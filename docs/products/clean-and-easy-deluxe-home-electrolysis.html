            <li>What an AWESOME torture</li>
            <li>I thought I had found the perfect solution for permanent hair removal at home.</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it, it works amazing!!</li>
            <li>In my opinion this product gives excellent results at a good price.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this system about 4 months ago and have had great results.</li>
            <li>Product works well and with the great directions</li>
            <li>I had a doctor tell me once that I&#x27;d have to win the lotto to get rid of all my veins</li>
            <li>The intensity dial is a great feature</li>
            <li>PS was great hassle-free return....</li>
            <li>I am happy with this device.</li>
            <li>Time consuming but works great</li>
            <li>great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great just be patient.</li>
            <li>So glad I did!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>If it worked more than once, it would be awesome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In order to successfully use this device</li>
            <li>Successfully removed one hair.  </li>
            <li>This was therefore probably not the best option considering there are more effective and faster laser treatment options out there, but being a student who is on a budget, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good couple of seconds.)</li>
            <li>Good idea</li>
            <li>It will take me a good two years to do my beard area.</li>
            <li>If you buy the product, start at 1 or 2 for strength and increase until you feel a good zap.</li>
            <li>Gave it a good try.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a really good product.</li>
            <li>the hair should be good to come out.  </li>
            <li>Bit of a bother, and you need really good eyesight (which I still have), but it does seem to have worked.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because some of the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>Great value for money, much better than spending loads on laser.</li>
            <li>and you should def have a good pair of your own)</li>
            <li>I nice mirror with good lighting is a must.</li>
            <li>, I love your product!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when I bought this product if it would work, but it does!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>is great easy to use</li>
            <li>Works great on the light hairs on my lip that LASER did not zap.</li>
            <li>And although it works, somewhat, even with my ideal fairly light hair type, the welts it causes eliminates the summer for usage, because you can&#x27;t show your legs for a week or more for every time you try.    </li>
            <li>- Use your own tweezers.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a nice booklet of instructions that is well written.  </li>
            <li>- Use the lowest effective setting:  </li>
            <li>I ordered two of the deluxe Home Electrolysis machines.  </li>
            <li>If you plan to use it on your own face, a magnifying mirror is a must.      </li>
            <li>You are basically being your own dermatologist and zapping your own hair away for $30-$40.</li>
            <li>you have the money for it and don&#x27;t want to do this on your own.</li>
            <li>you have the money for it and don&#x27;t want to do this on your own.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be easier to do it at home and cost effective so ordered this</li>
            <li>So I had to use my own tweezer.</li>
            <li>I fully realize this is my own fault, since I disregarded the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Have your own handy.</li>
            <li>This kind of depilation concerns specialists.</li>
            <li>I have honestly tried them all.....</li>
            <li>I bought this because it has so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Yes it is time consuming, but worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the effectiveness and most of the reviews I read helped give an accurate detailing of this product.  </li>
            <li>The parts come apart very easily and the tips break.</li>
            <li>I get irritation/shaving bumps very easily</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it (which is in an hour or two), using the device becomes very easy.</li>
            <li>Also, in my opinion it is very easy to infect yourself if you do not follow the stylus cleaning instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li>You ABSOLUTELY will need EXCELLENT EYES, a STEADY HAND, a GOOD zoom mirror, and good lighting.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use the lowest setting that is effective to get the hair out without tugging the skin at all.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a permanent option electrolysis is your best bet so far.</li>
            <li>Make sure to also have some kind of healing ointment.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any results with professional electrolysis, but am already seeing incredible results with this!  </li>
            <li>THanks amazon for the easy purchase and the best value.</li>
            <li>It may be a wonderful product for those of you with steady hands and strong eyes, but I&#x27;m going to seek out a \\&quot;tweezer\\&quot; style product instead.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the product was great.</li>
            <li>I tried higher settings twice, and have experienced no regrowth in those locations.</li>
            <li>I bought my own though and it works fine.</li>
            <li>It works like magic.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone, just make sure you read the instructions and follow them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it may take two or three more times</li>
            <li>For the price, you won&#x27;t find any better options for permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li>As I got used to the pain, I was able to gradually increase the setting.</li>
            <li>I made sure that everything was sterilized with rubbing alcohol beforehand including the skin area, and cleaned afterwords as well.  </li>
            <li>It helps if you purchase a pair magnifying glasses to see better as well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it once.</li>
            <li>Took about 4 days to mostly heal up</li>
            <li>One more thing:  </li>
            <li>I will try it one more time however</li>
            <li>That said, love the product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>If I had, I would have enjoyed much more hairless years.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It makes sense more for me to suck up the patience</li>
            <li>Best thing is to do this in daylight instead of regular light.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Because your hair has the most moisture at that  stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because your hair has the most moisture at that  stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hurts more in some places than it does for others.</li>
            <li>Wish it was easier but for this price it doesn&#x27;t get any better</li>
            <li>I am sure if it was better built I could have achieved results</li>
            <li>and I m glad I did  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, love it.</li>
            <li>I had this 30 years ago and was expecting a better model.</li>
            <li>That is ok if it works for you so</li>
            <li>If this product worked it would be worth the scabs and everything to have a good end result, but it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>You have to be able to stick the needle into the hair follicle at the angle of the hair.</li>
            <li>And you have to be able to see the skin closely.</li>
            <li>you will need a good lighted magnifying mirror, I would recommend a 7x mirror as it gives good magnification and allows you to see clearly and in focus without getting too close to the mirror.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;**As it says in the manual DO NOT stretch the skin while the electrode is on, this will make it much more susceptible to scarring/pitting.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT stretch the skin while the electrode is on, this will make it much more susceptible to scarring/pitting.  </li>
            <li>IT was everything and more.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this model years ago in europe for much more money.</li>
            <li>This device works, but make sure you pay attention to the directions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>If you keep trying to treat the follicle more times or for longer times, you will get scars like I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it many chances.</li>
            <li>With care you can get many uses out of each tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most acne is follicular.  </li>
            <li>Control digital would be best.</li>
            <li>quite sure it works, but</li>
            <li>Also, buy more of the needle tips.</li>
            <li>I then set it on 7 which I felt something I was able to deal that setting  </li>
            <li>Eh im sure itd work if I had the patience to do this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helpful to read the instructions, wait, reread the instructions, prepare, reread the instructions again to make sure you hadn&#x27;t missed or misunderstood anything</li>
            <li>thankfully I had made sure to double-check before starting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you want some more info on this topic, check out \\&quot;Home electrolysis tips\\&quot; on the \\&quot;Hairfacts\\&quot; website</li>
            <li>As for the tweezers that are included, they may as well be salad tongs they are so abominably incapable of gripping even the thicker hairs.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use it for more than an hour a day, and it&#x27;s recommended that you not use it on more than 1 square inch of hair at a time.</li>
            <li>Better off shaving or going to a licensed electrologist.</li>
            <li>My hairs are extremely fine, and I think this might work better for thicker hairs, or better if one person assists another person in using it, because it will be easier to find the roots and zap them those ways.  </li>
            <li>directions say to not treat a hair follicle more than once or twice, even if the hair still won&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
            <li>, I was then able to easily target the pores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a guitar string, which bends easily and is SPRING LOADED.</li>
            <li>Then I bought the Clean &amp; Easy Deluxe Home Electrolysis.  </li>
            <li>B002QXLM3I Clean + Easy  Deluxe Home Electrolysis]]</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews are accurate on how time consuming it is.  </li>
            <li>So far all I have used this on is my legs and had great results.</li>
            <li>The instructions stated that most people are comfortable using a level 4 setting</li>
            <li>You are better off investing in the Me Smooth at home laser device.</li>
            <li>I have used this product with a great deal of patience and persistence in the hope that it would do its job, albeit slower than a professional treatment.  </li>
            <li>we were both amazed how good it really does work.</li>
            <li>If you crank up the voltage you can zap them faster but it will hurt more and the chances of scarring are much higher, so it is best to stick with as low a voltage as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And while I could just as easily feel buyer&#x27;s remorse now, I don&#x27;t, because I decided to buy this and give it a test anyway.</li>
            <li>and then it comes out easily with no scars.  </li>
            <li>Is it easy, no.</li>
            <li>but what woman&#x27;s product is easy??</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let that scare you unless you scar easily and badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to convert with</li>
            <li>still felt nothing, the hair should have easily come out if I pulled with twizer</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, and I made a video on how it works.</li>
            <li>One reviewer commented that the tip bends easily..</li>
            <li>so it bends easily.</li>
            <li>others have commented, the tips can break or bend easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Now that would be easy compared to what you have to do with this.</li>
            <li>The probe bends easily.</li>
            <li>10x was way too strong.</li>
            <li>but I feel it doesn&#x27;t stand up to your goals unless you have really good eye sight, steady hands and are prepared to replace the battery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure once you have been able to manage the technique of hitting the hair follicle the right way it should be easy.</li>
            <li>so far i have not had not been successful in removing any hairs.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a new battery, it still doesn&#x27;t work, so I contacted to the seller,but they didn&#x27;t come up with a good solution...</li>
            <li>I found my arm hair to be almost too fine for the needle, but once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li>I had one of these years ago and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Nipple hairs are fine.  </li>
            <li>The price for this product made me a little nervous, but compared to the $100-$200 products, it had the best reviews.</li>
            <li>Tips are perfect size for face little hair.</li>
            <li>Already I love this using my Clean + Easy unit and if you&#x27;re patient with your self-treatment you&#x27;ll be pretty excited at the results, too!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wax huge sections.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wax huge sections.</li>
            <li>Purchased this based on someone else&#x27;s review, but was a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li>I broke out with a huge zit on every hair follicle where I used it.</li>
            <li>I also have been epillating for years, and that takes a huge amount of time and creates ingrown hairs and is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth the price and much more......</li>
            <li>I dearly wish it was a light.</li>
            <li>Hurt like heck, but I persevered with the hope of being hair free.  </li>
            <li>if it worked, it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>- Be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>After finding this machine for so cheap, I decided to buy it and try it.      </li>
            <li>You can muffle some of that sound if you wrap a hand towel around it.     </li>
            <li>available.</li>
            <li>I will say that if you can get it to work for you, it is cheap...</li>
            <li>Then squeeze it out with a comedone extractor (also available on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>this product has just two people that are available to help you.  </li>
            <li>smooth skin, no stubble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am contemplating buying another one because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s cheap and works</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s cheap and doesn&#x27;t do anything that&#x27;s a rip off.</li>
            <li>But, so far, so good for the hair removal.  </li>
            <li>so far this is good  </li>
            <li>Also I was able to do it in a faster amount of time than professional electrolysis and on my own schedule.  </li>
            <li>Also I was able to do it in a faster amount of time than professional electrolysis and on my own schedule.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m fairly conscientious and even I had missed a vital step -</li>
            <li>I know i was using it correctly, the hairs would pull right out without a tug at all but most of them did return.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s going to hurt more (right over the shin bone or your eyebrow area</li>
            <li>cool and easy to use....</li>
            <li>Not user friendly.  </li>
            <li>Anyone with keratinosis will be intimately familiar with what it looks like</li>
            <li>Clean the needle with peroxide and alcohol after use to prevent infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean your wound with peroxide and alcohol.</li>
            <li>If you have lots of hair that needs to be removed, then I think you&#x27;d be better off getting it done professionally, but make sure the electrologist has stellar references and isn&#x27;t trying to scam you, like the person I went to before buying the Clean &amp; Easy.  </li>
            <li>also, if you use alcohol or peroxide after to clean, i find it makes more inflamation and scabs and takes much longer to heal.  </li>
            <li>I would have loved for the gadget to work, and it did remove a couple hairs, but I paid a lot of money for it to work only three months--even with battery replacement.   </li>
            <li>Although this product was cheap, it isn&#x27;t even worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think you can get a full tank of gas in your car for under $40.</li>
            <li>Ok, this product does really work.</li>
            <li>I regret not being wise enough to return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>The tip was easily bent in the first use.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions on my bikini line and found it pretty easy to use</li>
            <li>But, if you want to treat an area that is easy to reach, or if you have someone who is willing to spend hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours (get it?</li>
            <li>I found this product pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>After three months, new growth appeared (very fine hair)</li>
            <li>If you plan to remove a lot of hair, you&#x27;d better plan on buying a new one every month!</li>
            <li>First, I didn&#x27;t feel a tingle until I got up to level 5 even on a fine hair.</li>
            <li>It was a waste of money for me, but someone may do better and have good results...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>Thanks Clean + Easy</li>
            <li>A week after the first try, I did some more veins on a higher setting (four and some on six).  </li>
            <li>Looks very well really clean and easy.</li>
            <li>While it is time consuming and mildly painful,this unit has seen a lot of use in my house.</li>
            <li>I bought the older version of this many years ago.  </li>
            <li>so I bought this product since most reviews rated it highly.</li>
            <li>in many areas this will make it much easier to insert the electrode correctly into the follicle at the right angle.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in many areas this will make it much easier to insert the electrode correctly into the follicle at the right angle.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is for anyone that wants to be smooth and clean of body hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I put in a new one it will work better.</li>
            <li>I read positive reviews elsewhere, and they seemed genuine.  </li>
            <li>Very disapointed !!</li>
            <li>This product works great for little touch ups and to remove hairs in between my appointments (as you should never pluck or shave areas that you are treating with electrolysis).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to keep a little bowl of salt water and a towel handy and keep your fingers moist, not dripping</li>
            <li>if you think three months of usage is worth it.</li>
            <li>I say please dont use this item if your prone to scars just be safe and pay a professional to do this for you.</li>
            <li>Still better than the time and expense for professional.</li>
            <li>but I am still hoping it is worth it once we get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>The ability to have a machine that is capable of doing the same thing at home that actually works is priceless.</li>
            <li>but i jumped cause of the shock it hurts but worth the hair removal...</li>
            <li>I am giving it a 5 star because I think this is well worth the price and also works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re going to need patience in order to have success with this product.</li>
            <li>After sanitizing the equipment and area to be treated, have to try to insert a thread size filament into the hair follicle at a very specific angle while holding the existing hair with tweezers (use your own, the supplied tweezers are garbage).</li>
            <li>To use it you moisten the tips of the fingers that are holding the needle, tap it to the metal pad to make sure there&#x27;s enough moisture on your hands as it will emit a high-pitched sound when you do</li>
            <li>It takes a while to achieve results but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The sores it leaves also just arent worth it.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical of this, but since I was paying $32 for 8 minutes of electrolysis every two weeks, it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>The box only says Deluxe Electrolysis.</li>
            <li>despite seeing that I decided to use it anyway, because I am not afraid of knock offs.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that I had given it enough time and a fair chance, but ultimately for me it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It seems work okay at first, but so easily broken(I have used it only 6 times)&lt;br /&gt;-Unfriendly</li>
            <li>/&gt;The needles definitely are very fine (would you really want them anything else considering they go into your hair follicles??) and can bend easily - but they do make replacements.  </li>
            <li>As I get older (being from Mediterranean dissent ) I have been getting more and more facial hair.</li>
            <li>I would also highly recommend a good pair of needle/point tip tweezers such as tweezerman,</li>
            <li>I was doing it right.</li>
            <li>if it has resistance you didn&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li>I have a 15x one that I am using right now.</li>
            <li>Wax your hair area that is to be treated, wait till it starts showing and get it treated right away for maximum results</li>
            <li>Wax your hair area that is to be treated, wait till it starts showing and get it treated right away for maximum results</li>
            <li>Therefore you can just blow it right out.  </li>
            <li>this review helps you make a decision thats right for you</li>
            <li>But the fine hair did come out easily after several seconds of zapping.</li>
            <li>and it is the best 30 I have spent in a long time!!</li>
            <li>Overall for this price I am very satisfied and saved more than $300 I would have spent on the Tria or going to professionals.</li>
            <li>I still go to a professional here and there to get those really fine hairs that I have difficulty getting</li>
            <li>Far sighted folks will need magnifying mirrors to accurately identify hair folicle.    </li>
            <li>Just remember, the higher the setting, the more damage it is doing to not only the root, but to your skin since that&#x27;s its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ohhhh and be sure the battery is actually plugged in...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t find the buzz sound all that loud</li>
            <li>I followed directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>Worked the first time, did not work again.</li>
            <li>I brought my first electrolysis machine four months ago</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter pre or post shower, hot rag, whatever.</li>
            <li>Well, I first tried this about two weeks ago on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>The fading of the treated veins does make me hopeful that I can eliminate veins on a higher setting.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>first stylus/tip lasted for over 100 hairs.</li>
            <li>when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I started of this a bowl first but dipping fingers was turning out to be a pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I wish it was higher.</li>
            <li>so I would recommend higher magnification for them.</li>
            <li>So first you wax/pluck the hair out to and let it grow out.</li>
            <li>So first you wax/pluck the hair out to and let it grow out.</li>
            <li>This item is not difficult and works well.  </li>
            <li>Bought two of these, the needle broke on the first one and replace the battery.</li>
            <li>As advertised, and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I tried first at medium setting but couldn&#x27;t feel anything, than raised to highest setting</li>
            <li>When I first started using the machine it took me about an hour to remove 15 hairs and</li>
            <li>The first time i turned the dial to 4 and did my chin...</li>
            <li>and I have used it properly too many times for there to be NO RESULTS.</li>
            <li>I used this thing once, and it did work that first time.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this device, be forewarned that you may never be able to buy replacement tips that work for it, and it might also come with tips that are too short to work.</li>
            <li>First, buy a hands-free magnifying glass that you can wear on your head.</li>
            <li>This machine is great for blondes whose hair is too late to be captured by laser removal systems (like mine).</li>
            <li>I used it for the first</li>
            <li>but think I could have went higher.  </li>
            <li>She Just created more facial hair.  </li>
            <li>you have any random hairs, this is the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>The closer to the bone, the closer to a nerve and the more likely</li>
            <li>(which is still time consuming ;) )</li>
            <li>Would of been alot better if the needle was actually a needle.</li>
            <li>I have seen no change whatsoever in the frequency of hair growth nor the thickness, and I have been using it consistently for about 3 months.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts that it would work because of it&#x27;s size but the first time she used it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I had electrolysis years ago on just a few unruly hairs that didn&#x27;t work because I didn&#x27;t have a good technician.  </li>
            <li>I had one a few years ago loved it.</li>
            <li>machine is not easy to use, it takes a steady hand and a lot of practice; however, for $70-80 (cost of this unit + a good lighted mirror and tweezers) plus around 60 hours of my time, I was able to remove a large section of my facial hair which was estimated to cost $5000 or more by a professional electrolysis technician.  </li>

            <li>The customer service, which I contacted was very helpful and answered the phone right away to help me figure out how to use the product.</li>
            <li>This is a very cheaply made product, which is why I&#x27;m not very surprised that the one I received did not operate at all.</li>
            <li>probably due to my own error).</li>
            <li>A great product and saves a few trips to a professional in between and a lot of money, I have had it for a few months now and is working great so far.</li>
            <li>If you have steady hands, decent eyesight, and huge amounts of time to spare, this product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>One of the two probes was too short to even work, which is a good thing because it kept me from mangling myself further.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost always a slow process that requires many, many treatments.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t as good as the one I had a while back that finally broke.</li>
            <li>the aftermath of my escapade I was left with scarring from the needle, which in turn lead to in grown hairs, which then caused a major cystic acne breakout and still more scarring!</li>
            <li>I have had good results using witch hazel and aloe gel(not lotion), right after treatment, and at least once a day afterwards.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, my experience was not so positive.</li>
            <li>First, it IS very detail oriented and time consuming.</li>
            <li>this unit is sort-of cheaply made; the stylet tips will bend if you are not careful with them; and yes, using this can hurt.</li>
            <li>This will make it so much easier to see the exact spot where your hair grows out of your skin.</li>
            <li>First of all - it really is not very uncomfortable at all with the exception of hairs found near your bones.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine the first time used to remove about 3-5 hairs from my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>It is however ok to stretch the skin to insert the electrode while it is not active, then complete the circuit after releasing the skin,</li>
            <li>It is however ok to stretch the skin to insert the electrode while it is not active, then complete the circuit after releasing the skin,</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very simple &amp; easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li>This was a terrific product, was easy to use, and worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick to my Remington laser i bought on amazon for large areas, and continue waxing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Good for diminishing spier vein appearance just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I even went so far as to replace the battery that was included with a brand new one to make sure that the problem was not a dead battery.</li>
            <li>Here I am many many months later, returning to say that the area that I treated has about 50% less hair growth than before</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this is not a product you would use on large areas as it would be very labour intensive.</li>
            <li>Fine idea, reasonable effectiveness for very specific application.</li>
            <li>Yet, I still had a major struggle getting the tiny needle to pierce correctly in the hair shaft, while holding the wand perfectly still for long enough to zap the hair root.</li>
            <li>This thing has absolutely made my summer bare(ha)able.</li>
            <li>If you buy them in bulk, they are cheap, and you only need to replace them infrequently.  </li>
            <li>it takes time to get the hang of doing it, but once you do, it works very well.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful with the power settings to keep from damaging you skin any more</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be elec. tweezers, that would be much easier.</li>
            <li>I really did not like my product.</li>
            <li>before I was ready.</li>
            <li>As I pluck hairs nightly I didn&#x27;t feel that having to do it repeatedly would be an issue - that part wasn&#x27;t so much.  </li>
            <li>they are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Also, the whole thing seems abit flimsy, but after all, it doesn&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li>The upsides are that it is very inexpensive given that you are getting permanent hair removal</li>
            <li>and it really does work.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>3x is really all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t think the dial on the unit does ANYTHING, even turning it (supposedly) &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; seems to be a placebo.</li>
            <li>Very lound one too.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t aim to get rid of whole face or underarm hair in one go.</li>
            <li>Have you water solution ready.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, you really do need a 20x magnification.</li>
            <li>It makes the work so much easier.</li>
            <li>I did stayed hair free for about 3 weeks total.</li>
            <li>It is time consuming, but it really works.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But not 5 stars because it is not practical to use, even for someone very determined.</li>
            <li>It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got really scared after awhile they would scar, but in the end they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Very convienent.</li>
            <li>I find this device more convenient to use than to go to technicians who drag out the process for extorting money.</li>
            <li>The pain is somewhat intense depending on your tolerance but its not worse than waxing.</li>
            <li>It really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used too much yet, but it works well and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>REALLY HURTS.  </li>
            <li>This machine created scars and it made me really nervous but  by now it looks that they are disappeared.</li>
            <li>I was very impress with the at home electrolysis.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to follow the instructions on the manual as stated, especially the salt water mixture that is required for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>/&gt;Appearance: looks very 70ish in appearance and color schemes.  </li>
            <li>it would be much easier.</li>
            <li>One just thinks it is ready to go---it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>The instructions really put me off.  </li>
            <li>This may be one of those times where it&#x27;s worth it to have the work done by a professional.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this, haven&#x27;t seen much problem with scabbing.</li>
            <li>But really, dying after 6 months???</li>
            <li>But I really appreaciate their customer service department.</li>
            <li>much time consuming&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Very loud...went after one hair and it burned...</li>
            <li>Stylus is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>It produced a light &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34;, but not nearly enough to truly kill the hair follicle.  </li>
            <li>I have been more than patient with it because I expected their to be a learning curve.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product because the price of this product was still cheaper than one session at the electrolysis and second because I can do it in the privacy of my own home and do it whenever I have extra time.</li>
            <li>At the moment they are still scabbed over, but it does appear so far that it may have worked better - meaning on several areas</li>
            <li>The whole thing is headed to the electronics recycling center, so they can use the parts for something worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I am not Mr. Rock Steady Hands, but if I rest my arm or wrist on a table, then yes I am pretty steady.</li>
            <li>Also the little wire of a stylet tip bend very easily.</li>
            <li>Other times I was able to get 5-6 hairs without any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>two flush mounted banana sockets mounted on the lettering between the tweezers and the probe holder .There are only two wires inside connect one to each socket  and leave the original probe connected .</li>
            <li>so many of the complaints that people have in other reviews did not come across as challenges or surprises when I decided to use this</li>
            <li>first time using this product, I was able to treat a larger portion of my chin, but was left with bumps and scars that are now disappearing with home treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for other people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>If you cannot afford professional electrolysis, and would rather do it yourself in the privacy of your own home without any fears of other people&#x27;s germs, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, but only by a hair. ;]</li>
            <li>Mole hairs are fine IF you have had the mole for a long time and it has not changed.  </li>
            <li>So, super thick hairs may be a challenge and will need more catering to as you use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first started using the unit I cranked it up to 5, and the pores took weeks to heal and clear up.  </li>
            <li>This product is for those of us that are self conscious and willing to take the time to rid our unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>advice to anyone considering this product is save the money and make the time to see a professional electrolysis first.</li>
            <li>Fourth, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all until you apply the electricity which is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Previously they were consistently an appropriate length.</li>
            <li>so I make sure that I use this when I&#x27;m not going out in public or going to see anyone for a day or two because my skin gets very red and puffy.</li>
            <li>and I finally feel like I know what I&#x27;m doing and can get the hairs fairly quickly and reliably.  </li>
            <li>- You need a steady hand.  </li>
            <li>Such a shame, I had a similar product that lasted for many years.</li>
            <li>I saw white stuff bubble out of the hair shaft, which according to the instructions is OK to see, though in my final analysis this meant I had caused scarring damage to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular item doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This particular device is also being advertised as the One Touch, but I assure you that it is not.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend reading everything carefully before beginning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My advice is try to use a high setting 4 plus depending on your resistance to pain, no pain no gain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>If you have scaring it is probably because your setting is too high.  </li>
            <li>Pay for high quality treatment or buy a well known branded home laser kit from a manufacturer like Philips.</li>
            <li>People complain about the scabbing, but scabbing does not mean scarring, and none of the areas I have used this on have scarred at all.    </li>
            <li>little moisturiser on the plate makes a better connection .</li>
            <li>bad, electrolysis is still the best and quickest way for permenant hair removal,</li>
            <li>As far as using the product you really get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>It looks like you have bright red pimples even though they are small</li>
            <li>you have light colored hair it will be harder to see</li>
            <li>Were I not a redhead, I probably would have just done laser hair removal since it is much cheaper and faster than professional electrolysis</li>
            <li>To some extent how fast you can go will depend on what area you are using it as well as how sensitive your skin is or how robust your hair follicles are.  </li>
            <li>Considering that electrolysis is the only form of permanent hair removal, it&#x27;s definitely worth the time.</li>
            <li>not a big deal but worth</li>
            <li>You finally get it JUST right, and your standing there in front of a magnifying mirror</li>
            <li>Once you have all of these things, start with the machine on low and then work your way up until you find the right power setting.</li>
            <li>then will start right back up again if you&#x27;re still in the follicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either the hair is not growing back, or it is so fine that is blends in, and isn&#x27;t coarse anymore.</li>
            <li>I have a great number of spider veins on my legs, especially little fine ones that are hard to treat.  </li>
            <li>Left a nice little scar, that did.</li>
            <li>did not work at all,even bought new batteries and nothin</li>
            <li>I see a new hair I zap it and move on.  </li>
            <li>or if I want to start on a new area of my body.</li>
            <li>The new growth were new hair folicles.  </li>
            <li>unit receives four stars (I had to modify it for it to work), but the new tips receive zero stars as I cannot use them at all.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the battery life is short, that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>The lower settings appeared to work at first, but the hair grew right back - and no, not hair in the same area that just hadn&#x27;t grown in at the time of treatment.</li>
            <li>Yes this is slightly more painful, but I can do it in the privacy of my own home whenever I want.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worthiy you are better off going to a professional, this is just waste of money.</li>
            <li>But I couldn&#x27;t grasp how to use it and was young and highly impatient.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit with the high hopes of saving both time and and money in visits to a professional electrologist.</li>
            <li>Start low and build up to higher intensities.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 1/2 weeks since first use, and the hairs aren&#x27;t back yet.</li>
            <li>It is better suited for thicker hairs such as pubic areas or male facial hair</li>
            <li>As others have commented, the tweezers that come with the kit are no good, so I use my own tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first hairs that I electrolysized did not grow back.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>years ago, I had this exact same product and it did work.</li>
            <li>I did everything just as I had the first time, following the instructions to a T, but no luck.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s actually where I first heard of this in my quest for hair removal.</li>
            <li>I would also like to add that the name itself is misleading; it is not clean and easy by any measure.</li>
            <li>She said if I want a new one, I have to mail the old one to her, and she will ship the new one to me.</li>
            <li>It took a little practice to use, but was easy to catch on to how it works with my skin.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend paying the money for a professional with professional equipment to get the bulk of your work done.</li>
            <li>am rating this product highly because it does actually do what it&#x27;s supposed to and does it really well.</li>
            <li>is a very very time consuming and mildly difficult process to do on your own.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I did get little tiny scabs, but they went away, and most of the hairs didn&#x27;t grow back!  </li>
            <li>one, the other reviews are true-</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that this would take such large plugs from my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been left with large holes in my skin and the holes are still there and are noticeable.</li>
            <li>Depending on how quickly you heal with other scrapes &amp; scratches will determine how fast these heal, I&#x27;m 3-4 days, some by the 2nd day.</li>
            <li>I have used my One Touch to totally clear my toes</li>
            <li>Instructions were not overly clear or helpful.</li>
            <li>if you buy it, you have to have a professional</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve already noticed that the hairs are growing back slower and much finer.</li>
            <li>If you are one to complain about your hand hurting, then leave it to a professional.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 - 4 separate times to completely rid myself of unwanted hair, but I was determined.  </li>
            <li>I have no trouble being patient while trying to learn how to use the tool.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t want to go for professional treatments for whatever reason</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s a lot easier on hairs that you can look at straight on (as opposed to on the side of your face or the back of your leg, etc).</li>
            <li>Save your money and go to a professional electrologist.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the actual product&#x27;s box, the whole \\&quot;kit\\&quot; can slide out.</li>
            <li>Also the stylus was too short to really reach the follicle root.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just sensitive</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t so far</li>
            <li>if you are going for a professional electrolysis.</li>
            <li>if you are going for a professional electrolysis.</li>
            <li>The knee area has been the biggest ouch thus far.</li>
            <li>Have also had electrolysis done professionally before</li>
            <li>It will soften and open your follicles and make it much easier (though it works without this too).</li>
            <li>the only real improvement I would suggest to the makers is to offer thinner probes.</li>
            <li>I have had electroylsis done by a professional</li>
            <li>Wow, this thing makes a noise that scared the daylights out of us.  </li>
            <li>Go to a professional.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li>And, the hair that I really wanted this for, all keep growing back!</li>
            <li>you have the time or money to get professional electrolysis.</li>
            <li>you have to literally keep it a foot near you....</li>
            <li>If you have near vision you will have no problems.  </li>
            <li>If you are using the electrolysis for the first time on an area it WILL take a long time and you have to be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine I was too far off, but I&#x27;m not a trained professional either.  </li>
            <li>Go professional.</li>
            <li>The beep is not that loud and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I overdid it once on a particularly old &amp; stubborn ingrown hair\abcess on my chin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going to a professional electrolysis for some years; however, every now</li>
            <li>Nor do I think it can replace a professional electrolysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>frankly, I&#x27;d need to be near comatose to not feel the pain.  </li>
            <li>Not built like my old one.  </li>
            <li>that I have had professional treatment.</li>
            <li>A mix of honey, sugar, and lemon 2.Aloe application in its natural form.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money trust me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the keratin buildup within your hair follicle (keratin is hair protein) and completely harmless.  </li>
            <li>The control knob doesn&#x27;t seem to work although i haven&#x27;t really set it beyond level 4 on a scale of 10, when set to 0 it still sends electrical current to the probe.</li>
            <li>the electrical current is very</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Stick with professional service</li>
            <li>And you have to at least treat the hairs for two sessions or more.</li>
            <li>Recently, all the stylet tips we&#x27;ve received have been too short to be useful.</li>
            <li>You have to have just the right amount of salt in the water and not too much or too little water on your fingers when using.</li>
            <li>The only negative for me, is the tweezer that came with it weren&#x27;t very good (too stiff), but I just use the ones I already had.</li>
            <li>Extreme patience required to see any lasting results, 6 months of WEEKLY treatments before any thinning is even visible, and since each machine only lasts 4 months, be prepaired to buy 10 of them if you intend to remove more than  5 hairs.</li>
            <li>I religiously used it multiple times a week for two months and all I was able to noticeably do was clear a tiny, tiny, tiny spot.</li>
            <li>The needle heads bend so easily it is quite hard to really get the follicle and not your actual skin.</li>
            <li>okay, I was very skeptical but after trying it I would recommend it as a cheap alternative to laser or salon electrolysis.</li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts (I use it at a setting of 8 on the dial, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend starting out that high)</li>
            <li>However I have noticed a decrease in my facial hair re-growth, so I have high hopes for the future.&lt;br /&gt;In regards to any effects of the treatment</li>
            <li>With very light hair it&#x27;s hard to see where it&#x27;s attached, but it&#x27;s still possible.  </li>
            <li>I am now attempting to do my whole bikini line, which will take a long time because there are a lot of hairs, but eventually will be permanent.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>That said, my only word of caution when using this product (or any electrolysis machine) is to go easy on the face or areas that are not easily concealable.</li>
            <li>At first, it seemed impossible to get the tiny stylist into the seemingly even tinier pore, but once we setup bright lighting</li>
            <li>Many of my problem hairs are fairly deep and the tip does not get down deep enough.  </li>
            <li>I had to use my reading glasses to really see what i was doing, a magnifying mirror would probably help, having second person such as a spouse do</li>
            <li>You have to stick the little needle DIRECTLY into the hair follicle all the way and hold it there for a full 15 seconds (following the instructions that come with it).</li>
            <li>Oh, and in the end up every single hair grew back - as big and as bold as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how well this works, and we&#x27;re even using a low setting; 3.  </li>
            <li>these make it much easier to pinpoint and grab a single hair compared with the tweezers included in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the way, I dropped mine onto the hard floor and it still works fine.</li>
            <li>start on your face, practice on other body parts first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but I think it&#x27;s amazing that this technology is even available to the average person for such a very low price.</li>
            <li>I tried to remove 5 hair near my ankle as a test, and I had red spots probably due to higher strength than it&#x27;s supposed to use.</li>
            <li>So much so that I cannot keep it in the follicle long enough to do its thing.  </li>
            <li>It has only been three months, but the hair growth is much slower and some hairs haven&#x27;t come back at all after only one treatment.  </li>
            <li>They warned that it takes several sessions to succeed, so I was patient, and allowed the area to heal completely each time.  </li>
            <li>I got this to supplement professional hair removal treatment I was already receiving regularly.</li>
            <li>but I went up to a 10 (the highest setting) and barely felt any sensation at all.</li>
            <li>So far, I have tried it on probably about fifty areas, not fifty individual veins, though.  </li>
            <li>So far the areas I zapped didn&#x27;t grow back.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the loud beeping noise when you have it in use.  </li>
            <li>There was unexpected pain at the low settings.  </li>
            <li>Burned my skin even though I followed directions very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;Probe broke when trying to put it into pen only plus side is the extra probe on that end....but broke for same reason again.</li>
            <li>I turned mine up to 10 (max) and still barely felt any zing...</li>
            <li>I was also surprised at the strength of the current that came out of the needle; the highest I ever needed to use was five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you need facial hair removed please go see a professional and not this piece of junk</li>
            <li>I can not sing the praise loud enough for this thing.</li>
            <li>Can really sting in some spots and barely tingles in other spots.  </li>
            <li>A little painful but very effective!!!</li>
            <li>Every time I attempt to \\&quot;slide\\&quot; the stylus tip into a pore I get a sharp zap because the thing has decided I must be ready.</li>
            <li>Thanks, but no thanks!</li>
            <li>After practicing for a while, I can now remove about 90 hairs per hour and very rarely have a failure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had numerous electrolysis sessions with a licensed professional and it feels the exactly same as what she does....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have such red spot from the professional treatment.</li>
            <li>The device is burning a tiny hole in your skin, complete with bubbling (sizzling) white ooze.  </li>
            <li>15 seconds of expected pain are finally over, so you gently tug the hair.</li>
            <li>(I really don&#x27;t do this part anymore as I know relatively how wet they need to be), and insert it into your follicle.  </li>
            <li>That way you can see the following: how to conduct the procedure, how much it hurts, how long a session takes, and how long it takes for you to heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel any pain either, an occasional sting but even that is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>The pain is not more than a pinch, so it&#x27;s worth it for the permanence.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as going to a professional, it takes many expensive visits.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but very tedious to use since one has to pluck a strand of hair one at a time.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY like it said to do and am left with these embarrassing little burn marks.</li>
            <li>you have a neurosurgeon&#x27;s steady hands and eagle sharp eyes, then perhaps this product will work for you.</li>
            <li>And while it is true that the stylus tip is extremely bendable (they do include a second one, however), it is still much too thick to actually get INTO any pore.</li>
            <li>I rate this device high due to</li>
            <li>This little torture device certainly works.  </li>
            <li>Inserting these tiny needles into your hair follicles is fiendishly tricky without a large magnifying mirror, plenty of light and the hand steadiness that would rival that of a mime artist.</li>
            <li>Not every single hair follicle is the same shape and size and direction so it could take a few times to get it right.</li>
            <li>I would never have enough time to treat my whole legs, but I did manage to do a 3x3 area on both legs a little ways above my ankles.</li>
            <li>the next day I had little red scabs over the hairs I removed, but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much if it ment having the hair gone forever.</li>
            <li>Most hairs slipped out with hardly a tug, after one 15-second treatment, but just a few (courser hairs) needed a second dose.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes, but this product is definitely a let down.</li>
            <li>Good idea, bad construction.  </li>
            <li>The issue is that it leaves ugly bright red holes on your face.  </li>
            <li>It really sucks and makes me very self conscious.    </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY impressed</li>
            <li> This is the best product for results.</li>
            <li> The item works great!!!</li>
            <li> Happy Zapping !!</li>
            <li> (they have to be moist with salt water) while trying to not lose your perfectly placed electrolysis filament..</li>
            <li> What an AWESOME torture</li>
            <li> I thought I had found the perfect solution for permanent hair removal at home.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, it works amazing!!</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product gives excellent results at a good price.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this system about 4 months ago and have had great results.</li>
            <li> Product works well and with the great directions</li>
            <li> I had a doctor tell me once that I&#x27;d have to win the lotto to get rid of all my veins</li>
            <li> The intensity dial is a great feature</li>
            <li> PS was great hassle-free return....</li>
            <li> I am happy with this device.</li>
            <li> Time consuming but works great</li>
            <li> great product.  </li>
            <li> Works great just be patient.</li>
            <li> So glad I did!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> If it worked more than once, it would be awesome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In order to successfully use this device</li>
            <li> Successfully removed one hair.  </li>
            <li> This was therefore probably not the best option considering there are more effective and faster laser treatment options out there, but being a student who is on a budget, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good couple of seconds.)</li>
            <li> Good idea</li>
            <li> It will take me a good two years to do my beard area.</li>
            <li> If you buy the product, start at 1 or 2 for strength and increase until you feel a good zap.</li>
            <li> Gave it a good try.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Good deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a really good product.</li>
            <li> the hair should be good to come out.  </li>
            <li> Bit of a bother, and you need really good eyesight (which I still have), but it does seem to have worked.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because some of the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> Great value for money, much better than spending loads on laser.</li>
            <li> and you should def have a good pair of your own)</li>
            <li> I nice mirror with good lighting is a must.</li>
            <li> , I love your product!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I bought this product if it would work, but it does!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> is great easy to use</li>
            <li> Works great on the light hairs on my lip that LASER did not zap.</li>
            <li> And although it works, somewhat, even with my ideal fairly light hair type, the welts it causes eliminates the summer for usage, because you can&#x27;t show your legs for a week or more for every time you try.    </li>
            <li> - Use your own tweezers.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a nice booklet of instructions that is well written.  </li>
            <li> - Use the lowest effective setting:  </li>
            <li> I ordered two of the deluxe Home Electrolysis machines.  </li>
            <li> If you plan to use it on your own face, a magnifying mirror is a must.      </li>
            <li> You are basically being your own dermatologist and zapping your own hair away for $30-$40.</li>
            <li> you have the money for it and don&#x27;t want to do this on your own.</li>
            <li> you have the money for it and don&#x27;t want to do this on your own.</li>
            <li> so I thought it would be easier to do it at home and cost effective so ordered this</li>
            <li> So I had to use my own tweezer.</li>
            <li> I fully realize this is my own fault, since I disregarded the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have your own handy.</li>
            <li> This kind of depilation concerns specialists.</li>
            <li> I have honestly tried them all.....</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Yes it is time consuming, but worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the effectiveness and most of the reviews I read helped give an accurate detailing of this product.  </li>
            <li> The parts come apart very easily and the tips break.</li>
            <li> I get irritation/shaving bumps very easily</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it (which is in an hour or two), using the device becomes very easy.</li>
            <li> Also, in my opinion it is very easy to infect yourself if you do not follow the stylus cleaning instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li> You ABSOLUTELY will need EXCELLENT EYES, a STEADY HAND, a GOOD zoom mirror, and good lighting.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use the lowest setting that is effective to get the hair out without tugging the skin at all.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a permanent option electrolysis is your best bet so far.</li>
            <li> Make sure to also have some kind of healing ointment.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results with professional electrolysis, but am already seeing incredible results with this!  </li>
            <li> THanks amazon for the easy purchase and the best value.</li>
            <li> It may be a wonderful product for those of you with steady hands and strong eyes, but I&#x27;m going to seek out a \\&quot;tweezer\\&quot; style product instead.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the product was great.</li>
            <li> I tried higher settings twice, and have experienced no regrowth in those locations.</li>
            <li> I bought my own though and it works fine.</li>
            <li> It works like magic.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone, just make sure you read the instructions and follow them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it may take two or three more times</li>
            <li> For the price, you won&#x27;t find any better options for permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li> As I got used to the pain, I was able to gradually increase the setting.</li>
            <li> I made sure that everything was sterilized with rubbing alcohol beforehand including the skin area, and cleaned afterwords as well.  </li>
            <li> It helps if you purchase a pair magnifying glasses to see better as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it once.</li>
            <li> Took about 4 days to mostly heal up</li>
            <li> One more thing:  </li>
            <li> I will try it one more time however</li>
            <li> That said, love the product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> If I had, I would have enjoyed much more hairless years.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It makes sense more for me to suck up the patience</li>
            <li> Best thing is to do this in daylight instead of regular light.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Because your hair has the most moisture at that  stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because your hair has the most moisture at that  stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hurts more in some places than it does for others.</li>
            <li> Wish it was easier but for this price it doesn&#x27;t get any better</li>
            <li> I am sure if it was better built I could have achieved results</li>
            <li> and I m glad I did  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, love it.</li>
            <li> I had this 30 years ago and was expecting a better model.</li>
            <li> That is ok if it works for you so</li>
            <li> If this product worked it would be worth the scabs and everything to have a good end result, but it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> You have to be able to stick the needle into the hair follicle at the angle of the hair.</li>
            <li> And you have to be able to see the skin closely.</li>
            <li> you will need a good lighted magnifying mirror, I would recommend a 7x mirror as it gives good magnification and allows you to see clearly and in focus without getting too close to the mirror.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;**As it says in the manual DO NOT stretch the skin while the electrode is on, this will make it much more susceptible to scarring/pitting.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT stretch the skin while the electrode is on, this will make it much more susceptible to scarring/pitting.  </li>
            <li> IT was everything and more.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this model years ago in europe for much more money.</li>
            <li> This device works, but make sure you pay attention to the directions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> If you keep trying to treat the follicle more times or for longer times, you will get scars like I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it many chances.</li>
            <li> With care you can get many uses out of each tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most acne is follicular.  </li>
            <li> Control digital would be best.</li>
            <li> quite sure it works, but</li>
            <li> Also, buy more of the needle tips.</li>
            <li> I then set it on 7 which I felt something I was able to deal that setting  </li>
            <li> Eh im sure itd work if I had the patience to do this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful to read the instructions, wait, reread the instructions, prepare, reread the instructions again to make sure you hadn&#x27;t missed or misunderstood anything</li>
            <li> thankfully I had made sure to double-check before starting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you want some more info on this topic, check out \\&quot;Home electrolysis tips\\&quot; on the \\&quot;Hairfacts\\&quot; website</li>
            <li> As for the tweezers that are included, they may as well be salad tongs they are so abominably incapable of gripping even the thicker hairs.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it for more than an hour a day, and it&#x27;s recommended that you not use it on more than 1 square inch of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> Better off shaving or going to a licensed electrologist.</li>
            <li> My hairs are extremely fine, and I think this might work better for thicker hairs, or better if one person assists another person in using it, because it will be easier to find the roots and zap them those ways.  </li>
            <li> directions say to not treat a hair follicle more than once or twice, even if the hair still won&#x27;t come out easily.</li>
            <li> , I was then able to easily target the pores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a guitar string, which bends easily and is SPRING LOADED.</li>
            <li> Then I bought the Clean &amp; Easy Deluxe Home Electrolysis.  </li>
            <li> B002QXLM3I Clean + Easy  Deluxe Home Electrolysis]]</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews are accurate on how time consuming it is.  </li>
            <li> So far all I have used this on is my legs and had great results.</li>
            <li> The instructions stated that most people are comfortable using a level 4 setting</li>
            <li> You are better off investing in the Me Smooth at home laser device.</li>
            <li> I have used this product with a great deal of patience and persistence in the hope that it would do its job, albeit slower than a professional treatment.  </li>
            <li> we were both amazed how good it really does work.</li>
            <li> If you crank up the voltage you can zap them faster but it will hurt more and the chances of scarring are much higher, so it is best to stick with as low a voltage as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And while I could just as easily feel buyer&#x27;s remorse now, I don&#x27;t, because I decided to buy this and give it a test anyway.</li>
            <li> and then it comes out easily with no scars.  </li>
            <li> Is it easy, no.</li>
            <li> but what woman&#x27;s product is easy??</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let that scare you unless you scar easily and badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to convert with</li>
            <li> still felt nothing, the hair should have easily come out if I pulled with twizer</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, and I made a video on how it works.</li>
            <li> One reviewer commented that the tip bends easily..</li>
            <li> so it bends easily.</li>
            <li> others have commented, the tips can break or bend easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to do.  </li>
            <li> Now that would be easy compared to what you have to do with this.</li>
            <li> The probe bends easily.</li>
            <li> 10x was way too strong.</li>
            <li> but I feel it doesn&#x27;t stand up to your goals unless you have really good eye sight, steady hands and are prepared to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure once you have been able to manage the technique of hitting the hair follicle the right way it should be easy.</li>
            <li> so far i have not had not been successful in removing any hairs.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a new battery, it still doesn&#x27;t work, so I contacted to the seller,but they didn&#x27;t come up with a good solution...</li>
            <li> I found my arm hair to be almost too fine for the needle, but once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Nipple hairs are fine.  </li>
            <li> The price for this product made me a little nervous, but compared to the $100-$200 products, it had the best reviews.</li>
            <li> Tips are perfect size for face little hair.</li>
            <li> Already I love this using my Clean + Easy unit and if you&#x27;re patient with your self-treatment you&#x27;ll be pretty excited at the results, too!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wax huge sections.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wax huge sections.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on someone else&#x27;s review, but was a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li> I broke out with a huge zit on every hair follicle where I used it.</li>
            <li> I also have been epillating for years, and that takes a huge amount of time and creates ingrown hairs and is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth the price and much more......</li>
            <li> I dearly wish it was a light.</li>
            <li> Hurt like heck, but I persevered with the hope of being hair free.  </li>
            <li> if it worked, it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> - Be comfortable.  </li>
            <li> After finding this machine for so cheap, I decided to buy it and try it.      </li>
            <li> You can muffle some of that sound if you wrap a hand towel around it.     </li>
            <li> available.</li>
            <li> I will say that if you can get it to work for you, it is cheap...</li>
            <li> Then squeeze it out with a comedone extractor (also available on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> this product has just two people that are available to help you.  </li>
            <li> smooth skin, no stubble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am contemplating buying another one because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s cheap and works</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s cheap and doesn&#x27;t do anything that&#x27;s a rip off.</li>
            <li> But, so far, so good for the hair removal.  </li>
            <li> so far this is good  </li>
            <li> Also I was able to do it in a faster amount of time than professional electrolysis and on my own schedule.  </li>
            <li> Also I was able to do it in a faster amount of time than professional electrolysis and on my own schedule.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m fairly conscientious and even I had missed a vital step -</li>
            <li> I know i was using it correctly, the hairs would pull right out without a tug at all but most of them did return.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to hurt more (right over the shin bone or your eyebrow area</li>
            <li> cool and easy to use....</li>
            <li> Not user friendly.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with keratinosis will be intimately familiar with what it looks like</li>
            <li> Clean the needle with peroxide and alcohol after use to prevent infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean your wound with peroxide and alcohol.</li>
            <li> If you have lots of hair that needs to be removed, then I think you&#x27;d be better off getting it done professionally, but make sure the electrologist has stellar references and isn&#x27;t trying to scam you, like the person I went to before buying the Clean &amp; Easy.  </li>
            <li> also, if you use alcohol or peroxide after to clean, i find it makes more inflamation and scabs and takes much longer to heal.  </li>
            <li> I would have loved for the gadget to work, and it did remove a couple hairs, but I paid a lot of money for it to work only three months--even with battery replacement.   </li>
            <li> Although this product was cheap, it isn&#x27;t even worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think you can get a full tank of gas in your car for under $40.</li>
            <li> Ok, this product does really work.</li>
            <li> I regret not being wise enough to return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> The tip was easily bent in the first use.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on my bikini line and found it pretty easy to use</li>
            <li> But, if you want to treat an area that is easy to reach, or if you have someone who is willing to spend hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours (get it?</li>
            <li> I found this product pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> After three months, new growth appeared (very fine hair)</li>
            <li> If you plan to remove a lot of hair, you&#x27;d better plan on buying a new one every month!</li>
            <li> First, I didn&#x27;t feel a tingle until I got up to level 5 even on a fine hair.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me, but someone may do better and have good results...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Thanks Clean + Easy</li>
            <li> A week after the first try, I did some more veins on a higher setting (four and some on six).  </li>
            <li> Looks very well really clean and easy.</li>
            <li> While it is time consuming and mildly painful,this unit has seen a lot of use in my house.</li>
            <li> I bought the older version of this many years ago.  </li>
            <li> so I bought this product since most reviews rated it highly.</li>
            <li> in many areas this will make it much easier to insert the electrode correctly into the follicle at the right angle.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in many areas this will make it much easier to insert the electrode correctly into the follicle at the right angle.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is for anyone that wants to be smooth and clean of body hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I put in a new one it will work better.</li>
            <li> I read positive reviews elsewhere, and they seemed genuine.  </li>
            <li> Very disapointed !!</li>
            <li> This product works great for little touch ups and to remove hairs in between my appointments (as you should never pluck or shave areas that you are treating with electrolysis).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to keep a little bowl of salt water and a towel handy and keep your fingers moist, not dripping</li>
            <li> if you think three months of usage is worth it.</li>
            <li> I say please dont use this item if your prone to scars just be safe and pay a professional to do this for you.</li>
            <li> Still better than the time and expense for professional.</li>
            <li> but I am still hoping it is worth it once we get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> The ability to have a machine that is capable of doing the same thing at home that actually works is priceless.</li>
            <li> but i jumped cause of the shock it hurts but worth the hair removal...</li>
            <li> I am giving it a 5 star because I think this is well worth the price and also works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re going to need patience in order to have success with this product.</li>
            <li> After sanitizing the equipment and area to be treated, have to try to insert a thread size filament into the hair follicle at a very specific angle while holding the existing hair with tweezers (use your own, the supplied tweezers are garbage).</li>
            <li> To use it you moisten the tips of the fingers that are holding the needle, tap it to the metal pad to make sure there&#x27;s enough moisture on your hands as it will emit a high-pitched sound when you do</li>
            <li> It takes a while to achieve results but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> The sores it leaves also just arent worth it.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical of this, but since I was paying $32 for 8 minutes of electrolysis every two weeks, it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> The box only says Deluxe Electrolysis.</li>
            <li> despite seeing that I decided to use it anyway, because I am not afraid of knock offs.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I had given it enough time and a fair chance, but ultimately for me it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It seems work okay at first, but so easily broken(I have used it only 6 times)&lt;br /&gt;-Unfriendly</li>
            <li> /&gt;The needles definitely are very fine (would you really want them anything else considering they go into your hair follicles??) and can bend easily - but they do make replacements.  </li>
            <li> As I get older (being from Mediterranean dissent ) I have been getting more and more facial hair.</li>
            <li> I would also highly recommend a good pair of needle/point tip tweezers such as tweezerman,</li>
            <li> I was doing it right.</li>
            <li> if it has resistance you didn&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li> I have a 15x one that I am using right now.</li>
            <li> Wax your hair area that is to be treated, wait till it starts showing and get it treated right away for maximum results</li>
            <li> Wax your hair area that is to be treated, wait till it starts showing and get it treated right away for maximum results</li>
            <li> Therefore you can just blow it right out.  </li>
            <li> this review helps you make a decision thats right for you</li>
            <li> But the fine hair did come out easily after several seconds of zapping.</li>
            <li> and it is the best 30 I have spent in a long time!!</li>
            <li> Overall for this price I am very satisfied and saved more than $300 I would have spent on the Tria or going to professionals.</li>
            <li> I still go to a professional here and there to get those really fine hairs that I have difficulty getting</li>
            <li> Far sighted folks will need magnifying mirrors to accurately identify hair folicle.    </li>
            <li> Just remember, the higher the setting, the more damage it is doing to not only the root, but to your skin since that&#x27;s its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ohhhh and be sure the battery is actually plugged in...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t find the buzz sound all that loud</li>
            <li> I followed directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> Worked the first time, did not work again.</li>
            <li> I brought my first electrolysis machine four months ago</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter pre or post shower, hot rag, whatever.</li>
            <li> Well, I first tried this about two weeks ago on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> The fading of the treated veins does make me hopeful that I can eliminate veins on a higher setting.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> first stylus/tip lasted for over 100 hairs.</li>
            <li> when I first used it.</li>
            <li> I started of this a bowl first but dipping fingers was turning out to be a pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I wish it was higher.</li>
            <li> so I would recommend higher magnification for them.</li>
            <li> So first you wax/pluck the hair out to and let it grow out.</li>
            <li> So first you wax/pluck the hair out to and let it grow out.</li>
            <li> This item is not difficult and works well.  </li>
            <li> Bought two of these, the needle broke on the first one and replace the battery.</li>
            <li> As advertised, and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I tried first at medium setting but couldn&#x27;t feel anything, than raised to highest setting</li>
            <li> When I first started using the machine it took me about an hour to remove 15 hairs and</li>
            <li> The first time i turned the dial to 4 and did my chin...</li>
            <li> and I have used it properly too many times for there to be NO RESULTS.</li>
            <li> I used this thing once, and it did work that first time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this device, be forewarned that you may never be able to buy replacement tips that work for it, and it might also come with tips that are too short to work.</li>
            <li> First, buy a hands-free magnifying glass that you can wear on your head.</li>
            <li> This machine is great for blondes whose hair is too late to be captured by laser removal systems (like mine).</li>
            <li> I used it for the first</li>
            <li> but think I could have went higher.  </li>
            <li> She Just created more facial hair.  </li>
            <li> you have any random hairs, this is the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li> The closer to the bone, the closer to a nerve and the more likely</li>
            <li> (which is still time consuming ;) )</li>
            <li> Would of been alot better if the needle was actually a needle.</li>
            <li> I have seen no change whatsoever in the frequency of hair growth nor the thickness, and I have been using it consistently for about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts that it would work because of it&#x27;s size but the first time she used it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I had electrolysis years ago on just a few unruly hairs that didn&#x27;t work because I didn&#x27;t have a good technician.  </li>
            <li> I had one a few years ago loved it.</li>
            <li> machine is not easy to use, it takes a steady hand and a lot of practice; however, for $70-80 (cost of this unit + a good lighted mirror and tweezers) plus around 60 hours of my time, I was able to remove a large section of my facial hair which was estimated to cost $5000 or more by a professional electrolysis technician.  </li>

            <li> The customer service, which I contacted was very helpful and answered the phone right away to help me figure out how to use the product.</li>
            <li> This is a very cheaply made product, which is why I&#x27;m not very surprised that the one I received did not operate at all.</li>
            <li> probably due to my own error).</li>
            <li> A great product and saves a few trips to a professional in between and a lot of money, I have had it for a few months now and is working great so far.</li>
            <li> If you have steady hands, decent eyesight, and huge amounts of time to spare, this product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> One of the two probes was too short to even work, which is a good thing because it kept me from mangling myself further.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost always a slow process that requires many, many treatments.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as good as the one I had a while back that finally broke.</li>
            <li> the aftermath of my escapade I was left with scarring from the needle, which in turn lead to in grown hairs, which then caused a major cystic acne breakout and still more scarring!</li>
            <li> I have had good results using witch hazel and aloe gel(not lotion), right after treatment, and at least once a day afterwards.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, my experience was not so positive.</li>
            <li> First, it IS very detail oriented and time consuming.</li>
            <li> this unit is sort-of cheaply made; the stylet tips will bend if you are not careful with them; and yes, using this can hurt.</li>
            <li> This will make it so much easier to see the exact spot where your hair grows out of your skin.</li>
            <li> First of all - it really is not very uncomfortable at all with the exception of hairs found near your bones.  </li>
            <li> Worked fine the first time used to remove about 3-5 hairs from my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> It is however ok to stretch the skin to insert the electrode while it is not active, then complete the circuit after releasing the skin,</li>
            <li> It is however ok to stretch the skin to insert the electrode while it is not active, then complete the circuit after releasing the skin,</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very simple &amp; easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li> This was a terrific product, was easy to use, and worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick to my Remington laser i bought on amazon for large areas, and continue waxing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Good for diminishing spier vein appearance just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I even went so far as to replace the battery that was included with a brand new one to make sure that the problem was not a dead battery.</li>
            <li> Here I am many many months later, returning to say that the area that I treated has about 50% less hair growth than before</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this is not a product you would use on large areas as it would be very labour intensive.</li>
            <li> Fine idea, reasonable effectiveness for very specific application.</li>
            <li> Yet, I still had a major struggle getting the tiny needle to pierce correctly in the hair shaft, while holding the wand perfectly still for long enough to zap the hair root.</li>
            <li> This thing has absolutely made my summer bare(ha)able.</li>
            <li> If you buy them in bulk, they are cheap, and you only need to replace them infrequently.  </li>
            <li> it takes time to get the hang of doing it, but once you do, it works very well.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with the power settings to keep from damaging you skin any more</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be elec. tweezers, that would be much easier.</li>
            <li> I really did not like my product.</li>
            <li> before I was ready.</li>
            <li> As I pluck hairs nightly I didn&#x27;t feel that having to do it repeatedly would be an issue - that part wasn&#x27;t so much.  </li>
            <li> they are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Also, the whole thing seems abit flimsy, but after all, it doesn&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li> The upsides are that it is very inexpensive given that you are getting permanent hair removal</li>
            <li> and it really does work.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> 3x is really all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t think the dial on the unit does ANYTHING, even turning it (supposedly) &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; seems to be a placebo.</li>
            <li> Very lound one too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t aim to get rid of whole face or underarm hair in one go.</li>
            <li> Have you water solution ready.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, you really do need a 20x magnification.</li>
            <li> It makes the work so much easier.</li>
            <li> I did stayed hair free for about 3 weeks total.</li>
            <li> It is time consuming, but it really works.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But not 5 stars because it is not practical to use, even for someone very determined.</li>
            <li> It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got really scared after awhile they would scar, but in the end they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> Very convienent.</li>
            <li> I find this device more convenient to use than to go to technicians who drag out the process for extorting money.</li>
            <li> The pain is somewhat intense depending on your tolerance but its not worse than waxing.</li>
            <li> It really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used too much yet, but it works well and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> REALLY HURTS.  </li>
            <li> This machine created scars and it made me really nervous but  by now it looks that they are disappeared.</li>
            <li> I was very impress with the at home electrolysis.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to follow the instructions on the manual as stated, especially the salt water mixture that is required for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> /&gt;Appearance: looks very 70ish in appearance and color schemes.  </li>
            <li> it would be much easier.</li>
            <li> One just thinks it is ready to go---it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> The instructions really put me off.  </li>
            <li> This may be one of those times where it&#x27;s worth it to have the work done by a professional.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this, haven&#x27;t seen much problem with scabbing.</li>
            <li> But really, dying after 6 months???</li>
            <li> But I really appreaciate their customer service department.</li>
            <li> much time consuming&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very loud...went after one hair and it burned...</li>
            <li> Stylus is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> It produced a light &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34;, but not nearly enough to truly kill the hair follicle.  </li>
            <li> I have been more than patient with it because I expected their to be a learning curve.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because the price of this product was still cheaper than one session at the electrolysis and second because I can do it in the privacy of my own home and do it whenever I have extra time.</li>
            <li> At the moment they are still scabbed over, but it does appear so far that it may have worked better - meaning on several areas</li>
            <li> The whole thing is headed to the electronics recycling center, so they can use the parts for something worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I am not Mr. Rock Steady Hands, but if I rest my arm or wrist on a table, then yes I am pretty steady.</li>
            <li> Also the little wire of a stylet tip bend very easily.</li>
            <li> Other times I was able to get 5-6 hairs without any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> two flush mounted banana sockets mounted on the lettering between the tweezers and the probe holder .There are only two wires inside connect one to each socket  and leave the original probe connected .</li>
            <li> so many of the complaints that people have in other reviews did not come across as challenges or surprises when I decided to use this</li>
            <li> first time using this product, I was able to treat a larger portion of my chin, but was left with bumps and scars that are now disappearing with home treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it works for other people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> If you cannot afford professional electrolysis, and would rather do it yourself in the privacy of your own home without any fears of other people&#x27;s germs, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, but only by a hair. ;]</li>
            <li> Mole hairs are fine IF you have had the mole for a long time and it has not changed.  </li>
            <li> So, super thick hairs may be a challenge and will need more catering to as you use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first started using the unit I cranked it up to 5, and the pores took weeks to heal and clear up.  </li>
            <li> This product is for those of us that are self conscious and willing to take the time to rid our unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> advice to anyone considering this product is save the money and make the time to see a professional electrolysis first.</li>
            <li> Fourth, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all until you apply the electricity which is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Previously they were consistently an appropriate length.</li>
            <li> so I make sure that I use this when I&#x27;m not going out in public or going to see anyone for a day or two because my skin gets very red and puffy.</li>
            <li> and I finally feel like I know what I&#x27;m doing and can get the hairs fairly quickly and reliably.  </li>
            <li> - You need a steady hand.  </li>
            <li> Such a shame, I had a similar product that lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> I saw white stuff bubble out of the hair shaft, which according to the instructions is OK to see, though in my final analysis this meant I had caused scarring damage to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular item doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This particular device is also being advertised as the One Touch, but I assure you that it is not.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend reading everything carefully before beginning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My advice is try to use a high setting 4 plus depending on your resistance to pain, no pain no gain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> If you have scaring it is probably because your setting is too high.  </li>
            <li> Pay for high quality treatment or buy a well known branded home laser kit from a manufacturer like Philips.</li>
            <li> People complain about the scabbing, but scabbing does not mean scarring, and none of the areas I have used this on have scarred at all.    </li>
            <li> little moisturiser on the plate makes a better connection .</li>
            <li> bad, electrolysis is still the best and quickest way for permenant hair removal,</li>
            <li> As far as using the product you really get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> It looks like you have bright red pimples even though they are small</li>
            <li> you have light colored hair it will be harder to see</li>
            <li> Were I not a redhead, I probably would have just done laser hair removal since it is much cheaper and faster than professional electrolysis</li>
            <li> To some extent how fast you can go will depend on what area you are using it as well as how sensitive your skin is or how robust your hair follicles are.  </li>
            <li> Considering that electrolysis is the only form of permanent hair removal, it&#x27;s definitely worth the time.</li>
            <li> not a big deal but worth</li>
            <li> You finally get it JUST right, and your standing there in front of a magnifying mirror</li>
            <li> Once you have all of these things, start with the machine on low and then work your way up until you find the right power setting.</li>
            <li> then will start right back up again if you&#x27;re still in the follicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either the hair is not growing back, or it is so fine that is blends in, and isn&#x27;t coarse anymore.</li>
            <li> I have a great number of spider veins on my legs, especially little fine ones that are hard to treat.  </li>
            <li> Left a nice little scar, that did.</li>
            <li> did not work at all,even bought new batteries and nothin</li>
            <li> I see a new hair I zap it and move on.  </li>
            <li> or if I want to start on a new area of my body.</li>
            <li> The new growth were new hair folicles.  </li>
            <li> unit receives four stars (I had to modify it for it to work), but the new tips receive zero stars as I cannot use them at all.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the battery life is short, that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> The lower settings appeared to work at first, but the hair grew right back - and no, not hair in the same area that just hadn&#x27;t grown in at the time of treatment.</li>
            <li> Yes this is slightly more painful, but I can do it in the privacy of my own home whenever I want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worthiy you are better off going to a professional, this is just waste of money.</li>
            <li> But I couldn&#x27;t grasp how to use it and was young and highly impatient.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit with the high hopes of saving both time and and money in visits to a professional electrologist.</li>
            <li> Start low and build up to higher intensities.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 1/2 weeks since first use, and the hairs aren&#x27;t back yet.</li>
            <li> It is better suited for thicker hairs such as pubic areas or male facial hair</li>
            <li> As others have commented, the tweezers that come with the kit are no good, so I use my own tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first hairs that I electrolysized did not grow back.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> years ago, I had this exact same product and it did work.</li>
            <li> I did everything just as I had the first time, following the instructions to a T, but no luck.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s actually where I first heard of this in my quest for hair removal.</li>
            <li> I would also like to add that the name itself is misleading; it is not clean and easy by any measure.</li>
            <li> She said if I want a new one, I have to mail the old one to her, and she will ship the new one to me.</li>
            <li> It took a little practice to use, but was easy to catch on to how it works with my skin.</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend paying the money for a professional with professional equipment to get the bulk of your work done.</li>
            <li> am rating this product highly because it does actually do what it&#x27;s supposed to and does it really well.</li>
            <li> is a very very time consuming and mildly difficult process to do on your own.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I did get little tiny scabs, but they went away, and most of the hairs didn&#x27;t grow back!  </li>
            <li> one, the other reviews are true-</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this would take such large plugs from my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been left with large holes in my skin and the holes are still there and are noticeable.</li>
            <li> Depending on how quickly you heal with other scrapes &amp; scratches will determine how fast these heal, I&#x27;m 3-4 days, some by the 2nd day.</li>
            <li> I have used my One Touch to totally clear my toes</li>
            <li> Instructions were not overly clear or helpful.</li>
            <li> if you buy it, you have to have a professional</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve already noticed that the hairs are growing back slower and much finer.</li>
            <li> If you are one to complain about your hand hurting, then leave it to a professional.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 - 4 separate times to completely rid myself of unwanted hair, but I was determined.  </li>
            <li> I have no trouble being patient while trying to learn how to use the tool.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t want to go for professional treatments for whatever reason</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s a lot easier on hairs that you can look at straight on (as opposed to on the side of your face or the back of your leg, etc).</li>
            <li> Save your money and go to a professional electrologist.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the actual product&#x27;s box, the whole \\&quot;kit\\&quot; can slide out.</li>
            <li> Also the stylus was too short to really reach the follicle root.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sensitive</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t so far</li>
            <li> if you are going for a professional electrolysis.</li>
            <li> if you are going for a professional electrolysis.</li>
            <li> The knee area has been the biggest ouch thus far.</li>
            <li> Have also had electrolysis done professionally before</li>
            <li> It will soften and open your follicles and make it much easier (though it works without this too).</li>
            <li> the only real improvement I would suggest to the makers is to offer thinner probes.</li>
            <li> I have had electroylsis done by a professional</li>
            <li> Wow, this thing makes a noise that scared the daylights out of us.  </li>
            <li> Go to a professional.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li> And, the hair that I really wanted this for, all keep growing back!</li>
            <li> you have the time or money to get professional electrolysis.</li>
            <li> you have to literally keep it a foot near you....</li>
            <li> If you have near vision you will have no problems.  </li>
            <li> If you are using the electrolysis for the first time on an area it WILL take a long time and you have to be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine I was too far off, but I&#x27;m not a trained professional either.  </li>
            <li> Go professional.</li>
            <li> The beep is not that loud and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I overdid it once on a particularly old &amp; stubborn ingrown hair\abcess on my chin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going to a professional electrolysis for some years; however, every now</li>
            <li> Nor do I think it can replace a professional electrolysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> frankly, I&#x27;d need to be near comatose to not feel the pain.  </li>
            <li> Not built like my old one.  </li>
            <li> that I have had professional treatment.</li>
            <li> A mix of honey, sugar, and lemon 2.Aloe application in its natural form.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money trust me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the keratin buildup within your hair follicle (keratin is hair protein) and completely harmless.  </li>
            <li> The control knob doesn&#x27;t seem to work although i haven&#x27;t really set it beyond level 4 on a scale of 10, when set to 0 it still sends electrical current to the probe.</li>
            <li> the electrical current is very</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Stick with professional service</li>
            <li> And you have to at least treat the hairs for two sessions or more.</li>
            <li> Recently, all the stylet tips we&#x27;ve received have been too short to be useful.</li>
            <li> You have to have just the right amount of salt in the water and not too much or too little water on your fingers when using.</li>
            <li> The only negative for me, is the tweezer that came with it weren&#x27;t very good (too stiff), but I just use the ones I already had.</li>
            <li> Extreme patience required to see any lasting results, 6 months of WEEKLY treatments before any thinning is even visible, and since each machine only lasts 4 months, be prepaired to buy 10 of them if you intend to remove more than  5 hairs.</li>
            <li> I religiously used it multiple times a week for two months and all I was able to noticeably do was clear a tiny, tiny, tiny spot.</li>
            <li> The needle heads bend so easily it is quite hard to really get the follicle and not your actual skin.</li>
            <li> okay, I was very skeptical but after trying it I would recommend it as a cheap alternative to laser or salon electrolysis.</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts (I use it at a setting of 8 on the dial, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend starting out that high)</li>
            <li> However I have noticed a decrease in my facial hair re-growth, so I have high hopes for the future.&lt;br /&gt;In regards to any effects of the treatment</li>
            <li> With very light hair it&#x27;s hard to see where it&#x27;s attached, but it&#x27;s still possible.  </li>
            <li> I am now attempting to do my whole bikini line, which will take a long time because there are a lot of hairs, but eventually will be permanent.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> That said, my only word of caution when using this product (or any electrolysis machine) is to go easy on the face or areas that are not easily concealable.</li>
            <li> At first, it seemed impossible to get the tiny stylist into the seemingly even tinier pore, but once we setup bright lighting</li>
            <li> Many of my problem hairs are fairly deep and the tip does not get down deep enough.  </li>
            <li> I had to use my reading glasses to really see what i was doing, a magnifying mirror would probably help, having second person such as a spouse do</li>
            <li> You have to stick the little needle DIRECTLY into the hair follicle all the way and hold it there for a full 15 seconds (following the instructions that come with it).</li>
            <li> Oh, and in the end up every single hair grew back - as big and as bold as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well this works, and we&#x27;re even using a low setting; 3.  </li>
            <li> these make it much easier to pinpoint and grab a single hair compared with the tweezers included in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the way, I dropped mine onto the hard floor and it still works fine.</li>
            <li> start on your face, practice on other body parts first.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but I think it&#x27;s amazing that this technology is even available to the average person for such a very low price.</li>
            <li> I tried to remove 5 hair near my ankle as a test, and I had red spots probably due to higher strength than it&#x27;s supposed to use.</li>
            <li> So much so that I cannot keep it in the follicle long enough to do its thing.  </li>
            <li> It has only been three months, but the hair growth is much slower and some hairs haven&#x27;t come back at all after only one treatment.  </li>
            <li> They warned that it takes several sessions to succeed, so I was patient, and allowed the area to heal completely each time.  </li>
            <li> I got this to supplement professional hair removal treatment I was already receiving regularly.</li>
            <li> but I went up to a 10 (the highest setting) and barely felt any sensation at all.</li>
            <li> So far, I have tried it on probably about fifty areas, not fifty individual veins, though.  </li>
            <li> So far the areas I zapped didn&#x27;t grow back.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the loud beeping noise when you have it in use.  </li>
            <li> There was unexpected pain at the low settings.  </li>
            <li> Burned my skin even though I followed directions very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;Probe broke when trying to put it into pen only plus side is the extra probe on that end....but broke for same reason again.</li>
            <li> I turned mine up to 10 (max) and still barely felt any zing...</li>
            <li> I was also surprised at the strength of the current that came out of the needle; the highest I ever needed to use was five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you need facial hair removed please go see a professional and not this piece of junk</li>
            <li> I can not sing the praise loud enough for this thing.</li>
            <li> Can really sting in some spots and barely tingles in other spots.  </li>
            <li> A little painful but very effective!!!</li>
            <li> Every time I attempt to \\&quot;slide\\&quot; the stylus tip into a pore I get a sharp zap because the thing has decided I must be ready.</li>
            <li> Thanks, but no thanks!</li>
            <li> After practicing for a while, I can now remove about 90 hairs per hour and very rarely have a failure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous electrolysis sessions with a licensed professional and it feels the exactly same as what she does....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have such red spot from the professional treatment.</li>
            <li> The device is burning a tiny hole in your skin, complete with bubbling (sizzling) white ooze.  </li>
            <li> 15 seconds of expected pain are finally over, so you gently tug the hair.</li>
            <li> (I really don&#x27;t do this part anymore as I know relatively how wet they need to be), and insert it into your follicle.  </li>
            <li> That way you can see the following: how to conduct the procedure, how much it hurts, how long a session takes, and how long it takes for you to heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any pain either, an occasional sting but even that is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> The pain is not more than a pinch, so it&#x27;s worth it for the permanence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as going to a professional, it takes many expensive visits.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but very tedious to use since one has to pluck a strand of hair one at a time.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY like it said to do and am left with these embarrassing little burn marks.</li>
            <li> you have a neurosurgeon&#x27;s steady hands and eagle sharp eyes, then perhaps this product will work for you.</li>
            <li> And while it is true that the stylus tip is extremely bendable (they do include a second one, however), it is still much too thick to actually get INTO any pore.</li>
            <li> I rate this device high due to</li>
            <li> This little torture device certainly works.  </li>
            <li> Inserting these tiny needles into your hair follicles is fiendishly tricky without a large magnifying mirror, plenty of light and the hand steadiness that would rival that of a mime artist.</li>
            <li> Not every single hair follicle is the same shape and size and direction so it could take a few times to get it right.</li>
            <li> I would never have enough time to treat my whole legs, but I did manage to do a 3x3 area on both legs a little ways above my ankles.</li>
            <li> the next day I had little red scabs over the hairs I removed, but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much if it ment having the hair gone forever.</li>
            <li> Most hairs slipped out with hardly a tug, after one 15-second treatment, but just a few (courser hairs) needed a second dose.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes, but this product is definitely a let down.</li>
            <li> Good idea, bad construction.  </li>
            <li> The issue is that it leaves ugly bright red holes on your face.  </li>
            <li> It really sucks and makes me very self conscious.    </li>
            <li> Very very time consuming and very painful which i really didnt enjoy.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t hear any loud noise</li>
            <li> (The total hours of electrolysis would have been less using a professional, probably 35-40 hours; however, the overall process would have taken longer since I would have had to space my treatments out into weekly or bi-weekly sessions)ys in the manual</li>
            <li> (The total hours of electrolysis would have been less using a professional, probably 35-40 hours; however, the overall process would have taken longer since I would have had to space my treatments out into weekly or bi-weekly sessions)</li>
            <li> This is unfortunate, because it really worked the first time.  </li>
            <li> I might try again at the start of a week long stay-cation where I could wait for the red dots to go away before being in public.  </li>
            <li> it does take quite a while as you have to treat each hair individually, but after a few tries it gets much easier, and I&#x27;ve only noticed about 25% of the hair treated has grown back (</li>
            <li> Being new to this, I was not familiar with the technique and bent the stylus tip a bit, they are VERY fragile.</li>
            <li> It is difficult and tedious to use at its best, and it didn&#x27;t remove one single hair for me.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with sensitive skin and very thick facial hairs, on certain areas of my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow, tedious, uncomfortable, causes scabs when doing really thick hairs (the very type of hairs one would generally want to get rid of), the wire bends easily (but bends back easily as well), and WHEN IT&#x27;S DONE, IT&#x27;S REALLY DONE!</li>
            <li> really works I  not sure but after reading some of the reviews I decide to give a try</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m a guy who usually sports stubble, so it didn&#x27;t really show on my chin after the scab fell off.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to decide if the beeping lasts as long as it should be left in there.</li>
            <li> but as patient as I am I couldn&#x27;t keep going with it long enough to see if it would permanently remove the hair forever.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to know if the hair will return</li>
            <li> so I had red marks for a long time and took forever.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> And you can only treat one hair at a time, so it takes a long time and doing your legs is NOT feasible.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it help with the (minor compared to having hair) pain, but it keeps it from getting infected and scabbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it healed and my skin looked normal within a few days.</li>
            <li> hurts the same if not more at a professional electrolysis sessions and some people have a low pain threshold and some don&#x27;t----the chin is not too terribly sensitive but other areas of your face and body</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of the product (aesthetically) is a little below average, pretty colors, but just &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It was slightly more painful than my professional treatment.</li>
            <li> They bend easily and this makes them difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have always had trouble with my bikini line.</li>
            <li> The circuit is completed when the stylus tip comes in contact with the bottom of your skin&#x27;s pore, where there is enough salt for the circuit to be made complete and a (small) jolt of electricity essentially fries out</li>
            <li> I use a wire with a b/plug on one end and a flat piece of aluminum to sit on !!</li>
            <li> I have average steady hands and used a lighted 10x magnifying mirror for my average eyesight</li>
            <li> anyway, owning this product makes me want to see an electrolysis at least just once in to compare and to maybe pick up some techniques (like gauging how much it should &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; to know it&#x27;s being effective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Semi difficult to use at first, but the directions are extremely clear.</li>
            <li> The next day, you have developed small pimples in the treated areas.</li>
            <li> do believe this system works, after removing the hairs a small mosquito like bump formed (this is normal).</li>
            <li> Had one of these a long time ago but got rid of it when I could no longer find the tips, so I decided to try it again.  </li>
            <li> If a vein is an inch long, I might do four or five pokes along the vein.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time for these holes to fill in.</li>
            <li> I am using it to remove the grey hair that laser treatment did not remove.  </li>
            <li> 1 year later, Only a few hairs DIDNT grow back.</li>
            <li> Mine had a short and didn&#x27;t work properly after only a few months.</li>
            <li> It takes a LONG time) doing it for you, go for it.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> so I was not surprised by anything.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared to do this for a long time if you have a lot of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scam and a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> If you scar easily, be extra careful.  </li>
            <li> The Machine work well as long as you use salt water</li>
            <li> Scars take too long to heal.  </li>
            <li> How long do we have before we can exchange something on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were poor and didn&#x27;t tell you many things like what the beeping implies, but after a few tries, I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Generic Visine (red eye remover) helps slightly reduce redness and swelling.  </li>
            <li> This little unit works very well for a little while...then its flimsy construction reveals itself.</li>
            <li> I have read pretty much all of the reviews about this little machine and was skeptical, but purchased anyway.</li>
            <li> Now I use it on a 1 setting and while treating the individual hairs seems to take a little longer, the healing process is only a matter of days.  </li>
            <li> My skin actually bubbles up a little bit of a gooey white substance and then when I pluck the hair out there is no resistance</li>
            <li> I bought it a year ago and worked on both of my legs once, the hair came back like 40% in one and on the other like 10%.</li>
            <li> (laser does not work on red hair due to different type of pigment than other hair</li>
            <li> It left little scabs that healed in about a week but after about a month the hair grew back.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok, but having to wait 20 seconds for each hair to be treated can be a bit tedious!</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY coarse, dark red, brown, black and the dreaded lightning bolts of white hairs that pop up time to time.  </li>
            <li> It did seem to remove hairs for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> and takes a very long time to do.</li>
            <li> Well...the hair got darker and more coarse in my goatee area, but the PAINFUL laser did not work.  </li>
            <li> Your skin should be dry.  </li>
            <li> Reading the directions a few times before I started and testing on my arm a few hairs really helped.</li>
            <li> I have only had a few chances to use the device so this review is based on initial impressions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect to get a low quality product and unfriendly service, plus I waste money for return shipping back and forth!..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to electrolysis.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and tried it out-not a single pulse of anything.  </li>
            <li> I still have ever single hair I started with.</li>
            <li> this point I recommend this product as an alternative to professional electrolysis, if you are not able to find or afford it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> (I do not normally need glasses for close up work).</li>
            <li> but then I was careful follow the instructions and not do it too long as I using this along my chin line.</li>
            <li> As I live abroad and don&#x27;t have access to &amp;#34;witch hazel&amp;#34; I use regular rubbing alcohol and to assist healing, I use a small amount of Neosporin that I bought a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The lower the setting, the less likely to leave a scab.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s necessary to wait about a half hour or so.  </li>
            <li> Now, that may not sound like too long but imagine doing it for an hour and only covering one square inch.</li>
            <li> Their way to know that you&#x27;ve gotten the hair permanently removed is you will see a small amount of white, bubbling fluid around the follicle.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the stupidest invention out there, plugging a long sharp needle into your pores will cause it to blister.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick, dark hair and have always been kind of obsessed with hair removal.</li>
            <li> You will get tiny little scabs where the needle went in, but they heal after a day or two.</li>
            <li> I figure after 5 treatment with little facial hair</li>
            <li> it is not like the old ones and hard to use.</li>
            <li> A little bit annoying because you have to keep wetting fingers with salt water, but otherwise good and efficient.  </li>
            <li> , I hold it in for about 3-5pulses of electricity, the most painful part, to me, is getting the stylus in the hair shaft, then it&#x27;s bearable.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because &amp;#34;happy wife happy life&amp;#34; and she used it for about 3 days and it caused terrible...</li>
            <li> i tried salt water and it is PAINFUL and causes way more damage to the skin.  </li>
            <li> It will be soothing and reduce the likelihood of the hair growing back (or at least it will grow back</li>
            <li> The directions say you can repeat once, but the spot is red, angry looking, and leaking serous (clear) fluid as your body&#x27;s response to the abuse</li>
            <li> All of the follicles are red, angry looking, and oozing clear fluid.</li>
            <li> so yes, I sat there for some time poking my face and curious as to why it wasn&#x27;t working...</li>
            <li> To add insult to injury (literally), hairs started to grow back through ALL of the scab-holes after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is what I expected of a $30.00 machine.</li>
            <li> There has been absolutely no scarring.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve got with this is a few blisters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be careful.</li>
            <li> You tug harder (it should just slide out)</li>
            <li> The product is about what I expected.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful about the usage andl not to burn your skin.</li>
            <li> You have to WET your fingers for it to work.</li>
            <li> The needle is so thin, its more like a thin wire rather than a needle.</li>
            <li> Start out on a low power setting, apply for less time than you would on any other area, and DO NOT squeeze!</li>
            <li> After being very careful I think I got overconfident and killed the second tip after just 20 hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get little scabs when I use this, but can&#x27;t return it, because I waited too long before I tried it out.</li>
            <li> being in an uncomfortable position, agitated mental or emotional state(whether through stimulants or circumstances), or tired is going to make your hands shaky, which will make the treatments longer, more frustrating, and more likely to go wrong.    </li>
            <li> Yes you do need to give it time, and it (like any other product) will never perm.</li>
            <li> He has a patch of hair on one of his shoulder blades with a small bald spot in the middle of it all.</li>
            <li> Use this product only for small amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> Now I should note that I bought this product with some skepticism having read the other product reviews.</li>
            <li> I have extremely study hands and thought I could do it.  </li>
            <li> Other than the tI</li>
            <li> I could do it on the front of my leg over the shin, but for other areas I couldn&#x27;t contort myself into a position that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not store it with the battery inside, as it was recommended by other reviewers not to do so.</li>
            <li> I also bought the tea tree oil ointment recommended by other reviewers to use on treated areas.</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 months now and I am extremely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, like some of the other reviewers here, my efforts ended in scarring and disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other areas sometimes I can feel it a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The risk with moles is that if it is cancerous, you may not know the cancer is growing because electrolysis can change the appearance of the mole (usually makes it smaller and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had the machine leave a pock, damage my skin, or do any other harm.  </li>
            <li> It could be because I have dark course hair, but for the amount of time and with little results, this had been in a closet unused for a long time.</li>
            <li> very be careful because It can damage your skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very hard to insert the long metal stylus into the hair follicle while the thing is constantly zapping you.  </li>
            <li> And each time I have to wet my fingers with a salt water is a little pain.  </li>
            <li> but this left the usual little burn marks</li>
            <li> This product works but it is hard to look at the mirror and at the same time put the stylet tip into the hair follicle.</li>
            <li> Also you have a constant charge and it stings pretty bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money or hassle..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on giving it to my sister-in-law who is naturally dark hair.</li>
            <li> I want to say again that I have used this on small red/purple spider veins, not the big green varicose type veins.</li>
            <li> Thin the forest, don&#x27;t clear cut it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Go with the Remington, the money savings are NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> read a review that mentioned something about salt water with one hand while using the machine - which I found a tiny bit confusing.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t so much vanity as that they just feel wrong.</li>
            <li> It sucks because I have facial hair</li>
            <li> In terms of its effectiveness, I have thick hair and a lot of facial hair I need to be rid of.</li>
            <li> It was hard for her to use and you have to dip your hand in water or something to make it work, and even with those instructions it only works about half the time.</li>
            <li> it was in the unit upside down (presumably for shipping)</li>
            <li> /&gt;You may want to sit down to go this because you need stable hands.</li>
            <li> It is money down the drain and a risk for your skin.</li>
            <li> Thank God the price of Laser hair removal is coming down.</li>
            <li> Having read the other reviews, I promptly opened up the bottom side, plugged-in the included 9-volt battery and went to go make a little bit of salty water to dab my fingers</li>
            <li> The one I had delivered to an address other then mine did not work!  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has used this product properly will know that it works because you will feel the small needle (stylet) in your hair follicle giving you a zap!</li>
            <li> As opposed to other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the stylet tip.</li>
            <li> And for the past ten years I&#x27;ve been annoyed by a half dozen coarse, stray hairs which insist to grow in odd places along my ear lobes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about half a dozen times</li>
            <li> but they turned black.</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews I should of</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t completely disappear, to my disappointment, but after all, I only tried the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> Your fingers need to be on the metal piece on the wand and it needs to be slightly moist with salt water.</li>
            <li> The pulse hurts quite a bit and the &#x27;treated&#x27; hairs didn&#x27;t budge half the time.</li>
            <li> They scabs stayed for about a week, the skin was slightly discolored for an additional week after the scabs came off.</li>
            <li> That means less pushing\squeezing, minimizing the chance of bruising or breaking blood vessels in the surrounding skin.  </li>
            <li> And in some cases, if it&#x27;s bent ever so slightly, I find that it almost makes it easier to get it into the follicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d rather it be done quicker, turn the dial up to 10 and in about a cycle and a half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month</li>
            <li> So what started out as a few dark hairs here and there, turned into a lifetime of battling a position in the circus.here</li>
            <li> have given the product a 4 star review since the tweezers are not good, and because I am still not 100% convinced of the lasting effects.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Thats not true.  </li>
            <li> My face was a mess after using it.  </li>
            <li> but if you spray colloidal silver on the area after treatment there is much less redness, little or no scabbing, and its healed in 3 days.</li>
            <li> Put it down for a few days, tried it again, and nothing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine having to hold the stylus on a single hair for at least 15 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The beeping noise it makes is not a friendly alarm.</li>
            <li> It took a little practice</li>
            <li> Immediately after usage it looks like you have little bug bites</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to work, I could not feel anything happening and it did little for me.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure whether this was due to a product design change or indicates that I recieved a defective product.</li>
            <li> It leaves a little scab, and after the scab heals I get to see if the vein disappeared.  </li>
            <li> those little pin pricks add up..</li>
            <li> It DOES leave little scars, but they&#x27;ve gone away for me.</li>
            <li> Yes it does leave little marks at each site you insert the needle but they heal.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky to use, but I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> takes care of those pesky little pubic hairs and others</li>
            <li> hate it, and don&#x27;t recommend to any one to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;be smart, and save your money!!!</li>
            <li> have done lots of laser hair removal, and that only works on dark hairs, and is not long term and is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse unwanted hair so while it is taking me some time to go by sections, I am seeing some results.</li>
            <li> :  The beeping sound is very annoying - it actually hurts my ears.</li>
            <li> I was warned that there would be tiny scabs, but it was soooo much worse.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend getting it, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few points of advice that may already have been given, but bear repeating:    </li>
            <li> I read on a message board somewhere that someone had used a home electrolysis machine to get rid of a few spider veins on her legs.  </li>
            <li> I used this item a few times and it broke.</li>
            <li> ; (again, which I think doesn&#x27;t matter), each electric pulse round lasts 7 seconds, and I repeated each follicle for 7 rounds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually thought those products made my situation worse.</li>
            <li> I used it on a few hairs on lip line.  </li>
            <li> It  is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product years ago...and with a few moves in between....</li>
            <li> Even if I shaved the there would be stubble within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is the quality poor when it breaks after only two uses?</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This os one of few that is recommended on TS Roadmap.</li>
            <li> I tried to give all reviews a look-see but found that the ones who were complaining were dead on spot.</li>
            <li> I have since gone to a professional, which is expensive</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 2 years now every few months HOPING for it to work</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t destroy your face with squeezing.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dead, the tissue is no longer &amp;#34;holding on&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and then I cannot get an appointment and just want to remove a few stray hairs.</li>
            <li> This thing is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a few stray hairs, didn&#x27;t touch it for years, and started using it again.  </li>
            <li> I somehow had the impression electrolysis units were like the electronic tweezers which as i understand are unproven hair removal systems and a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Worked at making it work for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times since then, and the results are already visible.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I did this because the probe is .004in thick and there are only .004in thick probes</li>
            <li> To temper it you can leave the setting down around a 5 or so and just allow the needle to go through a couple of cycles - usually 3 if I leave it at this level - and then the hair should pull out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  my instructions do not say to use salt water, so i always used plain water.  </li>
            <li> People complain about the pain, but it&#x27;s less painful than a tattoo or piercing, and tends to dull after the first few seconds on each hair.</li>
            <li> Have only used a few times but it doesn&#x27;t hurt though it is uncomfortable for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to use and very temperamental.</li>
            <li> Thick dark hair requires you to damage and scar your skin...</li>
            <li> : If you can&#x27;t thread a needle due to shaky hands, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> After a year of this, I became frustrated and suspicious that she wasn&#x27;t removing them properly, causing them to grow back.  </li>
            <li> However, it left ugly marks and 90% of the hairs came back.</li>
            <li> While this is not for the faint of heart (or those with poor vision), I found it works very well.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered this a couple of months ago to use on thick black whiskers on my chin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know whether the problem is that its not effective for thick and/or coarse hair or if it&#x27;s just not a good product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to believe this little &amp;#60;$30 machine can do anything, let alone do it well.</li>
            <li> even if you have a high tolerance for pain, it is, to say the very least, uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually performing the treatment is very time consuming, and a tad painful.</li>
            <li> Let it ooze if it&#x27;s going to, and just keep wiping with alcohol for a few minutes, but DO NOT squeeze!</li>
            <li> :-S</li>
            <li> With all the fake hair removal devices out there costing up to $500 (total quack machines)</li>
            <li> From my test, it works SOLELY on completing the circuit (even when off) and setting 10 seems to produce no more of a sting than setting 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I have gotten past the beep.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> If you have small children you might as well skip this one.</li>
            <li> I usually just turn on a tv show and use it for 15 - 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It stopped working, thinking a wire or something,  not sure</li>
            <li> A word of warning for those who are used to paying for electrolysis treatments:  the follicle usually does not come out immediately after you&#x27;ve zapped it</li>
            <li> needle is small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 2 stars because maybe I did it wrong.  </li>
            <li> Then, the tip bends way too easy---leaves small scabs in order to get the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can only express my regret in buying this product.</li>
            <li> I was paying an electrologist $30 every month for a 15 minute appointment to remove approximately 15 hairs from my chin due to post-menopausal growth.</li>
            <li> So if another hair grows back, it doesn&#x27;t mean you failed, it means you need to continue going through all of your hair growth cycles.</li>
            <li> your first try just aim for one or two annoying hairs.</li>
            <li> your first try just aim for one or two annoying hairs.</li>
            <li> The only change I would make to the product is a volume control for the tone it makes, which is loud and irritating; however, I found that rolling a thick sock over the base unit muffles it to an acceptable level.  </li>
            <li> star for my personal disastrous experience; 2 stars to take into account my user error and the fact that this machine may well work for some out there - but please use with extreme caution!</li>
            <li> the needle bends, it is too hard to get it into the hair follicle (even with a magnifying glass)</li>
            <li> Too hard to see where the hair follicle is otherwise.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of a quality hard plastic and sort of is a case for itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awfully hard to get that</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would not recommend using this machine to remove thinner hairs where the follicles are hard to see, ie arm or leg hairs.  </li>
            <li> I am also thinking that getting some sort of magnifying glass would be helpful, since it can be hard to see hairs sometimes.</li>
            <li> Its hard to use by yourself</li>
            <li> I am considering doing my armpits, but its hard to reach/see that</li>
            <li> Too hard to use.  </li>
            <li> find upper lip is a little painful.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping to get rid of unwanted hairs, however it stopped working after 2 months of use.(Sundays only)Too late to request a refund</li>
            <li> Everything is filmsy and the instructions are confusing.</li>
            <li> At least any of mine.</li>
            <li> Hair is the least of my concerns.      </li>
            <li> I recommend using leg hair or any region where you have thick hair to get handle of things.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I can see why people pay someone else to do this for them as it is slow going.</li>
            <li> This is just too time consuming, ineffective and cumbersome to use if you have a lot of thick hair to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Upon using this product I found it EXTREMELY time consuming, irritating, somewhat painful, and left me covered with teeny scabs for a week post-treatment.</li>
            <li> that zit with this mean sucker.  </li>
            <li> And by cycle I mean, the soundI mentioned sort of stops after a couple seconds and</li>
            <li> It is still a very tedious process and not for overall hair removal.</li>
            <li> but the tip is very small and needs to go into the pore to work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve disassembled this part of the device and repaired the cord with electrical tape, but it&#x27;s VERY difficult to put Humpty Dumpty back together</li>
            <li> Imagine trying to thread a needle with a very very small hole.</li>
            <li> Really hard to insert wire along side hairs because the wire / electrode is spring loaded providing little pressure - will be extremely difficult to use even if it does work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product gave me hope just to let me down.</li>
            <li> The first time I attempted the procedure, it was very painful, so I reduced the frequency to one of the lower settings.</li>
            <li> but it did tingled in some spots but nothing painful or more than slightly annoying.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s impossible to put the needle in your pore, hold it in place, and then turn the dial with only two hands.</li>
            <li> For those of you that have ever gone to the electrolysis, you know that it is painful and does take several treatments, but the plus side is that it permanently removes unwanted hair unlike waxing and laser.</li>
            <li> So not good for permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li> I can not fairly judge as to the effectiveness of this product, because I just couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> But, I have to go swimming and stuff and don&#x27;t want people to wonder what the heck is wrong with my legs, so I just do a few areas here and there.      </li>
            <li> As others have mentioned the twizers that come with the product are not good.</li>
            <li> I mean, this was broken</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a shocking experience, and it takes forever to get it just right, and it takes a while (like weeks) to fully get rid of a man&#x27;s beard, so I&#x27;m not trying it on my legs ever.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who is sick of tweezing, waxing, or dealing with unwanted hairs!</li>
            <li> This product was an epic, painful, fail.  </li>
            <li> This product is very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I tried very hard to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> Very hard to target hair folicle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally frustrated, I decided to attack a single beard-hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tough call.</li>
            <li> but it was still tough meaning it does not work.</li>
            <li> It is sooooo annoying that it means the machine can&#x27;t be used while doing anything else, or with anyone else nearby..  possibly even in an adjacent room.</li>
            <li> However workmanship is poor.</li>
            <li> When you put the battery in and turn it on there is a very annoying beep that stays on the whole time.</li>
            <li> Still nothing which I chalk up to the cheapness of the product and poorly made connectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I have not experienced anything abnormal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also annoying as heck as every time you connect the current it screeches to let you know that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Tired of plucking them out, I decided to root them out for once and all.</li>
            <li> Definitely delivers a shock and an annoying noise to boot.</li>
            <li> Usually you can hear popping sounds (very faint), which I take to mean its frying things</li>
            <li> When the horrible scabs (looked like a bad case of chicken pox) fell off, I was left with dark scars that have not faded as of 4 months later.  </li>
            <li> It is also nearly impossible to get the flimsy little needle into a hair follicle.</li>
            <li> I am hoping this will make doing the treatment less painful.</li>
            <li> It is a little painful, time consuming, and WORKS when it&#x27;s done correctly.</li>
            <li> I was too naive and desperate, when I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I have been going to the Electrolysis for some time now and decided to try this product because it was getting too expensive</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t afford laser treatments and extra body hair makes me miserable.</li>
            <li> as the contents of the pore are, somewhat disturbingly, seemingly boiled out.</li>
            <li> Sorry that I can&#x27;t comment on hair removal - as of now, I&#x27;d just be ecstatic to get rid of these veins.  </li>
            <li> I do not know the results of this Home Electrolysis machine, but should it fail; it also will be returned.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> I was using it wrong, because it was not beeping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So now came the tedious part.</li>
            <li> now came the tedious part.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time consuming and uncomfortable plus you have to use the salty water on your fingers...</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just time consuming, it&#x27;s difficult to do on youself.</li>
            <li> Just too difficult.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it leaves temporary scars and its somewhat complicated.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve, it is time consuming, tedious</li>
            <li> about 10 of them failed (you can tell if it works because the hair will just slide out of the follicle with no resistance).  </li>
            <li> If you have been to a professiobnal electrolysis then should know that it is a tedious time consuming process regardless.</li>
            <li> Product is too difficult to use, time consuming and ineffective.  </li>
            <li> in all, I would NOT recommend this product, and please do not be tempted by the unrealistic promises...</li>
            <li> if you want to use this product for your chin/neck area (like myself) it is extremely difficult (but not impossible).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the kit would not work when I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> absolutely useless product...</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s cooking your skin into liquid with the power of a mere 9 volt battery.  </li>
            <li> Once these needles are severely bent, they are useless.  </li>
            <li> It can be quite difficult to see the hair follicles without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your skeptical its</li>
            <li> QUITE uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Because of this change to the stylets, I have been unable to continue using the machine.</li>
            <li> (I could be wrong).  </li>
            <li> in all efficient product but tedious and tiring</li>
            <li> wtf.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the patience to try again.  </li>
            <li> Unable to target a hair shaft.</li>
            <li> This product is useless.</li>
            <li> The probe as you might expect is very thin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product got any bad reviews unless you got a broken unit.</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s a bit awkward doing electrolysis on oneself, but if you&#x27;re patient you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not all that inconvenient but increases conductivity.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve been desperate to find a home treatment for spider veins.  </li>
            <li> In this way it saves time (even though on a hair by hair basis it takes longer, I can do it while watching TV at home instead of booking an appointment and cutting off work).</li>
            <li> Hurt like crazy and made no difference at all.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s painful and uncomfortable but it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Caused my skin to break out and I looked wicked crazy...</li>
            <li> That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> The 1st time was rather awkward</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful and tedious.  </li>
            <li> Amazon accepted my return, but it was still a disappointing pain in the butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how anyone can use this electrolysis, it is very difficult to hold the elec.</li>

            <li> I could never get it to work. It was a waste of money for me, but someone may do better and have good results...</li>
            <li> did not work at all,even bought new batteries and nothin</li>
            <li> It can in about 5 days.  Place battery in a it did not work. Sent a response to company.  I have to pay to ship it back, I am fuming because their product never work!!!  I will not be paying for this on my Amazon credit card.  Very disapointed !! Would not even give it one star</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have always had trouble with my bikini line. I&#x27;ve waxed, nair-ed you name it, i&#x27;ve done it. This is the only product that has ever helped me. Yes you do need to give it time, and it (like any other product) will never perm. remove the hairs you have to keep using it. It works like magic. This thing has absolutely made my summer bare(ha)able. I recommend this to anyone, just make sure you read the instructions and follow them. It&#x27;s such a life saver.</li>
            <li> A great product and saves a few trips to a professional in between and a lot of money, I have had it for a few months now and is working great so far. It is worth the price and much more......</li>
            <li> The beeping noise it makes is not a friendly alarm. I dearly wish it was a light. It is sooooo annoying that it means the machine can&#x27;t be used while doing anything else, or with anyone else nearby..  possibly even in an adjacent room. And although it works, somewhat, even with my ideal fairly light hair type, the welts it causes eliminates the summer for usage, because you can&#x27;t show your legs for a week or more for every time you try.    Fine idea, reasonable effectiveness for very specific application. TOTALLY UNUSABLE as a consumer product.</li>
            <li> cant use it.  if you buy it, you have to have a professional do it for you anyway.  the needle bends, it is too hard to get it into the hair follicle (even with a magnifying glass) and after all you end up with is a bunch of pimples that last for 3 weeks PLUS the hair is still there.  Garbage product.</li>
            <li> It took a little practice but I&#x27;ve figured it out. I have super sensitive skin so I make sure that I use this when I&#x27;m not going out in public or going to see anyone for a day or two because my skin gets very red and puffy. I&#x27;ve only used it twice but I&#x27;ve already noticed that the hairs are growing back slower and much finer. I&#x27;m guessing it may take two or three more times and they will stop growing back!</li>
            <li> This little torture device certainly works.  Granted, it&#x27;s a bit awkward doing electrolysis on oneself, but if you&#x27;re patient you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. Be sure to use the lowest setting that is effective to get the hair out without tugging the skin at all.  The lower the setting, the less likely to leave a scab.  Practice some place inconspicuous on your body, I hold it in for about 3-5pulses of electricity, the most painful part, to me, is getting the stylus in the hair shaft, then it&#x27;s bearable.  Taking ibuprofen about an hour ahead of time works wonders for pain, redness and swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only do a few hairs in a section at a time to avoid too much damage.  I&#x27;m happy with the effectiveness and most of the reviews I read helped give an accurate detailing of this product.  My hair is VERY coarse, dark red, brown, black and the dreaded lightning bolts of white hairs that pop up time to time.  This works on all of them at different settings.  Just remember, the higher the setting, the more damage it is doing to not only the root, but to your skin since that&#x27;s its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to keep a little bowl of salt water and a towel handy and keep your fingers moist, not dripping, it&#x27;s not all that inconvenient but increases conductivity.  Ohhhh and be sure the battery is actually plugged in...it was in the unit upside down (presumably for shipping) so yes, I sat there for some time poking my face and curious as to why it wasn&#x27;t working...haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the buzz sound all that loud, it&#x27;s a beep and lets me know electricity is being delivered.  Works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I had electrolysis years ago on just a few unruly hairs that didn&#x27;t work because I didn&#x27;t have a good technician.  Later I shelled out tons of money for TWO YEARS of laser, and the laser clinic told me to shave my face in between visits to make the hair darker.  Well...the hair got darker and more coarse in my goatee area, but the PAINFUL laser did not work.  At all.  So what started out as a few dark hairs here and there, turned into a lifetime of battling a position in the circus.here and there, turned into a lifetime of battling a position in the circus.</li>
            <li> I purchased this system about 4 months ago and have had great results. Yeah it&#x27;s a pain it does take quite a while as you have to treat each hair individually, but after a few tries it gets much easier, and I&#x27;ve only noticed about 25% of the hair treated has grown back (probably due to my own error). So far all I have used this on is my legs and had great results. Immediately after usage it looks like you have little bug bites then they scab over but after about a week ot two the spots heal up. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I followed directions exactly.  Hurt like heck, but I persevered with the hope of being hair free.  I did about 80 hairs.  I was warned that there would be tiny scabs, but it was soooo much worse.  When the horrible scabs (looked like a bad case of chicken pox) fell off, I was left with dark scars that have not faded as of 4 months later.  One of the two probes was too short to even work, which is a good thing because it kept me from mangling myself further.  To add insult to injury (literally), hairs started to grow back through ALL of the scab-holes after a few weeks.  This product was an epic, painful, fail.  I am scarred, badly.</li>
            <li> I was paying an electrologist $30 every month for a 15 minute appointment to remove approximately 15 hairs from my chin due to post-menopausal growth. After a year of this, I became frustrated and suspicious that she wasn&#x27;t removing them properly, causing them to grow back.  Then I bought the Clean &amp; Easy Deluxe Home Electrolysis.  The instructions were poor and didn&#x27;t tell you many things like what the beeping implies, but after a few tries, I got the hang of it.  It has only been three months, but the hair growth is much slower and some hairs haven&#x27;t come back at all after only one treatment.  I advise getting several stylets and not trying to straighten them yourself.  If you buy them in bulk, they are cheap, and you only need to replace them infrequently.  If you have lots of hair that needs to be removed, then I think you&#x27;d be better off getting it done professionally, but make sure the electrologist has stellar references and isn&#x27;t trying to scam you, like the person I went to before buying the Clean &amp; Easy.  Be patient - it takes time to get the hang of doing it, but once you do, it works very well.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I expected. It is a little painful, time consuming, and WORKS when it&#x27;s done correctly. If people want something that&#x27;s going to be permanent, it&#x27;s going to take time and some discomfort. The pain is not more than a pinch, so it&#x27;s worth it for the permanence. For the price, you won&#x27;t find any better options for permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I have been going to the Electrolysis for some time now and decided to try this product because it was getting too expensive and I couldn&#x27;t find the time to drive over to my electrolysis office. For those of you that have ever gone to the electrolysis, you know that it is painful and does take several treatments, but the plus side is that it permanently removes unwanted hair unlike waxing and laser. I decided to try this product because the price of this product was still cheaper than one session at the electrolysis and second because I can do it in the privacy of my own home and do it whenever I have extra time. For those of you that complain about the pain, it&#x27;s equivalent to what you experience when at the electrolysis. This product isn&#x27;t for everyone, if you don&#x27;t have time, don&#x27;t purchase. It will take some time dependent on the location and growth of your hair. It may not be a one time thing, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. If you are one to complain about your hand hurting, then leave it to a professional. This product is for those of us that are self conscious and willing to take the time to rid our unwanted hair. Also I purchased at my local Sally Beauty Supply store, this might save you some shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my fiance to remove some patches of hair on his back. I had to read the instruction booklet a couple times to fully understand how I was suppose to get the the stylus tip into the hair follicle. I&#x27;m sure once you have been able to manage the technique of hitting the hair follicle the right way it should be easy. Some hairs (individual hairs one at a time) took about 20 minutes for the beeping to go off to let me know I was doing it right. (When you have placed the stylus tip correctly into the hair shaft the machine will start beeping to let you know it is properly sending currents at the time. I have yet to decide if the beeping lasts as long as it should be left in there. It&#x27;s a good couple of seconds.) Other times I was able to get 5-6 hairs without any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe this system works, after removing the hairs a small mosquito like bump formed (this is normal). If you have the patience to remove hair one at a time and give yourself enough time to master the technique you will receive results. It will just take A LOT of patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend investing in another set of stylus tips. Being new to this, I was not familiar with the technique and bent the stylus tip a bit, they are VERY fragile. It still works but is more difficult to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I would like to update and add that weeks later my fiance has had NO regrowth of the hair that had been removed in that tiny patch. He has a patch of hair on one of his shoulder blades with a small bald spot in the middle of it all. HIGHLY impressed***</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon, I have had this home electrolysis kit for several years now.  I have only used it on my bikini area.  The first time I attempted the procedure, it was very painful, so I reduced the frequency to one of the lower settings. As I got used to the pain, I was able to gradually increase the setting. It took about 3 - 4 separate times to completely rid myself of unwanted hair, but I was determined.  I read positive reviews elsewhere, and they seemed genuine.  They warned that it takes several sessions to succeed, so I was patient, and allowed the area to heal completely each time.  I made sure that everything was sterilized with rubbing alcohol beforehand including the skin area, and cleaned afterwords as well.  I used Neosporin + pain to help reduce the swelling, pain, and scabbing.      If you cannot afford professional electrolysis, and would rather do it yourself in the privacy of your own home without any fears of other people&#x27;s germs, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Upon using this product I found it EXTREMELY time consuming, irritating, somewhat painful, and left me covered with teeny scabs for a week post-treatment. I sold this item within a month of purchasing it. Here I am many many months later, returning to say that the area that I treated has about 50% less hair growth than before and I&#x27;m actually considering purchasing this again to finish up treatment. It&#x27;s a tough call. This machine has alot of cons, scabbing being the biggest issue for me, but this is one of the only machines that seems to deliver permanent results at such an affordable price. I just can&#x27;t afford laser treatments and extra body hair makes me miserable. I think by writing this review I came to decision. It&#x27;s worth it, but only by a hair. ;]</li>
            <li> Worked the first time, did not work again. If it worked more than once, it would be awesome.</li>
            <li> Hair comes after some time . So not good for permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li> I have had electrolysis done before and those hairs never grew back. I thought it would save me a lot of money and time if I tried to do it myself so I bought this product since most reviews rated it highly. HOWEVER, my experience was not so positive. I admit that my hair is coarse and I thought this item would do the job. I have no trouble being patient while trying to learn how to use the tool. I started it at level 1 and worked my way up until I felt the tingling. First, I didn&#x27;t feel a tingle until I got up to level 5 even on a fine hair. But the fine hair did come out easily after several seconds of zapping. For a coarse one, I turned it up all the way to 10 and though I left it on for 30 seconds or more, I was still unable to pull out the hair with ease. Basically, maybe this product works for finer hair but if you have coarse hair, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping to get rid of unwanted hairs, however it stopped working after 2 months of use.(Sundays only)Too late to request a refund so I am stuck with a non functioning unit with extra tips. totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Returning this item, did not say Diabetic could not use, found out after I received it.</li>
            <li> So i bought this product in hopes that it *MIGHT* work for me.. i followed the instructions to the T and when i went to use it, NOTHING. The product literally did not work, like it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I returned it two weeks ago and still didn&#x27;t receive my refund!</li>
            <li> At first I thought the product was great. Followed instructions to the t and had the hair coming out painlessly. However, it left ugly marks and 90% of the hairs came back. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got this to supplement professional hair removal treatment I was already receiving regularly. I would not recommend this product to remove all your leg hair or something that extensive. It would take FOREVER to do that. But if you have some straggler hairs that pop up and you don&#x27;t want to go for professional treatments for whatever reason, this will do the job.    Some things to know:  - It requires lots of patience and lots of practice. I&#x27;ve used it about half a dozen times and I finally feel like I know what I&#x27;m doing and can get the hairs fairly quickly and reliably.  - It&#x27;s nearly impossible to use without a lighted magnifying mirror or glass. Too hard to see where the hair follicle is otherwise.  - It&#x27;s a lot easier on darker hair. With very light hair it&#x27;s hard to see where it&#x27;s attached, but it&#x27;s still possible.  - It&#x27;s a lot easier on hairs that you can look at straight on (as opposed to on the side of your face or the back of your leg, etc). You may need help from a friend for those.  - You need to follow the instructions meticulously.  - You need a steady hand.  - Use your own tweezers. The ones that come with it are unusable.  - As opposed to other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the stylet tip. I did accidentally bend it this last time, but it still works and actually the angle happened to make it easier to use.    It&#x27;s not perfect, but I think it&#x27;s amazing that this technology is even available to the average person for such a very low price. But I highly recommend paying the money for a professional with professional equipment to get the bulk of your work done. Use this product only for small amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> Had one of these a long time ago but got rid of it when I could no longer find the tips, so I decided to try it again.  You have to be careful with the power settings to keep from damaging you skin any more not you have to.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to obtain the correct angle.  It helps if you purchase a pair magnifying glasses to see better as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how anyone can use this electrolysis, it is very difficult to hold the elec. pin in place. I thought it was going to be elec. tweezers, that would be much easier. I will never try a product like this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this out of desperation. Menopause does some nasty hairy things to your face - you basically start turning into your father!  So I ordered this a couple of months ago to use on thick black whiskers on my chin. Ewww! It took a little practice to use, but was easy to catch on to how it works with my skin. Only one of the twenty or so hairs I electrocuted (read: sent to their death) have come back. That was two months ago - and they are gone!  I started to use it on my eyebrows as well - on the wolf-man hairs you get between your brows. Imagine NEVER tweezing those again!  You can adjust it to a level you can handle (there is some pain involved, but think about it - you are electrocuting hair follicles). I kept waiting for something bad to happen and it never has. No scarring, no swelling, not reaction. Just no hair! It also comes with a nice booklet of instructions that is well written.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is sick of tweezing, waxing, or dealing with unwanted hairs!</li>
            <li> I really did not like my product.</li>
            <li> This device does not work at all. Everything is filmsy and the instructions are confusing. Save your money and go to a professional electrologist.</li>
            <li> This gadget did not work after three months of use. I called the manufacturer on the inside label (since it has a one-year guarantee) and was told I could receive a replacement, which I did. The thing is that the replacement would not work either! It did not turn on at all!   I would have loved for the gadget to work, and it did remove a couple hairs, but I paid a lot of money for it to work only three months--even with battery replacement.   Buy if you think three months of usage is worth it. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Although this product was cheap, it isn&#x27;t even worth it. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it once. It is very difficult to use and very temperamental. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have never used this. Maybe it was just me but this left the usual little burn marks but they turned black. They lasted for two weeks (mind you it was summer time). When the scabs finally peeled off I was left with burn marks almost like keloid&#x27;s and I still have them a year later. I used the products EXACTLY like it said to do and am left with these embarrassing little burn marks. It really sucks and makes me very self conscious.    As far as using the product you really get what you paid for. Very very time consuming and very painful which i really didnt enjoy. The needle heads bend so easily it is quite hard to really get the follicle and not your actual skin. I say please dont use this item if your prone to scars just be safe and pay a professional to do this for you.</li>
            <li> I brought my first electrolysis machine four months ago it only worked once.  I paid to send it back they shipped me a used electrolysis machine in return that didn&#x27;t work even once. So purchase another  electrolysis machine and it didn&#x27;t even work once.  So now I have to pay to ship both of them back again.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I read previous reviews I should of took that as a warning sign.  It&#x27;s not worth the money or hassle..</li>
            <li> Very simple &amp; easy to figure out.  Unfortunently all my hair grew back?  But it may be do to the fact that I&#x27;m naturally blonde and all hair removal products seem to be finicky with blonde hair.  I&#x27;m planning on giving it to my sister-in-law who is naturally dark hair.</li>
            <li> Now I should note that I bought this product with some skepticism having read the other product reviews. And while I could just as easily feel buyer&#x27;s remorse now, I don&#x27;t, because I decided to buy this and give it a test anyway. What the heck- if it worked, it&#x27;s cheap and I could definitely find a use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived quickly and was well packaged. Upon opening the actual product&#x27;s box, the whole \\&quot;kit\\&quot; can slide out. It&#x27;s made of a quality hard plastic and sort of is a case for itself. Having read the other reviews, I promptly opened up the bottom side, plugged-in the included 9-volt battery and went to go make a little bit of salty water to dab my fingers in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How this works is quite simple. Your fingers, salty, create a conductive connection with a metal band on the stylus. The circuit is completed when the stylus tip comes in contact with the bottom of your skin&#x27;s pore, where there is enough salt for the circuit to be made complete and a (small) jolt of electricity essentially fries out the pore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is... there&#x27;s no mechanism for when the electricity will actually flow. And while it is true that the stylus tip is extremely bendable (they do include a second one, however), it is still much too thick to actually get INTO any pore. At least any of mine. At any time. Doesn&#x27;t matter pre or post shower, hot rag, whatever. Every time I attempt to \\&quot;slide\\&quot; the stylus tip into a pore I get a sharp zap because the thing has decided I must be ready. It&#x27;s awfully hard to get that right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally frustrated, I decided to attack a single beard-hair. ZAP! before I was ready. I let it continue to zap me and watch as the contents of the pore are, somewhat disturbingly, seemingly boiled out. Left a nice little scar, that did. And the hair never came out till I yanked it with tweezers and it was back four days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have pores as big as the dots in the periods in the above sentences, this might actually work for you. Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money. I already did, in order to help you guy. If I could get my money back, I would. But life goes on.</li>
            <li> Product works well and with the great directions I can tell it is working. Have only used a few times but it doesn&#x27;t hurt though it is uncomfortable for a few seconds. Skin in irritated after so I used tea tree oil disinfectant also found on amazon.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe it was just mine, but it didn&#x27;t work. No current, no zap, no hairs removed. I followed the directions word for word, tried it several times. I read the reviews, and watched youtube videos on this specific product. Put it down for a few days, tried it again, and nothing. Maybe it was just mine, however I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product (aesthetically) is a little below average, pretty colors, but just &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, maybe it will work for you. If anything, you can always return it.</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to work, I could not feel anything happening and it did little for me.  I would not recommend getting it, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I can not fairly judge as to the effectiveness of this product, because I just couldn&#x27;t use it.  The \\&quot;stylet\\&quot; was the thickness and nearly the flexibility of a human hair, and was to be carefully slipped in under the existing hair, through the skin and to the follicle.  Even with the 10X mirror I purchased, I couldn&#x27;t see to do that!  (*Especially* on my face.)&lt;br /&gt; It may be a wonderful product for those of you with steady hands and strong eyes, but I&#x27;m going to seek out a \\&quot;tweezer\\&quot; style product instead.  I sent this back.</li>
            <li> The product did not work for me at all. It is difficult and tedious to use at its best, and it didn&#x27;t remove one single hair for me. I&#x27;m African American so I don&#x27;t know whether the problem is that its not effective for thick and/or coarse hair or if it&#x27;s just not a good product. Also, unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t hear any loud noise so I&#x27;m not sure whether this was due to a product design change or indicates that I recieved a defective product. The instructions stated that most people are comfortable using a level 4 setting but I went up to a 10 (the highest setting) and barely felt any sensation at all. In either case, I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on this and decided to give it a try.  I have extremely study hands and thought I could do it.  As I pluck hairs nightly I didn&#x27;t feel that having to do it repeatedly would be an issue - that part wasn&#x27;t so much.  The issue is that it leaves ugly bright red holes on your face.  It looks like you have bright red pimples even though they are small they are very noticeable.  Also you have a constant charge and it stings pretty bad so it&#x27;s very hard to insert the long metal stylus into the hair follicle while the thing is constantly zapping you.  Does it remove the hair, yes, is it permanent - maybe but as patient as I am I couldn&#x27;t keep going with it long enough to see if it would permanently remove the hair forever.  It did seem to remove hairs for a very long time.  I might try again at the start of a week long stay-cation where I could wait for the red dots to go away before being in public.  Took about 4 days to mostly heal up and I had not scaring but then I was careful follow the instructions and not do it too long as I using this along my chin line.</li>
            <li> If you have steady hands, decent eyesight, and huge amounts of time to spare, this product is the real deal.  I have gotten permanent reduction out of using this unit, without any scarring.  The only change I would make to the product is a volume control for the tone it makes, which is loud and irritating; however, I found that rolling a thick sock over the base unit muffles it to an acceptable level.  A few points of advice that may already have been given, but bear repeating:    - Use the lowest effective setting:  When I first started using the unit I cranked it up to 5, and the pores took weeks to heal and clear up.  Now I use it on a 1 setting and while treating the individual hairs seems to take a little longer, the healing process is only a matter of days.  - Skin care after treatment should not be considered optional.  I have had good results using witch hazel and aloe gel(not lotion), right after treatment, and at least once a day afterwards.  - Be comfortable.  Relax and take your time; being in an uncomfortable position, agitated mental or emotional state(whether through stimulants or circumstances), or tired is going to make your hands shaky, which will make the treatments longer, more frustrating, and more likely to go wrong.    Thanks Clean + Easy, I love your product!</li>
            <li> I have to say, I didn&#x27;t buy this with the intention of using it for hair removal.  I have a great number of spider veins on my legs, especially little fine ones that are hard to treat.  I had a doctor tell me once that I&#x27;d have to win the lotto to get rid of all my veins (I hope he was exaggerating). Since then, I&#x27;ve been desperate to find a home treatment for spider veins.  I read on a message board somewhere that someone had used a home electrolysis machine to get rid of a few spider veins on her legs.  She said the veins didn&#x27;t come back.  After finding this machine for so cheap, I decided to buy it and try it.      So far, I have tried it on probably about fifty areas, not fifty individual veins, though.  If a vein is an inch long, I might do four or five pokes along the vein.  I follow the instructions for hair removal, but just put the stylus tip on the vein instead of a hair follicle.  I leave it for fifteen seconds.    The results?  Well, I first tried this about two weeks ago on the lowest setting.  It leaves a little scab, and after the scab heals I get to see if the vein disappeared.  The veins that I treated on the lowest setting (one on the dial) are faded.  They didn&#x27;t completely disappear, to my disappointment, but after all, I only tried the lowest setting.  The fading of the treated veins does make me hopeful that I can eliminate veins on a higher setting.  A week after the first try, I did some more veins on a higher setting (four and some on six).  At the moment they are still scabbed over, but it does appear so far that it may have worked better - meaning on several areas I don&#x27;t see the spider vein between the scabs.  If it wasn&#x27;t summer, I would be all over this, treating veins all over my legs. But, I have to go swimming and stuff and don&#x27;t want people to wonder what the heck is wrong with my legs, so I just do a few areas here and there.      Cons:  The beeping sound is very annoying - it actually hurts my ears. Also, the whole thing seems abit flimsy, but after all, it doesn&#x27;t cost much.  Sorry that I can&#x27;t comment on hair removal - as of now, I&#x27;d just be ecstatic to get rid of these veins.  Hair is the least of my concerns.      One more thing:  I want to say again that I have used this on small red/purple spider veins, not the big green varicose type veins.</li>
            <li> I get little scabs when I use this, but can&#x27;t return it, because I waited too long before I tried it out.</li>
            <li> I used this item a few times and it broke. Also the stylus was too short to really reach the follicle root. Such a shame, I had a similar product that lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s retracts as soon as it touches the skin. There is no chance of getting it into follicles I would rather have one that doesn&#x27;t retract. Other than the tI p. It seems well made.  But I wouldn&#x27;t know because it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to use.  You need to be a surgeon to use it properly.  Find another solution.</li>
            <li> OMG!   I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective unit or I&#x27;m just sensitive BUT it hurt like heck at the lowest setting.   I can not use it because of the pain.  Good idea but  didn&#x27;t work out for me.  I will try it one more time however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for me.  AND I only used it on 2 eyebrow hairs!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of the deluxe Home Electrolysis machines.  They were both for gifts.  The one I had delivered to an address other then mine did not work!  It was returned.    The second one is still in the box for a gift later on.  I do not know the results of this Home Electrolysis machine, but should it fail; it also will be returned.[[ASIN:B002QXLM3I Clean + Easy  Deluxe Home Electrolysis]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything that you would expect from it if you&#x27;ve done your research. It&#x27;s slow, tedious, uncomfortable, causes scabs when doing really thick hairs (the very type of hairs one would generally want to get rid of), the wire bends easily (but bends back easily as well), and WHEN IT&#x27;S DONE, IT&#x27;S REALLY DONE! I haven&#x27;t had to go back over any of the spots I did.    People complain about the pain, but it&#x27;s less painful than a tattoo or piercing, and tends to dull after the first few seconds on each hair. People complain about the scabbing, but scabbing does not mean scarring, and none of the areas I have used this on have scarred at all.    That said, my only word of caution when using this product (or any electrolysis machine) is to go easy on the face or areas that are not easily concealable. Start out on a low power setting, apply for less time than you would on any other area, and DO NOT squeeze! Let it ooze if it&#x27;s going to, and just keep wiping with alcohol for a few minutes, but DO NOT squeeze! Again, I haven&#x27;t gotten any scarring at all from this device, but I did go around for a few weeks with a cluster of unusual looking, depressed scabs on my face. A lighter, slower approach might&#x27;ve saved me some embarrassment. :-S</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this would take such large plugs from my skin. It takes a long time for these holes to fill in. I have been left with large holes in my skin and the holes are still there and are noticeable. Also,the tiny stylet bent almost immediately. I tried very hard to follow instructions. I should return it but I haven&#x27;t so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried over and over, and have yet to remove even one hair with this. Maybe it is my mirror, maybe I have no depth perception. Either way I am returning it. PS.. those little pin pricks add up..even if you have a high tolerance for pain, it is, to say the very least, uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned the twizers that come with the product are not good. I bought my own though and it works fine. I have a 10x magnification mirror too. That said, love the product. I have been doing laser hair removal for over a year now and it&#x27;s so expensive. Yes this is slightly more painful, but I can do it in the privacy of my own home whenever I want. In this way it saves time (even though on a hair by hair basis it takes longer, I can do it while watching TV at home instead of booking an appointment and cutting off work). PLUS the hair is gone gone! I&#x27;ve had this for well over a month and none of the hair I&#x27;ve zapped has come back. Love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product got any bad reviews unless you got a broken unit. By the way, I dropped mine onto the hard floor and it still works fine. It works exactly as advertised. I&#x27;ve had numerous electrolysis sessions with a licensed professional and it feels the exactly same as what she does....it makes kills the roots of the hair and it will come out like a white goo.  You have to stick the little needle DIRECTLY into the hair follicle all the way and hold it there for a full 15 seconds (following the instructions that come with it). Your fingers need to be on the metal piece on the wand and it needs to be slightly moist with salt water. Yes, it hurts (I use it at a setting of 8 on the dial, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend starting out that high) and it&#x27;s supposed to hurt ---it hurts the same if not more at a professional electrolysis sessions and some people have a low pain threshold and some don&#x27;t----the chin is not too terribly sensitive but other areas of your face and body it will likely feel like a 15 second bee sting!  So far the areas I zapped didn&#x27;t grow back. You will know if it works when the hair slides out without any resistance.....if it has resistance you didn&#x27;t do it right. Not every single hair follicle is the same shape and size and direction so it could take a few times to get it right.</li>
            <li> Extreme patience required to see any lasting results, 6 months of WEEKLY treatments before any thinning is even visible, and since each machine only lasts 4 months, be prepaired to buy 10 of them if you intend to remove more than  5 hairs.</li>
            <li> This product worked for me.  The downsides are that it takes several treatments for permanent removal and it does leave a scab that heals.  The upsides are that it is very inexpensive given that you are getting permanent hair removal and it really does work.</li>
            <li> While this is not for the faint of heart (or those with poor vision), I found it works very well.  If you plan to use it on your own face, a magnifying mirror is a must.      The intensity dial is a great feature - I vary between 4 &amp; 7, depending where on my body I am using it.  Start low and build up to higher intensities.    The only negative for me, is the tweezer that came with it weren&#x27;t very good (too stiff), but I just use the ones I already had.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. With all the fake hair removal devices out there costing up to $500 (total quack machines) it&#x27;s hard to believe this little &amp;#60;$30 machine can do anything, let alone do it well. I&#x27;ve had it about a month now. Whereas my hairs grow back in 7-10 days after plucking, 3 weeks after treatment and about 20% of the hairs treated have not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first stylus/tip lasted for over 100 hairs. After being very careful I think I got overconfident and killed the second tip after just 20 hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a mirror to use for this. 10x was way too strong. 3x is really all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t &amp;#34;clear cut&amp;#34; an area, all at once. Thin the forest, don&#x27;t clear cut it. Too much electrolysis in one area makes this swollen for a few days, whereas thinning things out can avoid such swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t think the dial on the unit does ANYTHING, even turning it (supposedly) &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; seems to be a placebo. From my test, it works SOLELY on completing the circuit (even when off) and setting 10 seems to produce no more of a sting than setting 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: If you can&#x27;t thread a needle due to shaky hands, don&#x27;t buy this. I am not Mr. Rock Steady Hands, but if I rest my arm or wrist on a table, then yes I am pretty steady. Those on meds or stimulants that make you jittery, don&#x27;t buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, owning this product makes me want to see an electrolysis at least just once in to compare and to maybe pick up some techniques (like gauging how much it should &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; to know it&#x27;s being effective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a setting of &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; (again, which I think doesn&#x27;t matter), each electric pulse round lasts 7 seconds, and I repeated each follicle for 7 rounds.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have bought this a decade ago. Keeping my cautionary notes above in mind.... this thing rocks.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for me.  I am using it to remove the grey hair that laser treatment did not remove.  It does hurt like a rubberband snap; You do need to treat and pull each hair;  you do need to leave the needle in 15 seconds; and there will be red bumps afterward that go away in 2 to 3 days.  But, so far, so good for the hair removal.  It will take me a good two years to do my beard area.</li>
            <li> Semi difficult to use at first, but the directions are extremely clear. It takes a lot of patience but once you get the hang of it, it works amazing!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I bought this product if it would work, but it does! I&#x27;ve bought creams, razors, sharper image products and epilator gadgets and none of them work. I actually thought those products made my situation worse. I used this on my chin and upper lip and every area I have treated has not grown back. Does it hurt to zap the hair follicle? yes. The people who stated the product never even turned on probably forgot to open it up and activate the battery in it.      Anyone who has used this product properly will know that it works because you will feel the small needle (stylet) in your hair follicle giving you a zap! My skin actually bubbles up a little bit of a gooey white substance and then when I pluck the hair out there is no resistance so I know I did it correctly. I took advice from another customer that wrote a review and I apply witch hazel on it after I&#x27;m all finished. You will get tiny little scabs where the needle went in, but they heal after a day or two. If you buy the product, start at 1 or 2 for strength and increase until you feel a good zap. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the loud beeping noise when you have it in use.  You can muffle some of that sound if you wrap a hand towel around it.     This is the only inexpensive permanent hair removal system that has ever worked for me.  You are basically being your own dermatologist and zapping your own hair away for $30-$40. A dermatologist would probably end up costing you over $1,000. Why not try it?  I don&#x27;t even think you can get a full tank of gas in your car for under $40.</li>
            <li> So I took a leap of faith on  tangent&#x27;s review. I have bought this machine before. But I couldn&#x27;t grasp how to use it and was young and highly impatient.&lt;br /&gt;I regret now not giving this machine a proper try. If I had, I would have enjoyed much more hairless years. So I bought this again after ages after trying laser and epliation for years.&lt;br /&gt;I do agree, it is insanely time consuming. But when I think of the end result. Not having to go through laser treatments and basically throw my money again and again&lt;br /&gt;It makes sense more for me to suck up the patience factor.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, when I first used it. I was using it wrong, because it was not beeping. So i though, oh god I got a bad one. Then I thought maybe I am too dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;But that didn&#x27;t make sense to me. So since this machine reacts on moisture. I dipped my finger in the salt-water solution i was using for this. And placed the tip on my finger(finger was damp not wet).&lt;br /&gt;And it beeped! Very lound one too. But I have gotten past the beep.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think you can do this in one day. Don&#x27;t aim to get rid of whole face or underarm hair in one go. You have to be patient.&lt;br /&gt;Make a proper station for you to do this. Have you water solution ready. I started of this a bowl first but dipping fingers was turning out to be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;So I put my solution in a spay bottle. Convenient.&lt;br /&gt;You may want to sit down to go this because you need stable hands. I recommend using leg hair or any region where you have thick hair to get handle of things.&lt;br /&gt;Have rubbing alcohol ready(spray bottle), and don&#x27;t share needle with someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, you really do need a 20x magnification. I have a 15x one that I am using right now. But I wish it was higher. Best thing is to do this in daylight instead of regular light.&lt;br /&gt;If you have light colored hair it will be harder to see so I would recommend higher magnification for them. Watch some youtube videos on electrolysis to see how they do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now came the tedious part. You have to have your hair in andagen phase. So wax in sections. Don&#x27;t wax huge sections. Like 10-20 hair sections.&lt;br /&gt;In your first try just aim for one or two annoying hairs. So first you wax/pluck the hair out to and let it grow out. When you can see if coming out it&#x27;s in andagen phase.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when you do the electrolysis. For me it was two weeks of wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money for it and don&#x27;t want to do this on your own. Go to electrolysis facilities. Forget laser, because it didn&#x27;t work. Only thing it did for me was thinning out my hair&lt;br /&gt;But if you are going for a professional electrolysis. Wax your hair area that is to be treated, wait till it starts showing and get it treated right away for maximum results&lt;br /&gt;They may tell you it doesn&#x27;t matter. I am telling you that it does. Because your hair has the most moisture at that  stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairs are not growing back. So this works./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now came the tedious part. You have to have your hair in andagen phase. So wax in sections. Don&#x27;t wax huge sections.

            <li> This item is not difficult and works well.  A little bit annoying because you have to keep wetting fingers with salt water, but otherwise good and efficient.  I have not used it long enough to know if the hair will return but you can feel it working and then it comes out easily with no scars.  I used it on a few hairs on lip line.  I set it on 4.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Maybe I should have known it wasnt going to work, but I thought that with the low price I would try it anyway. I regret doing that. The whole thing is headed to the electronics recycling center, so they can use the parts for something worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I cant stress enough how time consuming using this is. If you have small children you might as well skip this one. I would never have enough time to treat my whole legs, but I did manage to do a 3x3 area on both legs a little ways above my ankles. 1 year later, Only a few hairs DIDNT grow back. I know i was using it correctly, the hairs would pull right out without a tug at all but most of them did return. It could be because I have dark course hair, but for the amount of time and with little results, this had been in a closet unused for a long time.</li>
            <li> total waste of money.  Hurt like crazy and made no difference at all.</li>
            <li> I used this on several different settings over several sessions, starting at the lowest and working my way up to about medium-high. The lower settings appeared to work at first, but the hair grew right back - and no, not hair in the same area that just hadn&#x27;t grown in at the time of treatment. Hair from the same follicles I treated. I could tell because I had red spots in every treatment location for weeks afterward. I tried higher settings twice, and have experienced no regrowth in those locations. However, I am still scarred five months later from those treatments. I&#x27;m done with this.</li>
            <li> The price for this product made me a little nervous, but compared to the $100-$200 products, it had the best reviews. Is it easy, no. Threading a needle is a piece of cake after this, but once you manage to make contact with the correct hair follicle, this baby does it&#x27;s job. Read the directions thoroughly, and don&#x27;t stray from them. It DOES leave little scars, but they&#x27;ve gone away for me. It&#x27;s been 2 1/2 weeks since first use, and the hairs aren&#x27;t back yet. Which, for me, means they&#x27;re gone. Hurts more in some places than it does for others. The knee area has been the biggest ouch thus far.</li>
            <li> I bought it a year ago and worked on both of my legs once, the hair came back like 40% in one and on the other like 10%. I stopped and now I&#x27;m using it again to finish it. It&#x27;s time consuming and uncomfortable plus you have to use the salty water on your fingers...My advice is try to use a high setting 4 plus depending on your resistance to pain, no pain no gain. Wish it was easier but for this price it doesn&#x27;t get any better but it does work. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s painful and uncomfortable but it worked for me.</li>
            <li> What battery is needed?</li>
            <li> Bought two of these, the needle broke on the first one and replace the battery. I couldn&#x27;t get the second one to turn on at all. I went through 3 sessions, i was left with scars that wouldn&#x27;t fade for months and did not stop growth. I am sure if it was better built I could have achieved results but I feel it doesn&#x27;t stand up to your goals unless you have really good eye sight, steady hands and are prepared to replace the battery. Good for diminishing spier vein appearance just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> As advertised, and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The tip was easily bent in the first use.</li>
            <li> Horrible, useless product. I got electrocuted by this product. Don&#x27;t buy this product!! It  is a waste of time and money. I was too naive and desperate, when I purchased this product. I regret not being wise enough to return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this product years ago...and with a few moves in between.... It got thrown out....and now I am purchasing it again...IT WORKS...does it hurt??? Yes...but what woman&#x27;s product is easy?? None... Anyway, I had started on my bikini area when I had the machine, and til this day it has NOT grown back. As I get older (being from Mediterranean dissent ) I have been getting more and more facial hair. I cannot wait to receive the machine....I&#x27;ll post after I get it and let everyone know how those hairs worked out...</li>
            <li> This is the best product for results. However workmanship is poor. Mine had a short and didn&#x27;t work properly after only a few months. I got a replacement because it works, and may be the only product out there that does work.</li>
            <li> I have used my One Touch to totally clear my toes and I am almost done with my feet.  My toes and feet use to look like Sasquatch, no offense to any Big Foots reading this. Even if I shaved the there would be stubble within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This requires a lot of patients.  I usually just turn on a tv show and use it for 15 - 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t start on your face, practice on other body parts first.  I found my arm hair to be almost too fine for the needle, but once I got the hang of it I could do finer hair as well.</li>
            <li> really works I  not sure but after reading some of the reviews I decide to give a try and I m glad I did  is great easy to use</li>
            <li> Followed directions to a T.  Have also had electrolysis done professionally before (so I know how it works and what to do).  This item didn&#x27;t work at all.  Am trying to return it to the seller now.</li>
            <li> Really hard to insert wire along side hairs because the wire / electrode is spring loaded providing little pressure - will be extremely difficult to use even if it does work.</li>
            <li> So I read the reviews before buying this. They had me a bit worried with the problems people stated about breaking the needles and it not working properly or up to it potential.&lt;br /&gt;Well I have no idea what they were talking about. The item works great!!! There are some things to consider though. First, it IS very detail oriented and time consuming. It&#x27;s one hair at a time and each hair is zapped for about 10 seconds. Second, I bought a magnifying lit visor. I highly recommend this. It makes the work so much easier. Third, take a bath before. It will soften and open your follicles and make it much easier (though it works without this too). Fourth, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all until you apply the electricity which is not bad at all. I use it at the max setting and it stings a bit but it gets the job done. Last, you are going to have tiny scabs when it works. You are killing your hair follicle! Don&#x27;t let that scare you unless you scar easily and badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, love it. I can see why people pay someone else to do this for them as it is slow going. For those of us who can&#x27;t afford it, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I had one a few years ago loved it. It stopped working, thinking a wire or something,  not sure so bought my 2nd one. Yes it does leave little marks at each site you insert the needle but they heal. Depending on how quickly you heal with other scrapes &amp; scratches will determine how fast these heal, I&#x27;m 3-4 days, some by the 2nd day.</li>
            <li> I had this 30 years ago and was expecting a better model. Nothing has changed. It is still a very tedious process and not for overall hair removal. I am using it for stubborn repeats. Still better than the time and expense for professional.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on someone else&#x27;s review, but was a huge mistake.  The test spots I tried did not remove the hair.  There was unexpected pain at the low settings.  It also left scars at these places.  I had been determined to try it again, but the scars didn&#x27;t leave.  I read all of the instructions and followed them to the letter.  Had high hopes, but this product is definitely a let down.</li>
            <li> Tweezers were crap.  It either didnt stop regrowth or boiled my skin so I had red marks for a long time and took forever.  Im going back to epillating.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. The parts come apart very easily and the tips break. Difficult to use. The pulse hurts quite a bit and the &#x27;treated&#x27; hairs didn&#x27;t budge half the time.</li>
            <li> I converted mine to work with any probe holder with a banana plug. I did this because the probe is .004in thick and there are only .004in thick probes available. That is ok if it works for you so the only real improvement I would suggest to the makers is to offer thinner probes. I use the unit with .002in probes but my holder will allow the use of 2 ,3  and 4 probes. Easy to convert with two flush mounted banana sockets mounted on the lettering between the tweezers and the probe holder .There are only two wires inside connect one to each socket  and leave the original probe connected . You can then use it or the probe holder and needle size of your choice. You will need to connect yourself to the + socket . I use a wire with a b/plug on one end and a flat piece of aluminum to sit on !!&lt;br /&gt;A little moisturiser on the plate makes a better connection . Happy Zapping !!</li>
            <li> I have had electroylsis done by a professional so I thought it would be easier to do it at home and cost effective so ordered this, however I was so disappointed. The needle is so thin, its more like a thin wire rather than a needle. I tried first at medium setting but couldn&#x27;t feel anything, than raised to highest setting still felt nothing, the hair should have easily come out if I pulled with twizer but it was still tough meaning it does not work. It&#x27;s not worthiy you are better off going to a professional, this is just waste of money.</li>
            <li> so far this is good  but the tip is very small and needs to go into the pore to work well.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, looked like it was suppose to. When you put the battery in and turn it on there is a very annoying beep that stays on the whole time. I followed the directions on my bikini line and found it pretty easy to use, I used it on the number 5 setting. I didn&#x27;t think it hurt at all but it did tingled in some spots but nothing painful or more than slightly annoying. it seemed to work like it was suppose it, after the hair was removed (the tweezers they provide are horrible by the way and you should def have a good pair of your own) the area turned red and raised, almost like a mosquitoe bite, I removed about 35 hairs total, applied witch hazel to the area. the next day I had little red scabs over the hairs I removed, but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much if it ment having the hair gone forever. They scabs stayed for about a week, the skin was slightly discolored for an additional week after the scabs came off. I thought it had worked cause the area I did stayed hair free for about 3 weeks total. But than every one grew back except maybe 2 out of the 35. If this product worked it would be worth the scabs and everything to have a good end result, but it didn&#x27;t work for me and I work be trying it a second time.</li>
            <li> Ok, this product does really work. It is a little tricky to use, but I got the hang of it. I have really thick, dark hair and have always been kind of obsessed with hair removal. I knew this would be time consuming to use on my legs, but figured I could do it over time. It is time consuming, but it really works. A couple years after I treated an area of my leg, no hair has grown back. I am really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the problem. It&#x27;s not just time consuming, it&#x27;s difficult to do on youself. You have to be able to stick the needle into the hair follicle at the angle of the hair. And you have to be able to see the skin closely. I could do it on the front of my leg over the shin, but for other areas I couldn&#x27;t contort myself into a position that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating this product highly because it does actually do what it&#x27;s supposed to and does it really well. But not 5 stars because it is not practical to use, even for someone very determined. But, if you want to treat an area that is easy to reach, or if you have someone who is willing to spend hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours (get it? It takes a LONG time) doing it for you, go for it. It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and yes it does leave those red dots. For me, it took the red dots about 3 months to go away. I got really scared after awhile they would scar, but in the end they didn&#x27;t. Anyway, plan accordingly if you&#x27;re going to use this treatment.</li>
            <li> Caused my skin to break out and I looked wicked crazy... Garbage... I thought maybe this would help my hair problem but nope...</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to use. I can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s designed to be used by yourself on yourself. Just too difficult.</li>
            <li> This item broke after only two uses. I did not store it with the battery inside, as it was recommended by other reviewers not to do so. Does it work when it &#x27;works&#x27;? Absolutely. Is the quality poor when it breaks after only two uses? Absolutely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see its working. I don&#x27;t like how it leaves temporary scars and its somewhat complicated. Maybe I haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> Wow, this thing makes a noise that scared the daylights out of us.  This is something I felt should be explained in the instructions.  Have yet to remove one hair with it, as we tried it for hours with no avail.  There is a learning curve, it is time consuming, tedious but I am still hoping it is worth it once we get the hang of it.  Oh yes, it hurts like hell!</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with sensitive skin and very thick facial hairs, on certain areas of my face I get irritation/shaving bumps very easily so I decided to permanently remove the hairs in those areas with electrolysis.  Were I not a redhead, I probably would have just done laser hair removal since it is much cheaper and faster than professional electrolysis (laser does not work on red hair due to different type of pigment than other hair colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend using this machine to remove thinner hairs where the follicles are hard to see, ie arm or leg hairs.  It is better suited for thicker hairs such as pubic areas or male facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to successfully use this device you will need a good lighted magnifying mirror, I would recommend a 7x mirror as it gives good magnification and allows you to see clearly and in focus without getting too close to the mirror.  On 10x/15x mirrors you have to get so close that you may end up bumping the electrode and/or your tweezers against the mirror.  I would also highly recommend a good pair of needle/point tip tweezers such as tweezerman, these make it much easier to pinpoint and grab a single hair compared with the tweezers included in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have those two items all you need is to follow the directions and practice.  When I first started using the machine it took me about an hour to remove 15 hairs and about 10 of them failed (you can tell if it works because the hair will just slide out of the follicle with no resistance).  After practicing for a while, I can now remove about 90 hairs per hour and very rarely have a failure.  To some extent how fast you can go will depend on what area you are using it as well as how sensitive your skin is or how robust your hair follicles are.  If you crank up the voltage you can zap them faster but it will hurt more and the chances of scarring are much higher, so it is best to stick with as low a voltage as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**As it says in the manual DO NOT stretch the skin while the electrode is on, this will make it much more susceptible to scarring/pitting.  It is however ok to stretch the skin to insert the electrode while it is not active, then complete the circuit after releasing the skin, in many areas this will make it much easier to insert the electrode correctly into the follicle at the right angle.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine is not easy to use, it takes a steady hand and a lot of practice; however, for $70-80 (cost of this unit + a good lighted mirror and tweezers) plus around 60 hours of my time, I was able to remove a large section of my facial hair which was estimated to cost $5000 or more by a professional electrolysis technician.  Also I was able to do it in a faster amount of time than professional electrolysis and on my own schedule.  (The total hours of electrolysis would have been less using a professional, probably 35-40 hours; however, the overall process would have taken longer since I would have had to space my treatments out into weekly or bi-weekly sessions)ys in the manual DO NOT stretch the skin while the electrode is on, this will make it much more susceptible to scarring/pitting.

            <li> After a year of electrolysis, I thought this would save me some money and let me stretch my appointments out longer. Machine didn&#x27;t work out of the box. Promptly returned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to use this product but I can&#x27;t seem to figure out the technique of it. I haven&#x27;t heard the machine beep yet and I was wondering if anyone could give me some tips to help me out!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. It damaged my skin in ways that will take months to heal and it didn&#x27;t even remove the hair. Go to a professional. There are reasons you need to be licensed to practice electrolysis.</li>
            <li> This device should be taken off the market.  The directions do not explain how you should use.  Please do not waste your time or money.  You are better off investing in the Me Smooth at home laser device.</li>
            <li> I have read pretty much all of the reviews about this little machine and was skeptical, but purchased anyway. So glad I did!! If you have been to a professiobnal electrolysis then should know that it is a tedious time consuming process regardless. The ability to have a machine that is capable of doing the same thing at home that actually works is priceless. Yes it is time consuming, but worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  The stylist bends and the electrolysis doesn&#x27;t work well at all!  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these. The 1st worked for about 2 uses then quit. I ordered another hoping it was a fluke and would last longer. But the 2nd didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> TO COMPLICATE IT TO USED AND PAINFUL.  DID NOT WORK FOR ME.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, and I made a video on how it works. This os one of few that is recommended on TS Roadmap.</li>
            <li> Not user friendly.  Very tedious and not usable.</li>
            <li> Burned my skin even though I followed directions very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;Probe broke when trying to put it into pen only plus side is the extra probe on that end....but broke for same reason again.</li>
            <li> This is too time consuming and causes sores which take forever to heal. These sores also tend to scar. And, the hair that I really wanted this for, all keep growing back!</li>
            <li> Good idea, bad construction.  Product is too difficult to use, time consuming and ineffective.  Purchase an epilator system (works wonders)until you have the time or money to get professional electrolysis.</li>
            <li> I tried to give all reviews a look-see but found that the ones who were complaining were dead on spot. The cord is short you have to literally keep it a foot near you.... the salt water does not help conduct electricity.  I turned mine up to 10 (max) and still barely felt any zing... you are electricuting your hair folicles... you should be feeling the sting.  I literally returned mine the next day.  PS was great hassle-free return.... UPS came to me and got it at no charge.</li>
            <li> IT was everything and more.My wife bought this model years ago in europe for much more money. I bought for her as a gift and loves it.THanks amazon for the easy purchase and the best value.</li>
            <li> This is a simple do it yourself product that is a bit tricky but be patient and you will figure it out.You will need to get a tweezers and dont bother with the one they give you. After 5 uses it just stopped working. That was disappointing. I sent an email for a replacement as it says there is a warranty. Hopefully I will just get another one and keep on going with it.</li>
            <li> This little unit works very well for a little while...then its flimsy construction reveals itself. I&#x27;ve tried three, and every one has simply stops working. The problem seems to be the slipshod way the wiring inside. If you plan to remove a lot of hair, you&#x27;d better plan on buying a new one every month!</li>
            <li> After spending over a year paying for electrolysis sessions, I decided to buy this product.  It works well and I have no complaints.  A word of warning for those who are used to paying for electrolysis treatments:  the follicle usually does not come out immediately after you&#x27;ve zapped it, it&#x27;s necessary to wait about a half hour or so.  I didn&#x27;t realize this and kept zapping, leaving myself with darker marks than necessary.  Considering that electrolysis is the only form of permanent hair removal, it&#x27;s definitely worth the time. It&#x27;s almost always a slow process that requires many, many treatments.  In my opinion this product gives excellent results at a good price.  I also bought the tea tree oil ointment recommended by other reviewers to use on treated areas.</li>
            <li> This is a very cheaply made product, which is why I&#x27;m not very surprised that the one I received did not operate at all. I even went so far as to replace the battery that was included with a brand new one to make sure that the problem was not a dead battery. Still nothing which I chalk up to the cheapness of the product and poorly made connectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, electrolysis is still the best and quickest way for permenant hair removal, Guess I&#x27;ll just have to stick with a salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy I bought this because I have a rat tail on the back of my neck that I don&#x27;t like. I tried it on my leg to feel if this was painful or not. So when I inserted it into my pour it zapped the hair folacule but i jumped cause of the shock it hurts but worth the hair removal... By the way it&#x27;s only permanent if you do it to the hair folacule 5 to 8 times</li>
            <li> been using about a month now.  I read all the other reviews before purchasing.  Does have a beep while zapping..no big deal to me.  Can really sting in some spots and barely tingles in other spots.  One reviewer commented that the tip bends easily.. it does, another said the tip is too short.. I have the same problem.  Many of my problem hairs are fairly deep and the tip does not get down deep enough.  Does require some practice to insert along the hair follicle.  Works great on the light hairs on my lip that LASER did not zap. If you have near vision you will have no problems.  Far sighted folks will need magnifying mirrors to accurately identify hair folicle.    I like how portable it is and that it is battery operated. I see a new hair I zap it and move on.  Very convienent.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work just like the directions say it will.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is what I expected of a $30.00 machine. As others have commented, the tweezers that come with the kit are no good, so I use my own tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;Actually performing the treatment is very time consuming, and a tad painful. However I have not experienced anything abnormal. Reading the directions a few times before I started and testing on my arm a few hairs really helped. I strongly recommend reading everything carefully before beginning.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it for a month at the moment, so I can&#x27;t attest to the longevity of the treatment. However I have noticed a decrease in my facial hair re-growth, so I have high hopes for the future.&lt;br /&gt;In regards to any effects of the treatment, I too have found that I get sore red spots, they usually last 2-5days depending on my care regimen.  As I live abroad and don&#x27;t have access to &amp;#34;witch hazel&amp;#34; I use regular rubbing alcohol and to assist healing, I use a small amount of Neosporin that I bought a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I have given the product a 4 star review since the tweezers are not good, and because I am still not 100% convinced of the lasting effects.&lt;br /&gt;At this point I recommend this product as an alternative to professional electrolysis, if you are not able to find or afford it.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very very time consuming and mildly difficult process to do on your own.</li>
            <li> I tried this product three times. The first time i turned the dial to 4 and did my chin... but the hair was back within a week.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it again with the dial on 7... it was a bit painful but I went through it anyways. Same thing, the next week hair was back.  I tried it AGAIN at the highest setting and it didn&#x27;t work, it just scarred my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is junk!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all.. I mean, this was broken so I don&#x27;t know if it works soooooo, I&#x27;m still hairy.</li>
            <li> I needed to buy a magnifier to see the hair follicles. I tried to remove 5 hair near my ankle as a test, and I had red spots probably due to higher strength than it&#x27;s supposed to use. I tried at level 3 out of 10 strength. But the red spots gradually fade away and gone one month later, and no regrowth. I didn&#x27;t have such red spot from the professional treatment. It was slightly more painful than my professional treatment. The probe/needle tip is really tiny so it bends easily. The tweezer that came in with it doesn&#x27;t work. So I had to use my own tweezer. But this is a lot cheaper although it takes time, and practice.</li>
            <li> This device works, but make sure you pay attention to the directions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, the other reviews are true- this unit is sort-of cheaply made; the stylet tips will bend if you are not careful with them; and yes, using this can hurt. However, no pain, no gain, I figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to not treat a hair follicle more than once or twice, even if the hair still won&#x27;t come out easily. If you keep trying to treat the follicle more times or for longer times, you will get scars like I did. I fully realize this is my own fault, since I disregarded the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I have purchased a topical numbing solution. It&#x27;s Dermine or lidocaine. I am hoping this will make doing the treatment less painful. I am also thinking that getting some sort of magnifying glass would be helpful, since it can be hard to see hairs sometimes.</li>
            <li> Its hard to use by yourself</li>
            <li> Looked to painful to use</li>
            <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking. &amp;#34;Those people who gave the one star reviews were just lazy!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;I can actually do this!&amp;#34; I thought so, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electrolysis set is freaking impossible to use. It&#x27;s painful to boot. I religiously used it multiple times a week for two months and all I was able to noticeably do was clear a tiny, tiny, tiny spot. It is not worth it. It&#x27;s also annoying as heck as every time you connect the current it screeches to let you know that it&#x27;s working. Plus it&#x27;s impossible to put the needle in your pore, hold it in place, and then turn the dial with only two hands. If you have the dial on while you do this you&#x27;ll burn the skin upon entry into the pore. And forget about having sex while using this, because the bumps it gives you looks like an STD and lasts around 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would NOT recommend this product, and please do not be tempted by the unrealistic promises...</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work.  It creates a red scab on the hair follicle that stays for over a week and then the hair grows back.  I&#x27;ve given it many chances.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 months now and I am extremely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to anyone considering this product is save the money and make the time to see a professional electrolysis first. That way you can see the following: how to conduct the procedure, how much it hurts, how long a session takes, and how long it takes for you to heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been going to an electrolysis for years, so many of the complaints that people have in other reviews did not come across as challenges or surprises when I decided to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are not committed to spend an hour or two, for 2-4 times per month, this is not a product for you. You have to be dedicated in order to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about my experience...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my chest, sideburns, neck, chin, and stomach. I still go to a professional here and there to get those really fine hairs that I have difficulty getting or if I want to start on a new area of my body. If you are using the electrolysis for the first time on an area it WILL take a long time and you have to be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you want to use this product for your chin/neck area (like myself) it is extremely difficult (but not impossible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Semi-cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The needle is small. So, super thick hairs may be a challenge and will need more catering to as you use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers that come with it suck. Have your own handy.</li>
            <li> Used it &amp; reused it, on Eyebrows. Gave it a good try. Did not work at all for me. Hair kept coming back. I have since gone to a professional, which is expensive but I have achieved the results I was hoping for.  This product was a complete waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This thing takes FOREVER to use, and it hurts like a beast. It left little scabs that healed in about a week but after about a month the hair grew back. Did I mention that it is painful? Good luck but it takes 15-20 seconds per hair folicle. Now, that may not sound like too long but imagine doing it for an hour and only covering one square inch. It is just not for me.</li>
            <li> Saves me a lot of molney by using this instead of going to have electrolysis at a spa.</li>
            <li> Had to return to vendor.  Worked fine the first time used to remove about 3-5 hairs from my upper lip.  After three months, new growth appeared (very fine hair) so wanted to zap them.  Unfortunately, the kit would not work when I tried to use it.  Tried several times and even changed the battery.  Still could not get it to activate.  This is unfortunate, because it really worked the first time.  The new growth were new hair folicles.  The first hairs that I electrolysized did not grow back.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Works as stated. Great value for money, much better than spending loads on laser. I find this device more convenient to use than to go to technicians who drag out the process for extorting money. Once you get the hang of it (which is in an hour or two), using the device becomes very easy. There has been absolutely no scarring. I am happy with this device. Also, my device had no beeping and is quiet. I don&#x27;t feel any pain either, an occasional sting but even that is barely noticeable. I am giving it a 5 star because I think this is well worth the price and also works. For those who opt for laser, I think you have to understand that laser isn&#x27;t permanent removal. It grows back. If you are looking for a permanent option electrolysis is your best bet so far.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 2 stars because maybe I did it wrong.  It did not work for me after several treatments.  I had done a lot if research, so I can&#x27;t imagine I was too far off, but I&#x27;m not a trained professional either.  I will say that if you can get it to work for you, it is cheap...what you don&#x27;t pay for financially though may cost you in time and sanity!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit with the high hopes of saving both time and and money in visits to a professional electrologist. But, like some of the other reviewers here, my efforts ended in scarring and disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a neurosurgeon&#x27;s steady hands and eagle sharp eyes, then perhaps this product will work for you. I have average steady hands and used a lighted 10x magnifying mirror for my average eyesight (I do not normally need glasses for close up work). Yet, I still had a major struggle getting the tiny needle to pierce correctly in the hair shaft, while holding the wand perfectly still for long enough to zap the hair root. I used &#x27;Emla&#x27; (a topical numbing cream) so the pain wasn&#x27;t too bad, and held the needle in for the prescribed length of time. I saw white stuff bubble out of the hair shaft, which according to the instructions is OK to see, though in my final analysis this meant I had caused scarring damage to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aftermath of my escapade I was left with scarring from the needle, which in turn lead to in grown hairs, which then caused a major cystic acne breakout and still more scarring! Oh, and in the end up every single hair grew back - as big and as bold as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star for my personal disastrous experience; 2 stars to take into account my user error and the fact that this machine may well work for some out there - but please use with extreme caution!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.. Go professional.</li>
            <li> Thick dark hair requires you to damage and scar your skin...</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as good as the one I had a while back that finally broke.</li>
            <li> I throw it out cause it takes forever, it hurst like hell and it didnt work for me. it took me a lot of time to figure out how it works too.</li>
            <li> absolutely useless product...&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;I hate it, and don&#x27;t recommend to any one to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;be smart, and save your money!!!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this product so I was not surprised by anything. It does what it says it will do. Just be prepared to do this for a long time if you have a lot of unwanted hair. Make sure to also have some kind of healing ointment. I have very thick coarse unwanted hair so while it is taking me some time to go by sections, I am seeing some results. It&#x27;s the same as going to a professional, it takes many expensive visits. The beep is not that loud and doesn&#x27;t bother me. The pain is somewhat intense depending on your tolerance but its not worse than waxing. The 1st time was rather awkward but once I got the hang of it, it&#x27;s way faster. Overall for this price I am very satisfied and saved more than $300 I would have spent on the Tria or going to professionals.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 2 years now every few months HOPING for it to work and it never does. It&#x27;s a scam and a complete waste of money and I have used it properly too many times for there to be NO RESULTS.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve got with this is a few blisters. It is money down the drain and a risk for your skin. This kind of depilation concerns specialists.</li>
            <li> It really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have commented, the tips can break or bend easily. With care you can get many uses out of each tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re going to need patience in order to have success with this product. I recommend buying two extra sets of tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend buying the Tea Tree antiseptic cream.</li>
            <li> Does NOT work.  I used it numerous times and my chin hairs keep coming back!</li>
            <li> Warning: Do NOT share this product with anyone else...unless you want Hepatitis or HIV.  You are inserting a flexible needle into your skin.  Don&#x27;t be stupid.  Clean the needle with peroxide and alcohol after use to prevent infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not endorsing this product for the removal of lots of hair.  It&#x27;s painful and tedious.  This product is terrific for the removal of ingrown hairs. If you have a problem hair that won&#x27;t come out, or keeps growing back, get this.  You will basically pierce your skin with the burning tip and electrocute the follicle.  If you scar easily, be extra careful.  The device is burning a tiny hole in your skin, complete with bubbling (sizzling) white ooze.  Yeah, it&#x27;s cooking your skin into liquid with the power of a mere 9 volt battery.  If you have fillings in your teeth, you will feel the electrical current, and it will heat your fillings; you will taste metal.  Overdoing it means you will hurt yourself.  I overdid it once on a particularly old &amp; stubborn ingrown hair\abcess on my chin.  It left a bump scar that took a year to be all but gone.  However, I&#x27;m a guy who usually sports stubble, so it didn&#x27;t really show on my chin after the scab fell off.  Afterward, apply Kalo post-epilating lotion (another product on Amazon) to the affected area.  It will be soothing and reduce the likelihood of the hair growing back (or at least it will grow back thinner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you ever get stubborn zits that you just can&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;core&amp;#34; out?  Don&#x27;t destroy your face with squeezing.  Zap that zit with this mean sucker.  Then squeeze it out with a comedone extractor (also available on Amazon).  Most acne is follicular.  This device basically electrocutes\kills the hair follicle.  When it&#x27;s dead, the tissue is no longer &amp;#34;holding on&amp;#34;.  Therefore you can just blow it right out.  That means less pushing\squeezing, minimizing the chance of bruising or breaking blood vessels in the surrounding skin.  Clean your wound with peroxide and alcohol. Done and done.  That zit isn&#x27;t getting infected again because you got it all out.  Woo-hoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. This product is flimsy.  I&#x27;m on my third one.  (think about 1 per year depending on your frequency of use).  The cord will bend and eventually tear, where it meets the plastic base of the needle holder wand.  I&#x27;ve disassembled this part of the device and repaired the cord with electrical tape, but it&#x27;s VERY difficult to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.&lt;br /&gt;2. This product only comes with 2 stylet tips (the flexible needle).  You WILL bend or break the proprietary flexible needle tips.  It&#x27;s so easy to do.  Vendors on Amazon sell replacements, but sometimes they are severely bent from factory packaging or the shipping process.  Once these needles are severely bent, they are useless.  Amazon accepted my return, but it was still a disappointing pain in the butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProTip: Generic Visine (red eye remover) helps slightly reduce redness and swelling.  You&#x27;ll need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations, you&#x27;re now an amateur surgeon. ;)&lt;br /&gt;Be careful.</li>
            <li> Imagine trying to thread a needle with a very very small hole. Now that would be easy compared to what you have to do with this. After sanitizing the equipment and area to be treated, have to try to insert a thread size filament into the hair follicle at a very specific angle while holding the existing hair with tweezers (use your own, the supplied tweezers are garbage). You finally get it JUST right, and your standing there in front of a magnifying mirror and you wait for a tingle. Nothing happens. You rewet your fingertips (they have to be moist with salt water) while trying to not lose your perfectly placed electrolysis filament.. And finally get a tingle. It starts to hurt.. 15 seconds of expected pain are finally over, so you gently tug the hair. You tug harder (it should just slide out) Finally you just pluck it out. It didn&#x27;t work on that hair this time. The directions say you can repeat once, but the spot is red, angry looking, and leaking serous (clear) fluid as your body&#x27;s response to the abuse so you leave it alone and move on. You repeat this on 15 hairs, taking about an hour total. 3 of them actually slid out as they should. All of the follicles are red, angry looking, and oozing clear fluid. The next day, you have developed small pimples in the treated areas. A week later they grow back hairs. I&#x27;m going to stick to my Remington laser i bought on amazon for large areas, and continue waxing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Instructions were not overly clear or helpful. Overall, the prodct did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I haven&#x27;t used too much yet, but it works well and doesn&#x27;t hurt. Good deal.</li>
            <li> This particular item doesn&#x27;t work. I have replaced the battery and there&#x27;s a problem with the connection or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago, I had this exact same product and it did work. I would feel the tingling when the tip entered the pore and white liquid would exit the pore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that was delivered to me doesn&#x27;t do anything. I should have returned it when I purchased it 5 months ago, but I thought that if I just kept working with it, it would start working. Now I am out 30 bucks!!! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to electrolysis. I&#x27;ve been going to a professional electrolysis for some years; however, every now and then I cannot get an appointment and just want to remove a few stray hairs. This product works great for little touch ups and to remove hairs in between my appointments (as you should never pluck or shave areas that you are treating with electrolysis). I found this product pretty easy to use. I was also surprised at the strength of the current that came out of the needle; the highest I ever needed to use was five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is not a product you would use on large areas as it would be very labour intensive. Nor do I think it can replace a professional electrolysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you do purchase this product to use on your face you should also purchase a magnifying cosmetic mirror, if you don&#x27;t already have one. It can be quite difficult to see the hair follicles without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a really good product.</li>
            <li> cool and easy to use....</li>
            <li> Terrible, terrible product. I know, I know-- I read the reviews before I bought it. I guess I was just trying to save money, but I should&#x27;ve just bit the bullet and gone to an electrologist. I used this thing once, and it did work that first time. I broke out with a huge zit on every hair follicle where I used it. I was very red and bumpy. But it healed and my skin looked normal within a few days. So I thought I&#x27;d give it another try. The second time, I couldn&#x27;t get it to work at all. I did everything just as I had the first time, following the instructions to a T, but no luck. This thing is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I gave this product two weeks and it actually works.  Many of the reviews are accurate on how time consuming it is.  Each hair has to be individually zapped and it takes awhile.  I do about 10 to 20 hairs every 3 or 4 days.  If your skeptical its okay, I was very skeptical but after trying it I would recommend it as a cheap alternative to laser or salon electrolysis. I have honestly tried them all.....</li>
            <li> Looks very well really clean and easy. Tips are perfect size for face little hair. Control digital would be best.</li>
            <li> QUITE uncomfortable.  So much so that I cannot keep it in the follicle long enough to do its thing.  I &#x27;m quite sure it works, but frankly, I&#x27;d need to be near comatose to not feel the pain.  It is VERY difficult to use as a beginner.  You ABSOLUTELY will need EXCELLENT EYES, a STEADY HAND, a GOOD zoom mirror, and good lighting.  I wanted it to remove errant hairs outside my beard line.  Thought this would be a piece of cake.... I was W R O N G.  What an AWESOME torture device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I think it CAN and will do the job it is designed to do, IF you can stand the pain.</li>
            <li> I used it 2 weeks ago so I can&#x27;t give a verdict yet about the result.......But this HURTS.  REALLY HURTS.  I can tolerate  a pain quite well but this one........  And each time I have to wet my fingers with a salt water is a little pain.  This machine created scars and it made me really nervous but  by now it looks that they are disappeared.</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and it worked fine.  I gave it to a friend.  I realized I needed it and searched for one and found it.  I ordered it and tried it out-not a single pulse of anything.  What a piece of junk.  Not built like my old one.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> this is painful and does not work and they wouldn&#x27;t let me return it. NO ONE SHOULD BUY THIS EVER!</li>
            <li> A little painful but very effective!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because &amp;#34;happy wife happy life&amp;#34; and she used it for about 3 days and it caused terrible...and i mean terribly awful scabs on her face, it ended up scarring which she had to fix with vitamin E oil. It was hard for her to use and you have to dip your hand in water or something to make it work, and even with those instructions it only works about half the time. Go with the Remington, the money savings are NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought I had found the perfect solution for permanent hair removal at home. While it is time consuming and mildly painful,this unit has seen a lot of use in my house. Recently, all the stylet tips we&#x27;ve received have been too short to be useful. Previously they were consistently an appropriate length. Because of this change to the stylets, I have been unable to continue using the machine. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this device, be forewarned that you may never be able to buy replacement tips that work for it, and it might also come with tips that are too short to work. I don&#x27;t know if this was a permanent change on the part of the manufacturer, but I am not the only person who has had this problem (check the reviews on the stylet tips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit receives four stars (I had to modify it for it to work), but the new tips receive zero stars as I cannot use them at all.</li>
            <li> it broke on me the same day I got. if you need facial hair removed please go see a professional and not this piece of junk</li>
            <li> it is not like the old ones and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I have bought this machine twice now. There are a couple tips you need to know to use it. If you use it correctly, it will work! First, buy a hands-free magnifying glass that you can wear on your head. This will make it so much easier to see the exact spot where your hair grows out of your skin. Also, buy more of the needle tips. They bend easily and this makes them difficult to use. Once you have all of these things, start with the machine on low and then work your way up until you find the right power setting. If you crank the machine up to 10, you may find yourself with a scab. Their way to know that you&#x27;ve gotten the hair permanently removed is you will see a small amount of white, bubbling fluid around the follicle. When you pull the hair out,there should be no resistance, and you should see the follicle at the end of the hair. If you see that, the hair is gone. Keep in mind there are six cycles of hair growth. So if another hair grows back, it doesn&#x27;t mean you failed, it means you need to continue going through all of your hair growth cycles. This machine is great for blondes whose hair is too late to be captured by laser removal systems (like mine).</li>
            <li> I was very impress with the at home electrolysis.  I used it for the first I set the control on 1 which is the lowest did not feel nothing  I then set it on 7 which I felt something I was able to deal that setting  but think I could have went higher.  I rate this device high due to that I have had professional treatment. Actually 5 treatment which I realize I was getting beat out of my money which I was paying her $50.00 a session.  I figure after 5 treatment with little facial hair I shouldn&#x27;t have any hair.  I believe she was not inserting the needle inside the skin.  She Just created more facial hair.  The Machine work well as long as you use salt water</li>
            <li> I bought the older version of this many years ago.  This does what its supposed to do.  People with complaints have them only because they are complaining about electrolysis issues, not issues with this machine.  You will have the same issues seeing a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done lots of laser hair removal, and that only works on dark hairs, and is not long term and is very expensive.  I also have been epillating for years, and that takes a huge amount of time and creates ingrown hairs and is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all electrolysis, this works by killing the hair follicle.  That creates a scab that takes about 4 days to go away.  And you can only treat one hair at a time, so it takes a long time and doing your legs is NOT feasible.  I find I need to zap the hair twice before tweezing it out.  Possibly because I dont want to risk it not working and me having to redo that hair later.  I use setting 6.  Usually you can hear popping sounds (very faint), which I take to mean its frying things (I could be wrong).  Lots of the time a tiny white fluid comes out of the follicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any random hairs, this is the perfect solution.  I bought it for a few stray hairs, didn&#x27;t touch it for years, and started using it again.  I am now attempting to do my whole bikini line, which will take a long time because there are a lot of hairs, but eventually will be permanent.  I am considering doing my armpits, but its hard to reach/see that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any scars.  If you have scaring it is probably because your setting is too high.  Your skin should be dry.  Your fingers should be moist but not dripping wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find upper lip is a little painful.  Chin I cant feel it at all.  Other areas sometimes I can feel it a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say dont do moles or nipple hairs.  Thats not true.  Nipple hairs are fine.  Mole hairs are fine IF you have had the mole for a long time and it has not changed.  The risk with moles is that if it is cancerous, you may not know the cancer is growing because electrolysis can change the appearance of the mole (usually makes it smaller and flatter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  my instructions do not say to use salt water, so i always used plain water.  i tried salt water and it is PAINFUL and causes way more damage to the skin.  i found no increase in effectiveness, so dont use salt water!!!  also, if you use alcohol or peroxide after to clean, i find it makes more inflamation and scabs and takes much longer to heal.  no cleaning after makes it take about a week to heal.  but if you spray colloidal silver on the area after treatment there is much less redness, little or no scabbing, and its healed in 3 days.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but very tedious to use since one has to pluck a strand of hair one at a time. It has  potential to leave scars on the spots treated. I can&#x27;t stress the importance of a magnifying mirror and aloe application to the treated sites enough. You will get bumps and possible scars, if you don&#x27;t get the hair at its root and in its growth direction. Hence, the magnifying mirror and aloe(natural) to apply after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;My first time using this product, I was able to treat a larger portion of my chin, but was left with bumps and scars that are now disappearing with home treatment. 1. A mix of honey, sugar, and lemon 2.Aloe application in its natural form.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to follow the instructions on the manual as stated, especially the salt water mixture that is required for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;All in all efficient product but tedious and tiring</li>
            <li> Time consuming but works great</li>
            <li> Idk if it&#x27;s working or no</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well this works, and we&#x27;re even using a low setting; 3.  At first, it seemed impossible to get the tiny stylist into the seemingly even tinier pore, but once we setup bright lighting and I used a magnifying glass, I was then able to easily target the pores.  Most hairs slipped out with hardly a tug, after one 15-second treatment, but just a few (courser hairs) needed a second dose.</li>
            <li> This did not work at all! Do not waste your money trust me it&#x27;s a scam.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has so many good reviews.  I&#x27;m glad it works for other people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Maybe the needle is too short, because I never felt any tingling sensation like you&#x27;re supposed to feel when it contacts the root.  I pulled out a couple of chin hairs and compared it to the needle and the needle seemed too short compared to the part of the hair that was under the skin. Oh well, whatever . . . I&#x27;m off to see a pro.</li>
            <li> My mother purchased this sometime in the mid-80&#x27;s and I found it when I was around 11 or 12 after it had sat in a closet unused for a while.  I proceeded to use it on my legs and 25 years later, the hair has never grown back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The needles definitely are very fine (would you really want them anything else considering they go into your hair follicles??) and can bend easily - but they do make replacements.  I actually would recommend buying a couple replacements along with this machine.  Even bent, though, the machine still works.  And in some cases, if it&#x27;s bent ever so slightly, I find that it almost makes it easier to get it into the follicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review that mentioned something about salt water with one hand while using the machine - which I found a tiny bit confusing.  To use it you moisten the tips of the fingers that are holding the needle, tap it to the metal pad to make sure there&#x27;s enough moisture on your hands as it will emit a high-pitched sound when you do (I really don&#x27;t do this part anymore as I know relatively how wet they need to be), and insert it into your follicle.  When you&#x27;ve hit paydirt (in this case the root of the hair) you should hear the same high-pitched sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have a few different options for the whole &amp;#34;pain level&amp;#34; thing.  First of all - it really is not very uncomfortable at all with the exception of hairs found near your bones.  The closer to the bone, the closer to a nerve and the more likely it&#x27;s going to hurt more (right over the shin bone or your eyebrow area was what I found to be the worst).  But even then the pain isn&#x27;t *that* bad.  To temper it you can leave the setting down around a 5 or so and just allow the needle to go through a couple of cycles - usually 3 if I leave it at this level - and then the hair should pull out.  If you&#x27;d rather it be done quicker, turn the dial up to 10 and in about a cycle and a half the hair should be good to come out.  And by cycle I mean, the soundI mentioned sort of stops after a couple seconds and then will start right back up again if you&#x27;re still in the follicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the white discharge everyone is worried about?  It&#x27;s the keratin buildup within your hair follicle (keratin is hair protein) and completely harmless.  Anyone with keratinosis will be intimately familiar with what it looks like and it&#x27;s not something to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had the machine leave a pock, damage my skin, or do any other harm.  If and when mine dies, I will probably buy another one.  It&#x27;s time consuming and tedius work, but it&#x27;s a heck of a lot cheaper than having someone at a spa do it! (which is still time consuming ;) )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 58-year-old guy. And for the past ten years I&#x27;ve been annoyed by a half dozen coarse, stray hairs which insist to grow in odd places along my ear lobes. It isn&#x27;t so much vanity as that they just feel wrong. They&#x27;re an annoyance. Tired of plucking them out, I decided to root them out for once and all. As the cost was under $30 I gave this device a try. Bit of a bother, and you need really good eyesight (which I still have), but it does seem to have worked.</li>
            <li> I have only had a few chances to use the device so this review is based on initial impressions.  i will update my review at a later time and I encourage constructive feedback on usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance: looks very 70ish in appearance and color schemes.  a 9 volt battery is included.  I bought this to us on my facial hair (bear/,mustache area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used an electrolysis device before this one or even saw one prior to this order. I somehow had the impression electrolysis units were like the electronic tweezers which as i understand are unproven hair removal systems and a waste of money.  electrolysis requires a probe be inserted into the hair follicle to zap [kill] the hair follicle.  The probe as you might expect is very thin.  I had to use my reading glasses to really see what i was doing, a magnifying mirror would probably help, having second person such as a spouse do it would be much easier. The control knob doesn&#x27;t seem to work although i haven&#x27;t really set it beyond level 4 on a scale of 10, when set to 0 it still sends electrical current to the probe. so far i have not had not been successful in removing any hairs.  the electrical current is very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing not mentioned in description is use of salt water.  not a big deal but worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in hindsight i wish i had waited and picked up a laser hair removal system which i may do later, they start around $300.00 on amazon.  Laser hair removal system do not kill the hair follicle, they just put it to sleep.  electrolysis is the only [FDA approved] way to  kill the follicle and guarantee no regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this review helps you make a decision thats right for you</li>
            <li> The product is about what I expected.  The only thing is that there isn&#x27;t enough power.  I spend a lot time per hair and then sometimes it doesn&#x27;t come out.  I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month and I need to check the battery.  Maybe if I put in a new one it will work better.</li>
            <li> It was quite painful to use and it did  not show any results. It is also nearly impossible to get the flimsy little needle into a hair follicle. It was a lot of work for not a lot of result...</li>
            <li> I bought this for hair under my belly button. It does not work. It&#x27;s nowhere near professional quality and, frankly, it&#x27;s a waste of money. I will stick with going locally until I decide on something else to try for home use.</li>
            <li> this product has just two people that are available to help you.  No where in the instructions does it say to take the battery out, remove the plastic cover and connect the battery.  One just thinks it is ready to go---it&#x27;s not.  Then, the tip bends way too easy---leaves small scabs in order to get the hairs out.  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is for anyone that wants to be smooth and clean of body hair. It takes a while to achieve results but it is well worth it. Once you do it you no longer need to redo it. It is for the porn stars or the regular person.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Too hard to use.  Stick with professional service</li>
            <li> worked alright if you don&#x27;t mind the electric you feel when using it. and takes a very long time to do.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. You have to be careful about the usage andl not to burn your skin. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Eh im sure itd work if I had the patience to do this but itd take me a lifetime. And you have to at least treat the hairs for two sessions or more. The sores it leaves also just arent worth it.</li>
            <li> No button or switch to actually engage the electrical current. You have to WET your fingers for it to work. Terrible mechanical design there. Would of been alot better if the needle was actually a needle. It&#x27;s more like a guitar string, which bends easily and is SPRING LOADED. wtf. You go to poke the pore and the &amp;#34;needle&amp;#34; just pushes back into the pen. Whos the idiot that designed this?</li>
            <li> The instructions really put me off.  I can&#x27;t imagine having to hold the stylus on a single hair for at least 15 seconds.  This may be one of those times where it&#x27;s worth it to have the work done by a professional.  My kit will be donated, unused.</li>
            <li> I just started using this, haven&#x27;t seen much problem with scabbing. That said, immediately after treatment, I wash the area and then apply Neosporin to the area. Not only does it help with the (minor compared to having hair) pain, but it keeps it from getting infected and scabbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the unit itself may look flimsy, it&#x27;s actually all you need. It&#x27;s helpful to read the instructions, wait, reread the instructions, prepare, reread the instructions again to make sure you hadn&#x27;t missed or misunderstood anything (I&#x27;m fairly conscientious and even I had missed a vital step - thankfully I had made sure to double-check before starting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want some more info on this topic, check out \\&quot;Home electrolysis tips\\&quot; on the \\&quot;Hairfacts\\&quot; website - it&#x27;s actually where I first heard of this in my quest for hair removal. Already I love this using my Clean + Easy unit and if you&#x27;re patient with your self-treatment you&#x27;ll be pretty excited at the results, too! I know it has a bit of a learning curve, but if you persist... smooth skin, no stubble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped!</li>
            <li> great product.  does just what it is supposed to do.  takes care of those pesky little pubic hairs and others</li>
            <li> This was a terrific product, was easy to use, and worked like a charm. Last week I would have given it 5 stars. And then it just stopped working. I changed the battery, though I couldn&#x27;t believe that was the problem. It wasn&#x27;t. The thing just stopped working. I have owned it for 6 months, and used it maybe once a week. There is no reason for it to have just died. I am furious. I am contemplating buying another one because I liked it so much. But really, dying after 6 months??? Did I mention I am furious?</li>
            <li> This product works but it is hard to look at the mirror and at the same time put the stylet tip into the hair follicle. Also the little wire of a stylet tip bend very easily. If you buy this product you will probably need to order extra stylet tips.  I still like it but if you want to get the hair kill you will probably need to go to a profession.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it and it made blisters on my skin that took several days to heal. My hairs are extremely fine, and I think this might work better for thicker hairs, or better if one person assists another person in using it, because it will be easier to find the roots and zap them those ways.  The customer service, which I contacted was very helpful and answered the phone right away to help me figure out how to use the product. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the patience to try again.  But I really appreaciate their customer service department.</li>
            <li> Painful and did nothing. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because some of the reviews were good. You don&#x27;t feel anything when you use it so you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working. The probe bends easily. You have to have just the right amount of salt in the water and not too much or too little water on your fingers when using. I did not get results. Had my husband try to do it for me on my chin and he felt nothing either. Changed batteries, still didn&#x27;t feel anything. Very hard to target hair folicle. Garbage. Wish I could send it back but I can&#x27;t so it&#x27;s headed for the landfill. Like throwing away money. Thank God the price of Laser hair removal is coming down.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions in the booklet and the tips on these reviews and still couldn&#x27;t make it work. The needle kept retracting into the stylus and would never slide into the pore. Returning it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product with a great deal of patience and persistence in the hope that it would do its job, albeit slower than a professional treatment.  I even consulted Youtube tutorials on this as I&#x27;d read reviews saying that people had misunderstood how to use the product correctly. Unfortunately I can only express my regret in buying this product. Inserting these tiny needles into your hair follicles is fiendishly tricky without a large magnifying mirror, plenty of light and the hand steadiness that would rival that of a mime artist. As for the tweezers that are included, they may as well be salad tongs they are so abominably incapable of gripping even the thicker hairs. Also, in my opinion it is very easy to infect yourself if you do not follow the stylus cleaning instructions to the letter. In terms of its effectiveness, I have thick hair and a lot of facial hair I need to be rid of. This was therefore probably not the best option considering there are more effective and faster laser treatment options out there, but being a student who is on a budget, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I have seen no change whatsoever in the frequency of hair growth nor the thickness, and I have been using it consistently for about 3 months. I would also like to add that the name itself is misleading; it is not clean and easy by any measure. If you are looking for a no nonsense hair removal method, this is not for you. Pay for high quality treatment or buy a well known branded home laser kit from a manufacturer like Philips. This is just too time consuming, ineffective and cumbersome to use if you have a lot of thick hair to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Caution!&lt;br /&gt;-Please very be careful because It can damage your skin!&lt;br /&gt;-Too much time consuming&lt;br /&gt;-It seems work okay at first, but so easily broken(I have used it only 6 times)&lt;br /&gt;-Unfriendly service!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this device for $36.44($31.99+shipping$4.45). I got this device at the end of Jan 2013. I used it for 4-5 times after that I have to work in another state, so I didn&#x27;t bring it with me. Almost two months later,I came back home and started using again. The device seemed quiet, no response! I replaced a new battery, it still doesn&#x27;t work, so I contacted to the seller,but they didn&#x27;t come up with a good solution...just told me it has already passed 90 days!  so what I can do. She said if I want a new one, I have to mail the old one to her, and she will ship the new one to me. I don&#x27;t expect to get a low quality product and unfriendly service, plus I waste money for return shipping back and forth!..It seems I pay more expensive for this device. Sometimes I feel like someone takes advantage on me!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present. I had my doubts that it would work because of it&#x27;s size but the first time she used it we were both amazed how good it really does work. You cannot beat this machine especially for the price. The only problem is the battery life is short, that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and it is the best 30 I have spent in a long time!! Works great just be patient. I nice mirror with good lighting is a must. Also don&#x27;t bother with the tweezers they sent. Worthless. Either way I can not sing the praise loud enough for this thing. I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a shocking experience, and it takes forever to get it just right, and it takes a while (like weeks) to fully get rid of a man&#x27;s beard, so I&#x27;m not trying it on my legs ever. You can&#x27;t use it for more than an hour a day, and it&#x27;s recommended that you not use it on more than 1 square inch of hair at a time. It&#x27;s too much trouble, really.</li>
            <li> Very loud...went after one hair and it burned...so I stopped.  Scars take too long to heal.  Thanks, but no thanks!</li>
            <li> Stylus is very flimsy. Unable to target a hair shaft.</li>
            <li> My face was a mess after using it.  Another item I threw money away on.  How long do we have before we can exchange something on Amazon.  This product is useless.</li>
            <li> found this nearly impossible to use.  Worked at making it work for a few hours.  Successfully removed one hair.  would never recomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical of this, but since I was paying $32 for 8 minutes of electrolysis every two weeks, it was worth a try.  The first time I used it, I did get little tiny scabs, but they went away, and most of the hairs didn&#x27;t grow back!  I have used it a few times since then, and the results are already visible.  I have been dreaming of getting rid of these coarse extra hairs on my chin, and it is finally happening!  I didn&#x27;t see any results with professional electrolysis, but am already seeing incredible results with this!  Either the hair is not growing back, or it is so fine that is blends in, and isn&#x27;t coarse anymore.</li>
            <li> Dont work had to returned to get refund</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It produced a light &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34;, but not nearly enough to truly kill the hair follicle.  I tried several test sites and did not see any permanent hair reduction.  Better off shaving or going to a licensed electrologist.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok, but having to wait 20 seconds for each hair to be treated can be a bit tedious!</li>
            <li> This is quack science at its finest.  It hurts like hell, takes forever to operate, and it doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!!!  This has got to be the stupidest invention out there, plugging a long sharp needle into your pores will cause it to blister.  Before you know it, you&#x27;ll find mucous start forming and scars all over your face!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> ***This particular device is also being advertised as the One Touch, but I assure you that it is not. The box only says Deluxe Electrolysis. Nothing more.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And despite seeing that I decided to use it anyway, because I am not afraid of knock offs. If it&#x27;s cheap and works that&#x27;s one thing. If it&#x27;s cheap and doesn&#x27;t do anything that&#x27;s a rip off. I still have ever single hair I started with. I wanted to make sure that I had given it enough time and a fair chance, but ultimately for me it just didn&#x27;t work. I tried it in several different spots, different voltages, even have someone else try it on me, but nothing worked. I have been more than patient with it because I expected their to be a learning curve. It just didn&#x27;t turn out to be the device for me. It sucks because I have facial hair and I just want it gone. Unfortunately this product gave me hope just to let me down. If you were ever looking for a torture device this may be it though.Definitely delivers a shock and an annoying noise to boot. I can&#x27;t even use it when someone is trying to sleep.</li>
