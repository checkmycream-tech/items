            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because I loved the Kisstixx sample I had.</li>
            <li>However, it was good chapstick in terms of flavor and texture.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I loved it.</li>
            <li>It honestly felt great  we kissed probably about 15 minutes.</li>

            <li>My husband and I love these!  </li>
            <li>but I never used it after that first time so its not the best use of money.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would have loved it if it had two flavors.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best chapstick type products that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>An OK novelty once or twice.</li>
            <li>Tastes are ok, and add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Interesting novelty item</li>
            <li>While the mint flavor is ok, it was disapointing.</li>
            <li>Kind of fun as a gag gift</li>
            <li>I love this product and was so excited to find it on amazon after I ran out of the ice flavored chapstick</li>
            <li>I thought this looked kind of funny and wanted to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>but it just adds more fun to a kiss.</li>
            <li>Honestly, my boyfriend and I didn&#x27;t really notice anything special/different about the feeling of this chapstick when we tried it.</li>
            <li>Fine to have fun.</li>
            <li>and it really works, love it.</li>
            <li>The ice I recieved was peppermint versus the sweeter cool ice that is shown (the packaging isnt anywhere close to what is shown)</li>
            <li>Other than that it still was great.</li>
            <li>They are such a cute novelty idea but also, it works!</li>
            <li>Must buy, so fun to use</li>
            <li>A Way to Add Fun to Kissing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun and made us laugh.</li>
            <li>It gives the kiss some flavor and it&#x27;s fun to try out the first time...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be fine to buy it from a store, but I believe it is not possible.</li>
            <li>Very waxy and flavors didn&#x27;t blend.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>It burnt so much that it almost made me cry</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims to do and leaves your lips soft for hours!  </li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite out of the other flavors.</li>
            <li>We had a fantastic shared experience other than I accidently over applied the hot and he under applied the ice.</li>
            <li>but the &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; feeling isn&#x27;t necessarily pleasurable and it gets old pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend didn&#x27;t like the cinnamon flavor in particular for this flavor-set.</li>
            <li>As long as you only put a tiny bit on your lips at a time, this product is really fun.</li>
            <li>First I thought this product is great since it really taste like cinnamon, but after using it a few times it started to burn awfully on my lips.</li>

            <li> It gives the kiss some flavor and it&#x27;s fun to try out the first time... but the &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; feeling isn&#x27;t necessarily pleasurable and it gets old pretty quickly. My girlfriend didn&#x27;t like the cinnamon flavor in particular for this flavor-set.</li>
            <li> I thought this looked kind of funny and wanted to give it a try.  My husband and I love these!  It does exactly what it claims to do and leaves your lips soft for hours!  This is by far one of the best chapstick type products that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> My package came with 2 fires and no ice. I&#x27;m sure I would have loved it if it had two flavors.</li>
            <li> the fire one burns the lips</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Made in the USA and I use it all the time now. My husband likes it too. It is not just a novelty for us.</li>
            <li> I was given samples of the peppermint flavored Kisstixx lip balm a couple of years ago. Once I ran out of these samples, I ordered these. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula, or ingredients, but this does not have the same mint flavor. It leaves a very artificial after taste, and, quite frankly, is gross. It&#x27;s a shame, because I loved the Kisstixx sample I had.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this gift!!</li>
            <li> Got this and it really works, love it.</li>
            <li> Not a fan, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Must buy, so fun to use</li>
            <li> A Way to Add Fun to Kissing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tasting each flavor but when you press your lips with the other it changes flavor.  Maybe a gimmick but it just adds more fun to a kiss.</li>
            <li> Great product! Gives a great tingling experience and makes kissing more interesting!</li>
            <li> Just so-so. An OK novelty once or twice.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Not at all what I expected.  Very waxy and flavors didn&#x27;t blend.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day. They are such a cute novelty idea but also, it works! When one person wears the fire and the other wears the ice, you kiss and then you start to feel both sensations...it&#x27;s fun and made us laugh. Win-Win lol</li>
            <li> When combined together it gave both me and my girlfriend a rash</li>
            <li> Fine to have fun. Tastes are ok, and add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly overpriced if you have to pay the product + the shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be fine to buy it from a store, but I believe it is not possible.</li>
            <li> Honestly, my boyfriend and I didn&#x27;t really notice anything special/different about the feeling of this chapstick when we tried it. However, it was good chapstick in terms of flavor and texture. It just wasn&#x27;t what I expected to pay for.</li>
            <li> Interesting novelty item</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything. I didn&#x27;t feel anything with my partner.</li>
            <li> As long as you only put a tiny bit on your lips at a time, this product is really fun. Definitely my favorite out of the other flavors.</li>
            <li> Saw this on &#x27;The Profit&amp;#34; the CNBC show with Marcus Lemonis so bought it for my son&#x27;s fiancé.  They loved it!  I think this is a great gift!</li>
            <li> These left my lips in pain. The fire created a undesired amount of burning sensation to a point where it actually hurt even after trying to wipe off. Also created a numbness in my lips. Not a good product do not waste money on these.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I loved it. We each chose whether we wanted fire or ice and applied. It honestly felt great  we kissed probably about 15 minutes. We had a fantastic shared experience other than I accidently over applied the hot and he under applied the ice. Other than that it still was great. It felt instantly mosturizing. Just to let you all know my boyfriend and I have been going out for almost 2 years. Little experiences like what this provided help us bond</li>
            <li> First I thought this product is great since it really taste like cinnamon, but after using it a few times it started to burn awfully on my lips. It burnt so much that it almost made me cry and I just don&#x27;t like to use it again at any point!</li>
            <li> Kind of fun as a gag gift but I never used it after that first time so its not the best use of money.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was so excited to find it on amazon after I ran out of the ice flavored chapstick so i ordered it for Christmas.  I just tried it today and...unfortunatley the product I received isnt the same as the ice flavor shown in the picture.  The ice I recieved was peppermint versus the sweeter cool ice that is shown (the packaging isnt anywhere close to what is shown) While the mint flavor is ok, it was disapointing.</li>
