    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I am very happy with this product, intending to continue using it.  </li>
            <li>yeah, it isn&#x27;t perfect and takes 3 weeks to see any results, but it does work and your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li>This stuff is GREAT, I&#x27;ve been using it for like 8 days, and all the marks on my chin have faded a ton.</li>
            <li>thought this was a great price, so i wanted to try</li>
            <li>Even so, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smoothly and I look flawless..</li>
            <li>However, a good moisturizer takes care of that problem.</li>
            <li>I have always had good skin</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to pay the price for awesome skin.</li>
            <li>But the fifty dollar price tag is kind of hefty.</li>
            <li>The best product I have found so far is Proactive skin lightening lotion.</li>
            <li>SO, I&#x27;m not going to bother to buy more, just to see if this product might ever work for me.</li>
            <li>I also use the Even Better Skin Tone</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I use Better Skin tone corrector in the pm and am.  </li>
            <li>Neither, gave me the sticky feeling, my face felt nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Still no sticky feeling from \\&quot;Even Better Skin Corrector.  </li>
            <li>I am ordering more today.  </li>
            <li>I started using Clinique3 months ago and absolutely love it...</li>
            <li>Frankly it became enough and I went to my doctor and got prescribed epi-duo and retin-A. Perfect; my acne cleared but my skin looked like a war zone.</li>
            <li>i guess i should have looked at the picture better, this version isnt even sold on clinique&#x27;s website...</li>
            <li>More even tone.</li>
            <li>but I am breaking out much more.</li>
            <li>It has lightened the areas but need to give it more time.</li>
            <li>Nothing has worked better for me than this.</li>
            <li>Ladies, please order and enjoy your skin better, I DO</li>
            <li>/&gt;The clarity of my face is stunning, I went from patchy to smooth and even looking after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I strongly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li>They are rather light but bothered me</li>
            <li>This product seems to smooth out of face in a way?</li>
            <li>It remained smooth and breakouts did not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, so it&#x27;s completely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have a unique problem, but all I can say is that Clinique&#x27;s product did not work.</li>
            <li>After seeing the commercials on tv I was really excited to see this product on the market because I suffer from hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>This is the original skin tone corrector and it works.</li>
            <li>I said yes, so he made a prescription for a combination of medications which I had to go fill at a special pharmacy that does compounds.</li>
            <li>The lotion also leaves your skin soft and all though I am prone to breakouts while using any kind of lotion on my face, I have not had any problems with this</li>
            <li>and I was super psyched to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first one and so far, it&#x27;s pretty good for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be exactly as If I did buy it at the store; it comes in a box with a notice!</li>
            <li>I actually have quite nice skin</li>
            <li>but it is worth it in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within the first week I started seeing a difference, this product has not only lightened up the age spots, my freckles have all but disappeared and my skin tone is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with lots of dark spots from the sun all blending into one.</li>
            <li>If you use a toner everyday before using this you should start to notice your skin tone really become great.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this is that it makes your skin peel alittle, so be sure to use an exploiater (sp?) along with it.</li>
            <li>so I ordered the second one from Amazon and most of the brown spots are almost invisible.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for 2 weeks, and it has already worked better than the bottle of Clinique.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Clinique!</li>
            <li>so any difference in tones shows up pretty noticeably).</li>
            <li>However, it did get rid of more recent ones.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for a month or so along with other skin care products makings sure to clean my face really well because using.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin super soft, and brighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and I can really see results.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping from the seller too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper, works faster, the tretinoin lasts longer, and you get 150% as much.</li>
            <li>It takes about 4 weeks to really see results</li>
            <li>I started using Clinique Even Better Skin Tone Corrector because I noticed I had some dark spots under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if they had put this product in a container that showed how little was really in it for the money, I wouldn&#x27;t be so angry--but their intentional misrepresentation just does not allow me to reward them for their deceit by buying more.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My primary care physician actually referred back to my dermatologist, \\&quot;They look darker than before.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I used this product in conjunction with the Clinique Even Better Skin Tone Moisturizer and was not extremely pleased with either product.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle in Macy&#x27;s in April 2011, now I am on my second bottle.  </li>
            <li>So, unfortunatley it won&#x27;t do for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>And each time I break out, it&#x27;s in the exact same areas where I apply this supposed skin tone corrector.</li>
            <li>A month and a half later my skin is more even on the face and neck</li>
            <li>Since they say it takes at least four weeks before you&#x27;ll notice a difference, that means I&#x27;ll have to give them more of money before I can even tell IF it will ever work--because so far, I&#x27;ve seen NO improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for four weeks, twice daily on my whole face</li>
            <li>Also if you want to see how much is inside the mysterious \\&quot;non see-through</li>
            <li>Was as described, the only thing that bothered me,there was no instructions with the product and since it had gotten very cold,possibly frozen</li>
            <li>I was told that this product won&#x27;t really start working until the 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li>I am 22 years young, and I started having acne issues because of stress.</li>
            <li>After a week, began to notice my age spots fading and how soft and youthful my skin looked.</li>
            <li>One more round may be necessary</li>
            <li>Good at controlling frequent acne breakouts but slow to diminish dark spots and blemishes.</li>
            <li>So far, it hasn&#x27;t worked at all, and I&#x27;m only a week away from when \\&quot;I should notice an improvement\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, it didn&#x27;t quite get rid of my old acne scars from seven to ten years ago.</li>
            <li>I have always had freckles, but one of these spots are a little smaller than a dime on my right temple.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for about 4 weeks and my old acne marks and dark spots are almost completely gone.  </li>

            <li> Have been using it for about 4 weeks and my old acne marks and dark spots are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of getting these companies rich while they trick and manipulate the consumer.</li>
            <li> They are no where near as dark as they were 8 days ago.</li>
            <li> I broke out terribly and it left dark spots all over my once almost flawless skin.</li>
            <li> I figured it would do everything it says it will do, especially since I followed the instructions carefully and applied it twice a day, day and night.</li>
            <li> along with the Clinique so, not sure how much of the improvement is the other stuff.</li>
            <li> You only apply it once every other day, and it comes in a 45 gram tube, which is equivalent to 1.5 ounces.</li>
            <li> I had several dark brown spots on my arms.</li>
            <li> so im not sure how old this bottle it...</li>
            <li> but I was left with the dark spots.</li>
            <li> Not sure how the other reviewer ran out after one month when only using it on her nose because I use it on my face and neck daily and still haven&#x27;t ran out.</li>
            <li> but as I am hitting 50 shortly I have two small age spots on my cheek.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m using other skin products -- some prescribed, others not--</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are some other brands that have the skin tone corrector</li>
            <li> Correcting Moisturizer which also helps minimize the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I used it for at least 3-4 months religiously on my problem areas</li>
            <li> Redness and blotches seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m on the slightly darker side of the skin tone spectrum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was due to the Clinique or the fact that I started wearing sun screen every day.   </li>
            <li> My face has been alot smoother, softer and corrected by dark spots and small lines.  </li>
            <li> I am in my mid-20s with acne and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> It has dried out my skin, which helps with my acne outbursts.</li>
            <li> After turning 40, I started to get a few age spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I noticed very slight effects.</li>
            <li> There is apparently very little of the product in the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in, but you can&#x27;t tell that because of the non see-through bottle</li>
            <li> the person who commented \\&quot;There is apparently very little of the product in the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in, but you can&#x27;t tell that because of the non see-through bottle</li>
            <li> (it is expensive but actually cheaper than Clinique).  </li>
            <li> It was rough, patchy and tired looking.</li>
            <li> I feel like this did start to even out my skin tone, but after about 3-4 days, small pimples broke out all over my face.</li>
            <li> This was a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> but the past year I was on and off the pill</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting so sick of companies putting less and less in their packaging and charging us more and more--as if we&#x27;re too stupid to notice.</li>
            <li> This product I used twice a day for approximately 2 months and have seen little results.  </li>
            <li> Users must be patient and don&#x27;t expect to see dramatic result in a few weeks, try it for at least two to three months</li>
            <li> The item was delivered quickly even though we were having terrible weather all over the US.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical after reading the varying reviews but gave it a shot anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really frustrating trying to cover these spots up.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the Clinique Even Better Skin Tone Moisturizer and was not extremely pleased with either product.  This product I used twice a day for approximately 2 months and have seen little results.  Good at controlling frequent acne breakouts but slow to diminish dark spots and blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and I can really see results.  My skin tone is more even!  Fast shipping from the seller too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and I have noticed a change.  Redness and blotches seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, which, for starters, is pricey enough. There is apparently very little of the product in the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in, but you can&#x27;t tell that because of the non see-through bottle it&#x27;s in--sneaky of them. The product ran out after only three weeks of twice-daily use, on my nose only. Since they say it takes at least four weeks before you&#x27;ll notice a difference, that means I&#x27;ll have to give them more of money before I can even tell IF it will ever work--because so far, I&#x27;ve seen NO improvement. I&#x27;m getting so sick of companies putting less and less in their packaging and charging us more and more--as if we&#x27;re too stupid to notice. SO, I&#x27;m not going to bother to buy more, just to see if this product might ever work for me. So far, it hasn&#x27;t worked at all, and I&#x27;m only a week away from when \\&quot;I should notice an improvement\\&quot;. I&#x27;m tired of getting these companies rich while they trick and manipulate the consumer. Perhaps if they had put this product in a container that showed how little was really in it for the money, I wouldn&#x27;t be so angry--but their intentional misrepresentation just does not allow me to reward them for their deceit by buying more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  Have been using it for about 4 weeks and my old acne marks and dark spots are almost completely gone.  My skin looks so mich brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the person who commented \\&quot;There is apparently very little of the product in the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in, but you can&#x27;t tell that because of the non see-through bottle it&#x27;s in--sneaky of them. The product ran out after only three weeks of twice-daily use, on my nose only.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for four weeks, twice daily on my whole face and it is still not gone. Also if you want to see how much is inside the mysterious \\&quot;non see-through bottle\\&quot; I might suggest unscrewing the cap and looking.</li>
            <li> I actually have quite nice skin but as I am hitting 50 shortly I have two small age spots on my cheek. They are rather light but bothered me so I thought I would give this product a try. I have a red undertone to my skin. I applied it daily for two months with no change. I took it back to where I purchased it and got a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle in Macy&#x27;s in April 2011, now I am on my second bottle.  After using it for 3 weeks I started to notice that my face has become brighter and whiter with the spots fading noticeably.  It makes me look years younger and I am very happy with this product, intending to continue using it.  Users must be patient and don&#x27;t expect to see dramatic result in a few weeks, try it for at least two to three months and you should see the improvements of your skin.  I also use the Even Better Skin Tone Correcting Moisturizer which also helps minimize the dark spots.  Love it and I strongly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li> I tried and tried, but it just did not work for me. My primary care physician actually referred back to my dermatologist, \\&quot;They look darker than before.\\&quot;  I went to my dermatologist and mentioned I had been using this clinique product. He avoided the comment and proceeded to tell me that it appeared I wanted the skin discolorations to go away. I said yes, so he made a prescription for a combination of medications which I had to go fill at a special pharmacy that does compounds. I having started using the prescribed compound and hope this will give me results (it is expensive but actually cheaper than Clinique).  Maybe I have a unique problem, but all I can say is that Clinique&#x27;s product did not work.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and well package.  I use Better Skin tone corrector in the pm and am.  Neither, gave me the sticky feeling, my face felt nice and smooth.  I&#x27;ll give an up date in two weeks to see if any of my brown spot run away.  Until then---Women of Color get it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; NOV 14, 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed my brown spots are fading away and some are gone.  I took before pictures and compared them today.  Still no sticky feeling from \\&quot;Even Better Skin Corrector.  I am ordering more today.  Ladies, please order and enjoy your skin better, I DO</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a month or so along with other skin care products makings sure to clean my face really well because using. This product seems to smooth out of face in a way? It does what it says it can do. If you use a toner everyday before using this you should start to notice your skin tone really become great.</li>
            <li> I started using Clinique3 months ago and absolutely love it...My face has been alot smoother, softer and corrected by dark spots and small lines.  My makeup goes on smoothly and I look flawless..I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT, I&#x27;ve been using it for like 8 days, and all the marks on my chin have faded a ton. They are no where near as dark as they were 8 days ago. It has made my skin super soft, and brighter. The only downside to this is that it makes your skin peel alittle, so be sure to use an exploiater (sp?) along with it. I know it&#x27;s \\&quot;pricy\\&quot; or whatever, but I&#x27;m willing to pay the price for awesome skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-20s with acne and uneven skin tone. Frankly it became enough and I went to my doctor and got prescribed epi-duo and retin-A. Perfect; my acne cleared but my skin looked like a war zone. It was rough, patchy and tired looking. Then I started using this over my acne meds and using it alone after washing my face in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clarity of my face is stunning, I went from patchy to smooth and even looking after 3 weeks. You have to give it time, and 2-3 weeks is when I started noticing even texture and pigmentation from acne to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I stopped using my prescriptions and was using this with continued skin protection. It remained smooth and breakouts did not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, it isn&#x27;t perfect and takes 3 weeks to see any results, but it does work and your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> I feel like this did start to even out my skin tone, but after about 3-4 days, small pimples broke out all over my face. So, unfortunatley it won&#x27;t do for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> A friend said it didn&#x27;t work on her so gave it to me and believe me it was working on me. I had several dark brown spots on my arms. They were getting lighter after using it for 2 weeks.  I was out so I ordered the second one from Amazon and most of the brown spots are almost invisible.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered quickly even though we were having terrible weather all over the US.  Was as described, the only thing that bothered me,there was no instructions with the product and since it had gotten very cold,possibly frozen, I didn&#x27;t know if the product was affected..not the fault of the seller..thanks</li>
            <li> I used an entire bottle of this in about a month, using it as directed twice daily. I noticed very slight effects. I&#x27;m not sure if this was due to the Clinique or the fact that I started wearing sun screen every day.   Then I went to a dermatologist ($30 copay) and was prescribed the generic of Retin-A, which is called Tretinoin cream ($15). I have only been using it for 2 weeks, and it has already worked better than the bottle of Clinique. You only apply it once every other day, and it comes in a 45 gram tube, which is equivalent to 1.5 ounces. The bottle of Clinique is only 1 ounce, and you need to use it twice daily!   Overall, I would say SKIP the Clinique, and go see a dermatologist. It&#x27;s cheaper, works faster, the tretinoin lasts longer, and you get 150% as much.</li>
            <li> thought this was a great price, so i wanted to try but when i received it it wasnt the \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; version that i thought. i guess i should have looked at the picture better, this version isnt even sold on clinique&#x27;s website...so im not sure how old this bottle it...but since i paid for it im using it, im just not going to buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was told that this product won&#x27;t really start working until the 3rd bottle. I&#x27;m on my first one and so far, it&#x27;s pretty good for my skin. No breakouts. More even tone. But I&#x27;m using other skin products -- some prescribed, others not-- along with the Clinique so, not sure how much of the improvement is the other stuff. But this corrector definitely helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this product three weeks ago and I was super psyched to try it. I am 22 years young, and I started having acne issues because of stress. Anyhow, when my acne disappears it leaves a red spot that doesn&#x27;t go away until several months have passed. It&#x27;s been really frustrating trying to cover these spots up. I am fair skinned, so it&#x27;s completely noticeable. I decided to give this a try, since I wear the Clinique powder. I figured it would do everything it says it will do, especially since I followed the instructions carefully and applied it twice a day, day and night. This was a complete disappointment. Not only have I not seen any noticeable results, which I suppose I should have by now considering the fact that I have followed the instructions religiously-- but I am breaking out much more. And each time I break out, it&#x27;s in the exact same areas where I apply this supposed skin tone corrector. I am heading back to the mall to demand a refund. That is all. Hope this product works differently for you.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with lots of dark spots from the sun all blending into one. I have been using this for about 4 weeks. It has lightened the areas but need to give it more time. I figured that it didn&#x27;t take weeks for my skin to get that way, so I figure it will take longer to improve it. It has dried out my skin, which helps with my acne outbursts. However, a good moisturizer takes care of that problem. I am now ordering another tube.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for everyone else but this thing has worked wonders on my skin then again I&#x27;m only 25. I have always had good skin but the past year I was on and off the pill and it did a number on my skin. I broke out terribly and it left dark spots all over my once almost flawless skin. Thank God the breakouts are gone but I was left with the dark spots. Within a week of using this almost all the spots are gone and my face is getting back to the way it was. Nothing has worked better for me than this.</li>
            <li> I received the product without any box, neither notice. Which is quite nonprofessionnal. It&#x27;s supposed to be exactly as If I did buy it at the store; it comes in a box with a notice!</li>
            <li> After turning 40, I started to get a few age spots on my face. I have always had freckles, but one of these spots are a little smaller than a dime on my right temple.  I seen the commercial for this product and decided to give it a try after several years of using makeup to cover up the spots. Within the first week I started seeing a difference, this product has not only lightened up the age spots, my freckles have all but disappeared and my skin tone is amazing. The lotion also leaves your skin soft and all though I am prone to breakouts while using any kind of lotion on my face, I have not had any problems with this and I am on the 3rd week of using it.</li>
            <li> After seeing the commercials on tv I was really excited to see this product on the market because I suffer from hyperpigmentation. I used it for at least 3-4 months religiously on my problem areas and I did not see any change at all. The best product I have found so far is Proactive skin lightening lotion.</li>
            <li> After a week, began to notice my age spots fading and how soft and youthful my skin looked. Would highly recommend this product. Thanks, Clinique!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical after reading the varying reviews but gave it a shot anyway. A month and a half later my skin is more even on the face and neck (I&#x27;m on the slightly darker side of the skin tone spectrum so any difference in tones shows up pretty noticeably). The only thing is, it didn&#x27;t quite get rid of my old acne scars from seven to ten years ago. However, it did get rid of more recent ones. Not sure how the other reviewer ran out after one month when only using it on her nose because I use it on my face and neck daily and still haven&#x27;t ran out. But the fifty dollar price tag is kind of hefty. Even so, it&#x27;s a great buy. I used it in conjuction with the Clinique cleansing foam so that may also be a reason why I had succsesful results. My skin is almost to complete tone evenness with the exception of those few old acne marks. One more round may be necessary but I&#x27;m definitely going to do it.</li>
            <li> I started using Clinique Even Better Skin Tone Corrector because I noticed I had some dark spots under my eyes. I have always been a beach girl so before we knew how harmful it was to hang out at the beach in the sun all day I did just that. And now my skin is showing the consequences. This product does what it says however, it won&#x27;t happen overnight. It takes about 4 weeks to really see results I know it seems like a lot of money but it is worth it in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;There are some other brands that have the skin tone corrector but I don&#x27;t know how well they work if they work at all. This is the original skin tone corrector and it works.</li>
