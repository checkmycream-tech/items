    <ol>
            <li>this is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I gave this product two stars because it smelled good!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d found the perfect lip balm.</li>
            <li>An incredible healing product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything, and this is truly the best!</li>
            <li>This one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used, hands-down.</li>
            <li>very good.</li>
            <li>A very good lip balm.  </li>
            <li>this glides on wonderfully and tastes great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great orange/ citrus smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that this is the best lip balm I have EVER</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste great, however, it works well.</li>
            <li>had the pleasure of using much better lip balm!!</li>
            <li>Non of them feel as good as Lip Calm.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I love that Amazon sells it too!  </li>
            <li>i want to get more soon!</li>
            <li>oil, borago officinalis (borage) oil, rose mosqueta (rosehip) oil, citrus reticulata (langerine) peel oil, citrus medica limonium (lemon) peel oil, citrus aurantifolia (lime) oil.</li>
            <li>The citrus smell provides a nice burst of aromatherapy when you use</li>
            <li>It just goes on like butter and makes my lips look and feel so happy :) I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>So far this lip balm seems simply perfect and the best one I am using right</li>
            <li>great product, great classy brand.</li>
            <li>Light pleasant citrus smell.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and will glide on almost like an oil.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>they feel better instantly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>there are too many chapsticks that have a waxy feel.</li>
            <li>just ordered 2 more tubes so i can stash them around my house</li>
            <li>If it also keeps the eczema from drying out and peeling, that would be even better.</li>
            <li>Probably would help to have more beeswax in it to make it thicker and have more staying power.  </li>
            <li>This is really very nice stuff; it has a soothing gentle effect.  </li>
            <li>The balm is greasy and just stays on the lips&#x27; surface and easily came off.  </li>
            <li>This cost more than the 99 cent chapstick, but is so very much worth it.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be sure to check around about the price; some sellers here are really jacking up the price, so check the John Masters website to make sure that you&#x27;re not paying too much.</li>
            <li>I like this enough to be trying to find more since it isn&#x27;t carried in most stores i run in to.   </li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is calming and repairing, and citrus oils repair with vitamin C and mild fruit</li>
            <li>and if I continue to have good luck with it I will buy one for every purse because right now, I look like I have a red burn around my lips that rejects just about everything I try including prescription steroid creams.</li>
            <li>The first week I used it my lips felt smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of scars on my lips and need very intense moisture, and this stuff delivers!</li>
            <li>I like the flavor(not to strong) and I like the way he shine(not too much).</li>
            <li>Lip calm heals my lips quickly.</li>
            <li>tube of Lip Calm should cost six dollars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product and love it - soft and no funky smell.</li>
            <li>I must have sensitive skin around my lips because I frequently break out around the lip line with most lip balms, not this one!  </li>
            <li>(The JM website also offers free shipping.)&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 of them and as long as it&#x27;s available, I&#x27;ll be exclusively purchasing this!</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;calm\\&quot; in the title seems accurate, but without some of the extra-strong essential oils some products may use for that.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find an organic lip balm that moisturizes really well</li>
            <li>If I get dehydrated or spend a bit too much time out of doors, my lips crack hideously.</li>
            <li>As a product junkie, I hardly ever finish up lip balms since I&#x27;m always moving on to the next great thing before I finish up what I have.  </li>
            <li>The only balms that I&#x27;ve finished because I love them so much are this Lip Calm balm, the EOS round balms, and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and I was surprised how much it helped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a lovely citrus scent to it because of the added essential oils, but they don&#x27;t dry out your lips.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips more; you can feel the hydration the next day.  </li>
            <li>Be careful leaving in a hot area, as it is a very soft consistency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a more expensive lip balm from Organics that I like very much, but tried this to compare.  </li>
            <li>Next time I think I will buy the same one ;)</li>
            <li>but I live several hrs away...</li>
            <li>A good lip balm is difficult to find!  </li>
            <li>Though it sometimes is difficult to find, this is superior to other balms, from the contents to the ease of glide with application</li>
            <li>i can buy this at whole foods for way less</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as nice as Organics, but it&#x27;s so much less expensive that it&#x27;s definitely in my list for repeat orders as it does the job.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and soft with pure plant oils like jojoba and flax in a beeswax base; the beeswax forms a protective layer and the plant oils sink in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Whole Foods is usually sold out of this lip balm (when I remember to buy it).</li>
            <li> So far this balm feels very soothing  - or at the very least, non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim when I flew into Denver and within several hours had dry verging on chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive but very worth it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a flavor (not sure where the other reviewer was getting that from) and it smells kinda like lemons and...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not as solid / dense as other lip balms.</li>
            <li> As soon as you put it on, it relieves dry lips-</li>
            <li> but I found it stripped my lips making them dry and sore.</li>
            <li> I have burning, peeling exczema on and around my lips right now and am desperately trying every natural product on the market to not just help improve but also to just not irritate this area; as well as to moisturize the dry, peeling skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like beeswax based products that drag on your lips.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a minus one star, I would.</li>
            <li> But after using it continually my lips began to swell, and became so cracked and dried that they actually hurt.</li>
            <li> The olive oil base provides a nice, slippery feel, and yet it lasts for quite some time on your lips.  </li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i have a lip condition where I get random blisters, its embarrassing and this really is helping.</li>
            <li> This product has the flavor of olive and lemon combined, which is an odd combination.</li>
            <li> and my lips haven&#x27;t even peeled once, much less cracked!    </li>
            <li> I have been using this all day, every day (like I usually did with chapstick) for over three months</li>
            <li> I tried to remove, but it was hard to remove and got all sticky.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously a miracle.</li>
            <li> The secret is apply and reapply.</li>
            <li> Not attractive.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to place</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t bad.    </li>
            <li> A bit every night at bedtime prevents the painful cuts as well.</li>
            <li> They would often peel and crack to the point where there would be blood :(</li>
            <li> If they ever stop making this stuff, I&#x27;ll go crazy!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a more expensive lip balm from Organics that I like very much, but tried this to compare.  It&#x27;s not quite as nice as Organics, but it&#x27;s so much less expensive that it&#x27;s definitely in my list for repeat orders as it does the job.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I have been trying to find an organic lip balm that moisturizes really well and FEELS like it&#x27;s moisturizing. This is it.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried Badger Balm, Burt&#x27;s Bees and (in desperation) Carmex. Non of them feel as good as Lip Calm.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way. As soon as you put it on, it relieves dry lips- they feel better instantly.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like beeswax based products that drag on your lips. It is very light weight and will glide on almost like an oil. It is not at all sticky.&lt;br /&gt;It has a great orange/ citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;It is not as solid / dense as other lip balms. I have a feeling that in the summer it would melt beyond being usable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and I can honestly say that this is the best lip balm I have EVER used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case they haven&#x27;t listed it, Here are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olea Europaea (olive) oil, carthamus tinctorius (sunflower) oil, beeswax, simmodsia chinesis (jojoba) oil, linum usitastissimum (flax seed) oil, borago officinalis (borage) oil, rose mosqueta (rosehip) oil, citrus reticulata (langerine) peel oil, citrus medica limonium (lemon) peel oil, citrus aurantifolia (lime) oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim when I flew into Denver and within several hours had dry verging on chapped lips.  I ran into a drug store in boulder and they happened to have this so I bought it on a lark.  It was expensive but very worth it.  I&#x27;m not attached to brands when it comes to something like lip moisturizer I just want something that works and I don&#x27;t have to think about.  I like this enough to be trying to find more since it isn&#x27;t carried in most stores i run in to.   Just don&#x27;t leave it in the car... it won&#x27;t hold up like chap stick.. which is like chalk comparatively speaking.</li>
            <li> As a product junkie, I hardly ever finish up lip balms since I&#x27;m always moving on to the next great thing before I finish up what I have.  The only balms that I&#x27;ve finished because I love them so much are this Lip Calm balm, the EOS round balms, and the [[ASIN:B002ZORWGO Choco*Smooch Organic Baby Lip &amp; Face Balm, with Argan, Calendula and Sea Buckthorn]] balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a lovely citrus scent to it because of the added essential oils, but they don&#x27;t dry out your lips.  The olive oil base provides a nice, slippery feel, and yet it lasts for quite some time on your lips.  The citrus smell provides a nice burst of aromatherapy when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be sure to check around about the price; some sellers here are really jacking up the price, so check the John Masters website to make sure that you&#x27;re not paying too much. (The JM website also offers free shipping.)&lt;br /&gt;A tube of Lip Calm should cost six dollars.</li>
            <li> Though it sometimes is difficult to find, this is superior to other balms, from the contents to the ease of glide with application this is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This product has the flavor of olive and lemon combined, which is an odd combination. It doesn&#x27;t taste great, however, it works well.</li>
            <li> This is really very nice stuff; it has a soothing gentle effect.  I try not to eat it off.  The secret is apply and reapply.</li>
            <li> I use this product at bedtime to protect and moisture my lips throughout the night. I thinks it conditions my lips and helps my lipstick application in hte morning.</li>
            <li> I gave this product two stars because it smelled good!! I have def. had the pleasure of using much better lip balm!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and love it - soft and no funky smell. So I purchased it for my mom but it got a big sticker to hide the bar code.  I tried to remove, but it was hard to remove and got all sticky. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product is wonderful. I will keep buying!</li>
            <li> very good.I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a minus one star, I would. The first week I used it my lips felt smooth and moisturized. I thought I&#x27;d found the perfect lip balm. But after using it continually my lips began to swell, and became so cracked and dried that they actually hurt. It took a week for the swelling to go down and for my lips to get back to normal. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this product that would cause a reaction like that, but I do know that I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> i can buy this at whole foods for way less but I live several hrs away... this glides on wonderfully and tastes great. there are too many chapsticks that have a waxy feel. this doesnt</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had severely chapped lips. They would often peel and crack to the point where there would be blood :( Not attractive. I was a chapstick fiend until my husband brought this home from work. I have been using this all day, every day (like I usually did with chapstick) for over three months and my lips haven&#x27;t even peeled once, much less cracked!    This stuff is seriously a miracle. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a flavor (not sure where the other reviewer was getting that from) and it smells kinda like lemons and... it&#x27;s difficult to place but it isn&#x27;t bad.    It doesn&#x27;t sting, it doesn&#x27;t burn, it doesn&#x27;t tingle... It just goes on like butter and makes my lips look and feel so happy :) I LOVE it. If they ever stop making this stuff, I&#x27;ll go crazy!</li>
            <li> I like the flavor(not to strong) and I like the way he shine(not too much). Next time I think I will buy the same one ;)</li>
            <li> A very good lip balm.  Be careful leaving in a hot area, as it is a very soft consistency.</li>
            <li> An incredible healing product! If I get dehydrated or spend a bit too much time out of doors, my lips crack hideously. Lip calm heals my lips quickly. A bit every night at bedtime prevents the painful cuts as well. This cost more than the 99 cent chapstick, but is so very much worth it. I&#x27;ve tried everything, and this is truly the best! Light pleasant citrus smell. In a pinch, I&#x27;ve even used a dab on cracked feet and hands and I was surprised how much it helped.</li>
            <li> its organic , but its oil moist.</li>
            <li> A good lip balm is difficult to find!  This one is perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips more; you can feel the hydration the next day.  I must have sensitive skin around my lips because I frequently break out around the lip line with most lip balms, not this one!  I love that Amazon sells it too!  Whole Foods is usually sold out of this lip balm (when I remember to buy it).</li>
            <li> I have burning, peeling exczema on and around my lips right now and am desperately trying every natural product on the market to not just help improve but also to just not irritate this area; as well as to moisturize the dry, peeling skin. So far this lip balm seems simply perfect and the best one I am using right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;calm\\&quot; in the title seems accurate, but without some of the extra-strong essential oils some products may use for that. It is smooth and soft with pure plant oils like jojoba and flax in a beeswax base; the beeswax forms a protective layer and the plant oils sink in the moisture. Rosehip oil is calming and repairing, and citrus oils repair with vitamin C and mild fruit acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered 2 more tubes so i can stash them around my house and if I continue to have good luck with it I will buy one for every purse because right now, I look like I have a red burn around my lips that rejects just about everything I try including prescription steroid creams. So far this balm feels very soothing  - or at the very least, non-irritating. If it also keeps the eczema from drying out and peeling, that would be even better.</li>
            <li> great product, great classy brand.</li>
            <li> The balm is greasy and just stays on the lips&#x27; surface and easily came off.  Probably would help to have more beeswax in it to make it thicker and have more staying power.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth but I found it stripped my lips making them dry and sore. I&#x27;ve tried 100&#x27;s of organic lip balms and I&#x27;ll never buy this one again. Not for me.</li>
            <li> i have a lip condition where I get random blisters, its embarrassing and this really is helping. i want to get more soon!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used, hands-down. I have a lot of scars on my lips and need very intense moisture, and this stuff delivers! I&#x27;ve already purchased 2 of them and as long as it&#x27;s available, I&#x27;ll be exclusively purchasing this!</li>
