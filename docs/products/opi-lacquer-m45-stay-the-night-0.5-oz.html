            <li>It goes on smooth and when it dries it&#x27;s nice and bumpy</li>
            <li>I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this one didn&#x27;t elicit as many.</li>
            <li>so i tried it with a top coat and its THIRSTY.</li>
            <li>people like this polish better with a glossy finish</li>
            <li>This is love.</li>
            <li>Buy it, but understand you&#x27;re gonna need top coat.</li>
            <li>Sexy.</li>
            <li>Stylish.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use a top coat.</li>
            <li>really felt like sand in my polish (in a good way).</li>
            <li>and it looks so cool!</li>
            <li>So pretty, love the texture!</li>
            <li>I have tried running the bottle under hot water, and rolling it in my hands to warm it up, but nothing works.  </li>
            <li>took 4 coats of topcoat to be smooth and glassy</li>
            <li>I got this polish with my pedicure once &amp; my boyfriend loved it so naturally I had to find it.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the gritty feel but after covering it with topcoat it looks beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Its also super easy to touch up if it chips.  </li>
            <li>I own about 75 different shades of nail polish, mostly OPI.  </li>
            <li>(I understand that it would have it, but it was overboard) and it looked great after a gel top coat.</li>
            <li>Love the color and texture, but the staying power leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>My husband loved that I was using the rough finish of my nail to scratch his back for him (lol).</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love love t polish!</li>
            <li>but it is very pretty</li>
            <li>It is really pretty!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my personal favorite one!</li>
            <li>make it fun though.</li>
            <li>Fun.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole collection, and this one is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>nails look exactly like the picture (color) - except, of course</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve watched as many volcano documentaries and movies as I have, you&#x27;ll instantly know why:</li>
            <li>Great for a night out, long lasting.</li>
            <li>but this is pretty as well.</li>
            <li>Pretty color</li>
            <li>Even with extra top coats applied</li>
            <li>You will need to apply 2-3 coats for it to look right, but It dries really fast too.</li>
            <li>I love the polish takes a bit to dry though.</li>
            <li>while i liked it matte it looked a little ashy</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>As others have said, this polish dries sandy, but if you coat it with a layer or two of topcoat, you can get the &#x27;black/red sparkle&#x27; look without too much of a sandy matte look.</li>
            <li>Sparkly, but not too much.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, I still really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>put it on in thin coats and did do 3 coats because it just kept looking better and better</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on very easily and dried fast, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the textured finish lets you fix with zero effort the inevitable smudges you make from being so excited about your lava nails that you must tweet about it.</li>
            <li>OPI Stay the Night from the Mariah Carey collection is the first Mariah Carey thing I&#x27;ve loved since I was approximately 9.</li>
            <li>I had full opacity with two coats, no visible nail line, and the red just shimmers!</li>
            <li>love this color and finish, and I&#x27;m going to try the other sand polishes as well!</li>
            <li>It does take a little more work to remove it all traces of this polish, but I personally think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>You use it or apply it as you would with any normal textured lacquer.  </li>
            <li>This nail polish is so fun and different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a bit of a strange sandpaper like texture, but it&#x27;s liquid sand polish, so let&#x27;s be honest, it was to be expected.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as hoped but Absolutely love the color.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it looks gorgeous shiny, but why fix what isn&#x27;t broken?</li>
            <li>The photo of the product shows the color differently than it actually appears in sunlight or other type of lighting, but the color is still gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>The pink glitter is also nice in this, and I love how it just looks once its dried down to the textured finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second day of wear, and it&#x27;s held up pretty well -</li>
            <li>The black and red color combo is my favorite</li>
            <li>I nicked the tips of two nails and was able to fix them with a tiny dab of polish that disappeared into the lava about two minutes later, when it&#x27;s mostly dry to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it chips really fast.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty, but it does not last long on the nails.</li>
            <li>first coat goes on very sheer with loads of red glitter.</li>
            <li>this is saying a lot, as I have a very typing intensive jobs and tend to chip manicures after a few hours on their first day.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the sand polishes, but if you don&#x27;t like rough feeling polish, then it isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>So far I have one minute chip on my left thumbnail that I did not cap the end</li>
            <li>It was interesting to see the base was actually a deep eggplant purple color that obviously gets darker with more layers.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that I only gave this polish four stars instead of five because it required a lot of coats for opacity and took a Long time to dry.</li>

            <li> First I want to say that I only gave this polish four stars instead of five because it required a lot of coats for opacity and took a Long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Nail polish with good staying power (which also does mean it is a little hard to get off - must use acetone nail polish remover).</li>
            <li> I apply two coats over a base coat and with some touch-ups (which are very easy with this texture), can make the polish last an entire work week.  </li>
            <li> You must carry on, for at 2 thick coats or 3 thin coats you get a deep black with shimmering red glitter and fabulous texture.</li>
            <li> but it dulls once dry and looks crusty.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint (and it&#x27;s kinda gross) is that I have dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;The people who are posting that it isn&#x27;t shiny or that it is rough...</li>
            <li> However, with the second coat application (I used thin coats as advised), it was a complete transformation.</li>
            <li> The base dries to a unique crumbly looking matte, while the red glitter shines from within, almost like the embers of a fire...</li>
            <li> love sparkly things, and this polish does NOT disappoint, despite the matte finish of the base polish.</li>
            <li> Not shiny and not smooth.  </li>
            <li> and if I scratch and have this polish on you can see the dead skin cells on my nails</li>
            <li> dried fully matte.</li>
            <li> When I first began applying it, I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> The biggest downfall is that after a few months this polish &amp;#34;sets up&amp;#34; and becomes incredibly hard to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I usually get tons of compliments on my nail polish</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just me or what.</li>
            <li> The base polish seemed very thin, and was an icky grey color with the first coat.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles start to separate and its like trying to dab on thick, clumpy mud.  </li>
            <li> so they add a thick topcoat.</li>
            <li> It is a black jelly base with red glitter.</li>
            <li> it looks like a fake nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> it looks blah unfortunately.</li>
            <li> awful quality at a ridiculous price.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, I love it! It goes on smooth and when it dries it&#x27;s nice and bumpy and it looks so cool!</li>
            <li> I got this tonight and had to put it on ASAP.  It is really pretty!  I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sparkly, even with the liquid sand texture.  I like the texture because it makes the polish fool-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on in thin coats and did do 3 coats because it just kept looking better and better the darker it got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very easily and dried fast, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails look exactly like the picture (color) - except, of course, you can see a lot of sparkle in person!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who are posting that it isn&#x27;t shiny or that it is rough...IT IS LIQUID SAND.  Don&#x27;t take away stars because you don&#x27;t know what liquid sand means!  The product is exactly as described.  Not shiny and not smooth.  But really lovely if you know what to expect!!</li>
            <li> It was interesting to see the base was actually a deep eggplant purple color that obviously gets darker with more layers. The pink glitter is also nice in this, and I love how it just looks once its dried down to the textured finish. Beautiful and unique, recommend to all looking for a sexy, vampy nail polish!</li>
            <li> It is very pretty, but it does not last long on the nails.</li>
            <li> I received M45 stay the night today. it looks like a fake nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Such awful quality at a ridiculous price.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! So pretty, love the texture! After 2 days, it turns to a muted grayish. Apply another coat and it&#x27;s pretty again! I really like it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites! The black and red color combo is my favorite</li>
            <li> Love the color and texture, but the staying power leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I bought this liquid sand polish about 4 months ago.  I own about 75 different shades of nail polish, mostly OPI.  I originally loved the color of this polish.  I am not crazy about the gritty feel but after covering it with topcoat it looks beautiful.  Its also super easy to touch up if it chips.  The biggest downfall is that after a few months this polish &amp;#34;sets up&amp;#34; and becomes incredibly hard to get out of the bottle.  The brush bristles start to separate and its like trying to dab on thick, clumpy mud.  I have tried running the bottle under hot water, and rolling it in my hands to warm it up, but nothing works.  Buy the mini of this if you have to have it.  Otherwise, unless you wear it constantly until you run out, you will be wasting your money.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this polish dries sandy, but if you coat it with a layer or two of topcoat, you can get the &#x27;black/red sparkle&#x27; look without too much of a sandy matte look.</li>
            <li> The photo of the product shows the color differently than it actually appears in sunlight or other type of lighting, but the color is still gorgeous.  I am a big fan of OPI and this nail polish does not disappoint.  You use it or apply it as you would with any normal textured lacquer.  I love this color and the texture!</li>
            <li> I got this polish with my pedicure once &amp; my boyfriend loved it so naturally I had to find it. The liquid sand is very different from regular polishes but it is very pretty &amp; I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I usually get tons of compliments on my nail polish but this one didn&#x27;t elicit as many. The ruby sparkles and texture make it fun though. My only complaint (and it&#x27;s kinda gross) is that I have dry skin and if I scratch and have this polish on you can see the dead skin cells on my nails (ew! And embarrassing if you can&#x27;t steal away to wash your hands).</li>
            <li> I love the polish takes a bit to dry though.</li>
            <li> dried fully matte. really felt like sand in my polish (in a good way). while i liked it matte it looked a little ashy so i tried it with a top coat and its THIRSTY. took 4 coats of topcoat to be smooth and glassy</li>
            <li> OPI Stay the Night from the Mariah Carey collection is the first Mariah Carey thing I&#x27;ve loved since I was approximately 9. If you&#x27;ve watched as many volcano documentaries and movies as I have, you&#x27;ll instantly know why: LAVA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first coat goes on very sheer with loads of red glitter. You&#x27;ll immediately understand why this nail polish reminds some people of scabs. Fear not! You must carry on, for at 2 thick coats or 3 thin coats you get a deep black with shimmering red glitter and fabulous texture. That, my friends, is lava.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus to an already completely perfect polish, the textured finish lets you fix with zero effort the inevitable smudges you make from being so excited about your lava nails that you must tweet about it. I nicked the tips of two nails and was able to fix them with a tiny dab of polish that disappeared into the lava about two minutes later, when it&#x27;s mostly dry to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people like this polish better with a glossy finish so they add a thick topcoat. Yeah, it looks gorgeous shiny, but why fix what isn&#x27;t broken? I don&#x27;t understand what would possess someone to de-lava their lava nails. That&#x27;s insanity. This is love.</li>
            <li> when it dries it&#x27;s really gritty. I took it with me to a nail salon and to not have the gritty effect (I understand that it would have it, but it was overboard) and it looked great after a gel top coat. Would recommend for the look, but not the feel. Buy it, but understand you&#x27;re gonna need top coat.</li>
            <li> Sexy. Stylish. Fun. These are all of the words I can use to describe this polish. I really love it!!!</li>
            <li> There is something chic about this polish. Great for a night out, long lasting. Sparkly, but not too much.  love it!</li>
            <li> This nail polish looks great - almost like molten lava.  I really like the feel of the sand polishes, but if you don&#x27;t like rough feeling polish, then it isn&#x27;t for you.  I apply two coats over a base coat and with some touch-ups (which are very easy with this texture), can make the polish last an entire work week.  It does take a little more work to remove it all traces of this polish, but I personally think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is so fun and different. I always get compliments when I wear it. You will need to apply 2-3 coats for it to look right, but It dries really fast too. The only downfall is that it chips really fast. Not sure if it&#x27;s just me or what. Anyways, I still really like it.</li>
            <li> Sent it to a girlfriend, she painted her toes and fingers and sent me pics. I like the color and she liked it.</li>
            <li> This will be lovely for Halloween!  My fave in liquid sand is Get your number but this is pretty as well.</li>
            <li> A hint: I know the polish says not to use a topcoat, but I did topcoat on my ring fingers as the &amp;#34;accent nail&amp;#34; and the sheen is just gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love sparkly things, and this polish does NOT disappoint, despite the matte finish of the base polish. When I first began applying it, I was very skeptical. The base polish seemed very thin, and was an icky grey color with the first coat. However, with the second coat application (I used thin coats as advised), it was a complete transformation. I had full opacity with two coats, no visible nail line, and the red just shimmers! My geography professor was impressed because he said it looked like a magma flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a bit of a strange sandpaper like texture, but it&#x27;s liquid sand polish, so let&#x27;s be honest, it was to be expected. My husband loved that I was using the rough finish of my nail to scratch his back for him (lol). It&#x27;s my second day of wear, and it&#x27;s held up pretty well - this is saying a lot, as I have a very typing intensive jobs and tend to chip manicures after a few hours on their first day. So far I have one minute chip on my left thumbnail that I did not cap the end well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this color and finish, and I&#x27;m going to try the other sand polishes as well!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Got here in two days! Also cheaper then going to Target or Ulta for it. The OPI is now $9.00. I paid $7.00 for it. Works awesome. Don&#x27;t use a top coat. Worth the buy. This is something you will use over and over again! It&#x27;s my personal favorite one!</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I only gave this polish four stars instead of five because it required a lot of coats for opacity and took a Long time to dry. Other than that, I love love t polish! It is a black jelly base with red glitter. The base dries to a unique crumbly looking matte, while the red glitter shines from within, almost like the embers of a fire...just gorgeous. I bought the whole collection, and this one is my favorite by far. I got a million compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Nail polish with good staying power (which also does mean it is a little hard to get off - must use acetone nail polish remover). Like the color and matte finish.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as hoped but Absolutely love the color.</li>
            <li> Pretty color but it dulls once dry and looks crusty.  Even with extra top coats applied it looks blah unfortunately.</li>
