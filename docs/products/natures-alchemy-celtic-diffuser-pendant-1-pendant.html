            <li>Wonderful gift for family and friends.</li>
            <li>I am buying one for my best friend for Mothers Day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the shiny silver tone chain with the pewter-look pendant, but the pendant is really attractive.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get it to look good</li>
            <li>and it looks really cool not to mention, smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also gotten so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute piece of costume jewelry (which is what you&#x27;d expect for the price).  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I wear it while I am at work and really enjoy the aroma.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty good, but it absolutely does not stay shut.</li>
            <li>This item is really cool</li>
            <li>The charm came open very easily and the oil diffuser pad came out every time.  </li>
            <li>I love this essential oil jewelry and I often get compliments.</li>
            <li>I find as I am wearing the diffuser pendant that I occasionally get a whiff of lovely scent travel up to my nose.</li>
            <li>but it is not difficult to close.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I sutured the cotton pad a bit</li>
            <li>But dissapointment soon followed the first day my son wore it to school.</li>
            <li>, I was intrigued with the whole aromatherapy aspect of it.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has one and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size, not too big or too small.</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t know how to put it other than cheap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new tailsman</li>
            <li>and I will be VERY surprised if he comes home with his diffuser pad inside it.  </li>
            <li>The chain is a little long and it broke on the first day but it was easy to fix.</li>
            <li>My son lost his first pendant and I was able to keep it closed with a thicker pad, but this current pendant is WORSE than the first one.  </li>
            <li>I think I posted a higher rating earlier, but it does not stay closed and the pad falls out.  </li>

            <li> The other thing is you have to be careful with how much oil you apply to the cotton pad.</li>
            <li> I really like the look of this pendant especially since it&#x27;s for my son; however, I do NOT like that the pendant has a hard time staying closed and keeping the pads inside.  </li>
            <li> and then it is very difficult for my 13 year old to fit back together correctly so it will stay closed.</li>
            <li> I would probably quite like it if the neck chain was a little bit shorter because I find the pendant constantly falls between my breasts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY loose</li>
            <li> the rings aren&#x27;t closed</li>
            <li> Clasp does NOT stay closed.</li>
            <li> Even though this makes the diffuser nice and warm and inclined to exude plenty of aroma it appears annoying or wrong to people who view me wearing it as just a piece of jewelry at the wrong</li>
            <li> The point has to slide down and that is what locks it in.</li>
            <li> this pendent is hard to work with, the design makes it hard to open and stay closed.</li>
            <li> My son was excited about the idea of having an aromatherapy necklace but we are disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> The little cotton pad has fallen out and got lost everytime</li>
            <li> the snap together slide together on the bottom is difficult to do up and undo when needing to change the pad, while I dont mind the undo (make it to where it doesnt open during the day) when trying to close it back up it is difficult going back in.</li>
            <li> The locket is difficult to put back together once you&#x27;ve inserted the scent pad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is to keep the pads INSIDE the pendant OR how to contact seller for help...</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to open and close.</li>
            <li> I will wear it still, but the aroma aspect of it is quite limited.  : (</li>
            <li> I was saddened to find that the clasp is very weak.  </li>
            <li> However, the locket is difficult to put together; it doesn&#x27;t stay together.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I would not recommended this item.</li>
            <li> So the scent pad wound up dropping down my cleavage and giving me a terrible rash.  </li>
            <li> Very poor value!</li>
            <li> VERY unhappy with purchase.  </li>
            <li> I would not wear it as a piece of jewelry - the detailing is very crude, with chunks of solder and cut marks visible.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.  </li>

            <li> I wear this all the time and switch out the scents based on my mood or what I want to achieve. I&#x27;ve also gotten so many compliments.  I love it!</li>
            <li> the snap together slide together on the bottom is difficult to do up and undo when needing to change the pad, while I dont mind the undo (make it to where it doesnt open during the day) when trying to close it back up it is difficult going back in.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I didnt realize that it came with infuser pads also so that was an added bonus! Ive been wearing it since it came in the mail. Sturdy material and it looks really cool not to mention, smells wonderful! Thank You!</li>
            <li> this pendent is hard to work with, the design makes it hard to open and stay closed. Please make it have a magnetic to open and close and it will work well</li>

            <li> I bought this for my son, and he loves it.  It&#x27;s a great size, not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> I really like the look of this pendant especially since it&#x27;s for my son; however, I do NOT like that the pendant has a hard time staying closed and keeping the pads inside.

            <li> This product is not what it appears.  It&#x27;s a cute piece of costume jewelry (which is what you&#x27;d expect for the price).  I didn&#x27;t get it to look good, I was intrigued with the whole aromatherapy aspect of it.  However, the locket is difficult to put together; it doesn&#x27;t stay together.  So the scent pad wound up dropping down my cleavage and giving me a terrible rash.  Then the chain is. . .I just don&#x27;t know how to put it other than cheap.  It&#x27;s one of those chains that has triple rings linked together except the rings aren&#x27;t closed so they scratch at your neck all day and snag your clothing and hair.  It&#x27;s terrible.  I wouldn&#x27;t even give this away to the Goodwill.  I wound up trashing it.  I did not contact the seller; probably should have, but why bother.</li>
            <li> Wonderful gift for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I find as I am wearing the diffuser pendant that I occasionally get a whiff of lovely scent travel up to my nose. I would probably quite like it if the neck chain was a little bit shorter because I find the pendant constantly falls between my breasts.  Even though this makes the diffuser nice and warm and inclined to exude plenty of aroma it appears annoying or wrong to people who view me wearing it as just a piece of jewelry at the wrong length.&lt;br /&gt;However I definitely like the concept and it does work.</li>
            <li> I was saddened to find that the clasp is very weak.  I will wear it still, but the aroma aspect of it is quite limited.  : (</li>
            <li> Clasp opens and the diffuser pads fall out</li>
            <li> I opened shipping box to discover pendant out of product packaging laying in box.  There was no product insert.  Clasp does NOT stay closed. VERY unhappy with purchase.  Would not recommend to anyone - not even as costume jewelry.</li>
            <li> I think I posted a higher rating earlier, but it does not stay closed and the pad falls out.  I don&#x27;t like the shiny silver tone chain with the pewter-look pendant, but the pendant is really attractive.</li>
            <li> My son was excited about the idea of having an aromatherapy necklace but we are disappointed in this one. It is very difficult to open and close. You must remove the pendant from the chain to open it and then it is very difficult for my 13 year old to fit back together correctly so it will stay closed. Unfortunately, I would not recommended this item.</li>
            <li> I recieved this pendant as a gift and I love it. I have had no problems in keeping it together. Yes you do have to remove it off the chain to open and fill the pad but it is not difficult to close. The point has to slide down and that is what locks it in. I wear it while I am at work and really enjoy the aroma. My daughter has one and really likes it.  I am buying one for my best friend for Mothers Day.</li>
            <li> This item is really cool just takes some getting used to. Opening and closing the pendant are the hardest to get used to. The other thing is you have to be careful with how much oil you apply to the cotton pad. The first time I used it, I sutured the cotton pad a bit and it leaked out onto my shirt. Please note that this was my error, not a defect in the product. It&#x27;s my new tailsman and I really like it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast. But dissapointment soon followed the first day my son wore it to school. The charm came open very easily and the oil diffuser pad came out every time.  Defeated the purpose. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The chain is a little long and it broke on the first day but it was easy to fix.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty good, but it absolutely does not stay shut. The little cotton pad has fallen out and got lost everytime I&#x27;ve worn it. I am definitely getting something else.</li>
