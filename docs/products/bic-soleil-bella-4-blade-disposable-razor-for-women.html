    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>So happy to have found a razor that does its job without any nicks or cuts!</li>
            <li>Excellent razor, well priced.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>

            <li>Also very happy with the price.</li>
            <li>The best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The best razors at the best price.</li>
            <li>I researched this product on Amazon and concluded this was the best deal based on my belief</li>
            <li>I think the pivoting head is the best feature it has</li>
            <li>Again I had a very nice shave, but this time no nicks or cuts!</li>
            <li>Good for curves!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great that I can find them here.</li>
            <li>Skin feels and looks great</li>
            <li>I used to spend tones on replacement heads for my fancy razor but these are cheaper and work great.</li>
            <li>While the Bic Soleil Bella 4 blade Disposable Razor works really great</li>
            <li>Bic Soleil disposable razors are a great substitute.</li>
            <li>Works great with coochy shaving cream.</li>
            <li>did great.</li>
            <li>Very nice disposable razor.</li>
            <li>Great razors at a really good price when using subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li>The shave lasts for a good number of days.</li>
            <li>I picked these up for my wife, and she&#x27;s had nothing but good things to say about them.</li>
            <li>The handle shape gives a good thumb grip, and they do not slip.  </li>
            <li>If you like disposable razors, these are a good choice.</li>
            <li>the Bic Bella 4 Blade razors, I&#x27;ve gotten 3 good shaves on my legs with these razors.</li>
            <li>Good shave.</li>
            <li>These have a stationary head and make good contact on the skin.</li>
            <li>For a disposable razor, this is a good attempt.</li>
            <li>They do not give a good shave at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cover is good for travel because takes a bit of work to remove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, a good razor</li>
            <li>but they do a good job.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel, the fact they are disposable (great to take on trips), and they do a good job.</li>
            <li>Nice, very very nice no nicks,</li>
            <li>I love these - and they are a great price point.</li>
            <li>She says that the moisturizing strip is particularly effective (you can feel it going on) and that the razor itself has a good grip</li>
            <li>my favorite!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes they&#x27;re even better!</li>
            <li>They are great razors and give a close, smooth shave without nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>It shaves smoothly &amp; effectively.</li>
            <li>These are nicely shaped disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>I ended up with a nice shave as well as a cut, a nick and some irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I have struggled before to find razors that provide a nice, quality shave without falling apart or breaking while using them that didn&#x27;t cost upwards of $10 to $15.</li>
            <li>I liked the slim shape.  </li>
            <li>The handle has a nice feel, the razor is well balanced, and the blade has a plastic cover to protect it (and you) when not in use.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Bic Soleil Bella.</li>
            <li>When I was given the option to review a 3-count package of Bic Soleil Bella 4 Blade Disposable I jumped at the opportunity because I honestly could not recall why I switched from disposables.  </li>
            <li>and I honestly have a smoother shave.</li>
            <li>And the four blades give you a really nice close shave.</li>
            <li>moisture strip isn&#x27;t as effective as the ones on the Venus razors</li>
            <li>These follow curves nicely.</li>
            <li>and that was my own fault as I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to what I was doing.</li>
            <li>very nice smooth glide as you shave your legs</li>
            <li>I find these to be the best razors for intimate shaving areas as they are the types of razors that help me prevent razor burn the most.</li>
            <li>I have loved these razors forever and now that I can get them for a better price from Amazon life is even better.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and these razors work great!  </li>
            <li>&gt; The pivoting head made it very easy to handle around curved area of the body like the knees and underarms.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and blessed with mostly fine hair.</li>
            <li>because the hair is so lightly colored, but on my legs the shaves are spotty - I always have to go over spots 2 or 3 times to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Nice, close, safe shave with these.  </li>
            <li>This razor is good quality for the price and gives you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Both my S.O. and I have used it, with easy results!</li>
            <li>Excellent product and by far my favorite blade compaired to the competitors.</li>
            <li>These are awesome, the built in lotion really creates a smooth shaving experience.</li>
            <li>The Bic Soleil Bela 4 Blade disposable razor does offer a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Has a very comfortable, ergonomic grip.</li>
            <li>Gave a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>a nice moisturizing strip so that you can use it without shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Provides a smooth shave like the Venus disposables.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite razors are Schick Hydros, but for disposables these Bics aren&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The sideways cover of the blade is a much better design than a snap on.  </li>
            <li>but, I am also, for the most part, a patient shaver.</li>
            <li>Overall, excellent buy.</li>
            <li>I wish they would maintain that nice juiciness longer though, ya know, the lotion that is on there that automatically applies to your skin and makes it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I like that most razors these days, including these Bic Soleil Bella, have a slide-on cover over the blades rather than a snap-on.</li>
            <li>Also as with most razors, these also have the grooves to help lift the hairs for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>While the blade does have some rotation, I&#x27;ve used razors with more flexibility than this one.  </li>
            <li>I have found that for the more stubborn hairs, these produce that dreaded &amp;#</li>
            <li>These ARE better then the one or two use razors.</li>
            <li>But there are still better options.</li>
            <li>It gave me a nice smooth shave without feeling scratchy or nicking my legs at all.</li>
            <li>The Bic Soleil Bella is the latest in the Bic Soleil line of disposable shavers.</li>
            <li>The razors glide smoothly and always cut nicely.</li>
            <li>All in all I’ve been really pleased with the way this razor performs..</li>
            <li>I was able to use it twice (on my legs).</li>
            <li>Love that I got these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They have a top that slides on to protect them and you can use them more than one time.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>The handle is wider than most disposable razors and has ample rubberized grips, on both sides for a better grasp and directional pull during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>my skin is nice and smooth after I shave.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than in the store by $0.20 and with prime shipped here for free, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>Also, because the razor head doesn&#x27;t move, when you get up to your knees you have to be fairly skilled to get every hair.  </li>
            <li>: make sure to get the 4-blade ones.</li>
            <li>I do wish they would sell them in packs of more than three though.</li>
            <li>I love the Bic Soleil disposables.</li>
            <li>Was more thank</li>
            <li>Razor is comfortable to hold and glides nicely.</li>
            <li>Okay-</li>
            <li>I feel you should get more razors for the price</li>
            <li>I am in love they work better then my husbands razor.</li>
            <li>These are ok.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was easy to clean</li>
            <li>Worth paying more for than the cheapies!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very good inexpensive razor that I would definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li>so I’m sure they’re free of hair, shaving cream residue, and so they don’t rust.</li>
            <li>This razor exhibits many great qualities and offers an easy and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These work much better than the original Soleil.</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to use and re-use if you like.</li>
            <li>It glides easily over my legs and didn&#x27;t miss any spots.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and doesn&#x27;t rash your skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave (way, way better than the cheap Target-brand razors I was using).  </li>
            <li>No nicks or cuts and moved around the knees and ankles quite easily.</li>
            <li>, this razor has a lot to recommend it, and it may be a good solution for you, particularly if you don&#x27;t like the moisture strip on the Venus razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still though, the Bic Soleil Bella has a nice, smooth cut and the right balance.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap, I never nick myself with them, they&#x27;re efficient, easy to use, and they get a close shave.</li>
            <li>but this held up fine.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the handle because it is smooth and has an easy grip so it is better to handle.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, easy to handle, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The razors really are easy to rinse and stores nicely in the shower caddy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Glides smoothly over the legs and is fine on the underarms, as well&lt;</li>
            <li>Love the pretty colors these come in!  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor those who love a smooth shave but has sensitive skin like I do and worry about irritation I love this razor it gives a clean shave and no irritation or cuts I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>The four blades give me a close, precise shave.  </li>
            <li>handle is comfortable and has a no-slip grip for index finger and thumb.</li>
            <li>the head doesn&#x27;t fit well in those spaces.</li>
            <li>no scrapes just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>These razors give a close, smooth shave, even on your curvy areas.  </li>
            <li>® Soleil Bella® razor has four flexible blades, a Soothing Moisture Strip® enriched with coconut milk and a pivoting head that follows every contour for a flawlessly smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Bic Soleil Bella 4 Blade Disposable Razor for Women, 3 count, sound like what you may be looking for?</li>
            <li>I like these razors; my legs seem to stay smooth longer.  </li>
            <li>Skin is smooth, not irritated.</li>
            <li>This Bic Soleil does not get as close and smooth of a shave as the Schick Hydro Silk (which has 5 blades, versus Bic Soleil&#x27;s 4 blades).  </li>
            <li>The four and five blades make all of the difference in getting a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>but it also shaves smoothly without irritation.</li>
            <li>I have always had good success with Bic shaving products and will continue using the Bic Soleil Bella, with the price of razors, the combination of quality and price with this product really cant be beat.</li>
            <li>although I did not nick or cut myself and the pivoting head made it super easy for contours on the arms and legs.</li>
            <li>The 4 blades make for an easy and effective means to clear the hair with one swipe.</li>
            <li>But they were great on long strokes on legs without clogging!</li>
            <li>You will love how soft and sexy your legs will feel.</li>
            <li>She also says that it&#x27;s great under the arms and leaves it smooth, not itchy and bumpy like some other razors.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend these to someone looking for a good razor that is light-weight and disposable.</li>
            <li>this one does not work significantly better than the brands with smaller heads to make it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>It has to be the razors because I have pretty light hair, which doesn’t grow quickly, and I do have an electric - which I use very occasionally that gets all the hair the first time around, but it’s not as good with all the curves of a woman’s body..</li>
            <li>To be fair, the shave was very close, smooth, and nic free, however my legs feel as though they have been scratched up, which is definitely a minus.  </li>
            <li>very close shave easy fat handle</li>
            <li>only good thing is they are pretty</li>
            <li>These are my favorite razors, been using them for nearly a decade!</li>
            <li>They have a nice grip, do not slip, and the plastic cover over the blade is easy to get off/on with wet fingers and</li>
            <li>These razors cut really well and gives me smooth legs after shaving</li>
            <li>34;tug n pull.&amp;#34; I have actually had much more comfortable success with men&#x27;s razors in this class.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to obtain several shaves from a single razor before noticing any difference, so it&#x27;s not a product that needs to be tossed after a single use.&lt;br /&gt;These would be great for travel, a gym bag and to have on hand for guests who may have neglected to bring their own razor.</li>
            <li>The blade seems to stay sharp for a good while.</li>
            <li>These are disposable, and they are handy to take on a trip and leave behind in the trash, but, they are a bit too nice to be using all the time.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and end up with razor burn easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly surprised that a disposable razor could get such a good shape.  </li>
            <li>dont waste your money... dont save some bucks its better to pay more and have quality razor.</li>
            <li>I am grateful I had the experience of going back to disposables, my question has been answered and I will continue using my trusty Gillette Venus Embrace, which offers a fabulous shave, leaves my legs smooth, and irritation free after being shaved.</li>
            <li>I even left one in the car, just in case :)</li>
            <li>Overall, this was not my favorite razor</li>
            <li>but I might be willing to give it another try.</li>
            <li>Ok, I can tell the difference from my last disposable razor using the Bic Soleil Bella.</li>
            <li>Today was my first time using one of them</li>
            <li>this was my first time using 4 blades.</li>
            <li>I was only able to get four, maybe five shaves out of one.</li>
            <li>This is not my first experience with Bic Disposable Razors.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>After the first use the razor did not work at all.</li>
            <li>I do feel like there is a good amount of waste with this product.</li>
            <li>I liked them, but they stopped working much sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li>That may be a positive to some, just not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself has been durable and the first razor has lasted very well.</li>
            <li>Not sure how these razors got good ratings from others.  </li>
            <li>The handle shape was easy enough to use without being too clunky.  </li>
            <li>These little disposable razors pretty much hold their own with Venus Embrace, which is what I&#x27;ve been using for years before buying these on a hunch.</li>
            <li>The large handle makes it easy to hold on to when wet and get the job done right</li>
            <li>If You have sensitive skin, this is a high quality disposable razor, the four blades really make a difference and provide a clean smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and they hold up well and will provide multiple uses.</li>
            <li>The four blades were super smooth and sharp</li>
            <li>They are a good length for getting down to the ankle area without major contortions in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades are somewhat flexible and give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to shave the same area two or three times to get them smooth.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the product was as described.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!  </li>
            <li>These disposables shave VERY well.  </li>
            <li>piece, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about matching handles with disposable blade cartridges (just toss the whole</li>
            <li>I really like the colors.</li>
            <li>Overall I probably would buy again as a cheap throwaway razor.</li>
            <li>These blades are sharp though, as most blades are,</li>
            <li>I love these razors and I refuse to use any other.</li>
            <li>The main reason is the fact I still cannot get a very close shave with the Bic Soleil Bellas.</li>
            <li>I have used BIC razors before and this Soleil is much improved over the older BIC versions.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a razor thats economical, sharp and safe look no further!</li>
            <li>It leaves her legs feeling soft and smooth (I will second this).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually with disposables I get one decent shave of my underarms and legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So while it is a decent quality razor, I&#x27;m not sold.</li>
            <li>Next time I need a disposable razor, will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting that disposable razors are priced at what regular razors used to be, and regular razors are now through the roof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>For a disposable razor, this is high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A high quality razor for those who like disposable.</li>
            <li>But all ladies have hairs that are a little more stubborn.</li>
            <li>as easy to maneuver as other razors around the knees and ankles</li>
            <li>This razor works as expected and smoothly for finer hairs.</li>
            <li>After shaving I always rinse well, clean, wipe, and dry my razors -</li>
            <li>/&gt;These disposable razors provided a safe shave with no nicks or cuts and performed very well in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about the product is the fact that it&#x27;s entirely disposable and costs more than I care to pay for a disposable</li>
            <li>I usually use the Venus Embrace razor that has refillable cartridges - but the latest replacement blades are much narrower and shorter and just do not work as well for me.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to try out a new disposable give these a try.</li>
            <li>They shave nice and smooth with out any irritation or cutting of the skin.</li>
            <li>She uses them in the shower with no other moisturizer or shaving cream/gel, and she says that it gives her a very close shave with no cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li>I accidentally bought the 3 blade kind of the same razor line and they pale in comparison.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing strips did not get gooey when exposed to water like most of the other razors that have similar strips.</li>
            <li>and they last pretty well for a disposable.</li>
            <li>I usually use the [[ASIN:B006DR2BEW Schick Hydro Silk for Women Razor]], which I love.  </li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hold and control with little effort.  </li>
            <li>Another important thing for me is that while they are disposable they really last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Trying to save a little money, I tried these razors because I had a coupon for buy one get one free.  </li>
            <li>did feel some catching and drag on underarms, and a little on knees.</li>
            <li>Downside is the protective cover which is hard to put on without touching it.</li>
            <li>The protective cover will only slide on/off one way, which is a nice little safety feature, especially when traveling.</li>
            <li>This cap slides on but does well protecting sensitive fingertips from the blade.</li>
            <li>I will buy these razors again over my old one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Ahh, I love that, but it only lasts a few shaves.</li>
            <li>Using expensive gel or cheap cream shaving soap, blades rinsed clean (every time) and shaving time was faster-than-ever as I didn&#x27;t have to go over each area twice (as with a traditional Bic 2 blade) for a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not my first buy (I mean, I bought them before I saw these in Vine which I got for free obviously) and I plan to do it again.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely repurchase, and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I found that these razors, although very reasonably priced, were fairly rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>This review will contain some comparative information so you can decide if these are right for you, or whether you&#x27;d rather try a different razor (since different people look for different things in a razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use a new one for each private area shave.</li>
            <li>Two days later, the hair isn&#x27;t very noticeable, but the stubble can be definitely be felt.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time to try a Bic disposable razor, though I have tried other brands.  </li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t use/like disposable razors, but I like to keep them on hand in our guest bathroom and in my travel case (for use while I&#x27;m on vacation).  </li>
            <li>The moisture strip generally wears out before the blades do.</li>
            <li>I am a bigger fan of the 3 Blade for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li>These razors for sensitive skin have finally put an end to all the itching and discomfort.</li>
            <li>If you look at similar ads, the titles or product descriptions will make it very clear that you&#x27;ll get, for example, \\&quot;two packages (3 count; total six items)\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the Bic Soleil Bella has 4 blades and the colors are cute, however the head does not pivot, it is narrow, which for me was not a plus, however if one is looking for a narrow headed razor, this could be the one, and I found the razor irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>do the same job as the Venus for me as far as actual shaving goes - I still have stubble the next day (stubborn Scandinavian hair!)</li>
            <li>It glides over a large area at the same time and it took much less time to shave with this razor than with my Gillette.</li>
            <li>A decent shave but maybe not worth the price given the options.</li>
            <li>The other razor that I&#x27;ve been using prior to receiving this product has 3 blades, moisture strip and allows me to purchase new cartridge heads without tossing the razor base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my legs due to a medication I have taken.</li>

            <li> I picked these up for my wife, and she&#x27;s had nothing but good things to say about them.</li>
            <li> The handle shape gives a good thumb grip, and they do not slip.  </li>
            <li> If you like disposable razors, these are a good choice.</li>
            <li> the Bic Bella 4 Blade razors, I&#x27;ve gotten 3 good shaves on my legs with these razors.</li>
            <li> Good shave.</li>
            <li> These have a stationary head and make good contact on the skin.</li>
            <li> For a disposable razor, this is a good attempt.</li>
            <li> They do not give a good shave at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cover is good for travel because takes a bit of work to remove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, a good razor</li>
            <li> but they do a good job.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel, the fact they are disposable (great to take on trips), and they do a good job.</li>
            <li> Nice, very very nice no nicks,</li>
            <li> I love these - and they are a great price point.</li>
            <li> She says that the moisturizing strip is particularly effective (you can feel it going on) and that the razor itself has a good grip</li>
            <li> my favorite!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes they&#x27;re even better!</li>
            <li> They are great razors and give a close, smooth shave without nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> It shaves smoothly &amp; effectively.</li>
            <li> These are nicely shaped disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a nice shave as well as a cut, a nick and some irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I have struggled before to find razors that provide a nice, quality shave without falling apart or breaking while using them that didn&#x27;t cost upwards of $10 to $15.</li>
            <li> I liked the slim shape.  </li>
            <li> The handle has a nice feel, the razor is well balanced, and the blade has a plastic cover to protect it (and you) when not in use.</li>
            <li> I really liked the Bic Soleil Bella.</li>
            <li> When I was given the option to review a 3-count package of Bic Soleil Bella 4 Blade Disposable I jumped at the opportunity because I honestly could not recall why I switched from disposables.  </li>
            <li> and I honestly have a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> And the four blades give you a really nice close shave.</li>
            <li> moisture strip isn&#x27;t as effective as the ones on the Venus razors</li>
            <li> These follow curves nicely.</li>
            <li> and that was my own fault as I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to what I was doing.</li>
            <li> very nice smooth glide as you shave your legs</li>
            <li> I find these to be the best razors for intimate shaving areas as they are the types of razors that help me prevent razor burn the most.</li>
            <li> I have loved these razors forever and now that I can get them for a better price from Amazon life is even better.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and these razors work great!  </li>
            <li> &gt; The pivoting head made it very easy to handle around curved area of the body like the knees and underarms.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and blessed with mostly fine hair.</li>
            <li> because the hair is so lightly colored, but on my legs the shaves are spotty - I always have to go over spots 2 or 3 times to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Nice, close, safe shave with these.  </li>
            <li> This razor is good quality for the price and gives you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Both my S.O. and I have used it, with easy results!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and by far my favorite blade compaired to the competitors.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, the built in lotion really creates a smooth shaving experience.</li>
            <li> The Bic Soleil Bela 4 Blade disposable razor does offer a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Has a very comfortable, ergonomic grip.</li>
            <li> Gave a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> a nice moisturizing strip so that you can use it without shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Provides a smooth shave like the Venus disposables.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite razors are Schick Hydros, but for disposables these Bics aren&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The sideways cover of the blade is a much better design than a snap on.  </li>
            <li> but, I am also, for the most part, a patient shaver.</li>
            <li> Overall, excellent buy.</li>
            <li> I wish they would maintain that nice juiciness longer though, ya know, the lotion that is on there that automatically applies to your skin and makes it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I like that most razors these days, including these Bic Soleil Bella, have a slide-on cover over the blades rather than a snap-on.</li>
            <li> Also as with most razors, these also have the grooves to help lift the hairs for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> While the blade does have some rotation, I&#x27;ve used razors with more flexibility than this one.  </li>
            <li> I have found that for the more stubborn hairs, these produce that dreaded &amp;#</li>
            <li> These ARE better then the one or two use razors.</li>
            <li> But there are still better options.</li>
            <li> It gave me a nice smooth shave without feeling scratchy or nicking my legs at all.</li>
            <li> The Bic Soleil Bella is the latest in the Bic Soleil line of disposable shavers.</li>
            <li> The razors glide smoothly and always cut nicely.</li>
            <li> All in all I’ve been really pleased with the way this razor performs..</li>
            <li> I was able to use it twice (on my legs).</li>
            <li> Love that I got these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> They have a top that slides on to protect them and you can use them more than one time.  </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> The handle is wider than most disposable razors and has ample rubberized grips, on both sides for a better grasp and directional pull during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> my skin is nice and smooth after I shave.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in the store by $0.20 and with prime shipped here for free, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Also, because the razor head doesn&#x27;t move, when you get up to your knees you have to be fairly skilled to get every hair.  </li>
            <li> : make sure to get the 4-blade ones.</li>
            <li> I do wish they would sell them in packs of more than three though.</li>
            <li> I love the Bic Soleil disposables.</li>
            <li> Was more thank</li>
            <li> Razor is comfortable to hold and glides nicely.</li>
            <li> Okay-</li>
            <li> I feel you should get more razors for the price</li>
            <li> I am in love they work better then my husbands razor.</li>
            <li> These are ok.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was easy to clean</li>
            <li> Worth paying more for than the cheapies!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a very good inexpensive razor that I would definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> so I’m sure they’re free of hair, shaving cream residue, and so they don’t rust.</li>
            <li> This razor exhibits many great qualities and offers an easy and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These work much better than the original Soleil.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to use and re-use if you like.</li>
            <li> It glides easily over my legs and didn&#x27;t miss any spots.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and doesn&#x27;t rash your skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave (way, way better than the cheap Target-brand razors I was using).  </li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts and moved around the knees and ankles quite easily.</li>
            <li> , this razor has a lot to recommend it, and it may be a good solution for you, particularly if you don&#x27;t like the moisture strip on the Venus razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still though, the Bic Soleil Bella has a nice, smooth cut and the right balance.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap, I never nick myself with them, they&#x27;re efficient, easy to use, and they get a close shave.</li>
            <li> but this held up fine.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the handle because it is smooth and has an easy grip so it is better to handle.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, easy to handle, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The razors really are easy to rinse and stores nicely in the shower caddy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Glides smoothly over the legs and is fine on the underarms, as well&lt;</li>
            <li> Love the pretty colors these come in!  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor those who love a smooth shave but has sensitive skin like I do and worry about irritation I love this razor it gives a clean shave and no irritation or cuts I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The four blades give me a close, precise shave.  </li>
            <li> handle is comfortable and has a no-slip grip for index finger and thumb.</li>
            <li> the head doesn&#x27;t fit well in those spaces.</li>
            <li> no scrapes just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> These razors give a close, smooth shave, even on your curvy areas.  </li>
            <li> ® Soleil Bella® razor has four flexible blades, a Soothing Moisture Strip® enriched with coconut milk and a pivoting head that follows every contour for a flawlessly smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Bic Soleil Bella 4 Blade Disposable Razor for Women, 3 count, sound like what you may be looking for?</li>
            <li> I like these razors; my legs seem to stay smooth longer.  </li>
            <li> Skin is smooth, not irritated.</li>
            <li> This Bic Soleil does not get as close and smooth of a shave as the Schick Hydro Silk (which has 5 blades, versus Bic Soleil&#x27;s 4 blades).  </li>
            <li> The four and five blades make all of the difference in getting a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> but it also shaves smoothly without irritation.</li>
            <li> I have always had good success with Bic shaving products and will continue using the Bic Soleil Bella, with the price of razors, the combination of quality and price with this product really cant be beat.</li>
            <li> although I did not nick or cut myself and the pivoting head made it super easy for contours on the arms and legs.</li>
            <li> The 4 blades make for an easy and effective means to clear the hair with one swipe.</li>
            <li> But they were great on long strokes on legs without clogging!</li>
            <li> You will love how soft and sexy your legs will feel.</li>
            <li> She also says that it&#x27;s great under the arms and leaves it smooth, not itchy and bumpy like some other razors.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend these to someone looking for a good razor that is light-weight and disposable.</li>
            <li> this one does not work significantly better than the brands with smaller heads to make it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> It has to be the razors because I have pretty light hair, which doesn’t grow quickly, and I do have an electric - which I use very occasionally that gets all the hair the first time around, but it’s not as good with all the curves of a woman’s body..</li>
            <li> To be fair, the shave was very close, smooth, and nic free, however my legs feel as though they have been scratched up, which is definitely a minus.  </li>
            <li> very close shave easy fat handle</li>
            <li> only good thing is they are pretty</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors, been using them for nearly a decade!</li>
            <li> They have a nice grip, do not slip, and the plastic cover over the blade is easy to get off/on with wet fingers and</li>
            <li> These razors cut really well and gives me smooth legs after shaving</li>
            <li> 34;tug n pull.&amp;#34; I have actually had much more comfortable success with men&#x27;s razors in this class.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to obtain several shaves from a single razor before noticing any difference, so it&#x27;s not a product that needs to be tossed after a single use.&lt;br /&gt;These would be great for travel, a gym bag and to have on hand for guests who may have neglected to bring their own razor.</li>
            <li> The blade seems to stay sharp for a good while.</li>
            <li> These are disposable, and they are handy to take on a trip and leave behind in the trash, but, they are a bit too nice to be using all the time.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and end up with razor burn easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly surprised that a disposable razor could get such a good shape.  </li>
            <li> dont waste your money... dont save some bucks its better to pay more and have quality razor.</li>
            <li> I am grateful I had the experience of going back to disposables, my question has been answered and I will continue using my trusty Gillette Venus Embrace, which offers a fabulous shave, leaves my legs smooth, and irritation free after being shaved.</li>
            <li> I even left one in the car, just in case :)</li>
            <li> Overall, this was not my favorite razor</li>
            <li> but I might be willing to give it another try.</li>
            <li> Ok, I can tell the difference from my last disposable razor using the Bic Soleil Bella.</li>
            <li> Today was my first time using one of them</li>
            <li> this was my first time using 4 blades.</li>
            <li> I was only able to get four, maybe five shaves out of one.</li>
            <li> This is not my first experience with Bic Disposable Razors.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> After the first use the razor did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I do feel like there is a good amount of waste with this product.</li>
            <li> I liked them, but they stopped working much sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> That may be a positive to some, just not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product itself has been durable and the first razor has lasted very well.</li>
            <li> Not sure how these razors got good ratings from others.  </li>
            <li> The handle shape was easy enough to use without being too clunky.  </li>
            <li> These little disposable razors pretty much hold their own with Venus Embrace, which is what I&#x27;ve been using for years before buying these on a hunch.</li>
            <li> The large handle makes it easy to hold on to when wet and get the job done right</li>
            <li> If You have sensitive skin, this is a high quality disposable razor, the four blades really make a difference and provide a clean smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and they hold up well and will provide multiple uses.</li>
            <li> The four blades were super smooth and sharp</li>
            <li> They are a good length for getting down to the ankle area without major contortions in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades are somewhat flexible and give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave the same area two or three times to get them smooth.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the product was as described.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!  </li>
            <li> These disposables shave VERY well.  </li>
            <li> piece, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about matching handles with disposable blade cartridges (just toss the whole</li>
            <li> I really like the colors.</li>
            <li> Overall I probably would buy again as a cheap throwaway razor.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp though, as most blades are,</li>
            <li> I love these razors and I refuse to use any other.</li>
            <li> The main reason is the fact I still cannot get a very close shave with the Bic Soleil Bellas.</li>
            <li> I have used BIC razors before and this Soleil is much improved over the older BIC versions.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a razor thats economical, sharp and safe look no further!</li>
            <li> It leaves her legs feeling soft and smooth (I will second this).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually with disposables I get one decent shave of my underarms and legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So while it is a decent quality razor, I&#x27;m not sold.</li>
            <li> Next time I need a disposable razor, will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting that disposable razors are priced at what regular razors used to be, and regular razors are now through the roof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> For a disposable razor, this is high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A high quality razor for those who like disposable.</li>
            <li> But all ladies have hairs that are a little more stubborn.</li>
            <li> as easy to maneuver as other razors around the knees and ankles</li>
            <li> This razor works as expected and smoothly for finer hairs.</li>
            <li> After shaving I always rinse well, clean, wipe, and dry my razors -</li>
            <li> /&gt;These disposable razors provided a safe shave with no nicks or cuts and performed very well in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about the product is the fact that it&#x27;s entirely disposable and costs more than I care to pay for a disposable</li>
            <li> I usually use the Venus Embrace razor that has refillable cartridges - but the latest replacement blades are much narrower and shorter and just do not work as well for me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to try out a new disposable give these a try.</li>
            <li> They shave nice and smooth with out any irritation or cutting of the skin.</li>
            <li> She uses them in the shower with no other moisturizer or shaving cream/gel, and she says that it gives her a very close shave with no cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought the 3 blade kind of the same razor line and they pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strips did not get gooey when exposed to water like most of the other razors that have similar strips.</li>
            <li> and they last pretty well for a disposable.</li>
            <li> I usually use the [[ASIN:B006DR2BEW Schick Hydro Silk for Women Razor]], which I love.  </li>
            <li> The handle is easy to hold and control with little effort.  </li>
            <li> Another important thing for me is that while they are disposable they really last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Trying to save a little money, I tried these razors because I had a coupon for buy one get one free.  </li>
            <li> did feel some catching and drag on underarms, and a little on knees.</li>
            <li> Downside is the protective cover which is hard to put on without touching it.</li>
            <li> The protective cover will only slide on/off one way, which is a nice little safety feature, especially when traveling.</li>
            <li> This cap slides on but does well protecting sensitive fingertips from the blade.</li>
            <li> I will buy these razors again over my old one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Ahh, I love that, but it only lasts a few shaves.</li>
            <li> Using expensive gel or cheap cream shaving soap, blades rinsed clean (every time) and shaving time was faster-than-ever as I didn&#x27;t have to go over each area twice (as with a traditional Bic 2 blade) for a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not my first buy (I mean, I bought them before I saw these in Vine which I got for free obviously) and I plan to do it again.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely repurchase, and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I found that these razors, although very reasonably priced, were fairly rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> This review will contain some comparative information so you can decide if these are right for you, or whether you&#x27;d rather try a different razor (since different people look for different things in a razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use a new one for each private area shave.</li>
            <li> Two days later, the hair isn&#x27;t very noticeable, but the stubble can be definitely be felt.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time to try a Bic disposable razor, though I have tried other brands.  </li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t use/like disposable razors, but I like to keep them on hand in our guest bathroom and in my travel case (for use while I&#x27;m on vacation).  </li>
            <li> The moisture strip generally wears out before the blades do.</li>
            <li> I am a bigger fan of the 3 Blade for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> These razors for sensitive skin have finally put an end to all the itching and discomfort.</li>
            <li> If you look at similar ads, the titles or product descriptions will make it very clear that you&#x27;ll get, for example, \\&quot;two packages (3 count; total six items)\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the Bic Soleil Bella has 4 blades and the colors are cute, however the head does not pivot, it is narrow, which for me was not a plus, however if one is looking for a narrow headed razor, this could be the one, and I found the razor irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> do the same job as the Venus for me as far as actual shaving goes - I still have stubble the next day (stubborn Scandinavian hair!)</li>
            <li> It glides over a large area at the same time and it took much less time to shave with this razor than with my Gillette.</li>
            <li> A decent shave but maybe not worth the price given the options.</li>
            <li> The other razor that I&#x27;ve been using prior to receiving this product has 3 blades, moisture strip and allows me to purchase new cartridge heads without tossing the razor base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my legs due to a medication I have taken.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty mint green, teal blue, and a dark sea blue.  </li>
            <li> While it took only one swipe on my underarms rather than the usual two (though there wasn&#x27;t much hair to begin with), I noticed that my legs felt stubbly by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Razors like this are pretty common</li>
            <li> The head of the razor doesn&#x27;t bend as easily when going over the contours and it leaves uncomfortable stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Bic Soleil Bella only a few times so far, so</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t last as long - with the older style blades for the Venus they would last me for at least 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But more significantly, I noticed a really weird, almost tingly feeling before nighttime that I have not experienced with previous razors.</li>
            <li> I though maybe my skin was just having a bad time of its own, until I went back to using a Venus razor, and no, it&#x27;s just the bics are harder on your skin.</li>
            <li> Shaving creme or gel is definitely needed, but that is to be expected with a disposable.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve come a long way through the years.  </li>
            <li> Will use these for as long as they are around.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t yet know how long they will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Are sharp enough to use multiple times but aren&#x27;t so sharp in the beginning that they leave you bleeding.  </li>
            <li> I was shaving my back thigh going very slowly and gently</li>
            <li> It helps if you keep it dry when not in use.</li>
            <li> No nicks or dry patches from razor burn - always</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the head is so big that it makes shaving in areas such as the ankle of armpit</li>
            <li> With two children who use my shower and tend to knock things over, I know that they&#x27;re less likely to injure themselves on my razors since the covers won&#x27;t pop</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re less likely to cut yourself plus you should get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I called Amazon customer service and was issued a refund (credit toward next purchase) of half my cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just learned that you can extend the time you use a razor blade by cleaning it on an old piece of denim after it goes dull.  </li>
            <li> and when it get wets i can hold it without slipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cover takes a bit of work to remove so careful taking it off the razor blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I tried one out, even though I&#x27;m partial to the Gillette Venus line of women&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li> After receiving a different, more expensive product that was absolutely horrible, I appreciate this product even more.</li>
            <li> The only downside is, if you are using a cream and shaving my legs dry, it&#x27;s hard to get the soap out of the blades (even if they&#x27;re sharp and can use it again).  </li>
            <li> I got an extremely close shave, closer than any other razor I’ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would compare it to any other disposable razor.</li>
            <li> The other thing I do like about these is the razor head cover.</li>
            <li> These are fully disposable and the other is disposable heads.  </li>
            <li> but I have not had any nicks or other issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other disposables on the market.</li>
            <li> This razor has a flat blade so that when you run it up like your leg, there are no cuts like with razors usually.  </li>
            <li> They hold up about average.</li>
            <li> Each razor has a thick, plastic, protective cover that slides off for use, and back on for storage/travel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*The moisture strip doesn&#x27;t stick to the tub if you set it down</li>
            <li> The blades on the razors are very very sharp and it gave me baby cuts almost every 4 glides.</li>
            <li> Since I switched from the three blade version to this one, partly because of the subscribe and save discount, I&#x27;ve noticed less razor burn and nicks.</li>
            <li> and I swear the dang thing missed half my hairs.</li>
            <li> With the other razors I’m not sure how I’m doing with my underarms -</li>
            <li> My last cut was the worse.</li>
            <li> The shave lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> I notice within a few strokes hair is gone, even if I get a little lazy and skip a few days.</li>
            <li> I can usually get a few uses out of a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> It must something simple but got so frustrated I&#x27;m taking them back.</li>
            <li> The blades rinsed well - no need for excessive wiping to get hair out from between the blades.</li>
            <li> then others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> And men&#x27;s versions  and store brands are usually cheaper.</li>
            <li> Just picked up a package of 2 Bic flex 5 razors and have already broken one trying to get the cover off the blade now no luck with the other.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull before you even use them.  </li>
            <li> I thought the razors would get dull under the water</li>
            <li> (this is probably my biggest complaint about the Venus razors)&lt;br /&gt;*One</li>
            <li> I was forced to steal my husbands razors.</li>
            <li> and apparently it cut through my skin, and it was extremely painful.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, no nicks, even on tricky spots like knees &amp; ankles.</li>
            <li> I also feel that anything over 2 blades is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> and I was not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to find a women&#x27;s razor that will shave without leaving hair behind.</li>
            <li> It also gave me a big of razor burn, not the worst of any razor, but definitely not a pleasant shaving experience.</li>
            <li> difficult--</li>
            <li> Razors are so expensive.</li>
            <li> Shaving used to be tedious for me but these razors save me time in the shower.</li>
            <li> This Bic disposable razors do offer a close shave, but the angle of the shaving head is very weird, which makes shaving awkward and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad package of razors.  </li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the Bic Soleil Bella for Women razors.  </li>
            <li> I honestly hate these razors.</li>
            <li> Some of them are just dreadful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So happy to have found a razor that does its job without any nicks or cuts! This razor is easy to use and re-use if you like. It shaves smoothly &amp; effectively. The large handle makes it easy to hold on to when wet and get the job done right( especially when you are in a rush). The shave lasts for a good number of days. If you are looking for a razor thats economical, sharp and safe look no further! Would definitely be re-purchasing this razor.</li>
            <li> If You have sensitive skin, this is a high quality disposable razor, the four blades really make a difference and provide a clean smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and they hold up well and will provide multiple uses. I have always had good success with Bic shaving products and will continue using the Bic Soleil Bella, with the price of razors, the combination of quality and price with this product really cant be beat.</li>
            <li> I use these every time I shave &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and my armpits. I use a new one for each private area shave. But then I continue to use the same razor for my legs for a week or so.  I find these to be the best razors for intimate shaving areas as they are the types of razors that help me prevent razor burn the most.</li>
            <li> I picked these up for my wife, and she&#x27;s had nothing but good things to say about them. She uses them in the shower with no other moisturizer or shaving cream/gel, and she says that it gives her a very close shave with no cuts or razor burn. It leaves her legs feeling soft and smooth (I will second this). She says that the moisturizing strip is particularly effective (you can feel it going on) and that the razor itself has a good grip (it doesn&#x27;t slip out of her hand while she&#x27;s using it in the shower). She also says that it&#x27;s great under the arms and leaves it smooth, not itchy and bumpy like some other razors. Basically, the Bic Soleil Bella 4 Blade Disposable razor is a winner.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, well priced.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice moisturizing strip so that you can use it without shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Provides a smooth shave like the Venus disposables.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My favorite razors are Schick Hydros, but for disposables these Bics aren&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did feel some catching and drag on underarms, and a little on knees. Because of that I wouldn&#x27;t buy them. But they were great on long strokes on legs without clogging!</li>
            <li> These are nicely shaped disposable razors.  The handle shape gives a good thumb grip, and they do not slip.  The sideways cover of the blade is a much better design than a snap on.  The blades are somewhat flexible and give a very close shave.  Shaving creme or gel is definitely needed, but that is to be expected with a disposable.  The colors are very pretty mint green, teal blue, and a dark sea blue.  If you like disposable razors, these are a good choice.</li>
            <li> very nice smooth glide as you shave your legs very close shave easy fat handle and when it get wets i can hold it without slipping</li>
            <li> I ran out of razors and had to use one of my husband&#x27;s to shave my legs. I ended up with a nice shave as well as a cut, a nick and some irritated skin. The next time I shaved I used one of these Bic Soleil Bella 4 razors. Again I had a very nice shave, but this time no nicks or cuts! I won&#x27;t be using my husband&#x27;s razors any longer. This is a winner. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, easy to handle, smooth shave.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I have struggled before to find razors that provide a nice, quality shave without falling apart or breaking while using them that didn&#x27;t cost upwards of $10 to $15. This product is absolutely wonderful. I personally have not had any issues with nicks and cuts but, I am also, for the most part, a patient shaver. These blades are sharp though, as most blades are, so, you do have to be patient enough. The product itself has been durable and the first razor has lasted very well. The pivoting head is definitely a plus and helps reach the contours of one&#x27;s body without having accidental cuts and scrapes. I look forward to purchasing again. Overall, excellent buy.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors I use. They last FOREVER and they never nick me. Worth paying more for than the cheapies!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors, been using them for nearly a decade! I wish they would maintain that nice juiciness longer though, ya know, the lotion that is on there that automatically applies to your skin and makes it silky smooth. Ahh, I love that, but it only lasts a few shaves.</li>
            <li> The four blades give me a close, precise shave.  These are either always sold-out in stores or more expensive, so it&#x27;s great that I can find them here.</li>
            <li> Works well.  The handle shape was easy enough to use without being too clunky.  I liked the slim shape.  These are disposable, and they are handy to take on a trip and leave behind in the trash, but, they are a bit too nice to be using all the time.  For me, these disposables are an occasional thing.  I even left one in the car, just in case :)</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try a Bic disposable razor, though I have tried other brands.  I like that most razors these days, including these Bic Soleil Bella, have a slide-on cover over the blades rather than a snap-on. With two children who use my shower and tend to knock things over, I know that they&#x27;re less likely to injure themselves on my razors since the covers won&#x27;t pop off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable and has a no-slip grip for index finger and thumb. Also as with most razors, these also have the grooves to help lift the hairs for a closer shave. While it took only one swipe on my underarms rather than the usual two (though there wasn&#x27;t much hair to begin with), I noticed that my legs felt stubbly by the end of the day.  But more significantly, I noticed a really weird, almost tingly feeling before nighttime that I have not experienced with previous razors. Two days later, the hair isn&#x27;t very noticeable, but the stubble can be definitely be felt.  While the blade does have some rotation, I&#x27;ve used razors with more flexibility than this one.  Overall, this was not my favorite razor but I might be willing to give it another try.</li>
            <li> The Bic Soleil Bela 4 Blade disposable razor does offer a very smooth shave. It glides easily over my legs and didn&#x27;t miss any spots. My only complaint is that the head is so big that it makes shaving in areas such as the ankle of armpit difficult-- the head doesn&#x27;t fit well in those spaces. I probably would not buy it again for that reason-- this one does not work significantly better than the brands with smaller heads to make it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> This Bic disposable razors do offer a close shave, but the angle of the shaving head is very weird, which makes shaving awkward and uncomfortable.  It also gave me a big of razor burn, not the worst of any razor, but definitely not a pleasant shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This razor works as expected and smoothly for finer hairs. I am fair skinned and blessed with mostly fine hair. But all ladies have hairs that are a little more stubborn. I have found that for the more stubborn hairs, these produce that dreaded &amp;#34;tug n pull.&amp;#34; I have actually had much more comfortable success with men&#x27;s razors in this class. These ARE better then the one or two use razors. But there are still better options.</li>
            <li> The Bic Soleil razor works well. The handle has a nice feel, the razor is well balanced, and the blade has a plastic cover to protect it (and you) when not in use. It gave me a nice smooth shave without feeling scratchy or nicking my legs at all. It didn&#x27;t leave any sort of rash or razor burn on my legs or underarms. For a disposable razor, this is high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critique: I don&#x27;t feel that the moisture strip above the blades worked especially well (as compared to the Gillette Venus razor).</li>
            <li> The Bic Soleil Bella is the latest in the Bic Soleil line of disposable shavers. The Bella has 4 flexible blades instead of 3, and a pivoting head which has two coconut milk moisturizing strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually with disposables I get one decent shave of my underarms and legs. After shaving I always rinse well, clean, wipe, and dry my razors - so I’m sure they’re free of hair, shaving cream residue, and so they don’t rust. With the other razors I’m not sure how I’m doing with my underarms - because the hair is so lightly colored, but on my legs the shaves are spotty - I always have to go over spots 2 or 3 times to get a good shave. It has to be the razors because I have pretty light hair, which doesn’t grow quickly, and I do have an electric - which I use very occasionally that gets all the hair the first time around, but it’s not as good with all the curves of a woman’s body..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Bic Bella 4 Blade razors, I&#x27;ve gotten 3 good shaves on my legs with these razors. The razors glide smoothly and always cut nicely. I don&#x27;t have to shave the same area two or three times to get them smooth.  I really liked the Bic Soleil Bella. I got an extremely close shave, closer than any other razor I’ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The pivoting head made it very easy to handle around curved area of the body like the knees and underarms. The moisturizing strips did not get gooey when exposed to water like most of the other razors that have similar strips. The blades rinsed well - no need for excessive wiping to get hair out from between the blades. All in all I’ve been really pleased with the way this razor performs..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely repurchase, and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good shave. I would compare it to any other disposable razor. I was able to use it twice (on my legs). The 3rd shave left me with razor burn and I still had stubble. So, if you plan on traveling and using it once or twice these will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;  I do feel like there is a good amount of waste with this product. I guess any disposable razor would be. These are a bit bigger then others I have used in the past. I also feel that anything over 2 blades is unnecessary. I never noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I found that these razors, although very reasonably priced, were fairly rough on my skin. I though maybe my skin was just having a bad time of its own, until I went back to using a Venus razor, and no, it&#x27;s just the bics are harder on your skin.</li>
            <li> The 4 blades make for an easy and effective means to clear the hair with one swipe. Skin feels and looks great</li>
            <li> Since I switched from the three blade version to this one, partly because of the subscribe and save discount, I&#x27;ve noticed less razor burn and nicks. Excellent product and by far my favorite blade compaired to the competitors. Downside is the protective cover which is hard to put on without touching it. The 3 blade version was a snap and then I was in my way out of the shower. This cap slides on but does well protecting sensitive fingertips from the blade.</li>
            <li> Now I remember why I have not gone back to disposable razors.  When I was given the option to review a 3-count package of Bic Soleil Bella 4 Blade Disposable I jumped at the opportunity because I honestly could not recall why I switched from disposables.  Until the Bic Soleil Bella razor pack arrived I had not used a Bic razor since my University days, decades have passed and yet disposable razors appear to not have changed a lot.  Yes, the Bic Soleil Bella has 4 blades and the colors are cute, however the head does not pivot, it is narrow, which for me was not a plus, however if one is looking for a narrow headed razor, this could be the one, and I found the razor irritated my skin.  To be fair, the shave was very close, smooth, and nic free, however my legs feel as though they have been scratched up, which is definitely a minus.  I am grateful I had the experience of going back to disposables, my question has been answered and I will continue using my trusty Gillette Venus Embrace, which offers a fabulous shave, leaves my legs smooth, and irritation free after being shaved.</li>
            <li> Ok, I can tell the difference from my last disposable razor using the Bic Soleil Bella. First of all, I love the handle because it is smooth and has an easy grip so it is better to handle. The four blades were super smooth and sharp although I did not nick or cut myself and the pivoting head made it super easy for contours on the arms and legs. I liked the fact that it was easy to clean and I honestly have a smoother shave. My skin feels like silk! Love that I got these on Amazon. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Great razors at a really good price when using subscribe &amp; save. I have sensitive skin and end up with razor burn easily. These are the only razors that don&#x27;t tear up my legs. I have an Amazon Prime Mom account so when I purchase with my 20% discount these are really a great deal!</li>
            <li> I love these - and they are a great price point. I&#x27;ve been using Soleil brand razors since college (so over 5 years) and nothing compares. The shipping was fast and the product was as described.</li>
            <li> These razors are wonderful - I have not cut myself once yet since I started using them. This is not my first buy (I mean, I bought them before I saw these in Vine which I got for free obviously) and I plan to do it again. My last one I used seven or eight times.</li>
            <li> Nice, very very nice no nicks, no scrapes just smooth skin.  The handle is easy to hold and control with little effort.  The razors really are easy to rinse and stores nicely in the shower caddy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand razors that have a \\&quot;wobbly\\&quot; head. The last batch I bought had that type of head and I swear the dang thing missed half my hairs. These have a stationary head and make good contact on the skin. Surprisingly, no nicks, even on tricky spots like knees &amp; ankles. And the four blades give you a really nice close shave. I&#x27;ll keep on buying these.</li>
            <li> Nice, close, safe shave with these.  The other razor that I&#x27;ve been using prior to receiving this product has 3 blades, moisture strip and allows me to purchase new cartridge heads without tossing the razor base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These disposable razors provided a safe shave with no nicks or cuts and performed very well in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about the product is the fact that it&#x27;s entirely disposable and costs more than I care to pay for a disposable product.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to obtain several shaves from a single razor before noticing any difference, so it&#x27;s not a product that needs to be tossed after a single use.&lt;br /&gt;These would be great for travel, a gym bag and to have on hand for guests who may have neglected to bring their own razor.</li>
            <li> This razor has a flat blade so that when you run it up like your leg, there are no cuts like with razors usually.  also after you get out of the bath, having razored your legs in the tub, if you missed some hair, after moisturizing your legs, you can run the razor up your leg and catch the hair still there.  They have a top that slides on to protect them and you can use them more than one time.  I love them.</li>
            <li> For a disposable razor, this is a good attempt. I like the 4 blades. You&#x27;re less likely to cut yourself plus you should get a closer shave. The other thing I do like about these is the razor head cover. It helps to have that when you&#x27;re packing for a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I think I&#x27;ll stick to my regular Hydro Schick with travel cover instead of switching to disposables for traveling. The main reason is the fact I still cannot get a very close shave with the Bic Soleil Bellas. The head of the razor doesn&#x27;t bend as easily when going over the contours and it leaves uncomfortable stubble. Even with the 4 blades, I&#x27;m still having to go over and over the same places just to get all the hair. Then I wind up with razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it is a decent quality razor, I&#x27;m not sold.</li>
            <li> Good for curves!  These razors give a close, smooth shave, even on your curvy areas.  They didn&#x27;t nick or cut me and glided well over my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor those who love a smooth shave but has sensitive skin like I do and worry about irritation I love this razor it gives a clean shave and no irritation or cuts I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> What can I say about razors?</li>
            <li> I honestly hate these razors. Today was my first time using one of them and I was not happy at all. I regularly use Venus- 3 blades razors and this was my first time using 4 blades. The blades on the razors are very very sharp and it gave me baby cuts almost every 4 glides. I got 4 cuts in total after using this. The head was not flexible unlike Venus razors. My last cut was the worse. I was shaving my back thigh going very slowly and gently and apparently it cut through my skin, and it was extremely painful. I was bleeding nonstop. These razors cut really well and gives me smooth legs after shaving but I do NOT appreciate how they glide on my legs.</li>
            <li> Bic Soleil Bella 4 Blade Disposable Razor for Women 3 Count&lt;br /&gt;Category: Personal Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIC® Soleil Bella® razor has four flexible blades, a Soothing Moisture Strip® enriched with coconut milk and a pivoting head that follows every contour for a flawlessly smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• 3 count disposable razor&lt;br /&gt;• Four flexible e-z rinse blades that individually adjust to your skin for an ultra-smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;• Pivoting Head&lt;br /&gt;• Soothinig moisture strip enriched with coconut milk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes after using one of the Bic Soleil Bella 4 Blade Disposable Razors for Women. In a clam-shell type packaging one finds three tropical colored Disposable razors. Each razor has a thick, plastic, protective cover that slides off for use, and back on for storage/travel. The protective cover will only slide on/off one way, which is a nice little safety feature, especially when traveling. The pivoting head, of the razor, has four flexible blades. The head, itself, moves up/down -- not side-to-side. Above, and below, the blades is are visible moisture strips enriched with coconut milk for a soothing shaving experience. The handle is wider than most disposable razors and has ample rubberized grips, on both sides for a better grasp and directional pull during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closest shave Ever! Using expensive gel or cheap cream shaving soap, blades rinsed clean (every time) and shaving time was faster-than-ever as I didn&#x27;t have to go over each area twice (as with a traditional Bic 2 blade) for a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*smiles, sips espresso*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the Bic Soleil Bella 4 Blade Disposable Razor for Women, 3 count, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2015</li>
            <li> I like the razors they work well and don&#x27;t they slip out of my hand my skin is nice and smooth after I shave.</li>
            <li> Just picked up a package of 2 Bic flex 5 razors and have already broken one trying to get the cover off the blade now no luck with the other. Sure as hell shouldn&#x27;t be this difficult. There is no instruction or diagram to refer to. It must something simple but got so frustrated I&#x27;m taking them back.</li>
            <li> Three 4-blade razors.  I have very sensitive skin and these razors work great!  Are sharp enough to use multiple times but aren&#x27;t so sharp in the beginning that they leave you bleeding.  Cheaper than in the store by $0.20 and with prime shipped here for free, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Trying to save a little money, I tried these razors because I had a coupon for buy one get one free.  They do not give a good shave at all.  The blades are dull before you even use them.  Not sure how these razors got good ratings from others.  Maybe I just got a bad package of razors.  I still have my second package to open and try out. I dread shaving my legs using these razors.  The only reason I give it one star, is because it doesn&#x27;t allow me to give it no stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing is they are pretty colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I liked them, but they stopped working much sooner than I expected. I was only able to get four, maybe five shaves out of one.</li>
            <li> I like these razors; my legs seem to stay smooth longer.  I use Lady Cremo shave cream with it.  I&#x27;ve just learned that you can extend the time you use a razor blade by cleaning it on an old piece of denim after it goes dull.  I plan to try that with these.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used. They are easy to use and doesn&#x27;t rash your skin. YOU SHOULD ALSO BUY.</li>
            <li> This razor exhibits many great qualities and offers an easy and smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Large handle to grip&lt;br /&gt;Cooling strips provide protection against cuts (no cuts)&lt;br /&gt;Cover is good for travel because takes a bit of work to remove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cover takes a bit of work to remove so careful taking it off the razor blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very good inexpensive razor that I would definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I switch off between these and the schick quattro for women.  These are fully disposable and the other is disposable heads.  These disposables shave VERY well.  I&#x27;m honestly surprised that a disposable razor could get such a good shape.  They&#x27;ve come a long way through the years.  The only downside is, if you are using a cream and shaving my legs dry, it&#x27;s hard to get the soap out of the blades (even if they&#x27;re sharp and can use it again).  Also, because the razor head doesn&#x27;t move, when you get up to your knees you have to be fairly skilled to get every hair.  All in all, a good razor and I&#x27;ll buy these until they stop making them!</li>
            <li> I got a sample package of these razors in a subscription box so I tried one out, even though I&#x27;m partial to the Gillette Venus line of women&#x27;s razors. This review will contain some comparative information so you can decide if these are right for you, or whether you&#x27;d rather try a different razor (since different people look for different things in a razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this razor. Pros of the Soleil Bella:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Gives a close shave&lt;br /&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t irritate&lt;br /&gt;*Glides smoothly over the legs and is fine on the underarms, as well&lt;br /&gt;*The moisture strip doesn&#x27;t stick to the tub if you set it down (this is probably my biggest complaint about the Venus razors)&lt;br /&gt;*One piece, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about matching handles with disposable blade cartridges (just toss the whole thing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of the Soleil Bella:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The moisture strip isn&#x27;t as effective as the ones on the Venus razors&lt;br /&gt;*Not as easy to maneuver as other razors around the knees and ankles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this razor has a lot to recommend it, and it may be a good solution for you, particularly if you don&#x27;t like the moisture strip on the Venus razors.</li>
            <li> I have loved these razors forever and now that I can get them for a better price from Amazon life is even better.</li>
            <li> Razors are so expensive. I used to spend tones on replacement heads for my fancy razor but these are cheaper and work great. I&#x27;ll never go back to spending $20 on 4 heads again.&lt;br /&gt;Note: make sure to get the 4-blade ones. The extras make all the difference.</li>
            <li> This is not my first experience with Bic Disposable Razors. They are great razors and give a close, smooth shave without nicks and cuts. You will love how soft and sexy your legs will feel. While the Bic Soleil Bella 4 blade Disposable Razor works really great I am a bigger fan of the 3 Blade for Sensitive Skin. Another important thing for me is that while they are disposable they really last a very long time.</li>
            <li> These work much better than the original Soleil. I don&#x27;t get cuts with them and they last pretty well for a disposable. I really like the colors. I do wish they would sell them in packs of more than three though.</li>
            <li> Love the pretty colors these come in!  Great shave! I use these to shave underarms and legs.  I would definitely recommend these to others looking for a product like these.</li>
            <li> I love the Bic Soleil disposables. They&#x27;re cheap, I never nick myself with them, they&#x27;re efficient, easy to use, and they get a close shave. I&#x27;ve never had razor burn or in-grown hair with them, even without shaving cream. Skin is smooth, not irritated. The shave lasts a few days. After receiving a different, more expensive product that was absolutely horrible, I appreciate this product even more.</li>
            <li> I love these razors and I refuse to use any other. They shave nice and smooth with out any irritation or cutting of the skin. Will use these for as long as they are around.</li>
            <li> it doesnt work. dont waste your money... dont save some bucks its better to pay more and have quality razor. The package says its a sample...not for sale!</li>
            <li> I usually use the [[ASIN:B006DR2BEW Schick Hydro Silk for Women Razor]], which I love.  This Bic Soleil does not get as close and smooth of a shave as the Schick Hydro Silk (which has 5 blades, versus Bic Soleil&#x27;s 4 blades).  I would say that this Bic Soleil is comparable to the [[ASIN:B000XVSNTQ Gillette Embrace Women&#x27;s Razor 1 Razor Handle and 2 Razor Refills]] (which has 5 blades) though.  I generally don&#x27;t use/like disposable razors, but I like to keep them on hand in our guest bathroom and in my travel case (for use while I&#x27;m on vacation).  I have used BIC razors before and this Soleil is much improved over the older BIC versions.  The four and five blades make all of the difference in getting a smooth shave.  Next time I need a disposable razor, will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Very nice disposable razor. It&#x27;s interesting that disposable razors are priced at what regular razors used to be, and regular razors are now through the roof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still though, the Bic Soleil Bella has a nice, smooth cut and the right balance. Both my S.O. and I have used it, with easy results! The coconut scent is a gimmick, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Venus Embrace razor that has refillable cartridges - but the latest replacement blades are much narrower and shorter and just do not work as well for me. They also don&#x27;t last as long - with the older style blades for the Venus they would last me for at least 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bic Soleil disposable razors are a great substitute. I travel a lot for work and have no problem throwing one of these in the toiletries case and bringing it with. They have a nice grip, do not slip, and the plastic cover over the blade is easy to get off/on with wet fingers and squinty eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do the same job as the Venus for me as far as actual shaving goes - I still have stubble the next day (stubborn Scandinavian hair!) but I have not had any nicks or other issues. These follow curves nicely. A high quality razor for those who like disposable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other disposables on the market. Some of them are just dreadful. This razor is good quality for the price and gives you a smooth shave. The blade seems to stay sharp for a good while. It helps if you keep it dry when not in use. If you&#x27;re looking to try out a new disposable give these a try.</li>
            <li> Closer shave than the fancier razors with their fancy blades and scents and moisture bars (like that changes anything...). Shaving used to be tedious for me but these razors save me time in the shower. They don&#x27;t irritate my skin and I&#x27;ve only nicked myself twice - and that was my own fault as I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to what I was doing. I notice within a few strokes hair is gone, even if I get a little lazy and skip a few days.</li>
            <li> Was more thank I was expecting. It&#x27;s awesome. Fits Perfectly and matches me perfectly. I&#x27;m very very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Razors like this are pretty common and I don&#x27;t notice any difference between 2 , 3 , or 4 blades. The moisture strip generally wears out before the blades do. And men&#x27;s versions  and store brands are usually cheaper. A decent shave but maybe not worth the price given the options.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, the built in lotion really creates a smooth shaving experience. Razor is comfortable to hold and glides nicely.</li>
            <li> I received this product at no cost as part of the Amazon Vine program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razors are so varied in quality and what they can do. I like the Bic brand and decided to see how these worked. I liked the feel, the fact they are disposable (great to take on trips), and they do a good job. No nicks or dry patches from razor burn - always a plus! They are a good length for getting down to the ankle area without major contortions in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback for me was they are a bit lighter in weight than I like. I prefer feeling like I am holding something in my hand; these feel almost like feathers. That may be a positive to some, just not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these to someone looking for a good razor that is light-weight and disposable.</li>
            <li> my favorite!  Try never to  use anything but these.</li>
            <li> These little disposable razors pretty much hold their own with Venus Embrace, which is what I&#x27;ve been using for years before buying these on a hunch. Sometimes they&#x27;re even better! Also very happy with the price.</li>
            <li> The best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. I accidentally bought the 3 blade kind of the same razor line and they pale in comparison. I&#x27;d never consider using anything else. The best razors at the best price.</li>
            <li> Works great with coochy shaving cream. I thought the razors would get dull under the water but this held up fine.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my legs due to a medication I have taken. The itching was intolerable and would only be temporarily relieved by yet another medication cream. These razors for sensitive skin have finally put an end to all the itching and discomfort. I never even thought the razor I was using could make the difference, but it has, and I have had no cuts either. The price is unbeatable! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Smooth shave (way, way better than the cheap Target-brand razors I was using).  I&#x27;ve used the Bic Soleil Bella only a few times so far, so I don&#x27;t yet know how long they will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the photo for this product (when I purchased it, TWO packages were displayed): I researched this product on Amazon and concluded this was the best deal based on my belief I would be receiving two boxes/packages for a total of six razors.  If you look at similar ads, the titles or product descriptions will make it very clear that you&#x27;ll get, for example, \\&quot;two packages (3 count; total six items)\\&quot;.  This listing is deceptive (deliberate or just lazy/dumb?).  I called Amazon customer service and was issued a refund (credit toward next purchase) of half my cost.</li>
            <li> Okay- I feel you should get more razors for the price but they do a good job.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the Bic Soleil Bella for Women razors.  I can usually get a few uses out of a disposable razor.  After the first use the razor did not work at all.</li>
            <li> The Bic Soleil Bella razor is inexpensive quality. I think the pivoting head is the best feature it has but it also shaves smoothly without irritation.</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to find a women&#x27;s razor that will shave without leaving hair behind. I was forced to steal my husbands razors. I got these razors through a Bzz Agent campaign. I am in love they work better then my husbands razor.</li>
            <li> Got these razors today and tried one out a while ago. Has a very comfortable, ergonomic grip. Gave a very smooth shave. No nicks or cuts and moved around the knees and ankles quite easily. It glides over a large area at the same time and it took much less time to shave with this razor than with my Gillette. Didn&#x27;t even notice the moisture strip. Used soap and water instead of shave cream and the razor did great. I will buy these razors again over my old one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These are ok. Nothing to write home about. They hold up about average. Overall I probably would buy again as a cheap throwaway razor.</li>
            <li> kept me from looking like a wookie</li>
