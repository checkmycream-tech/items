            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like hair rush and roulette.</li>
            <li>which like my own hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hair person, hair makes me feel beautiful, that hair was not going to cover my whole head, I didn&#x27;t expect it to.</li>
            <li>But normally one package is good!</li>
            <li>Amazon is such an awesome company.</li>
            <li>Hair looks great &amp; WORKS very well.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for cheap hair you&#x27;re better off going to the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>All together the hair is very nice and soft, yes it does.</li>
            <li>it took about 2.5 hrs to die it red but after the wait it came out great.</li>
            <li>First I would like to say that this hair is not 100g per bundle more like 50g.</li>
            <li>buying hair on Amazon it is crucial to find a good seller.</li>
            <li>This is 100% true.</li>
            <li>They really need better advertisment</li>
            <li>The hair is not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad hair, it&#x27;s soft and cute, but it sheds pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Overall it flat irons and curls but nothing awesome.</li>
            <li>Wig Fashion Inc It is nappy, tangles, and boy does it SHED like a Golden Retreiver.</li>
            <li>I used this hair as a quickweave instead of getting a sew in because it wasn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>

            <li>They are the only company on here I&#x27;m actually pleased with.</li>

            <li>It was just one piece of hair that was not even longer than my WHOLE body</li>
            <li>I hv a full sew in with a middle part if anyone wants to see hair</li>
            <li>you need Buy 4 bundle full hair, yes did 100% human hair</li>
            <li>off to make it look decent.</li>
            <li>I ordered light brown straight and received black wavey.</li>
            <li>So I needed an extra bundle to make the hair full, because the hair I got from Tom Hair was sooo thin at the bottom I had to cut most of it off.</li>
            <li>Like many other human hair this hair curls an flat iron very well</li>
            <li>So far, it is going on two weeks</li>
            <li>So with that being said the hair arrived early that was a</li>
            <li>The hair was soft as hell when it was still in the pack</li>
            <li>The company decide they would send another,it took forever,an it was a total different package from the first one received.</li>
            <li>very cheat brand not 22 long either</li>
            <li>The only down fall of this hair is that it sheds very much ..</li>

            <li> I wanted to let everyone know that the listing description as well as the images belong to me and were from my OLD no longer active seller&#x27;s account on Amazon about a year ago.</li>
            <li> Second the hair is true to length &amp;#34;BUT&amp;#34; the ends are so thin that I had to cut about 4 or 5 inches off to make it look fuller.</li>

            <li> It had black die washing out, I had to wash it like 12 times before the black stoped running and the hair was straight.</li>
            <li> I have only put bio silk an pink oil moisturizer on my hair.</li>
            <li> (The first bundle of hair)I cut the weft and sewn two piece the same size together because they was thin, then I sewn clips on them.</li>
            <li> I closed my account here due to the fees and continued to sell sell locally and on Ebay.</li>
            <li> ill have to come up with something quick for my firat day of work</li>
            <li> absolutely NOT.</li>
            <li> so I need the other bundle.</li>
            <li> not the actual length and the fold it up in this little little package knocking your cruls out</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just going to stick to going to the beauty supply store and actually seeing what I&#x27;m spending my hard earned money on.</li>
            <li> I am shocked to see that Amazon either recycles or allows any seller to just piggy back off of old product pages from inactive accounts such as mine.</li>
            <li> You can see where the hair was cut in half.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 22\\&quot; mess from</li>
            <li> This hair actually made my hair worse than what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It was like really dead hair.  </li>
            <li> I had listed a few bundles but sold them immediately elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> The picture shows that the hair looks full, but once I got this I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> The ends is so thin and frizzy  </li>
            <li> is thin thin tangles</li>
            <li> It is false advertising and a lot of hair buyers on Amazon are being lied to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Love it my beautiful hair extensions wave ❤️️❤️️❤️️❤️️👏👏👏👏👏👏✨✨✨✨✨✨✨&lt;br /&gt;But you need Buy 4 bundle full hair, yes did 100% human hair</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. I would give this a 5 star but When I purchased this hair I was supposed to get two bundles of hair for the price of one, when i opened the package there was only one bundle of hair. I just contacted amazon and they are sending me another bundle. It shoud be here in about a week. I am going to dye them, ill let u know how that went after I receive my other bundle. (The first bundle of hair)I cut the weft and sewn two piece the same size together because they was thin, then I sewn clips on them. My hair is thick so I need the other bundle. If your hair is thin you could prob get away with using just one bundle. All together the hair is very nice and soft, yes it does. Shed some but all hair extensions do.</li>
            <li> I am really PLEASE with the brazilian 22 inches hair received. So far, it is going on two weeks and I have not had tangling or shedding. My cosmetologist even was PLEASE as she expressed the hair is top quality and looks good. I wore the hair for a cruise and it has done well. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Great product thanks😘</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it I ordered light brown straight and received black wavey.</li>
            <li> So I needed an extra bundle to make the hair full, because the hair I got from Tom Hair was sooo thin at the bottom I had to cut most of it off. I ordered this 22\\&quot; mess from Wig Fashion Inc It is nappy, tangles, and boy does it SHED like a Golden Retreiver. I have bought once again from a bad seller. This hair actually made my hair worse than what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When buying hair on Amazon it is crucial to find a good seller. You will likely not get the hair shown in the pictures. Every seller carries a different product. It&#x27;s kind of like hair rush and roulette. For better quality hair, shop the actual sellers and read their notes and reviews before purchase. Each seller has a completely different product. You will get 100% human hair-Brazilian Body Wave (the style) not from an actual Brazilian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought the same hair from five different sellers and had five different experiences. I will stick with Beauty &amp; Beyond from here on out. They are the only company on here I&#x27;m actually pleased with.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who never write reviews an I know your reading this like yea yea whatever but I had to write one on this hair bc us women know we don&#x27;t play when it comes to our weave. So with that being said the hair arrived early that was a ++++ after I was and condition hair it became dull looking but I didn&#x27;t think much of it bc I was about to die it red which like my own hair it took about 2.5 hrs to die it red but after the wait it came out great. Like many other human hair this hair curls an flat iron very well I have used curling iron an rollers on it an it hold curls for about 2 days without any chemicals on hair.. I have only put bio silk an pink oil moisturizer on my hair.The only down fall of this hair is that it sheds very much .. But all in all I am very pleased with this hair... I only bought 2 bundles N I hv a full sew in with a middle part if anyone wants to see hair u can email me hdebose22@yahoo.com an I can send pictures.</li>
            <li> The hair I got looked very pretty and was soft and wavy... then I washed it. It had black die washing out, I had to wash it like 12 times before the black stoped running and the hair was straight.</li>
            <li> So before I bought this hair I read all the reviews, good and bad.  But I was like im gonna get it and see for myself.  The hair was soft as hell when it was still in the pack but after I got my sew in and brushed the hair a lil bit, the ends got very coarse. It was like really dead hair.  Lasted me 2 weeks and a sew in usually lasts me a 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!! YOU WILL NOT GET THE HAIR SHOWN OR DESCRIBED IN THIS LISTING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi! I wanted to let everyone know that the listing description as well as the images belong to me and were from my OLD no longer active seller&#x27;s account on Amazon about a year ago. I am shocked to see that Amazon either recycles or allows any seller to just piggy back off of old product pages from inactive accounts such as mine. They are even using the UPC code that I had to pay for!! I plan on contacting them regarding this. It is false advertising and a lot of hair buyers on Amazon are being lied to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen others comment about the listings not being legit and you need to read up on the actual sellers feedback prior to purchasing.This is 100% true. I can&#x27;t believe this is going on. Amazon is such an awesome company. How could they allow such a flaw to exist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually never sold any hair on Amazon.I had listed a few bundles but sold them immediately elsewhere.  I closed my account here due to the fees and continued to sell sell locally and on Ebay. I stopped selling hair all together when I had quality issues with all my suppliers.</li>
            <li> This hair is crap. It&#x27;s also just a 1/2 bundle.  You can see where the hair was cut in half. You can see how the track it&#x27;s on the hair to make it longer. The ends is so thin and frizzy  you have to cut several  inches  off to make it look decent.</li>
            <li> I luv this hair its amazing good quality hair everything was on point.I would never buy hair from anyone else again</li>
            <li> Worst hair extensions omg!!!</li>
            <li> The hair is not bad. Im jus dissapointed with the advertisement,as I think its the wrong hair that was sent. I ordered two receive only one. The company decide they would send another,it took forever,an it was a total different package from the first one received.</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I&#x27;ve ever!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I paid for it and over night shipping the sent to my neigbors house the picture are lying the hair is thin thin tangles I even see gray and different colors hair not natural at all look like plastic literally I&#x27;m very disapointed not only do it put a hold on my hair style ill have to come up with something quick for my firat day of work this is soo horrible I&#x27;ve order from amzon plety of times never had a problem but this hair nd services is the worst its ichy plastic not the actual length and the fold it up in this little little package knocking your cruls out PLEASE DONT WAIST YOU HARD EARNED MONEY AND TIME ON THIS CRAP</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter and she was delighted. Hair looks great &amp; WORKS very well. Would recommend this hair l I be.</li>
            <li> very cheat brand not 22 long either</li>
            <li> looks NOTHING like the picture. The picture shows that the hair looks full, but once I got this I was disappointed. It was not 22&amp;#34;!! It was not the color I wanted. It was just one piece of hair that was not even longer than my WHOLE body and I&#x27;m ONLY 5&#x27;2&amp;#34;!! I&#x27;m a hair person, hair makes me feel beautiful, that hair was not going to cover my whole head, I didn&#x27;t expect it to. But normally one package is good! They really need better advertisment then what they have. I will NEVER again in my life order hair online, I&#x27;m just going to stick to going to the beauty supply store and actually seeing what I&#x27;m spending my hard earned money on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad hair, it&#x27;s soft and cute, but it sheds pretty easily. Also, update your description about the amount of bundles people will recive, we&#x27;re all think that we&#x27;ll get two per order, but we&#x27;ve only received one instead. Just some advice</li>
            <li> First I would like to say that this hair is not 100g per bundle more like 50g. Second the hair is true to length &amp;#34;BUT&amp;#34; the ends are so thin that I had to cut about 4 or 5 inches off to make it look fuller. 3rd the hair sheds horribly. Overall it flat irons and curls but nothing awesome. Would I purchase or recommend to anyone absolutely NOT. If you&#x27;re looking for cheap hair you&#x27;re better off going to the beauty supply store. I used this hair as a quickweave instead of getting a sew in because it wasn&#x27;t worth the time. Dissapointing. But if you&#x27;re willing to but some work into it then I guess it will work temporarily</li>
