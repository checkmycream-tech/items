            <li>love the aroma.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s making my skin tone more uniform and even and reducing spots.</li>
            <li>All of their products go on smoothly and don&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy!</li>
            <li>my skin sure  break out</li>
            <li>i am so glad i tried it.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is now much more even and smooth.</li>

            <li>but I am fine with that.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get it for free.</li>
            <li>The cream is light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>the product itself applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>You know, I have used several skin whitening products before and this one is definitely the best skin lightening cream I have used.</li>
            <li>I also love how it works with my very sensitive and indecisive skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it works with very sensitive.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this primarily and she says she really likes how this is working for her.</li>
            <li>At 51 years old, I am beginning to notice what appear to be large very light freckles forming on my face and shoulders, so I thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li>it came in a huge tub that had an easy open cap.</li>
            <li>The spots I&#x27;m aware of are already lightening.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>First, I am trans....</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait a few weeks to write a review to give a fair review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this product right now.</li>
            <li>It seems I may have finally found a good product that actually works well.</li>
            <li>will continue to use the product until the jar is empty and more than likely will purchase one more to see what happens.</li>
            <li>but i have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this product, paid for the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement on some sun spots on my arms.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this cream to lighten up some discoloration spots i have.</li>
            <li>It helps lighten my chest when I get too much sun.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think i would see the results that fast.</li>
            <li>Lightened my freckles so fast.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for moisturizing, but unsure of lightening aspects as I&#x27;ve used for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I would recommend highly it to anyone who has skin pigmentation,or to anyone the skin has been damaged by the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was really skeptical because I feel like everyone only put good reviews because they got it for free (even tho</li>
            <li>I thought it looked a little watery, but it spreads out well and gets absorbed in the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Asana Beauty Natural Skin Lightening Cream works slowly but effectively.</li>
            <li>I certainly will say it&#x27;s much more subtle effect then bleaches</li>
            <li>And so far it&#x27;s been lightening those spots and evening out blending with my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I checked the ingredients and they seem to be all natural so...</li>
            <li>I have been using the Natural Skin Lightening for a while now</li>
            <li>I thought this cream would lighten and restore my natural skin color.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy but not too light.</li>
            <li>so I do not believe it for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I received the Asana Beauty Natural Skin Lightening Cream, I tried it on my elbows and knees.</li>
            <li>I use it with my anti aging products and I love how clear my skin/complexion has been looking lately!</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>I noticed a general softening of my skin.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say it really works.  </li>
            <li>Worked for the first few weeks &amp; then stopped working.</li>
            <li>I have a dark spot on my upper lip and it is really fading using this product.</li>
            <li>My face does get a little irritated if i use it to much</li>

            <li> Not too heavy but not too light.</li>
            <li> so I do not believe it for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I received the Asana Beauty Natural Skin Lightening Cream, I tried it on my elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> I use it with my anti aging products and I love how clear my skin/complexion has been looking lately!</li>

            <li> I noticed a general softening of my skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say it really works.  </li>
            <li> Worked for the first few weeks &amp; then stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on my upper lip and it is really fading using this product.</li>
            <li> My face does get a little irritated if i use it to much</li>
            <li> I only need a small amount per application and I like it because it&#x27;s gentle and didn&#x27;t cause me any skin</li>
            <li> I had plenty of dark spots on my cheeks and in just a few weeks of use, i noticed considerable lightening with some spots completely disappearing.</li>
            <li> love that it doesnt have a weird smell like some other lightening creams do</li>
            <li> Now this may be just for my skin since I have a dark African American skin color</li>
            <li> I have used almost the entire jar on various dark spots and if anything they look darker.  </li>
            <li> For me personally it was just me wasting money to put cream on my skin that had absolutely NO affect on it.</li>
            <li> I received a few compliments about my skin from friends a few days after i started using the cream which has really boosted my confidence as I have had some skin issues for a while now.</li>
            <li> My knees and elbows are usually a bit darker than my skin tone because I frequently do floor exercises.</li>
            <li> so my final review is I&#x27;m not really satisfied or even moderately complacent with this product.</li>
            <li> and I have used skin bleaching in the past but that has some harsh chemicals like hidroquinone that really don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> SO I DECIDED TO USE WITH A BLACK AND WHITE BLEACHING SOAP</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed some slight lightening but not enough to give 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I do just apply a little and haven&#x27;t been using it long</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try and see how well it works for me, so far it has been working slowly and there is a slight change.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of scarring on my face due to acne.</li>
            <li> I would like to see their other products on eyebags and lifts.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one due to the reviews</li>
            <li> It helped even out her color, especially getting rid of dark spots left behind by blemishes.</li>
            <li> but it is too expensive now... $100.00 seems too high!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to lighten my underarms for some time now because they are to dark for my liking.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all, in fact the dark spots spread.</li>
            <li> Av used it for a week now, and I avnt seen any changes yet, it didn&#x27;t lighten dark spot and my skin</li>
            <li> Been using this Natural Skin Lightening Cream for a few weeks now, but not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> but for my dark tone skin it had no &amp;#34;change&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;transformation&amp;#34; So overall for me personally the product was 100% useless since it did NOTHING at all for me.</li>
            <li> Using it for a month, I have seen a slight lightening of the skin on my legs.</li>
            <li> This product worked well in evening out my complexion and getting rid of dark spots left behind by blemishes.</li>
            <li> It helped me out a little.</li>
            <li> Just received a few days ago, so can not give a review</li>
            <li> I tried this cream for 2 1/2 weeks and saw no results whatsoever, I felt like it was a waste of $30.</li>
            <li> I have been using in for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it as directed which is, everyday.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is meant for slightly lighter skinned people I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;m still dark</li>
            <li> The cream didn&#x27;t however break my skin out or any other negative skin reaction but this product basically did NOTHING!</li>
            <li> Just expect subtlety and not more.</li>
            <li> I am desperate the skin is getting so dark on my upper lip, if u have any suggestions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lightening lotions in the past but it&#x27;s a couple of years since I&#x27;ve used one.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my face and elbow for the past 3 weeks, and haven&#x27;t seen any changes</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> I have used it for approximately 30 days.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> It had an odd feeling when i put the cream on which was not a good or bad feeling and the cream did not smell bad at all</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i haven&#x27;t seen a improvement.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but it just is not working for me.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product, paid for the whole thing. Didn&#x27;t get it for free. I was really skeptical because I feel like everyone only put good reviews because they got it for free (even tho they are saying its honest or whatever). Anyway, I&#x27;m actually impressed. I had hyperpigmentation on the back of my neck, looked gross. This literally made it disappear and now my neck has an even complexion with the rest of my neck and body. I&#x27;m grateful for this product. It worked!</li>
            <li> Now this may be just for my skin since I have a dark African American skin color but I&#x27;ve been using this everynight until it ran out which was just recently and i have seen NO improvement. My skin is no softer than it was prior to using this product and it did not &amp;#34;Lighten/Brighten&amp;#34; my skin at all. The cream didn&#x27;t however break my skin out or any other negative skin reaction but this product basically did NOTHING! for my skin. It had an odd feeling when i put the cream on which was not a good or bad feeling and the cream did not smell bad at all so my final review is I&#x27;m not really satisfied or even moderately complacent with this product. For me personally it was just me wasting money to put cream on my skin that had absolutely NO affect on it. Perhaps this is meant for slightly lighter skinned people I&#x27;m not sure but for my dark tone skin it had no &amp;#34;change&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;transformation&amp;#34; So overall for me personally the product was 100% useless since it did NOTHING at all for me. Perhaps this is just a personal thing and others might find this product help but for me i did not.</li>
            <li> Wow this cream is great! It does an excellent job of smoothing out discolorations and best of all it was really gentle. It has a mild but pleasant smell and does not leave my skin greasy. My skin tone is now much more even and smooth. I received a few compliments about my skin from friends a few days after i started using the cream which has really boosted my confidence as I have had some skin issues for a while now. It seems I may have finally found a good product that actually works well.</li>
            <li> Received this item via a promotion and it feels wonderful on my skin.  It is smooth and non greasy, great item.</li>
            <li> love that it doesnt have a weird smell like some other lightening creams do</li>
            <li> I have a lot of scarring on my face due to acne. This cream has lighted up my skin amazingly</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 3 weeks. the sun spot lightened up, but the acne scars did not. I am a little disappointed. I will keep using it and see if it clears up.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this primarily and she says she really likes how this is working for her. She has eczema, and come scars from it as well. She likes the fact this cream helps lighten those scars and even out the blotches in her skin.</li>
            <li> bought this for my aunt and she loves it. She said its very light and leaves her skin feeling very smooth. It helped even out her color, especially getting rid of dark spots left behind by blemishes. I&#x27;m so glad it works with very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels...went to buy more but it is too expensive now... $100.00 seems too high!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement on some sun spots on my arms. I&#x27;ll give it some more time.  Hopefully it just needs more time?  If it does I will give it more stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and my skin has the same color, I can&#x27;t notice the bleach on it</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream regularly for over 3 weeks. I do not see any change is the color</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t why this is the case, but on some areas the cream seemed to start to work immediately while on others, it&#x27;s as if it hadn&#x27;t been applied.</li>
            <li> Just received a few days ago, so can not give a review</li>
            <li> Did not do anything on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good value and good customer service.</li>
            <li> At 51 years old, I am beginning to notice what appear to be large very light freckles forming on my face and shoulders, so I thought I would give this a try.  You will love the texture and the way this cream absorbs into skin.  I have read about hyaluronic acid, so I know this ingredient is key for revealing the dewy appearance of skin.  Already after two weeks, I look forward to using it and my skin feels fresher.  The spots I&#x27;m aware of are already lightening. In terms of feedback, I&#x27;d love it if this also had sunscreen so then it could be the only thing I use on days I&#x27;m going without makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to lighten my underarms for some time now because they are to dark for my liking. I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try and see how well it works for me, so far it has been working slowly and there is a slight change. I do just apply a little and haven&#x27;t been using it long so i&#x27;m hoping I will see better improvement within time. &amp;#34;I did receive this for free for an exchange with an honest review.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this cream to lighten up some discoloration spots i have. And so far it&#x27;s been lightening those spots and evening out blending with my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product right now. I have a dark spot on my upper lip and it is really fading using this product. My face does get a little irritated if i use it to much but i have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It helped me out a little. I mean I&#x27;m still dark but it helped out a bit.</li>
            <li> I used this under my arms and saw results in two days. Will def be buying again</li>
            <li> So far,I don&#x27;t see any changes on my face yet and the product is too liquidy and made my skin too oily.</li>
            <li> I had plenty of dark spots on my cheeks and in just a few weeks of use, i noticed considerable lightening with some spots completely disappearing. I thought it looked a little watery, but it spreads out well and gets absorbed in the skin quickly. I noticed a general softening of my skin. I would like to see their other products on eyebags and lifts.</li>
            <li> This product worked well in evening out my complexion and getting rid of dark spots left behind by blemishes. I use it with my anti aging products and I love how clear my skin/complexion has been looking lately! My husband is a big fan of this cream too, as it did an awesome job getting rid of breakout marks on his forehead. I also love how it works with my very sensitive and indecisive skin! I have been using it religiously and I&#x27;ve never had breakouts or rashes from it. I really love how this cream works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, i could see the difference in 1 week. Amazing product</li>
            <li> This is the BEST natural skin lightening cream I have tried! First, I am trans.... I love cosmetics and that is my passion since I am a stylist. I have some spots or melasma or something and I have used skin bleaching in the past but that has some harsh chemicals like hidroquinone that really don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;. The emollient texture on this is perfect, no scent, and nice feel. I certainly will say it&#x27;s much more subtle effect then bleaches but I am fine with that. I also don&#x27;t know about the anti aging part but I feel good about leaving a very good review. Just expect subtlety and not more.</li>
            <li> love the aroma. and goes on smoothly with no residue left behind. i&#x27;ve already used it all. worked great to lighten some discoloration on my legs.</li>
            <li> You know, I have used several skin whitening products before and this one is definitely the best skin lightening cream I have used. There seems to be some tingling when it&#x27;s applied after a couple of minutes and I checked the ingredients and they seem to be all natural so... The skin whitening cream is not only moisturizing but it&#x27;s making my skin tone more uniform and even and reducing spots. I will update this review after a couple of months to describe the progress.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Natural Skin Lightening for a while now and I cannot see any difference in my skin.  I an an African American lady and I purchased this product because I run in the heat and humidity on a daily basis.  I forgot to use sunscreen and I got a sunburn.  I thought this cream would lighten and restore my natural skin color.  But, to no avail.  I have used it for approximately 30 days.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all, in fact the dark spots spread.</li>
            <li> It was just ok not to impressed with this product !</li>
            <li> Av used it for a week now, and I avnt seen any changes yet, it didn&#x27;t lighten dark spot and my skin</li>
            <li> It helps lighten my chest when I get too much sun.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all I lost money on product !!</li>
            <li> I can definitely see the brown spots on my face fading.  The  Asana Beauty products have all met my hopes to improve my skin.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;for a nice product.  All of their products go on smoothly and don&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> Received product on time.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say it really works.  It does give the skin a glow.  Will continue its use for an over all even tone skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! Not too heavy but not too light. No scent</li>
            <li> I tried this cream for 2 1/2 weeks and saw no results whatsoever, I felt like it was a waste of $30. Will be returning this product ASAP.</li>
            <li> I have been using in for a few weeks now, I don&#x27;t see any improvement yet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it as directed which is, everyday. Using it for a month, I have seen a slight lightening of the skin on my legs. The cream is light and non-greasy. It is really great as a moisturizer; leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am halfway done with the product but I haven&#x27;t seen any change yet</li>
            <li> my skin sure  break out so I do not believe it for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Ordered this with a promotion code.  Very lightweight and already within a few weeks my skin looks and feels very different.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great customer service organic cream smooth and light weight</li>
            <li> Did not work ....I did not like the product</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks to write a review to give a fair review. Unfortunately i haven&#x27;t seen a improvement. I am desperate the skin is getting so dark on my upper lip, if u have any suggestions plz let me know.</li>
            <li> it did not do the job for me and I will not buy this product again. My skin condition in my arms did not improve at all.</li>
            <li> SO I HAVE BEEN USING THIS CREAM FAITHFULLY FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW HAVENT NOTICED ANY CHANGES SO I DECIDED TO USE WITH A BLACK AND WHITE BLEACHING SOAP, I WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER BOTTLE HOPEFULLY I WILL START NOTICING SOME CHANGES... MAYBE IT TAKES AWHILE...</li>
            <li> Worked for the first few weeks &amp; then stopped working.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist started me on a skin lightening  product. I decided to try this one due to the reviews and I&#x27;m quite please with it</li>
            <li> I have used almost the entire jar on various dark spots and if anything they look darker.  I am very unhappy with this product.  It is a very nice cream but it does not lighten as it is supposed to do.  Sorry, but it just is not working for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it works. I&#x27;ve had it a while, yet to see some differences</li>
            <li> Sucks. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> My knees and elbows are usually a bit darker than my skin tone because I frequently do floor exercises. I&#x27;ve used lightening lotions in the past but it&#x27;s a couple of years since I&#x27;ve used one. When I received the Asana Beauty Natural Skin Lightening Cream, I tried it on my elbows and knees. After trying it out for a month, I&#x27;ve noticed that the skin on my elbows and knees have lightened a bit compared to before I used this cream. It has a white color, a creamy consistency and is unscented. It glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It neither feel greasy nor sticky on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Asana Beauty Natural Skin Lightening Cream works slowly but effectively. I only need a small amount per application and I like it because it&#x27;s gentle and didn&#x27;t cause me any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product for free to try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> The cream is fantastic,it&#x27;s working amazingly,it&#x27;s mild and very light.I would recommend highly it to anyone who has skin pigmentation,or to anyone the skin has been damaged by the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I just hope this company  will continue manufacturing this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed some slight lightening but not enough to give 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very light and has no odor.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the product until the jar is empty and more than likely will purchase one more to see what happens.</li>
            <li> i got this product from a promotion. the product came in on time. the packaging is great. it came in a huge tub that had an easy open cap. the product itself applies smoothly. there is no greasiness after application. i am so glad i tried it. within 2 applications, i can already see the difference. i didn&#x27;t think i would see the results that fast. i should have taken before and after pictures. i will continue using the product and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Lightened my freckles so fast. I still have tons of product left. I did receive this discounted to give my honest  review</li>
            <li> Over rated product. didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Been using this Natural Skin Lightening Cream for a few weeks now, but not very impressed.  No visible results.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for moisturizing, but unsure of lightening aspects as I&#x27;ve used for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This product has not worked for me. I have been using it on my face and elbow for the past 3 weeks, and haven&#x27;t seen any changes</li>
