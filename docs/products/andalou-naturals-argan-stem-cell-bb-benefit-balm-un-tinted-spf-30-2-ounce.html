    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It smells great!</li>
            <li>My best friend likes it; I had to give it to her.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect compliment to finish off my skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s perfect for that.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and have tried dozens of products for the face that I can wear.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks incredibly shiny immediately after using this product, so oil control?</li>
            <li>This beauty balm sunblock has excellent ingredients,  smells divine (like oranges), and has great broad-spectrum, mineral-based UV protection.  </li>
            <li>It really good with controlling oil &amp; breakouts!</li>
            <li>so flash photography would probably not turn out great.  </li>
            <li>The SPF 30 is great</li>
            <li>It was a great buy all around</li>
            <li>Smells great and works well.</li>
            <li>This untinted BB cream/SPF is amazing!</li>
            <li>Although not lightweight, it blends in easily and provides superb sun protection.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover anything, but I feel good under the sun after applying it.</li>
            <li>This untinted BB cream is good if you have a lot of time to allow it to penetrate your skin.  </li>
            <li>Since my skin is oily, the DIY spf 30 serum works great on it&#x27;s own, no need to add a moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li>I am fair</li>
            <li>and this isn&#x27;t a good product for that.</li>
            <li>granted I&#x27;m a fair lady, but some sunscreen products do still stand out on my skin and never, ever sink in-</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>i love this!</li>
            <li>you have oily skin and need a higher SPF year-round, this is a perfect product for you (if you don&#x27;t mind the thickness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the glow this product gives my skin which is nice without looking oily.</li>
            <li>B0001TMDF0 Heritage Store Rose Petals Rosewater 8 oz]].  </li>
            <li>this stuff honestly works wonders for me.</li>
            <li>I use it after the Andalou Naturals Kombucha cleansing gel, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did it</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t need to struggle any more.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this more than once to use on my face when at the beach.  </li>
            <li>Besides, I&#x27;d rather the non-nano-sized mineral in this than a chemical sunblock which might be more cosmetically elegant, but is just a bunch of synthetic chemicals.  </li>
            <li>so it is more evenly distributed on the skin and looks better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>I thought that I could use a US made sunblock, but will keep ordering my sunblock on Amazon and have them shipped from Asia to get what works better for</li>
            <li>The price is comparable to the SPF moisturizer that I was getting from The Body Shop, and the ingredients in this one are better.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had a really good EWG rating and is safe, natural and effective.</li>
            <li>Texture is wonderfully smooth and easy to spread on, just like their Lavender Shea hand cream.</li>
            <li>In addition, I was seeking protection that was safer in terms of its chemical composition (check out the Environmental Working Group website) and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Although not inexpensive compared to many, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients on ALL their products are fantastic.</li>
            <li>The rose water allows it to be spread onto &amp; be massaged into the skin much easier</li>
            <li>What I like most about this BB cream is that it almost completely clears my acne on its own.</li>
            <li>Really controls oil but leaves my face moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>my face doesn&#x27;t FEEL as oily later in the day when I use this product, so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>so it works as a healthy natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Although the natural sunscreen is great, it does leave a white cast</li>
            <li>It is worth the price</li>
            <li>I mist my face with rose water prior to application to facilitate smoothing this product on my skin, which makes application easier</li>
            <li>You do need to make sure that the product is evenly and completely applied.</li>
            <li>it smells really good and keeps my skin moisturized, and i think because of that it&#x27;s less oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>:  As much as I&#x27;d love to give it 5 stars based on the above good qualities, I cannot as it causes my oily skin to shine quickly (it contains oil in the formula) and it feels a little heavier than the lovely mineral Korean and Japanese sunblocks I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>After comparing the price and the ingredients, Andalou Naturals came first and I bought it without a doubt.</li>
            <li>The zinc oxide in this product is whitening when first applied, but it fades rapidly.</li>
            <li>and I always have the same challenge of not being able to have them on my face all day.  </li>
            <li>This product was discovered when I searched the whole internet.</li>
            <li>But I did want some moisture and since it has hyaluronic acid, I expected it to be a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Bought this when Whole Foods Market is on sale.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb as much as I&#x27;d like, i still feel the grease of the lotion throughout the day.</li>
            <li>If the thickness of the BB creams is not to your taste &amp; you are more sensitive like me (where almost all sunscreens cause breakouts), give the DIY Booster SPF 30 facial serum a whirl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly hard to find facial products with an SPF higher than 15, so I jumped at the opportunity to try something with SPF 30 -and- a great score from EWG.</li>
            <li>It sinks in with a nice matte finish and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks (</li>
            <li>Both are high quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the zinc oxide that clears my skin (known from previous experience), so that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>I love that this is so natural, but it left my face extremely oily looking all day.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can really review is the scent.</li>
            <li>You do have to rub it in pretty hard to get rid of the white cast, but it&#x27;s easier to blend than my pick from the 2013 survey, CoTZ Sensitive Sunscreen SPF 40, and you get more of it for less money.</li>
            <li>This cream controls my oil pretty well, is a good base under my makeup and has helped to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, you might need to add a little extra moisture on top.</li>
            <li>maybe after it FINALLY sets in, it may help control oil throughout the day, BUT because of the white cast it leaves, I can&#x27;t go around looking like Casper the friendly ghost, so I always have to use other products- to put color back in-</li>
            <li>Yes, this does leave a white caste on your face just like every physical sunscreen that uses titanium dioxide, but the caste isn&#x27;t that bad and it rubs in pretty easily so that it isn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Thus far, this product does not help with oil control, it is very difficult to blend- even more so than traditional sunscreen &amp; to the point I am tugging at my face to smear the product all over, it leaves a white cast, it takes forever for my skin to absorb (I tried patting it in gently so as not to tug, but because the consistency is so thick, it just doesn&#x27;t seep into my skin nicely like other SPF face lotions), and it&#x27;s greasy feeling-</li>

            <li> My new favourite product hands down!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to soak in and once it does, it sort of disappears, so it&#x27;s not hydrating.</li>
            <li> It makes a good base for powder instead of liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have very oil skin which also suffers from occasional eczema from the dry desert environment which I live in and</li>
            <li> As was commented by another review a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I failed to notice it contained grapes; I&#x27;m very allergic!</li>
            <li> unlike their other products this one still causes me to breakout a bit</li>
            <li> so it is difficult to tell whether it DOES really help with my oily skin OR</li>
            <li> i have really sensitive skin that gets dry and oily if i put the wrong cream on it.</li>
            <li> if the combination of products I&#x27;m using along with this &amp;#34;BB Cream&amp;#34; (i.e. primer and mineral powder), help keep my face less oily.</li>
            <li> i use about a half a dime sized amount every morning.</li>
            <li> but if you have darker skin you might want to go with something less chalky.</li>
            <li> I also have a tendency during the day to get oily so need to use a towel to absorb about half way through my day.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, my forehead and nose bridge begin to get a bit of a sheen to them after a few hours, although...</li>
            <li> and since it is sooo thick &amp; you have to work harder at it to get it all smoothed on &amp; pushed into your skin, I might as well use a thinner easier to apply product that breaks me out.</li>
            <li> I let the moisturizer sit on my face a few minutes before applying my mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> i should say that i&#x27;m really really pale</li>
            <li> It does seem to make your skin overall smoother and healthier looking, however, I did not find it mattifying at all unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s any weird white cast to my complexion when using it.</li>
            <li> I do not find the product greasy, however it is a thick product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick.</li>
            <li> I chose it because it has a very low amount of bad stuff in it, according to the 2014 Environmental Working Group sunscreen survey.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t use the Juice Beauty one anymore because its too thick compare to this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY thick and takes a bit to rub in.</li>
            <li> It keeps the oil at bay (all day) and gives my face an even base from which to apply makeup.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! I use it after the Andalou Naturals Kombucha cleansing gel, and my skin has never looked better. Really controls oil but leaves my face moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to buy an all-natural moisturizer with spf. This product was discovered when I searched the whole internet. After comparing the price and the ingredients, Andalou Naturals came first and I bought it without a doubt. I am glad I did it so I wouldn&#x27;t need to struggle any more. It is as described-- untinted, oil control. It doesn&#x27;t cover anything, but I feel good under the sun after applying it. I don&#x27;t do makeup so it works as a healthy natural sunscreen. One thing I did not enjoy that much is the low speed of shipping. Almost forgot I bought it when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> What I like most about this BB cream is that it almost completely clears my acne on its own. The zinc oxide in this product is whitening when first applied, but it fades rapidly. It&#x27;s also the zinc oxide that clears my skin (known from previous experience), so that&#x27;s fine with me. I like the glow this product gives my skin which is nice without looking oily.</li>
            <li> This untinted BB cream is good if you have a lot of time to allow it to penetrate your skin.  It does seem to make your skin overall smoother and healthier looking, however, I did not find it mattifying at all unfortunately.  Although the natural sunscreen is great, it does leave a white cast so flash photography would probably not turn out great.  I switched back to my Avalon Organics Vitamin C lotion with spf 15....and mix with a dash of Olay Regenerist serum to make it easier to spread.</li>
            <li> Thus far, this product does not help with oil control, it is very difficult to blend- even more so than traditional sunscreen &amp; to the point I am tugging at my face to smear the product all over, it leaves a white cast, it takes forever for my skin to absorb (I tried patting it in gently so as not to tug, but because the consistency is so thick, it just doesn&#x27;t seep into my skin nicely like other SPF face lotions), and it&#x27;s greasy feeling- my skin looks incredibly shiny immediately after using this product, so oil control? maybe after it FINALLY sets in, it may help control oil throughout the day, BUT because of the white cast it leaves, I can&#x27;t go around looking like Casper the friendly ghost, so I always have to use other products- to put color back in-so it is difficult to tell whether it DOES really help with my oily skin OR if the combination of products I&#x27;m using along with this &amp;#34;BB Cream&amp;#34; (i.e. primer and mineral powder), help keep my face less oily. Nevertheless, my forehead and nose bridge begin to get a bit of a sheen to them after a few hours, although... my face doesn&#x27;t FEEL as oily later in the day when I use this product, so that&#x27;s good, I guess...bottom line...I probably won&#x27;t be repurchasing this...</li>
            <li> i love this! i have really sensitive skin that gets dry and oily if i put the wrong cream on it. i use about a half a dime sized amount every morning. it smells really good and keeps my skin moisturized, and i think because of that it&#x27;s less oily by the end of the day. i should say that i&#x27;m really really pale so the white cast this bb cream has doesn&#x27;t show up on me, but if you have darker skin you might want to go with something less chalky.</li>
            <li> This cream controls my oil pretty well, is a good base under my makeup and has helped to clear up my acne. My pores have stayed clearer since I started using this along with using Vitamin E oil at night. Yes, this does leave a white caste on your face just like every physical sunscreen that uses titanium dioxide, but the caste isn&#x27;t that bad and it rubs in pretty easily so that it isn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can really review is the scent. It smells great! Unfortunately, I failed to notice it contained grapes; I&#x27;m very allergic! So I had to remove it within three minutes of putting it on. But it goes on well. My best friend likes it; I had to give it to her.</li>
            <li> I have had melanoma so I am always looking for ways to protect my skin.  I am very fair skinned and have tried dozens of products for the face that I can wear.  They have ranged in price from $5 to $100 and I always have the same challenge of not being able to have them on my face all day.  They become oily or the ingredients irritate my skin or my eyes.  I also have a tendency during the day to get oily so need to use a towel to absorb about half way through my day.  I am in sales so face to face contact is also about not being distracting in your appearance.  As was commented by another review a little goes a long way.  I do not find the product greasy, however it is a thick product.  I personally like that because as I work it in it gives me the additional opportunity to work my face muscles.  I like the scent, the application and that it is un-tinted.  It is the perfect compliment to finish off my skin care routine.  It is worth the price and it is efficacious!  I only wish I had come across it sooner.</li>
            <li> This cream is so think, it feels like putting cement on.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this more than once to use on my face when at the beach.  Although not lightweight, it blends in easily and provides superb sun protection.  In addition, I was seeking protection that was safer in terms of its chemical composition (check out the Environmental Working Group website) and this fit the bill.  Although not inexpensive compared to many, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this produce. It really good with controlling oil &amp; breakouts! She will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> unlike their other products this one still causes me to breakout a bit and since it is sooo thick &amp; you have to work harder at it to get it all smoothed on &amp; pushed into your skin, I might as well use a thinner easier to apply product that breaks me out. Although I don&#x27;t have to because Andalou Naturals makes one called &#x27;DIY Booster SPF 30 facial serum&#x27;. Since my skin is oily, the DIY spf 30 serum works great on it&#x27;s own, no need to add a moisturizer for me. If you have dry skin, you might need to add a little extra moisture on top. I also use their clarifying line serum under that. If the thickness of the BB creams is not to your taste &amp; you are more sensitive like me (where almost all sunscreens cause breakouts), give the DIY Booster SPF 30 facial serum a whirl. The ingredients on ALL their products are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love that this is so natural, but it left my face extremely oily looking all day.</li>
            <li> Pro:  This beauty balm sunblock has excellent ingredients,  smells divine (like oranges), and has great broad-spectrum, mineral-based UV protection.  It makes a good base for powder instead of liquid foundation.  I mist my face with rose water prior to application to facilitate smoothing this product on my skin, which makes application easier [[ASIN:B0001TMDF0 Heritage Store Rose Petals Rosewater 8 oz]].  I am fair so I don&#x27;t mind the whitish cast this leaves on the skin.  Besides, I&#x27;d rather the non-nano-sized mineral in this than a chemical sunblock which might be more cosmetically elegant, but is just a bunch of synthetic chemicals.  The rose water allows it to be spread onto &amp; be massaged into the skin much easier so it is more evenly distributed on the skin and looks better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  As much as I&#x27;d love to give it 5 stars based on the above good qualities, I cannot as it causes my oily skin to shine quickly (it contains oil in the formula) and it feels a little heavier than the lovely mineral Korean and Japanese sunblocks I&#x27;ve been using.  I thought that I could use a US made sunblock, but will keep ordering my sunblock on Amazon and have them shipped from Asia to get what works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read this review.

            <li> This untinted BB cream/SPF is amazing! I have very oil skin which also suffers from occasional eczema from the dry desert environment which I live in and this stuff honestly works wonders for me. It keeps the oil at bay (all day) and gives my face an even base from which to apply makeup. The SPF 30 is great and I don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s any weird white cast to my complexion when using it. You do need to make sure that the product is evenly and completely applied. I let the moisturizer sit on my face a few minutes before applying my mineral foundation. My new favourite product hands down!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had a really good EWG rating and is safe, natural and effective. However, I had intended to use it as a daily moisturizer also and this isn&#x27;t a good product for that. It&#x27;s really thick. It doesn&#x27;t take long to soak in and once it does, it sort of disappears, so it&#x27;s not hydrating. I bought this product because I didn&#x27;t want the tinted one and since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34;, I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be greasy like some sunscreens. But I did want some moisture and since it has hyaluronic acid, I expected it to be a better moisturizer. Not so, I&#x27;m afraid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin and need a higher SPF year-round, this is a perfect product for you (if you don&#x27;t mind the thickness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will save it to use in summer as a regular face sunscreen when I&#x27;ll be out in the sun- I think it&#x27;s perfect for that.</li>
            <li> Bought this when Whole Foods Market is on sale. Zinc Oxide only, no Titanium Dioxide which I&#x27;m allergic to. Texture is wonderfully smooth and easy to spread on, just like their Lavender Shea hand cream. Both are high quality. And no color! Now I don&#x27;t use the Juice Beauty one anymore because its too thick compare to this!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product and the fact that it is a non-chemical SPF. That&#x27;s about all I like. It&#x27;s VERY thick and takes a bit to rub in. It&#x27;s also not oil control in any way. I believe it&#x27;s made with jojoba oil. I&#x27;ll use it until I&#x27;m out however I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> The tube claims this is a BB Cream, but it&#x27;s really only one thing: a physical sunblock. I chose it because it has a very low amount of bad stuff in it, according to the 2014 Environmental Working Group sunscreen survey. You do have to rub it in pretty hard to get rid of the white cast, but it&#x27;s easier to blend than my pick from the 2013 survey, CoTZ Sensitive Sunscreen SPF 40, and you get more of it for less money. Haven&#x27;t tried it under makeup yet, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly hard to find facial products with an SPF higher than 15, so I jumped at the opportunity to try something with SPF 30 -and- a great score from EWG. It is a thicker product, but I actually appreciate that because it feels like I&#x27;m actually putting something on my skin that has some staying power. It sinks in with a nice matte finish and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks (granted I&#x27;m a fair lady, but some sunscreen products do still stand out on my skin and never, ever sink in- I&#x27;m looking at you, Badger sport sunscreen!). The price is comparable to the SPF moisturizer that I was getting from The Body Shop, and the ingredients in this one are better. It was a great buy all around and I&#x27;ll definitely get it again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well. Doesn&#x27;t absorb as much as I&#x27;d like, i still feel the grease of the lotion throughout the day. Does work well with makeup though. I still have oily skin but I didn&#x27;t think this would make it all go away.</li>
