            <li> Very happy with this podruct. The brushes do not she&#x27;d after being cleaned or used. So far the best purchase I&#x27;ve made. I highly recommend this podruct!</li>
            <li> Good quality and easy to clean. These are soft and do good quality work when applying makeup for theater. I use them for my daily makeup application as well. I would recommend them for those who are on a budget but want good brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived super early.. They are soft, look sturdy, and my daughter loves them. They apparently apply color very well and are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes! Grabs product easily, they&#x27;re so soft, and easy to clean. The only part I don&#x27;t like about this set is the brush pouch is comes with. It&#x27;s flimsy and only folds closed.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. They came very fast and work amazing. They are very soft and easy to use. I am glad I  got them. The case it comes in smells bad like plastic but its ok i took them out i like to store my brushes somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I have been needing a new makeup brush set for a while now, and I have been shopping for a great deal out there. So far these have been more than satisfactory. I am content with the selection, and quality. The case is definitely cheaply made, but I store mine in a glass jar with marbles (bristles up). I think this is a great starter kit, and great way to learn your brushes and the benefits of having a variety.</li>
            <li> These brush are very nice. When a bought i wasn´t sure if it was going to be a good thing but i didn´t regret at all.&lt;br /&gt;They are very soft e beautiful</li>
            <li> These brushes are great sizes.  They help with makeup application and seem to wash well.  Would recommend to anyone that wants good brushes without huge price.</li>
            <li> These are NOT &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; 2 of the brushes came damage &amp; after 1 wash there was a lot of fall out. The brushes aren&#x27;t dense &amp; there are 4 brushes that look almost identical to each other. I guess that&#x27;s what you might expect buying a set of cheap brushes. I was hoping although affordable that these brushes would be great but I was very disappointed &amp; I&#x27;m not sure why they have such high reviews. I&#x27;m done buying &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34; brushes &amp; think if you do want quality perhaps spending more would result in better</li>
            <li> So I was really nervous about buying these. I hate buying things online that I can&#x27;t see.  But I was very pleased with these.  I just got them yesterday, washed them last night, and used them this morning.  The brushes pick up product well and have very precise application.  I also love the liner brush, it&#x27;s perfect for softening my eyeliner.  The angled face powder brush is awesome for my blush, perfect size!  And the case is great, some workmanship things I noticed (like strings, creases in material) but for the most part I really love it and it will make it awesome for when I go away and don&#x27;t want to shmoosh my fluffy brushes into a small makeup bag.</li>
            <li> My mother says these are fantastic and i gave it to her as a gift, she&#x27;d had plenty of brands before but these do the job for a mere price of what other brands want you to pay, would buy them again.</li>
            <li> They work as good as any other brush</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes as of right now . 😻</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such beautifully made brushes. These took me by surprise. I&#x27;m ordering another as a gift. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Huge Quantity, good quality, nice packaging!!!</li>
            <li> As a beginner with brushes this item is great for the price and allowed me to try many types to decide the ones that are right for me. They are soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not the biggest brush guru, BUT these are super soft and super nice. Fast shipping. Theres some white powder that comes off them. I&#x27;m sure a good cleaning would take care of the job.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set!  Not only are the brushes soft, but the kit has every brush you could possibly need and a nice case to hold them!  The shipping was super fast to!!!!</li>

            <li> Got for my daughter! Loved them</li>
            <li> these brushes are long just what I wanted. dark wood handle not like this picture. which is great.  brushes are perfect holds nicely not sheds and  when it does its just one or 2 at the time not a big deal. keep them clean and dust them after each use and separate them so the bristles don&#x27;t get deformed. beautiful brushes over all.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the brush heads pop off and need to be reglued.</li>
            <li> I love these...they came in good condition. No weird smells.
