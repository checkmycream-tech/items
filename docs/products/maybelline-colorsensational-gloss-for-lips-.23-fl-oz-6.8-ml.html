            <li>It goes on velvety smooth and feels great on my lips.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping it would give my lips a nice shade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was cheap and now I know why!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay :)</li>
            <li>It looks more like a nude color.</li>
            <li>Love the color and ease of application.</li>
            <li>I was very excited for when this lip gloss would come.</li>
            <li>Pretty good lip gloss .</li>
            <li>other people even can&#x27;t recognize that I had used this, I think it perfect.</li>
            <li>quick service, nice price with free delivery, but light on the color than the one I bought from Target...</li>
            <li>Beautiful gloss not over powering and actually smell quite tasty.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday wear!</li>
            <li>I was excited but then opened it.</li>
            <li>I was soooooo excited to get this supposed &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I really love the Maybelline lip glosses and really, really wished that it was the beautiful pink color that is pictured.</li>
            <li>They were quick to respond and refunded my money.  </li>
            <li>This was worth $2 though, I guess.</li>
            <li>Loved the way this PINK lip gloss looked however it was discountined at the retail stores</li>
            <li>I have a pale complexion and the light frosty color looks good on me.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s to give them a little more shine, but mostly I use it by itself.  </li>
            <li>When I received the 4 lip glosses, they were more of a brownish-broze shade than the pink that is displayed by the picture associated with this item (and my original I have with me</li>
            <li>Again, even the picture associated with this item is EXACTLY the color I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li>still is a nice color if it wasn&#x27;t for the other one I got..</li>
            <li>The product that I thought I was buying (Pink Perfection: which looks like a bright bubblegum pink online) is not pink at all, but more of an orange brown/tan.</li>
            <li>It stays for an hour or two, looks fine and isn&#x27;t gross.</li>
            <li>Not even in real packaging.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not at all the real color</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It was more orangy-brown than pink.</li>
            <li>I love the pink color .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind it, but I was looking forward to having cute pink lips and not skin-colored ones.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky or tacky like so many other lip gloss&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it on top of other lip gloss</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this was because I read some reviews and they were saying it wasn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to young girls who love pink .</li>
            <li>Hardly anything comes out and what does is not any kind of color.  </li>
            <li>It was clear to nude and very frosty in color.  </li>
            <li>A few touch ups here and there but lovely gloss.</li>
            <li>I think that this should be re-labeled as a new color, like frosty nude.  </li>
            <li>The color was completely off from the picture though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they have fixed the problem or if they are still selling the defective gloss.  </li>
            <li>, it looks more like sandish, waste of money because I order the color sand at the same time.bit</li>
            <li>I ordered the right name, number &amp; color (Maybelline Pink Perfection #035).  </li>
            <li>The shipping and delivery were very fast though, I received my package only a few days after ordering it.</li>

            <li> I bought the pink color that shows the pic</li>
            <li> I expected rosy pink</li>
            <li> I am giving this product three out of five stars because upon opening the package, the product what not as pink as the pink claimed it was going to be.</li>
            <li> please dont buy this ,i ordered one color but delivered the other one</li>
            <li> Still not sure how the colors are so different.</li>

            <li> It came all sticky and I never use it waste of money. But I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Great discovery for a gloss junkie!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited for when this lip gloss would come. I was getting the &#x27;Pink Perfection&#x27; pink color as a birthday gift for my friend. When it came, I noticed that in fact wasn&#x27;t pink perfection. but it was a brownish sandy color. I looked at all of the color options for this brand lip gloss and instead of &#x27;Pink Perfection&#x27; like I ordered, it came in as &#x27;Sandstone Shimmer&#x27;. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> please dont buy this ,i ordered one color but delivered the other one and it seems like the used one not the new one.please dont waste your money on buying this!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Omg. Where do I start? This gloss is the bomb! Glides like a dream on the lips. Stays on for at least 4-5 hours. A few touch ups here and there but lovely gloss. Beautiful gloss not over powering and actually smell quite tasty. Perfect for everyday wear!</li>
            <li> I waited for my lip gloss and as soon it came I was excited but then opened it. Wrong color it was ugly light brown. Not even in real packaging.</li>
            <li> hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i grab this one for my wife as a gift and shes happy with it , no problems or issues at all , recommended .</li>
            <li> I bought the pink color that shows the pic but that&#x27;s not at all the real color, it looks more like sandish, waste of money because I order the color sand at the same time.bit still is a nice color if it wasn&#x27;t for the other one I got.. The pic Is just misleading.</li>
            <li> Made my lips moisturized. They&#x27;re always dry, and this helped. Shiny, and Beautiful.</li>
            <li> I hate it so so much! It&#x27;s not even the color in the picture! The &amp;#34;pink perfection&amp;#34; is the color of sand. It has the label &amp;#34;pink perfection&amp;#34; on it so I know it wasn&#x27;t a mix up. Do not get this color. I hate it so much! It&#x27;s unusable. Just don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I really like it. I use it every day. other people even can&#x27;t recognize that I had used this, I think it perfect.</li>
            <li> I ordered a pink perfection and it was not the color i expected, I was kinda clear and very pink to me. I expected rosy pink</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this was because I read some reviews and they were saying it wasn&#x27;t sticky. I hate sticky lip glosses! It isn&#x27;t sticky or gooey. It&#x27;s shiny. The color was completely off from the picture though. It was more orangy-brown than pink. It still works.</li>
            <li> I was soooooo excited to get this supposed &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; lipgloss, only to  find out this gloss wasnot at all the cir it potrayed to be! It was a nasty beige looking grey gloss not pink whatsoever!  Grrrrrrrrrrtt!</li>
            <li> The product that I thought I was buying (Pink Perfection: which looks like a bright bubblegum pink online) is not pink at all, but more of an orange brown/tan. I don&#x27;t really mind it, but I was looking forward to having cute pink lips and not skin-colored ones. The finish is pearl-like, and it&#x27;s a little sticky but that&#x27;s compared to my $20 [[ASIN:B004D8KP1Y Fusion Beauty LipFusion Luxe Boudoir Collection - Coquette - 7.7g/0.27oz]] &amp;lt;--- If you can afford it, you will NOT regret it. This was worth $2 though, I guess. It stays for an hour or two, looks fine and isn&#x27;t gross.</li>
            <li> Hardly anything comes out and what does is not any kind of color.  It&#x27;s was cheap and now I know why!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay :) The shipping took for ever.....</li>
            <li> Pretty good lip gloss . I love the pink color . Highly recommend to young girls who love pink .</li>
            <li> quick service, nice price with free delivery, but light on the color than the one I bought from Target... still like it, use it every day.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product three out of five stars because upon opening the package, the product what not as pink as the pink claimed it was going to be. It looks more like a nude color. The shipping and delivery were very fast though, I received my package only a few days after ordering it.</li>
            <li> Love the color and ease of application. Does not last all day though.</li>
            <li> The Pink Perfection was not pink.  It was clear to nude and very frosty in color.  I contacted the seller and they said it was a defective batch.  They were quick to respond and refunded my money.  I don&#x27;t know if they have fixed the problem or if they are still selling the defective gloss.  However I am still using the gloss.  It is not sticky or tacky like so many other lip gloss&#x27;s.  It goes on velvety smooth and feels great on my lips.  I think that this should be re-labeled as a new color, like frosty nude.  It is really starting to grow on me.  Sometimes I use it on top of other lip gloss&#x27;s to give them a little more shine, but mostly I use it by itself.  I have a pale complexion and the light frosty color looks good on me.  I have included a picture of the lip gloss.  It is the one with the silver cap.  I have my old lip gloss from Avon next to it with the black cap, which is defiantly pink for a comparison.  I really love the Maybelline lip glosses and really, really wished that it was the beautiful pink color that is pictured. I have since tried to find that color in the stores, but it is not carried in my local stores.  Sad Face :(</li>
            <li> Wish they still made this--best lip gloss I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Great color and gloss.</li>
            <li> Its is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy too frosty for me. I mean... I&#x27;m a black female, so it might be my skin tone, but I still think its waaaaaaaayyyyy too frosty. It is so frosty, when i put it on, There were kids around me singing and dancing in the snow. Yeah, I turned into a damn snowman when I put this lip gloss on. Its that frosty.</li>
            <li> I ordered the right name, number &amp; color (Maybelline Pink Perfection #035).  When I received the 4 lip glosses, they were more of a brownish-broze shade than the pink that is displayed by the picture associated with this item (and my original I have with me but has very little in it). Very disappointing. Still not sure how the colors are so different. Again, even the picture associated with this item is EXACTLY the color I thought I was ordering. Loved the way this PINK lip gloss looked however it was discountined at the retail stores and thus I had to order it through Amazon and received a brownish color. NOT HAPPY AT ALL</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would give my lips a nice shade. I wish I could have at least got to try it. I never received the lipgloss even. I kept waiting and waiting for a package to arrive but nothing came. WASTE OF MONEY DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
