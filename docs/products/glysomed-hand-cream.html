            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I tried all most every type of creams on the market.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this hand cream for many years.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Best way to use it is to apply before bed, and wear white cotton gloves overnight.  </li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever used for my extemely dry winter hands.  </li>
            <li>the best for dry skin</li>
            <li>After two nights of applying Glysomed Hand Cream at bedtime, his hands are smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>but if you can put up with it the results are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>just wish it were available in the stores.</li>
            <li>It is not an anti-psoriasis cream, it just helps with hydration of the skin, but in a very powerful way</li>
            <li>Great for dry, cracking hands!</li>
            <li>And the nice thing is, even though it&#x27;s only a 5 oz.</li>
            <li>I love using this at night before bed and then putting my hands in some soft gloves.  </li>
            <li>Smart buy!</li>
            <li>Good product for people who wash their hands frequently or need extra care during the winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a week since the last application and his hands are still smooth!</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t immune to that greasy feeling completely, but it&#x27;s much better than any standard drug store lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love how my hands feel in the long run: soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s, Bag Balm, Aquaphor, and Jack Black; Glysomed works better for me.  </li>
            <li>Soft hands in the morning!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that really works without being so greasy and oily.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the tins locally which last a long time but this product is also available in a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li>But, like most people, I hate how greasy most lotions make your hands feel.</li>
            <li>It works very well on dry skin renewing the dry areas back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I shared it with my 87 year old Mother, who thought nothing could help her dry hands.</li>

            <li> This cream works well to help to prevent the cracked skin on my hands in the winter.  There&#x27;s a slight odor but once I&#x27;ve rubbed it on my hands, I can hardly detect the scent.  There&#x27;s a shiny residue but it&#x27;s not too greasy feeling.  I&#x27;ve tried O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s, Bag Balm, Aquaphor, and Jack Black; Glysomed works better for me.  I&#x27;ve had this jar for about a month and there&#x27;s plenty of cream left in it for next winter.  I also use the Avon silicone glove.  Only one crack in the past month where I generally get several.</li>
            <li> Glysomed Hand Cream does have a bit of a greasy feeling to begin with but if you can put up with it the results are pretty amazing. I love how my hands feel in the long run: soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time w/ my hands being dry in the winter and this stuff works better than anything else I have tried to heal the dryness. Smart buy!</li>
            <li> It works very well on dry skin renewing the dry areas back to normal.  I would recommend it and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> A friend turned me on to this hand cream a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since! It&#x27;s not greasy, and my hands are still moisturized even after I wash them. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I shared it with my 87 year old Mother, who thought nothing could help her dry hands. Well I will be ordering Glysomed Hand Cream for her so I can have mine back.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it were available in the stores. This product is Amazing.</li>
            <li> My hands get dry and cracked in the winter. But, like most people, I hate how greasy most lotions make your hands feel. This stuff isn&#x27;t immune to that greasy feeling completely, but it&#x27;s much better than any standard drug store lotion I&#x27;ve tried. And the nice thing is, even though it&#x27;s only a 5 oz. container, you need very, very little to get the job done, since it&#x27;s very dense. I&#x27;ve had the same container for over a year and expect it to last quite a bit longer still.</li>
            <li> My hands get dry every winter.  I tried all most every type of creams on the market.  This is the one and only one works for me.  I have been using it for the last three years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hand cream for many years. It provides a protective layer on you hands but isn&#x27;t overly oily. I can&#x27;t find the tins locally which last a long time but this product is also available in a squeeze tube. Good product for people who wash their hands frequently or need extra care during the winter. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I love using this at night before bed and then putting my hands in some soft gloves.  then, i wake up with baby skin!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !!! Best hand cream ever !!!</li>
            <li> Best handcreme on the market.  My hands are in &amp; out of water constantly.  This is my go to.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is not available locally.  SO GLAD I FOUND IT!!  It works so very much better than anything else!</li>
            <li> My husband does a LOT of handwashing and his hands are always so dry and cracked. After two nights of applying Glysomed Hand Cream at bedtime, his hands are smooth and healthy. It&#x27;s been a week since the last application and his hands are still smooth! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great for dry, cracking hands!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used for my extemely dry winter hands.  It&#x27;s the only thing that really works without being so greasy and oily.  Best way to use it is to apply before bed, and wear white cotton gloves overnight.  Soft hands in the morning!!</li>

            <li> the best for dry skin</li>
            <li> Really good hand cream but boy is it pricey. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the $$. That is just not necessary.</li>
            <li> FOR MY WIFE  recommended by philippinos for philippinos.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, but a rediculous price. It is three times what it should cost. It is a Canadian product and I&#x27;d expect to pay a bit more but not that much more!</li>
