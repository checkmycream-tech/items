            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My favorite leave in conditioner !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love that they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li>I use it every day and my hair looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have another Paul Mitchell product and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>It has also come in handy on vacation as an after sun burn lotion.</li>
            <li>It is chemical-smelling, kind of like paint.</li>
            <li>Updated--I completely changed my mind, this is the best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Just did my BC 7weeks ago, and this is by far the best leave-in conditioner everrr.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner on the market by far.</li>
            <li>a tip, it works best when the hair is damp, not wet.</li>
            <li>I just enjoy touching it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because I love Paul Mitchell&#x27;s cruelty-free products (vegan, no animal testing)</li>
            <li>and I love their shampoo (smells soooo goood - as does this)</li>
            <li>Ok let me start this review off by saying almost every hair stylist I&#x27;ve ever been to has said I have the thickest hair they&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>I have been thoroughly enjoying using this product with my cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It tames any flyaways and leaves our hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a conditioner that would work well with keeping my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>so I better use it up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love, love, and love some more.  </li>
            <li>There are many Equine products on the market specifically for showing</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell products been around for years and still one of the top brands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>More aqueous consistency than gel but better results.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is outmatched and like the reviews mention, your hair will LOVE this stuff, you will LOVE this stuff, HECK even your skin will love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>My hair needs more conditioner than before I used it...</li>
            <li>And I love the smell</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It works great and the time frame of getting the product was fast..</li>
            <li>Not at all sure I want to try just leaving it in.</li>
            <li>I gave it 1 star for the okay smell...</li>
            <li>My hair has never been shinier, and I am so glad I took the leap and bought it despite the cost.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the  years.</li>
            <li>In warmer weather my hair seems to like it better than in winter.</li>
            <li>Much better results than the GVP Sally&#x27;s version, which I was doing a comparison of.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>Love the The Conditioner, have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for the last 6 years as a detangler for my daughters hair and it is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner smells SO much better then \\&quot;The</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t tested on animals which is great!&lt;br /&gt;Giving this four stars (4 1/2 if I could) because the conditioner gets clogged in the dispenser thing on top of the bottle where it comes out</li>
            <li>It makes it smooth and shiny too, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I also use this as an alternate to shaving cream and always have its incredible for all hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price was fair, more reasonable than in the salon...</li>
            <li>The Original original was amazing.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes my skin while making my hair silky smooth :-)</li>
            <li>Great slip, makes my Kinky/Curly hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is something that Paul Mitchell needs to work on to make their bottles with a more secure cap.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and this is excellent for detangling and even better as a leave-in!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesnt greese up your hair, and is really easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>But I prefer to use about a tablespoon worked into my hair immediately after washing while still in the shower, then rinse it out for tangle free hair that doesn&#x27;t fly away with static after I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li>smell like some cheap shampoo brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product from Amazon several times before with great results, so I decided to order it again.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair amazingly smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>overall it is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is not as sticky and has a smooth gel-like form.</li>
            <li>I like Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner, make my hair feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and I have been using it for a number of years,  it  really works!!!</li>
            <li>It takes very little of this to leave your hair in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>This Faux Original is greasier and heavier on the perfume.</li>
            <li>suppose the CEO calculated that if they used cheaper ingredients and called it the Original, we wouldn&#x27;t notice.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the original conditioner has changed</li>
            <li>I love this product on my natural hair!!!!</li>
            <li>With the Real Original I quickly applied the cream and was ready to go.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it would cost a whole lot more than here.</li>
            <li>am on my 4th bottle of John Frieda Full Repair Repairing Elixir Oil</li>
            <li>definitely last a good while.</li>
            <li>I am truely amazed.</li>
            <li>Buying the bigger size was a wise investment.</li>
            <li>but I just take the whole top off to get it out now</li>
            <li>My hair feels so good and actually has shine to it now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very crisp clean smell nothing fruity.  </li>
            <li>Its a good product and will last a good long time.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, smooth and feel super healthy.</li>
            <li>Salon size bottle and quick and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>packaged, fairly quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My first clue that the product was not legit should have been the price - a salon quality brand like Paul Mitchell would not sell as cheaply (approx.</li>
            <li>than that tiny problem, this conditioner makes my hair nice and soft and the smell is nice (after the hair dries there is no smell).&lt;br /&gt;***Also</li>
            <li>Secondly, when i first applied the product, it did not smell good.</li>
            <li>Detangler\\&quot; too which my child really likes!!</li>
            <li>so the product I received was almost five (5) years old!!!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply amazing because before The Conditioner I would have a wad of hair left over in my brush after each shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a myriad of leave-in conditioners to keep my hair looking healthy after dye jobs and rough abuse, and NONE has worked better than Paul Mitchell&#x27;s The Conditioner.   </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;hair curls nicely like when i was younger</li>
            <li>I am sure this will work for others but for my 4b/4c natural hair...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is totally worth</li>
            <li>This product is worth it.</li>
            <li>I use just a dab while fresh out of the shower, and the brush just slides right through.</li>
            <li>Adds just the right amount of moisture to hair ends....</li>
            <li>My hair just acts right after I use this.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t act right?  </li>
            <li>right after I get out of</li>
            <li>True enough, when I examined the bottle more closely, I realized that on the bottom of the bottle, the expiration date read December 2009.  </li>
            <li>which is nothing a little polishing oil or serum cant handle, but otherwise, this product is amazing and I will be stocking up on it!</li>
            <li>It is perfect to use on my long hair and leaves my hair very manageable and not frizzy all day long.  </li>
            <li>Will be back for more * shop shipped the items very fast!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, it&#x27;s a great leave-in product, it leaves the hair moisturized for days without weighing it down or leaving a residue build-up.</li>
            <li>Came super fast .</li>
            <li>VERY OLD!!!  </li>
            <li>The Faux requires you to rinse off the extra greasiness from your hands, which takes more time and</li>
            <li>but this is the first conditioner I have tried by PM</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I tried this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love this, and have used it for several years.  </li>
            <li>curls look nice, when applied on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>The stuff in this bottle resembled the product we know and love in only its color.</li>
            <li>I purchased my conditioner from a local retailer and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My wife said my hair smelled funny, like medicinal.</li>
            <li>When I first started using PM conditioner, it was working well.</li>
            <li>I googled it and sure enough, people make or take the valid bottles out of the trash and fill it with whatever gel or solution that is cheapest.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my hair.</li>
            <li>So glad I finally found it..</li>
            <li>The latest has been almost the last 2yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the second time I buy it online and is way better ...</li>
            <li>Quick delivery from a new Amazon seller.</li>
            <li>it kept my curls elongated, so they didn&#x27;t shrink and hide like they normally do!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that it works better as a holding gel if your hair is dry, but I&#x27;ve not tested this.</li>
            <li>It is the best supplement leave-in conditioner for my long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>We show horses and I buy large bottle of this for manes and tails.  </li>
            <li>Use it on wet or dry hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>The scent didn&#x27;t smell so good, but I didn&#x27;t really care so much because the scent didn&#x27;t last long after blow-drying and straightening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how I really only need a little bit in my hair, most products I have to pile on</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know how to deal with it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>works well alot cheaper on line thanks for the savings.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair (3c)</li>
            <li>I dont even have that much hair</li>
            <li>This is a knockoff product and NOT the real deal.</li>
            <li>It stays shiny and sleek and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Received this in a very timely manner too.</li>
            <li>i didnt even put that much on.</li>
            <li>The bottle was very dusty...fooled me once.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length, straight baby-fine hair, and a lot of conditioners</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>This conditioner is a light blue hue.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t like conditioner you use in the shower, you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it makes my hair much softer that way than when I put it in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a conditioner and hair gell in one, leaves hair soft yet stays in place at the same time :)</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other leave-in conditioners over the years and have never found anything that works as well as the Paul Mitchell Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This is a totally different formula from the original.  </li>
            <li>I should have got the smallest bottle to try instead of taking the good reviews so seriously and got the biggest bottle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair at all and has a very light</li>
            <li>The key here is to apply lightly, you can always use a little more if you feel it didn&#x27;t penetrate through to all layers.</li>
            <li>I use it after I blown dry my hair and this make my hair wet again and with a not so good smell.</li>
            <li>more importantly it&#x27;s not as good as the original.</li>
            <li>It smells good and this bottle is big enough to last my wife and me a couple of years...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product now!</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than any shaving gel I have ever tried and costs much less.  </li>
            <li>I use it along with Olive Oil hair moisturizer and main listen....</li>
            <li>Works great to moisturize my daughters thick curly hair instantly.  </li>
            <li>Great for person who have dry hair and no more scalp.</li>
            <li>this is my holy grail product its mixes well with eco styler gel highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff on and off since High school.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, tropical smelling, immediately tames my hair, my hair feels much better, is easier to work with when dry, dries faster, my ends are not as dry, therefore not retaining the water in the dry ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this was leave in conditioner when I bought it, but I recently found out that conditioner is great alternative to shaving gel and leaves less red marks.</li>
            <li>This would be a 4 if the smell could be a little better.</li>
            <li>It makes my Natural Hair Softer, Shinier and Curlier!!  </li>
            <li>I have fine naturally curly hair that tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li>This product was runny, and not the normal consistency of the Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as a quick way to tame it, quick brush and go.</li>
            <li>Some of my friends love it year round.</li>
            <li>I have used the conditioner as its called by Paul Mitchell for several years with the same result every time FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels like hair, very soft with no snarls, no feeling of product in the strands.  </li>
            <li>I use a very little and it keeps my hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is the only leave in conditioner that I have used consistently for 9 years.</li>
            <li>I normally use Giovanni&#x27;s weightless leave in, but this is by far one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and realized quickly it is old!  </li>
            <li>From personal experience this means they are using TOO much!</li>
            <li>Plus this HUGE bottle costs much less than some of the &amp;#34;newer fad&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li>I still have more than half a bottle left after a year.</li>
            <li>The original one is thicker and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is left soft, without so much frizz</li>
            <li>not to say that you don&#x27;t need an additional product if you really want that polished look, but it will do if you&#x27;re extremely short on time... which I always am.   </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soooo soft.  </li>
            <li>I have natural 4a/b hair</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair.</li>
            <li>It makes detangling a breeze and leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on Paul Mitchell if it&#x27;s not from a salon.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the Paul Mitchell \\&quot;The Detangler\\&quot; but it DID NOT work nearly as well as \\&quot;The Conditioner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My barber says my hair is incredibly thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>My bottle from Amazon has worked fine -- just as well as bottles I&#x27;ve bought from salons in the past.</li>
            <li>very dry and most products that I use only make my hair soft while wet once it dries then</li>
            <li>One positive thing about the conditioner is that it didn&#x27;t make my hair hard at all like most other conditioners do to curly hair.</li>
            <li>This product when straight to the trash because God knows what kinda damage this would have done to my hair in the long run.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very rural area and walmart, target etc did not carry.  </li>
            <li>Well my most recent order was a HUGE disappointment because the thickness and consistency of the conditioner led me to believe someone watered it down pretty substantially in order to stretch its volume.  </li>
            <li>not sure if it&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li>This conditioner kept my curls defined and (something no other product has done before)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually one to complain about such things, and this still gets to me.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make my hair smooth in the least and it gets all tangly after using it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after conducting some general research online about the product.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast - however - i wish there was a seal on the conditioner because the bag that it was sent in the box had conditioner all through it from a long shipping - seems like this would be a simple thing rather than bagging each bottle?</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product and even used it for a whole week as a conditioner (for wash and go&#x27;s) and a small amount for a leave in to layer in with gel.  </li>
            <li>I put it on at night, and the next morning my hair was still soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>From the other reviews it certainly seems like we were mostly unlucky, but the most recent review, by &amp;#34;Chris,&amp;#34; which relays a very similar experience to ours, suggests that possibly the recent warehouse batch that they&#x27;re sending out is bad.</li>
            <li>Could have saved so much money on all those other products I bought.  </li>
            <li>put it on leave it and your hair will never dry out</li>
            <li>A little definitely goes a long way so unless you want your hair to look like its full of foamy white stuff use this sparingly.</li>
            <li>It adds so much texture to my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and this takes away tangles without adding weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it does wonders for my thin, fine hair.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I did not report it as they did the best they could.  </li>

            <li> A very effective and satisfying product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li> You need more stars!  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in conditioner !</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love that they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> I use it every day and my hair looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have another Paul Mitchell product and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> It has also come in handy on vacation as an after sun burn lotion.</li>
            <li> It is chemical-smelling, kind of like paint.</li>
            <li> Updated--I completely changed my mind, this is the best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Just did my BC 7weeks ago, and this is by far the best leave-in conditioner everrr.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner on the market by far.</li>
            <li> a tip, it works best when the hair is damp, not wet.</li>
            <li> I just enjoy touching it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because I love Paul Mitchell&#x27;s cruelty-free products (vegan, no animal testing)</li>
            <li> and I love their shampoo (smells soooo goood - as does this)</li>
            <li> Ok let me start this review off by saying almost every hair stylist I&#x27;ve ever been to has said I have the thickest hair they&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I have been thoroughly enjoying using this product with my cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It tames any flyaways and leaves our hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a conditioner that would work well with keeping my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li> so I better use it up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love, love, and love some more.  </li>
            <li> There are many Equine products on the market specifically for showing</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell products been around for years and still one of the top brands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> More aqueous consistency than gel but better results.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is outmatched and like the reviews mention, your hair will LOVE this stuff, you will LOVE this stuff, HECK even your skin will love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> My hair needs more conditioner than before I used it...</li>
            <li> And I love the smell</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It works great and the time frame of getting the product was fast..</li>
            <li> Not at all sure I want to try just leaving it in.</li>
            <li> I gave it 1 star for the okay smell...</li>
            <li> My hair has never been shinier, and I am so glad I took the leap and bought it despite the cost.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the  years.</li>
            <li> In warmer weather my hair seems to like it better than in winter.</li>
            <li> Much better results than the GVP Sally&#x27;s version, which I was doing a comparison of.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Love the The Conditioner, have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 6 years as a detangler for my daughters hair and it is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner smells SO much better then \\&quot;The</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t tested on animals which is great!&lt;br /&gt;Giving this four stars (4 1/2 if I could) because the conditioner gets clogged in the dispenser thing on top of the bottle where it comes out</li>
            <li> It makes it smooth and shiny too, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I also use this as an alternate to shaving cream and always have its incredible for all hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price was fair, more reasonable than in the salon...</li>
            <li> The Original original was amazing.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes my skin while making my hair silky smooth :-)</li>
            <li> Great slip, makes my Kinky/Curly hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is something that Paul Mitchell needs to work on to make their bottles with a more secure cap.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this is excellent for detangling and even better as a leave-in!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesnt greese up your hair, and is really easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> But I prefer to use about a tablespoon worked into my hair immediately after washing while still in the shower, then rinse it out for tangle free hair that doesn&#x27;t fly away with static after I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> smell like some cheap shampoo brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product from Amazon several times before with great results, so I decided to order it again.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair amazingly smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth.  </li>
            <li> overall it is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is not as sticky and has a smooth gel-like form.</li>
            <li> I like Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner, make my hair feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for a number of years,  it  really works!!!</li>
            <li> It takes very little of this to leave your hair in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> This Faux Original is greasier and heavier on the perfume.</li>
            <li> suppose the CEO calculated that if they used cheaper ingredients and called it the Original, we wouldn&#x27;t notice.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the original conditioner has changed</li>
            <li> I love this product on my natural hair!!!!</li>
            <li> With the Real Original I quickly applied the cream and was ready to go.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure it would cost a whole lot more than here.</li>
            <li> am on my 4th bottle of John Frieda Full Repair Repairing Elixir Oil</li>
            <li> definitely last a good while.</li>
            <li> I am truely amazed.</li>
            <li> Buying the bigger size was a wise investment.</li>
            <li> but I just take the whole top off to get it out now</li>
            <li> My hair feels so good and actually has shine to it now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very crisp clean smell nothing fruity.  </li>
            <li> Its a good product and will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, smooth and feel super healthy.</li>
            <li> Salon size bottle and quick and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> packaged, fairly quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My first clue that the product was not legit should have been the price - a salon quality brand like Paul Mitchell would not sell as cheaply (approx.</li>
            <li> than that tiny problem, this conditioner makes my hair nice and soft and the smell is nice (after the hair dries there is no smell).&lt;br /&gt;***Also</li>
            <li> Secondly, when i first applied the product, it did not smell good.</li>
            <li> Detangler\\&quot; too which my child really likes!!</li>
            <li> so the product I received was almost five (5) years old!!!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply amazing because before The Conditioner I would have a wad of hair left over in my brush after each shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a myriad of leave-in conditioners to keep my hair looking healthy after dye jobs and rough abuse, and NONE has worked better than Paul Mitchell&#x27;s The Conditioner.   </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;hair curls nicely like when i was younger</li>
            <li> I am sure this will work for others but for my 4b/4c natural hair...</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is totally worth</li>
            <li> This product is worth it.</li>
            <li> I use just a dab while fresh out of the shower, and the brush just slides right through.</li>
            <li> Adds just the right amount of moisture to hair ends....</li>
            <li> My hair just acts right after I use this.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t act right?  </li>
            <li> right after I get out of</li>
            <li> True enough, when I examined the bottle more closely, I realized that on the bottom of the bottle, the expiration date read December 2009.  </li>
            <li> which is nothing a little polishing oil or serum cant handle, but otherwise, this product is amazing and I will be stocking up on it!</li>
            <li> It is perfect to use on my long hair and leaves my hair very manageable and not frizzy all day long.  </li>
            <li> Will be back for more * shop shipped the items very fast!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, it&#x27;s a great leave-in product, it leaves the hair moisturized for days without weighing it down or leaving a residue build-up.</li>
            <li> Came super fast .</li>
            <li> VERY OLD!!!  </li>
            <li> The Faux requires you to rinse off the extra greasiness from your hands, which takes more time and</li>
            <li> but this is the first conditioner I have tried by PM</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I tried this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love this, and have used it for several years.  </li>
            <li> curls look nice, when applied on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> The stuff in this bottle resembled the product we know and love in only its color.</li>
            <li> I purchased my conditioner from a local retailer and I love it.  </li>
            <li> My wife said my hair smelled funny, like medicinal.</li>
            <li> When I first started using PM conditioner, it was working well.</li>
            <li> I googled it and sure enough, people make or take the valid bottles out of the trash and fill it with whatever gel or solution that is cheapest.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my hair.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally found it..</li>
            <li> The latest has been almost the last 2yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy it online and is way better ...</li>
            <li> Quick delivery from a new Amazon seller.</li>
            <li> it kept my curls elongated, so they didn&#x27;t shrink and hide like they normally do!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that it works better as a holding gel if your hair is dry, but I&#x27;ve not tested this.</li>
            <li> It is the best supplement leave-in conditioner for my long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> We show horses and I buy large bottle of this for manes and tails.  </li>
            <li> Use it on wet or dry hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> The scent didn&#x27;t smell so good, but I didn&#x27;t really care so much because the scent didn&#x27;t last long after blow-drying and straightening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how I really only need a little bit in my hair, most products I have to pile on</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know how to deal with it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> works well alot cheaper on line thanks for the savings.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair (3c)</li>
            <li> I dont even have that much hair</li>
            <li> This is a knockoff product and NOT the real deal.</li>
            <li> It stays shiny and sleek and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Received this in a very timely manner too.</li>
            <li> i didnt even put that much on.</li>
            <li> The bottle was very dusty...fooled me once.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length, straight baby-fine hair, and a lot of conditioners</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a light blue hue.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like conditioner you use in the shower, you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it makes my hair much softer that way than when I put it in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a conditioner and hair gell in one, leaves hair soft yet stays in place at the same time :)</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other leave-in conditioners over the years and have never found anything that works as well as the Paul Mitchell Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This is a totally different formula from the original.  </li>
            <li> I should have got the smallest bottle to try instead of taking the good reviews so seriously and got the biggest bottle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair at all and has a very light</li>
            <li> The key here is to apply lightly, you can always use a little more if you feel it didn&#x27;t penetrate through to all layers.</li>
            <li> I use it after I blown dry my hair and this make my hair wet again and with a not so good smell.</li>
            <li> more importantly it&#x27;s not as good as the original.</li>
            <li> It smells good and this bottle is big enough to last my wife and me a couple of years...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product now!</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any shaving gel I have ever tried and costs much less.  </li>
            <li> I use it along with Olive Oil hair moisturizer and main listen....</li>
            <li> Works great to moisturize my daughters thick curly hair instantly.  </li>
            <li> Great for person who have dry hair and no more scalp.</li>
            <li> this is my holy grail product its mixes well with eco styler gel highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff on and off since High school.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, tropical smelling, immediately tames my hair, my hair feels much better, is easier to work with when dry, dries faster, my ends are not as dry, therefore not retaining the water in the dry ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was leave in conditioner when I bought it, but I recently found out that conditioner is great alternative to shaving gel and leaves less red marks.</li>
            <li> This would be a 4 if the smell could be a little better.</li>
            <li> It makes my Natural Hair Softer, Shinier and Curlier!!  </li>
            <li> I have fine naturally curly hair that tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> This product was runny, and not the normal consistency of the Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as a quick way to tame it, quick brush and go.</li>
            <li> Some of my friends love it year round.</li>
            <li> I have used the conditioner as its called by Paul Mitchell for several years with the same result every time FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels like hair, very soft with no snarls, no feeling of product in the strands.  </li>
            <li> I use a very little and it keeps my hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the only leave in conditioner that I have used consistently for 9 years.</li>
            <li> I normally use Giovanni&#x27;s weightless leave in, but this is by far one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and realized quickly it is old!  </li>
            <li> From personal experience this means they are using TOO much!</li>
            <li> Plus this HUGE bottle costs much less than some of the &amp;#34;newer fad&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li> I still have more than half a bottle left after a year.</li>
            <li> The original one is thicker and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is left soft, without so much frizz</li>
            <li> not to say that you don&#x27;t need an additional product if you really want that polished look, but it will do if you&#x27;re extremely short on time... which I always am.   </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soooo soft.  </li>
            <li> I have natural 4a/b hair</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair.</li>
            <li> It makes detangling a breeze and leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on Paul Mitchell if it&#x27;s not from a salon.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the Paul Mitchell \\&quot;The Detangler\\&quot; but it DID NOT work nearly as well as \\&quot;The Conditioner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My barber says my hair is incredibly thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> My bottle from Amazon has worked fine -- just as well as bottles I&#x27;ve bought from salons in the past.</li>
            <li> very dry and most products that I use only make my hair soft while wet once it dries then</li>
            <li> One positive thing about the conditioner is that it didn&#x27;t make my hair hard at all like most other conditioners do to curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product when straight to the trash because God knows what kinda damage this would have done to my hair in the long run.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very rural area and walmart, target etc did not carry.  </li>
            <li> Well my most recent order was a HUGE disappointment because the thickness and consistency of the conditioner led me to believe someone watered it down pretty substantially in order to stretch its volume.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li> This conditioner kept my curls defined and (something no other product has done before)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to complain about such things, and this still gets to me.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make my hair smooth in the least and it gets all tangly after using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after conducting some general research online about the product.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast - however - i wish there was a seal on the conditioner because the bag that it was sent in the box had conditioner all through it from a long shipping - seems like this would be a simple thing rather than bagging each bottle?</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product and even used it for a whole week as a conditioner (for wash and go&#x27;s) and a small amount for a leave in to layer in with gel.  </li>
            <li> I put it on at night, and the next morning my hair was still soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> From the other reviews it certainly seems like we were mostly unlucky, but the most recent review, by &amp;#34;Chris,&amp;#34; which relays a very similar experience to ours, suggests that possibly the recent warehouse batch that they&#x27;re sending out is bad.</li>
            <li> Could have saved so much money on all those other products I bought.  </li>
            <li> put it on leave it and your hair will never dry out</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way so unless you want your hair to look like its full of foamy white stuff use this sparingly.</li>
            <li> It adds so much texture to my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and this takes away tangles without adding weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it does wonders for my thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell products say to \\&quot;only buy from an authorized salon\\&quot; and that other vendors, including superstores and discourt shops, may sell you a knock off, diluted, or old product.</li>
            <li> This should last my husband another 15 years, that&#x27;s how long he had the last bottle</li>
            <li> Used to be the only conditioner I used when I had long hair.  </li>
            <li> If you leave it in, a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But it is disappointing to have to clean up the bottle and to lose a small (but still significant) amount of product nevertheless.</li>
            <li> It conditions my hair like no other and it doesn&#x27;t flake or leave residue like other leave-ins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair dry and my hair felt hmm...</li>
            <li> , however my main complaint about the product overall is that it would make my hair too oily and irritate my scalp the 2nd day.  </li>
            <li> The Conditioner my hair dried very soft.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what else they can do other than ship it upright the whole way (no really possible for one bottle).</li>
            <li> I have natural 4b/c hair and just did the BC a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> Just wished I had tried it long ago.  </li>
            <li> It was, in fact, very watery and runny instead of the relatively thick and creamy consistency I was so used to.  </li>
            <li> This may not equal frizziest or most difficult, but it is really hard to take care of when you&#x27;re a low maintenance chick.</li>
            <li> I thought a 10oz bottle of Paul Mitchell would cost me $25-30 due to some research on this site, but it&#x27;s actually $9-10 retail in salons.</li>
            <li> My now almost 65-year-old fussy dry hair likes it.</li>
            <li> Thirdly, the bottling itslef warned that Paul Mitchell guarantees the product only when sold by a hairdresser or similar professional, and that when sold by a store, the product could be fake, in the black market, or old.</li>
            <li> It is a bit more expensive than some other leave in conditioners but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the ingredients sound scary, but i haven&#x27;t noticed any bad effect in many years&lt;br /&gt;recommended</li>
            <li> Must have just jiggled loose.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is watered down, blue gelatin.</li>
            <li> Once I purchased the product from this seller, I quickly knew something was wrong.</li>
            <li> it becomes very dry.  </li>
            <li> The next day I promptly co-washed her hair with Totally Twisted and voila, her hair was back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Its so thick I actually mix it with other products like curl activator and coconut oil to thin it out and give it just the right touch!</li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much into hair products, at 53</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Not much else</li>
            <li> size, it takes time until it&#x27;s finished.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in time, as expected</li>
            <li> But knocked off 2 stars because it leaked about an inch of conditioner in the package, despite having a piece of tape on the cap to keep it closed.</li>
            <li> The product is blue in color the consistency is thick and the smell puts you in the mind of hairdressings like royal crown and ultra sheen that were used years back.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is fairly thick.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was getting pretty desperate to find something for my hair and finally gave in and bought a bottle of PM.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry for a few minutes until it&#x27;s barely wet</li>
            <li> the product is not like other paul mitchell conditional.</li>
            <li> (I wash my hair every other day.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found any other leave-in conditioner that&#x27;s like as well.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this product rather than using gel and other products for his wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in the palm of my hand, dip my fingertips in and rub them around a bit , then starting at the roots going outward finger combing through a section of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and it tends to be</li>
            <li> The directions suggest that you use a small dab after washing and drying hair, and I will occasionally do that.  </li>
            <li> NO THANKS!  </li>
            <li> Like you&#x27;re walking through the store and it just start waving at people and other antics.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like any other hair product.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I have dry and fluffy hair, so need this for some shape and conditioning.</li>
            <li> Not kinky, not straight, but black hair that loves moisture.  </li>
            <li> I use a dime sized amount or less and then comb it thru with a wide toothed comb.</li>
            <li> have used other conditioners in the past that either left my hair feeling limp or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because it has a gel consistency which I&#x27;m not familiar with in conditioners.</li>
            <li> Seems watered down.  </li>
            <li> This one is runny and weighs your hair down.</li>
            <li> make my hair feel greasy and weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I tried using less of the conditioner and just concentrating on my ends, but this didn&#x27;t seem to help at all.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s why they sell it for so much less than you&#x27;d pay elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> When its still slightly damp, you can add just a little bit of The Conditioner and it will hold your curls tight and less frizzy....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for over 20+ years for long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have to style my hair in tight bun for work and this prevents a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other conditioners I used in the past, so</li>
            <li> so looked in my cabinet and saw this little test tube of this.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly hair that I wear short.</li>
            <li> Totally dried my hair out.  </li>
            <li> what a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> My family and I are swimming everyday this summer and this products protects our hair from the chlorine in the pool.  </li>
            <li> after stripping the shit out of my hair with a sulfate shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use this as a leave in everyday.</li>
            <li> But then after a few months, it stopped working as well.</li>
            <li> Her hair actually looked worse than mine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product.</li>
            <li> I discovered this all be accident when I ran out of my usual gel and needed something to cut down / eliminate razor burn</li>
            <li> The bottle we purchased on Amazon contained a pasty, extremely thick &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; that was difficult to even squeeze from the bottle, and completely lacked it&#x27;s usual sheen.</li>
            <li> The main annoyance is the wasted time and aggravation of ordering a badly defective product.</li>
            <li> i have very thick, frizzy hair, and this product straightens, conditions, and adds shine and hold to my hair without being greasy or looking wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but I gave this product another try</li>
            <li> was over four (4) years past its expiration date.</li>
            <li> After shampooing with Head &amp; shoulders and appling a small dab of Paul Mitch Conditioner all is well.</li>
            <li> I usually buy conditioner based on how well it de-tangles my hair which is medium length.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner in the past (bought from a salon) and</li>
            <li> my hair still felt hard and like straw.</li>
            <li> Hard to find on internet also, you can find the detangler, but not the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for at least 25 years .I won&#x27;t use anything else a bottle this size lasts me about a year some times a bit longer depending on the length of myhair</li>
            <li> Have used it at least a decade, wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> But I think everyone should at least try this product.</li>
            <li> Container came with lid ajar and consequently approximately an once was wasted.  </li>
            <li> I have thick gray hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes my thick frizzy hair easier to comb out and style.</li>
            <li> Other two bottles were very thin and ran through my hands.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount on my hair</li>
            <li> its nothing to brag about seriously.  </li>
            <li> I think maybe I just got a bad or expired bottle last time.  </li>
            <li> It leave my hair very hard and crisp not sleek and shine very disappointed i bought two and now have to return one of them.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty terrible...</li>
            <li> I am not a user of expensive hair products usually</li>
            <li> I have very very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is fake and so is the product.</li>
            <li> name brand, couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I suspect I was sent fake product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong conditioner.</li>
            <li> This seems to condition well, but the smell is really unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Fake as hell.</li>
            <li> I mean, don&#x27;t you just hate it when you&#x27;re hair</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and would NOT recommend purchasing because this is poor quality and a knock-off product.</li>
            <li> It also smelled bad.</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in and base for my wash n go&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and they still end up being worthless.</li>
            <li> Although I hate the smell, this conditioner works wonders on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing and the sellers selling these expired products should be sued!</li>
            <li> horrible results.</li>
            <li> Outrageously priced at salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Original original was amazing. Used it forever. You didn&#x27;t have to abuse your hair with a second washing and rinsing process. This Faux Original is greasier and heavier on the perfume. With the Real Original I quickly applied the cream and was ready to go. The Faux requires you to rinse off the extra greasiness from your hands, which takes more time and more importantly it&#x27;s not as good as the original. I guess it&#x27;s the extra grease that adds the greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the CEO calculated that if they used cheaper ingredients and called it the Original, we wouldn&#x27;t notice.  It&#x27;s still the best conditioner, just not as good as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s see: an extra 15 seconds per day for rinsing, for ten years &#x3D; 910 hours &#x3D; 37.9 days of my life that I can&#x27;t get back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why does everything have to have perfume in it? Oh well.</li>
            <li> I love this product on my natural hair!!!!</li>
            <li> good stuff, it also give hair volume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because I love Paul Mitchell&#x27;s cruelty-free products (vegan, no animal testing) and I love their shampoo (smells soooo goood - as does this) but this is the first conditioner I have tried by PM and it&#x27;s pretty terrible... doesn&#x27;t make my hair smooth in the least and it gets all tangly after using it.</li>
            <li> Container came with lid ajar and consequently approximately an once was wasted.  I did not report it as they did the best they could.  It was well wrapped. Must have just jiggled loose.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I have thin fine hair and this takes away tangles without adding weight. That has NEVER happened!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 20 years. It is the best supplement leave-in conditioner for my long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry and fluffy hair, so need this for some shape and conditioning. It works well...</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I tried this conditioner.  It is really wonderful - adds volume and shine but not weight to hair.  I use just a dime size amount.  After using this product for a month my hair has gone from straw to bouncy and manageable.  It eliminates the tangle problem also.</li>
            <li> Ok let me start this review off by saying almost every hair stylist I&#x27;ve ever been to has said I have the thickest hair they&#x27;ve ever seen. This may not equal frizziest or most difficult, but it is really hard to take care of when you&#x27;re a low maintenance chick. I&#x27;ve tried a myriad of leave-in conditioners to keep my hair looking healthy after dye jobs and rough abuse, and NONE has worked better than Paul Mitchell&#x27;s The Conditioner.   I was skeptical at first because it has a gel consistency which I&#x27;m not familiar with in conditioners. The key here is to apply lightly, you can always use a little more if you feel it didn&#x27;t penetrate through to all layers. I use just a dab while fresh out of the shower, and the brush just slides right through. It&#x27;s simply amazing because before The Conditioner I would have a wad of hair left over in my brush after each shower. Gross, I know.  When its still slightly damp, you can add just a little bit of The Conditioner and it will hold your curls tight and less frizzy.... not to say that you don&#x27;t need an additional product if you really want that polished look, but it will do if you&#x27;re extremely short on time... which I always am.   I&#x27;ve heard that it works better as a holding gel if your hair is dry, but I&#x27;ve not tested this. All I know is that it works perfectly for what I wanted, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful for my itchy scalp...it moisturizes my skin while making my hair silky smooth :-)</li>
            <li> the product is not like other paul mitchell conditional. smell like some cheap shampoo brand. not sure if it&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li> I got this conditoner because of reviews and tutorials I&#x27;ve seen. The product is blue in color the consistency is thick and the smell puts you in the mind of hairdressings like royal crown and ultra sheen that were used years back. I use it as a leave in and base for my wash n go&#x27;s. A little definitely goes a long way so unless you want your hair to look like its full of foamy white stuff use this sparingly. Its a good product and will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> You need more stars!  This is a great leave in conditioner.  I have been thoroughly enjoying using this product with my cleansing conditioner.  It leaves my hair soooo soft.  It is a bit more expensive than some other leave in conditioners but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, great product!  :D</li>
            <li> my husband loves this. it is all he uses. thanks. great price</li>
            <li> I have used this leave in conditioner in my hair every day for years. Now my twin daughters use it also. This is a must have hair product in my house. It tames any flyaways and leaves our hair healthy and shiny. I hope they never stop making this.</li>
            <li> I have fine naturally curly hair that tends to be dry.  I love this, and have used it for several years.  It helps provide extra moisture and softness that my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of hair gel and it keeps my hair from being frizzy - keeps my hair conditioned as I wash it daily</li>
            <li> This product was runny, and not the normal consistency of the Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Updated--I completely changed my mind, this is the best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but I gave this product another try and it worked wonders.  I think maybe I just got a bad or expired bottle last time.  It conditions my hair like no other and it doesn&#x27;t flake or leave residue like other leave-ins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Review--I have curly/wavy/frizzy hair and I was looking for a conditioner that would work well with keeping my hair healthy.  I used this product for about two months and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  The scent didn&#x27;t smell so good, but I didn&#x27;t really care so much because the scent didn&#x27;t last long after blow-drying and straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a good job of moisturizing my hair, however my main complaint about the product overall is that it would make my hair too oily and irritate my scalp the 2nd day.  (I wash my hair every other day.)  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other conditioners I used in the past, so I didn&#x27;t really know how to deal with it.  I tried using less of the conditioner and just concentrating on my ends, but this didn&#x27;t seem to help at all.  I finally gave up and stopped using the product altogether.  One positive thing about the conditioner is that it didn&#x27;t make my hair hard at all like most other conditioners do to curly hair.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair volume and doubles as a skin moisturizer</li>
            <li> It leave my hair very hard and crisp not sleek and shine very disappointed i bought two and now have to return one of them.</li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair.  This conditioner is awesome.  I use a very little and it keeps my hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is NOT Paul Mitchell The Conditioner. The bottle is fake and so is the product.</li>
            <li> The BEST leave-in conditioner you can buy.</li>
            <li> Great slip, makes my Kinky/Curly hair soft and manageable. Works well with gel, staple product. The 33 oz. bottle has lasted for a year with weekly/biweekly use. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Totally dried my hair out.  I tossed it out... what a waste of my money.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for about fifteen years. My now almost 65-year-old fussy dry hair likes it.</li>
            <li> I should have got the smallest bottle to try instead of taking the good reviews so seriously and got the biggest bottle. I still have more than half a bottle left after a year. I use it after I blown dry my hair and this make my hair wet again and with a not so good smell. I don&#x27;t see a difference in texture or softness in my hair. I am going to finish using the bottle as a conditioner in the shower paid $25 for this so I better use it up.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my 4th bottle of John Frieda Full Repair Repairing Elixir Oil and I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt greese up your hair, and is really easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;will definitely last a good while.</li>
            <li> A very effective and satisfying product.  Quick delivery from a new Amazon seller.</li>
            <li> Love, love, and love some more.  Won&#x27;t be caught without it.  I use it every day and my hair looks amazing.  Great value.</li>
            <li> works well alot cheaper on line thanks for the savings. I will keep shopping with Amazon.</li>
            <li> doesnt work. Drys hair out m</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product ever!    I am not a user of expensive hair products usually but this stuff is amazing. the one liter bottle will last years!!!      It&#x27;s like a conditioner and hair gell in one, leaves hair soft yet stays in place at the same time :)</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair (3c) and I&#x27;m always waisting a lot of money on products that can define my curls and keep them that way throughout the day. Well my search is over!! This conditioner kept my curls defined and (something no other product has done before) it kept my curls elongated, so they didn&#x27;t shrink and hide like they normally do!! I am truely amazed. If I had to complain, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking shiny- which is nothing a little polishing oil or serum cant handle, but otherwise, this product is amazing and I will be stocking up on it! PS. I love how I really only need a little bit in my hair, most products I have to pile on and they still end up being worthless.</li>
            <li> Runny.  Seems watered down.  This is not the same thickness/viscosity as the product at the salon.</li>
            <li> My family and I are swimming everyday this summer and this products protects our hair from the chlorine in the pool.  We are African Americans and this products works for our various textures of hair.</li>
            <li> We show horses and I buy large bottle of this for manes and tails.  There are many Equine products on the market specifically for showing but this leave in conditioner can&#x27;t be beat for price and results.  Used to be the only conditioner I used when I had long hair.  I permed every 3 months and colored every 2 months and did highlight and lowlights and blew-dry my hair every day. (I am an 80&#x27;s child) This stuff repaired all the damage I did to it and made it look great.  Paul Mitchell products been around for years and still one of the top brands.  Plus this HUGE bottle costs much less than some of the &amp;#34;newer fad&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, it&#x27;s a great leave-in product, it leaves the hair moisturized for days without weighing it down or leaving a residue build-up.</li>
            <li> I have used this for at least 25 years .I won&#x27;t use anything else a bottle this size lasts me about a year some times a bit longer depending on the length of myhair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product from Amazon several times before with great results, so I decided to order it again.  Well my most recent order was a HUGE disappointment because the thickness and consistency of the conditioner led me to believe someone watered it down pretty substantially in order to stretch its volume.  It was, in fact, very watery and runny instead of the relatively thick and creamy consistency I was so used to.  Perhaps that&#x27;s why they sell it for so much less than you&#x27;d pay elsewhere.  In any event, I will NEVER buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Its so thick I actually mix it with other products like curl activator and coconut oil to thin it out and give it just the right touch!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I have very very thick hair.  Not kinky, not straight, but black hair that loves moisture.  This conditioner leaves a film on my hair that I don&#x27;t quite like.  I do; however, use it.  Don&#x27;t want my good money to go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;I will not order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much into hair products, at 53 I dont even have that much hair but this stuff is great! I also put in in my mustache and goatee and on my face. It smells good and this bottle is big enough to last my wife and me a couple of years... I haven&#x27;t checked in a &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; recently for price but I&#x27;m pretty sure it would cost a whole lot more than here.</li>
            <li> This is the only leave in conditioner that I have used consistently for 9 years. It leaves my hair amazingly smooth and manageable. I have to style my hair in tight bun for work and this prevents a lot of breakage. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for over 20+ years for long, thick, wavy hair. The one I ordered through Amazon is NOT the same as the one I have always purchased from a salon. This one is runny and weighs your hair down. The original one is thicker and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. Very disappointed and would NOT recommend purchasing because this is poor quality and a knock-off product.</li>
            <li> This is a knockoff product and NOT the real deal. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and immediately discerned a difference in the viscosity of the liquid.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  It is perfect to use on my long hair and leaves my hair very manageable and not frizzy all day long.  I&#x27;ve tried many other leave-in conditioners over the years and have never found anything that works as well as the Paul Mitchell Conditioner.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly hair that I wear short. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as a quick way to tame it, quick brush and go. I&#x27;ve never found any other leave-in conditioner that&#x27;s like as well.</li>
            <li> For someone who needs extra conditioner strength, this will enable you to have stronger hair. I have used it for several years and am unwilling to change.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  Great conditioner.  I have thick gray hair.  It stays shiny and sleek and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Good stuff have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughters curls also make my &amp;#34;afro-like&amp;#34; curls look nice, when applied on wet hair.  More aqueous consistency than gel but better results.</li>
            <li> I have another Paul Mitchell product and it is amazing. I think this stuff is watered down, blue gelatin. When you put it in your hand you can see the water run off from the product. If you don&#x27;t shake it well it will separate. You are basically paying for water.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.  Makes my hair smooth.  I use it both as a leave on and wash off conditioner.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for beard care, #1 in my book.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to conditioner and this was offered at a great price. Received this in a very timely manner too.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a/b hair this is my holy grail product its mixes well with eco styler gel highly recommend</li>
            <li> it is what it is. name brand, couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this product rather than using gel and other products for his wavy hair. The bottle is huge for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it does wonders for my thin, fine hair.  It adds so much texture to my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I put a small amount in the palm of my hand, dip my fingertips in and rub them around a bit , then starting at the roots going outward finger combing through a section of my hair. Repeat until you worked it through all your hair. I hope they never stop making this stuff!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal on the best conditioner.  My wife uses it and Paul Mitchell is the only brand she&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> I use as a leave in product. Have used it at least a decade, wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I always buy the big size and save money. I also use it as a facial and body moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t have perfumes and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It has also come in handy on vacation as an after sun burn lotion.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I use this as a base before applying shaving cream.  Works like a charm --- put it on leave it and your hair will never dry out</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I love it! The quality of the product is outmatched and like the reviews mention, your hair will LOVE this stuff, you will LOVE this stuff, HECK even your skin will love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is amazing about this so do buy it and get that hair you always wanted!</li>
            <li> after stripping the shit out of my hair with a sulfate shampoo. i used my runny v05 conditioner. my hair still felt hard and like straw. so looked in my cabinet and saw this little test tube of this. put it on my hair (mind u the v05 conditioner is still in my hair).. put it on. instamt difference. im telling my hair instantly became smoother and the roughness was reduced about 75%. i didnt even put that much on. yeah its not a runny consistency which i like. i like the yellowish tone to it also. overall it is a great conditioner. i am going to get a big bottle of this.</li>
            <li> I love this product however I didn&#x27;t realize that it was for use after showering and I often forget to use it... It makes my thick frizzy hair easier to comb out and style.</li>
            <li> I suspect I was sent fake product. The bottle was very dusty...fooled me once. Never again.  My hair needs more conditioner than before I used it...horrible results.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have both used this conditioner for 15 years now. The stuff in this bottle resembled the product we know and love in only its color. The bottle we purchased on Amazon contained a pasty, extremely thick &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; that was difficult to even squeeze from the bottle, and completely lacked it&#x27;s usual sheen. It also smelled bad. From the other reviews it certainly seems like we were mostly unlucky, but the most recent review, by &amp;#34;Chris,&amp;#34; which relays a very similar experience to ours, suggests that possibly the recent warehouse batch that they&#x27;re sending out is bad. Really bad. The code on the bottom of the bottle did not appear to be an expiration date, so we have no idea how expired the stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re returning ours, though, at no cost to us. The main annoyance is the wasted time and aggravation of ordering a badly defective product.</li>
            <li> I purchased my conditioner from a local retailer and I love it.  I have extremely curly hair and it tends to be very dry and most products that I use only make my hair soft while wet once it dries then it becomes very dry.  With Paul Mitchell The Conditioner my hair dried very soft.  And I love the smell it&#x27;s a very crisp clean smell nothing fruity.  The bottle is huge and a little goes a long way.  I feel like I am going to have this bottle for a year with constant use.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My hair is graying and I regularly color it.  That means I tend to have drier hair than I like.  This leave-in conditioner is perfect!  It doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair at all and has a very light (if at all) scent.  I can&#x27;t live without this product now!</li>
            <li> This is a standard product. Not much else to say. Price was the driving force of buying it on Amazon. Not much else I can say about it. Buying the bigger size was a wise investment.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner, it works great for my wavy hair. And this size bottle, for this price... it lasts me for a year. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is heaven for your hair in a bottle! I have thick curly hair and this is excellent for detangling and even better as a leave-in! Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> it tooks years to use up my last bottle, so i got another&lt;br /&gt;minimal pleasant odor to no odor&lt;br /&gt;i sometimes put some on my hair while i shower&lt;br /&gt;or i put some on my fingers to run through my hair after the shower&lt;br /&gt;hair curls nicely like when i was younger&lt;br /&gt;the ingredients sound scary, but i haven&#x27;t noticed any bad effect in many years&lt;br /&gt;recommended</li>
            <li> It works great and the time frame of getting the product was fast..I appreciate everything.  It was also leas money</li>
            <li> Unfortunately only one of the three bottles delivered seems to be &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;.  I have used this product for 10+ years.  One of the bottles was the correct texture and thickness.  Other two bottles were very thin and ran through my hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after conducting some general research online about the product.  Once I purchased the product from this seller, I quickly knew something was wrong. It turns out the bottle I received was over four (4) years past its expiration date. My first clue that the product was not legit should have been the price - a salon quality brand like Paul Mitchell would not sell as cheaply (approx. $24 bucks at time of my purchase).  Secondly, when i first applied the product, it did not smell good. Thirdly, the bottling itslef warned that Paul Mitchell guarantees the product only when sold by a hairdresser or similar professional, and that when sold by a store, the product could be fake, in the black market, or old. True enough, when I examined the bottle more closely, I realized that on the bottom of the bottle, the expiration date read December 2009.  I ordered the product in September 2013 - so the product I received was almost five (5) years old!!!!!  This product when straight to the trash because God knows what kinda damage this would have done to my hair in the long run.  Very disappointing and the sellers selling these expired products should be sued!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length, straight baby-fine hair, and a lot of conditioners make my hair feel greasy and weighted down.  Not Paul Mitchell.  The directions suggest that you use a small dab after washing and drying hair, and I will occasionally do that.  But I prefer to use about a tablespoon worked into my hair immediately after washing while still in the shower, then rinse it out for tangle free hair that doesn&#x27;t fly away with static after I blow dry it.  My hair feels like hair, very soft with no snarls, no feeling of product in the strands.  Hair seems to feel cleaner longer this way, no greasies.</li>
            <li> My wife said my hair smelled funny, like medicinal. I brought her the Paul Mitchell conditioner bottle to smell and she said, yes, this is the culprit.  I am going back to Sleek Look, which is not advertised as a leave-in conditioner but works quite well when used that way.</li>
            <li> This would be a 4 if the smell could be a little better.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. My barber says my hair is incredibly thick and healthy. At 68 that&#x27;s not too shabby.</li>
            <li> I swim every week day in a public pool which destroyed my ability to style my hair.  After shampooing with Head &amp; shoulders and appling a small dab of Paul Mitch Conditioner all is well.</li>
            <li> This should last my husband another 15 years, that&#x27;s how long he had the last bottle...lol...true story</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong conditioner. I wanted the DeTangler. I am using this after I wash my hair but I rinse it out. I haven&#x27;t tried leaving it in. It&#x27;s blue in color and I have white hair. Not at all sure I want to try just leaving it in. It seems to work well rinsing it out though.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that works wonderfully for keeping hear in good health.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years.  Best leave in condition for me. Helps with the frizz and fly away hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this as a leave in everyday. I have natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product to me  and I have been using it for a number of years,  it  really works!!!</li>
            <li> Good price for a good product. Shipped fast - however - i wish there was a seal on the conditioner because the bag that it was sent in the box had conditioner all through it from a long shipping - seems like this would be a simple thing rather than bagging each bottle?</li>
            <li> I know this is supposed to be used on your head but I don&#x27;t.  I use it to shave my face / neck and my wife uses it on her legs.  This stuff works better than any shaving gel I have ever tried and costs much less.  I discovered this all be accident when I ran out of my usual gel and needed something to cut down / eliminate razor burn ~ I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving gel</li>
            <li> I usually buy conditioner based on how well it de-tangles my hair which is medium length. When I first started using PM conditioner, it was working well. But then after a few months, it stopped working as well. Hence the 3 stars</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feel of smell of this stuff so I set it aside until I used some at a friends house and it was different. I bought some at a salon and checked it against what I had at home. Turns out the Amazon version is nothing but petroleum jelly!!!!?? I googled it and sure enough, people make or take the valid bottles out of the trash and fill it with whatever gel or solution that is cheapest. I will never buy a non licensed Paul Mitchell product again!!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!  Adds just the right amount of moisture to hair ends....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was leave in conditioner when I bought it, but I recently found out that conditioner is great alternative to shaving gel and leaves less red marks. I use this all the time for shaving now. Moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery no complaints.</li>
            <li> This PM is what&#x27;s UP!! It makes my Natural Hair Softer, Shinier and Curlier!!  I use it along with Olive Oil hair moisturizer and main listen.... I can go 4 days on one twist out!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product alot and have used it for years.  It a a great conditioner and detangler.  Having it shipped saved money.</li>
            <li> I live in a very rural area and walmart, target etc did not carry.  Hard to find on internet also, you can find the detangler, but not the conditioner.  So glad I finally found it.. Works great to moisturize my daughters thick curly hair instantly.  A great leave in</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this conditioner from Amazon.  I gave it 1 star for the okay smell...its nothing to brag about seriously.  This conditioner left my hair dry and my hair felt hmm...thirsty?! I really wanted to like this product and even used it for a whole week as a conditioner (for wash and go&#x27;s) and a small amount for a leave in to layer in with gel.  I initially thought it must be the way I am using the conditioner so I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it was the same thing.  Her hair actually looked worse than mine. The next day I promptly co-washed her hair with Totally Twisted and voila, her hair was back to normal.  I will not repurchase this product again, I did return it to the department store I bought it from with no questions asked.  I am sure this will work for others but for my 4b/4c natural hair...NO THANKS!  Oh well, I guess on to the next.....</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, smooth and feel super healthy. My hair has never been shinier, and I am so glad I took the leap and bought it despite the cost.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. It&#x27;s fantastic. Especially if you&#x27;re in the sun a lot or in the water... This leave-in conditioner does the trick.</li>
            <li> Just did my BC 7weeks ago, and this is by far the best leave-in conditioner everrr. It smells great, is good to my hair, and it lasts awhile.. my hair is thankful!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s great for my curls...&lt;br /&gt;great size, it takes time until it&#x27;s finished.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in time, as expected</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price.  Definitely worth it.  Salon size bottle and quick and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a totally different formula from the original.  I don&#x27;t think the original conditioner has changed it&#x27;s formula, so I&#x27;m inclined to think that it&#x27;s counterfeit.  Am purchasing another from local hair salon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My hair just acts right after I use this. I mean, don&#x27;t you just hate it when you&#x27;re hair doesn&#x27;t act right?  Like you&#x27;re walking through the store and it just start waving at people and other antics. Anyway. Two thumbs up. Use it before blow drying.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again. Product just as described. . Came super fast . Thank you . I have tried many products over the  years. But this is the only one that works . Outrageously priced at salon&#x27;s. Good deal</li>
            <li> I heard so many great things about this leave-in.  I have naturally curly hair that is fairly thick.  I normally use Giovanni&#x27;s weightless leave in, but this is by far one of my favorites.  Although I hate the smell, this conditioner works wonders on my hair.  It makes detangling a breeze and leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this product.  BUt its not the product fault...its my hair. In warmer weather my hair seems to like it better than in winter. Some of my friends love it year round. But I think everyone should at least try this product. If you are on the fence...go for it!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a light blue hue. It is not as sticky and has a smooth gel-like form. It actually works for my hair. I put it on my hair in sections, mixing it in between my hands well so it smooths on all my strands. I put it on at night, and the next morning my hair was still soft and moisturized. Much better results than the GVP Sally&#x27;s version, which I was doing a comparison of. I decided to keep this one and will repurchase. This has taught me that I will stick to name brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons PM.com lists. Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product. Plus, these stores hijack the price....I thought a 10oz bottle of Paul Mitchell would cost me $25-30 due to some research on this site, but it&#x27;s actually $9-10 retail in salons.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on Paul Mitchell if it&#x27;s not from a salon.  I bought this and realized quickly it is old!  VERY OLD!!!  It smells so bad.  I have used this conditioner in the past (bought from a salon) and it smelled great!  This stuff smells awful.  It still works well, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but it does smell.  I then thought to look at the bottom of the bottle.  I believe it expired in September 2011.  I bought it in October 2012.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell is the best</li>
            <li> Love the The Conditioner, have been using it for many years. But knocked off 2 stars because it leaked about an inch of conditioner in the package, despite having a piece of tape on the cap to keep it closed. Not sure what else they can do other than ship it upright the whole way (no really possible for one bottle). Maybe it is something that Paul Mitchell needs to work on to make their bottles with a more secure cap. But it is disappointing to have to clean up the bottle and to lose a small (but still significant) amount of product nevertheless.</li>
            <li> I like Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner, make my hair feel smooth and silky. Great for person who have dry hair and no more scalp. It&#x27;s not like any other hair product. I recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great. i have very thick, frizzy hair, and this product straightens, conditions, and adds shine and hold to my hair without being greasy or looking wet.</li>
            <li> You can use this on damaged or color-treated hair. I asked my hair stylist if it can be used on permed hair.  She said \\&quot;You can use this before, after, and during. It&#x27;s great for your hair.\\&quot; You can rinse it out, or leave it in. If you leave it in, a tiny bit goes a long way. You don&#x27;t have to use Paul Mitchell shampoo with this conditioner, but both Paul Mitchell Shampoo One and Awapuhi are very good.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in conditioner ! It keep my hair moisturized</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 6 years as a detangler for my daughters hair and it is wonderful!! I have tried the Paul Mitchell \\&quot;The Detangler\\&quot; but it DID NOT work nearly as well as \\&quot;The Conditioner\\&quot;. This leave in conditioner smells SO much better then \\&quot;The Detangler\\&quot; too which my child really likes!! My daughters hair is left soft, without so much frizz and there is not a lot of build up either.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff on and off since High school. The latest has been almost the last 2yrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of the big bottles at the Salon and it was $20 bucks. I even gave some to a friend in a bowl of tupperware and I havent&#x27; even put a dent in it! It is totally worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many complain about the way it makes their hair feel. From personal experience this means they are using TOO much! It isn&#x27;t like conditioner you use in the shower, you don&#x27;t need that much. A little goes a long way. I use a dime sized amount or less and then comb it thru with a wide toothed comb. After that I run my fingers thru my hair.</li>
            <li> This is one product that its name says it all. It is the best conditioner. Use it on wet or dry hair and it works great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love it! This product is worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, tropical smelling, immediately tames my hair, my hair feels much better, is easier to work with when dry, dries faster, my ends are not as dry, therefore not retaining the water in the dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;Price was fair, more reasonable than in the salon... I use a very small amount on my hair but I do rinse this leave in conditioner almost all the way out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged, fairly quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;thank you!</li>
            <li> Love that they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t tested on animals which is great!&lt;br /&gt;Giving this four stars (4 1/2 if I could) because the conditioner gets clogged in the dispenser thing on top of the bottle where it comes out but I just take the whole top off to get it out now and it&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that tiny problem, this conditioner makes my hair nice and soft and the smell is nice (after the hair dries there is no smell).&lt;br /&gt;***Also a tip, it works best when the hair is damp, not wet. I let my hair dry for a few minutes until it&#x27;s barely wet and then put this in. I&#x27;ve found it makes my hair much softer that way than when I put it in right after I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favourite conditioner and I&#x27;ve used it literally for years and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I always buy this leave in conditioner because it&#x27;s so great for my curly hair! Will be back for more * shop shipped the items very fast!</li>
            <li> I have natural 4b/c hair and just did the BC a few months ago.  Since then I have tried numerous hair products in an attempt to add moisture and enhance my curls.  I had seen Paul Mitchell leave-in demonstrated on You-Tube, but never thought to try it.  Well, I was getting pretty desperate to find something for my hair and finally gave in and bought a bottle of PM.  WOW!!!  What a difference it has made.  My hair feels so good and actually has shine to it now. I just enjoy touching it!  Just wished I had tried it long ago.  Could have saved so much money on all those other products I bought.  Definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years... at the beginning I used to buy it at a beauty supply or a pharmacy.  This is the second time I buy it online and is way better ... it&#x27;s cheaper and I get it at home.</li>
            <li> best conditioner ever</li>
            <li> This seems to condition well, but the smell is really unfortunate. It is chemical-smelling, kind of like paint. I&#x27;m not usually one to complain about such things, and this still gets to me.</li>
            <li> Fake as hell. Expired product. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if your hair gets frizzy or staticy during the winter. It makes it smooth and shiny too, which is nice. A little bit goes a long way too! Paul Mitchell products say to \\&quot;only buy from an authorized salon\\&quot; and that other vendors, including superstores and discourt shops, may sell you a knock off, diluted, or old product. My bottle from Amazon has worked fine -- just as well as bottles I&#x27;ve bought from salons in the past.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner on the market by far.</li>
            <li> I have learned from using this product to expect nothing but the best from Paul Mitchell products.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other conditioners in the past that either left my hair feeling limp or greasy.  I have used the conditioner as its called by Paul Mitchell for several years with the same result every time FANTASTIC.  It takes very little of this to leave your hair in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I also use this as an alternate to shaving cream and always have its incredible for all hair!</li>
