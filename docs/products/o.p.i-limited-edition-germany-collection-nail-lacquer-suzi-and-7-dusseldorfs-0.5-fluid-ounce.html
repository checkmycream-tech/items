            <li>I have a polish problem--more types, colors and styles than most nail salons--and I have recently decided that O.P.I. is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Looks nice and received when expected</li>
            <li>I bought this polish for my teenage daughters who love the color purple.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived and we first used it</li>
            <li>Love this color, and could not find it anywhere in local suppliers.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the color it came out to be and ended up giving this particular polish away.</li>
            <li>Its exactly like they described.&lt;br /&gt;I will order nail polish from the seller again in the future.</li>
            <li>its a limited edition and well worth the cost.</li>
