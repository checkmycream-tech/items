            <li> I love the smell, moisturizing and quality of the product!</li>
            <li> Only soap my clients want in their restrooms.  Great for sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> Great deal and hard ti find locally</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent and a great value.</li>
            <li> Cleans hands, smells nice, good price, employees like this soap. The handle makes it easy to pour into our soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years.  Just didn&#x27;t want to run out, lol.</li>
            <li> The back of my hands had become very dry, brittle to the touch, and had a slight burning sensation.  Since using this liquid soap, I have noticed that my hands are softer, not brittle, and there is no longer a burning sensation.  I would recommend using this soap and hope you have a great experience as I have had.</li>
            <li> Great value, smells good &amp; leaves hands soft.</li>
            <li> Instead of adding to the trash problem on our planet  this is the way to go. Refill your own containers from this bottle. This is great soap and very gentle. I have very dry skin on my hand and this does not dry them out.</li>
            <li> Great hand soap.  Leaves skin so soft and smooth.  Has a pleasant odor.  I will order again.  Fast shipping, faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Get the best, Softsoap is wonderful, easy on your hands, works well with our hard water, I&#x27;ve used it for years...Love the gallon size, can refill my sink side containers&lt;br /&gt;Get your today..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kind of product for years -- I&#x27;m pretty compulsive about washing my hands whenever I come in from running errands, etc.  I believe this is the reason I have been able to avoid nearly all the colds and other bugs our friends and neighbors have suffered.  I can&#x27;t say that this product is the reason, but it has helped keep my hands from totally drying out in the process.  It is easier to pour from this jug than from some of the others I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> nice smell and nice on the skin</li>
            <li> this size container is a great refill size for fewer orders</li>
            <li> This is a repeat buy. One of the few I&#x27;m not allergic to.</li>
