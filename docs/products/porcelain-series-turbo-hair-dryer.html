            <li>and it is going strong.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer is heavy and the controls are not in the best place.  </li>
            <li>and this is about 15% more powerful (and 1/4</li>
            <li>Fell in love with it and came right home and ordered one.</li>
            <li>Drys your hair super fast and comes out so nice.</li>
            <li>I mostly like how quick it works, but I also love that it doesn&#x27;t completely scorch your hair to do so.</li>
            <li>Very good, heavy duty hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer was good but get the red one for $60, not this one.</li>
            <li>I bought it at least 10 years ago at a Sally Beauty Supply store and it is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I was able to easily tame my fine wavy hair into smooth and bouncy styles.  </li>
            <li>I first used one of these on vacation.</li>
            <li>It still looks ok outside</li>
            <li>I happened to try my friends blow dryer once when traveling and couldn&#x27;t get over how QUICK it was able to dry my hair!  </li>
            <li>I have dropped it many times and prior to death</li>
            <li>Very durable, very high power blower, It has actually helped me not have to use so many heating products to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>so I spent more money than I norma,my do for a dryer.</li>
            <li>Decent pitch on the noise.</li>

            <li>Year later I moved out after getting married and my sister took custody of it.</li>
            <li>Better value to buy the more expensive one that is red.</li>
            <li>Not as loud as some dryers.</li>
            <li>The heat can be a bit intense but there are multiple settings so you can cool it down as you get close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and it has an extra long cord.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After endless internet searching on hairdryer advancements and reading many conflicting reviews I finally decided &amp;#34;why not just buy the same one again?  </li>
            <li>finally a hair dryer that will dry my wife&#x27;s hair quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>Not as high pitched and loud as other dryers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Certainly not the lightest on the market but powerful with an extra long heavy duty cord.  </li>

            <li> Who knows how long it would have lasted if I hadn&#x27;t been so careless!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other brands usually last me about a year</li>
            <li> It tends to be on the heavier size but that is due to the motor which is built well and made to last.</li>
            <li> and it allowed me to only get one half of my head done before it shut off.</li>
            <li> I am black and have two daughters with 2 different  types of hair.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m back for round 2, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts if I don&#x27;t drop it this time.  </li>
            <li> so it ends up taking a long time to dry typically.</li>
            <li> A few months later, I have recommended this blow dryer to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> - my hair was DRY in 3 MINUTES!!</li>
            <li> Not the lightest but not too heavy by a long shot.</li>
            <li> I timed the other day, but then didn&#x27;t believe it, so I timed it again this morning</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and it is very thick.</li>
            <li> This thing dries my hair faster than other hair dryer - EVER!</li>
            <li> Literally, from stepping out of the shower and toweling it off as usual, my hair was completely dry in 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> something inside began to rattle, now it cycles between hot and cold air and has a rather distressing smell.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine a few years ago and it has outlasted any hair dryer that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> My hair is is past shoulder length and not super thick, but I have a lot of it</li>
            <li> Everyday use even while in a salon!</li>
            <li> It is broken.</li>
            <li> That one lasted me 2.5 years which is not too bad for a hairdryer</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Buy this - you will not be disappointed!!</li>

            <li> I first used one of these on vacation. Fell in love with it and came right home and ordered one. Its more expensive, however, I see this lasting for 10 yrs or more. Very durable, very high power blower, It has actually helped me not have to use so many heating products to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> My mom is hairstylist and had bought this dryer for her clients but my sister and I took it from her because it was so awesome! Drys your hair super fast and comes out so nice. Year later I moved out after getting married and my sister took custody of it. LOL so I had to find it again and I did! I love it</li>
            <li> Great blow Dryer! Other brands usually last me about a year but his one lasts three years. It tends to be on the heavier size but that is due to the motor which is built well and made to last.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was good but get the red one for $60, not this one. This one starting having that smoke burn smell after only 6 months. Better value to buy the more expensive one that is red. That one lasted me 2.5 years which is not too bad for a hairdryer</li>
            <li> Fabulous blow Dryer!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good, heavy duty hair dryer. Blows well and can take a hit. Not the lightest but not too heavy by a long shot. Go for it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair dryer.  I bought it at least 10 years ago at a Sally Beauty Supply store and it is excellent.  I have never had a problem with it and it is going strong.  Definitely worth the money to pay for a good one.  Very happy and happy they still make it as I am going to buy one in case it dies so I am not stranded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for TEN years now!! Everyday use even while in a salon! It&#x27;s the absolute best.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is heavy and the controls are not in the best place.  Not as loud as some dryers.</li>
            <li> I initially used this hair dryer when I was a conference and a roommate happened to have it in the bathroom. I swear, it changed my life!! I ordered one as soon as I could. This thing dries my hair faster than other hair dryer - EVER! My hair is is past shoulder length and not super thick, but I have a lot of it so it ends up taking a long time to dry typically. I timed the other day, but then didn&#x27;t believe it, so I timed it again this morning - my hair was DRY in 3 MINUTES!! Literally, from stepping out of the shower and toweling it off as usual, my hair was completely dry in 3 minutes. Buy this - you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> It worked for two month only and stopped working yesterday for no reason. It still looks ok outside but it smells like something burning inside.</li>
            <li> finally a hair dryer that will dry my wife&#x27;s hair quickly and completely.  an excellent value to boot.  we highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and it is very thick. I wanted a quality dryer so I spent more money than I norma,my do for a dryer. I use a dryer maybe 3 times a year. I pulled it out to work this week and it allowed me to only get one half of my head done before it shut off. I thought all I needed to do was hit the reset button and finish the rest of my hair. No such luck. It is broken. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Decent pitch on the noise. Not as high pitched and loud as other dryers. Would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> An excellent dryer which met all expectations.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so good after using this blowdryer.  I&#x27;m so grateful that I took a risk and bought it.  The cold speed helps set my hair so much better than the one I use to use.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome hair dryer! It&#x27;s not heavy and it blows out your hair beautifully. I have curly hair. So I like to straighten it and this does the job. I am buying a second one just to have on standby!</li>
            <li> I am black and have two daughters with 2 different  types of hair. I have found this hairdryer to work for both of them. The heat can be a bit intense but there are multiple settings so you can cool it down as you get close to the scalp. I use this with a comb attachment that I got from a local beauty supply  store.</li>
            <li> I happened to try my friends blow dryer once when traveling and couldn&#x27;t get over how QUICK it was able to dry my hair!  I knew I had to buy one for myself. A few months later, I have recommended this blow dryer to all of my friends. I mostly like how quick it works, but I also love that it doesn&#x27;t completely scorch your hair to do so. The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting isn&#x27;t going to fry your hair. Buy this. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair dryers. I bought mine a few years ago and it has outlasted any hair dryer that I have ever owned. It dries my hair quickly and it has an extra long cord. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift in 2001 from a friend who was a hairstylist and it finally died.  I have dropped it many times and prior to death something inside began to rattle, now it cycles between hot and cold air and has a rather distressing smell.  Who knows how long it would have lasted if I hadn&#x27;t been so careless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After endless internet searching on hairdryer advancements and reading many conflicting reviews I finally decided &amp;#34;why not just buy the same one again?  It always did a great job&amp;#34;  So, I&#x27;m back for round 2, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts if I don&#x27;t drop it this time.  Oh who am I kidding, I&#x27;m not that coordinated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly not the lightest on the market but powerful with an extra long heavy duty cord.  I was able to easily tame my fine wavy hair into smooth and bouncy styles.  I have a CHI Handshot for travel and this is about 15% more powerful (and 1/4 the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++ would buy again.</li>
