            <li>They ship quickly, and it will arrive sooner than you&#x27;d think, coming from the Hermit Kingdom.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever seen nose strips, but i&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
            <li>Its worth is tho.</li>
            <li>Takes out a lot of my white heads and feels very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>takes out all the gunk and helps to gradually lift out most of the deep blackheads from my pores.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says it does!</li>
            <li>Better than the regular Biore strips in drugstores.</li>
            <li>finally a product that works, I love it</li>
            <li>and no real sticky residue, easy to clean with a toner.</li>
            <li>and i have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Really takes all the gunk out of your nose.</li>
            <li>They took out twice as much gunk than the Biore strips did for me</li>
            <li>and it they also don&#x27;t hurt as much when peeling them off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then wet the area of face that you want to apply the pore strips on and make sure to smooth out the strips so that they stick properly onto your face.</li>
            <li>far these have really helped lifting out the white head bumps on my chin and the sides of my nose are noticeably cleaner :)</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>omg wow!!!</li>
            <li>Better than any other nose pack brands.</li>
            <li>this stuff actually works it removed alot of dirt and clean my pores and unclogged them too</li>
            <li>These make pores look larger and actually seem to let more stuff in then they take out.</li>
            <li>I reordered this as soon as I tired it the 1st time and also got some of the other products from skinfood because I was so impressed.</li>
            <li>They work well to remove blackheads, but in my eyes, they&#x27;re pretty much the same as their competitor.  </li>
            <li>it hurts so much when i take it off, and it didn&#x27;t clean that well as other comments said</li>
            <li>I have so many issues with stubborn black heads, but these peel off things work so well in removing them!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, upon comparing other Korean products with this one, there are much better products on the market such as the black charcoal versions that come off much smoother.</li>
            <li>I have the Skinfood egg white pore mask and the Skinfood egg white pore foam and figured it was worth a try to buy the Skinfood egg white peel-off pack.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find these to work any better or worse.  </li>
            <li>, I was so shocked, i did not think it was going to be that effective, but WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>You only get HALF of what you really need this for. :</li>
            <li>it really removes black and white heads, i like it.</li>

            <li> it really removes black and white heads, i like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend rinsing the face afterwards in ICE cold water and using skinfood&#x27;s egg pore mask to help minimizing the pores because using pore strips over time leaves my pores noticeably bigger and open to even more</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, due to the packaging, I believe the seller has old inventory that has been housed for a long time and is just trying to sell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-AmazonPro</li>
            <li> However, after using one of those (and coming up empty), I can use one of these in the same place and it&#x27;ll still pull up from my pores.  </li>
            <li> Thoroughly cleanse your face and pat dry</li>
            <li> after peeling them off I manually take out the remaining white heads and black heads that were missed then rub an ice cube all over my face since it helps to seal your pores</li>
            <li> The nose patch is not very well shaped.</li>
            <li> closed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i mean i used Biore and dont waste your money first its not cheap</li>
            <li> They pull out both the tiny little blackheads, and big, thick ones.  </li>
            <li> Wanna try some other skinfood products.</li>
            <li> They removed the few blackheads I had and unlike the Biore strips, my eyes didn&#x27;t water as I removed them.  </li>
            <li> The package comes with 5 strips for nose and 5 strips that each have two small triangles - one for chin and one for forehead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using Biore&#x27;s pore strips in the past.</li>
            <li> Its funny because I received a sample of a Biore nose strip the other day and it was Awful!</li>
            <li> At this point, I would buy whichever one was less expensive.</li>
            <li> These do pull gunk out, but you pores always end up worse off after.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well. The nose patch is not very well shaped. You can get better ones at target.</li>
            <li> it hurts so much when i take it off, and it didn&#x27;t clean that well as other comments said</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping they would help me clogged pores on my nose and forehead. These do pull gunk out, but you pores always end up worse off after. These make pores look larger and actually seem to let more stuff in then they take out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, I purchased some more actually. Contrary to biore it actually does what&#x27;s it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME! I have so many issues with stubborn black heads, but these peel off things work so well in removing them! I&#x27;ll have to buy some more soon.</li>
            <li> These nose strips are smaller than the biore strips.  It did not work well, only took off my tiny invisible nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Really takes all the gunk out of your nose. Better than any other nose pack brands. I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve only ever seen nose strips, but i&#x27;m so glad I found this! especially for my Forehead and Chin. I reordered this as soon as I tired it the 1st time and also got some of the other products from skinfood because I was so impressed.</li>
            <li> These strips do what they&#x27;re supposed to do- takes out all the gunk and helps to gradually lift out most of the deep blackheads from my pores. They took out twice as much gunk than the Biore strips did for me and it they also don&#x27;t hurt as much when peeling them off.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure not to use these more than twice a week. It is recommended to start out using only once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want these strips to take out maximum gunk possible then it&#x27;s crucial that you follow this routine:&lt;br /&gt;1) Thoroughly cleanse your face and pat dry&lt;br /&gt;2) place a towel over your head and steam your face for 5-10 mins to open your pores&lt;br /&gt;3) then wet the area of face that you want to apply the pore strips on and make sure to smooth out the strips so that they stick properly onto your face.Leave on for the instructed amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;4) after peeling them off I manually take out the remaining white heads and black heads that were missed then rub an ice cube all over my face since it helps to seal your pores closed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend rinsing the face afterwards in ICE cold water and using skinfood&#x27;s egg pore mask to help minimizing the pores because using pore strips over time leaves my pores noticeably bigger and open to even more bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far these have really helped lifting out the white head bumps on my chin and the sides of my nose are noticeably cleaner :)</li>
            <li> I have the Skinfood egg white pore mask and the Skinfood egg white pore foam and figured it was worth a try to buy the Skinfood egg white peel-off pack.  The package comes with 5 strips for nose and 5 strips that each have two small triangles - one for chin and one for forehead.  I just tried one of each.  The results were very similar to that of the Biore strips.  I didn&#x27;t find these to work any better or worse.  They removed the few blackheads I had and unlike the Biore strips, my eyes didn&#x27;t water as I removed them.  They work well to remove blackheads, but in my eyes, they&#x27;re pretty much the same as their competitor.  At this point, I would buy whichever one was less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a Verified Purchase Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, this product is a Korean product as the company &amp;#34;SKIN FOOD&amp;#34; is based in South Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, upon comparing other Korean products with this one, there are much better products on the market such as the black charcoal versions that come off much smoother. This product can rip your skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This does NOT come with all NOSE PORE cleaning strips. It comes with also forehead and chin removing strips which I would NOT recommend. You only get HALF of what you really need this for. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, due to the packaging, I believe the seller has old inventory that has been housed for a long time and is just trying to sell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-AmazonPro Reviews&lt;br /&gt;Est. Since 2003</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my face feels after using this... It really does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> Very good product, I successfully removed all the pores on my face thanks to this product. Great feeling of satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Takes out a lot of my white heads and feels very smooth afterwards. Only has a bit of scent but bearable.</li>
            <li> This brand, Skinfood, is THE best, and these pore strips are no exception.  They pull out both the tiny little blackheads, and big, thick ones.  I&#x27;ve tried using Biore&#x27;s pore strips in the past. However, after using one of those (and coming up empty), I can use one of these in the same place and it&#x27;ll still pull up from my pores.  Yes, these may seem pricey because they are being shipped from Korea, but you cant do better.  Plus, this Amazon store is great! They ship quickly, and it will arrive sooner than you&#x27;d think, coming from the Hermit Kingdom.  5 Stars all around!</li>
            <li> I love this product very much. I buy it every month for me and my family . Wanna try some other skinfood products.</li>
            <li> Better than the regular Biore strips in drugstores.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than biore, it really clears out a lot of the stuff clogging pores, I am very happy with the results and will purchase more.</li>
            <li> it really removes black and white heads, i like it.</li>
            <li> smells good, average pore peeling product , love skin food though!!</li>
            <li> omg wow!!! this stuff actually works it removed alot of dirt and clean my pores and unclogged them too, I was so shocked, i did not think it was going to be that effective, but WOW!!!! i mean i used Biore and dont waste your money first its not cheap and it does not work, its garbage. finally a product that works, I love it i will buy again. I am so happy. it did not irritate my skin and i have super sensitive skin , did not leave my skin red at all and no real sticky residue, easy to clean with a toner.</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday and I am in love! It comes with nose, chin and forehead patches. I don&#x27;t Need the forehead ones so I can use them for the chin instead. (They are the same size and shape) I used it last night and they did a great job of removing the junk in my pores. Its funny because I received a sample of a Biore nose strip the other day and it was Awful! Sooo glad I found this. I will buy 5 next time because it takes awhile to ship from S. Korea. Its worth is tho.</li>
