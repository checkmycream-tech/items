            <li>Best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Great product, but *incredibly* tacky/sticky - this is both its strength and its weakness.  </li>
            <li>As others have said, i used it in the salon, and its great.</li>
            <li>It has great holding power.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Liked it and used it for a while.</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair, very light which wont do anything i tell it to.</li>
            <li>im sure it wont work so well.</li>
            <li>If they re-design the jar, it gets a better rating.</li>
            <li>The top was cracked and the contents ruined.  </li>
            <li>I got it from my stylist who recommended it because I have very light fine hair.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and comes off easily in the shower</li>
            <li>Fantastic for adding texture, but a bit of a pain to deal with.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering if its genuine, it is.</li>
            <li>The consistency and hold is nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work, just not as well as the original product.</li>
            <li>My hair is relatively fine which made finding the right product cumbersome.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, and wavy hair now and its the best thing i have found thus far in my quest for the perfect hair product.</li>
            <li>It is like a clay and is great for a matte finish for any length of hair, just to keep the flyaways down.</li>
            <li>far too heavy and sticky....clumps of hair come out when i use it, but this is one is great!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty unique mix that really gives your hair a matte look without the shine of a wax.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for it now.  </li>
            <li>Seems a bit steep for such little product, but the stuff is good.</li>
            <li>Although it was a good alternative, it is extremely matte, and very dry.</li>
            <li>Great for thin hair!</li>
            <li>it came opener with no top and tape covering the top.  </li>
            <li>Have used many different products and have finally come across a product that actually works!</li>
            <li>After trying several other products in this category i find that Matt Paste holds up better than anything else.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product over the past year with my hair length going from about 2&amp;#34; on top to over 6&amp;#34; and it does what i need all along the way.  </li>

            <li> Great product, but *incredibly* tacky/sticky - this is both its strength and its weakness.  Fantastic for adding texture, but a bit of a pain to deal with.</li>
            <li> As others have said, i used it in the salon, and its great. I have thinning hair, very light which wont do anything i tell it to. But with this, and touch of hairspray i can get the look i want. Expensive but worth it! Other matte pastes i have use are far too heavy and sticky....clumps of hair come out when i use it, but this is one is great! For heavy hair im sure it wont work so well.</li>
            <li> it came opener with no top and tape covering the top.  The product was completely dried out.  What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the larger tub - it&#x27;s not. Seems a bit steep for such little product, but the stuff is good. My husband doesn&#x27;t want to look like he cares about his hair or tries to do anything to it. Matt Paste works wonders.</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair! Not greasy and comes off easily in the shower</li>
            <li> Have used many different products and have finally come across a product that actually works! My hair is relatively fine which made finding the right product cumbersome. I would recommend this product for those who have thin short hair and are looking for style</li>
            <li> After trying several other products in this category i find that Matt Paste holds up better than anything else.  I have used this product over the past year with my hair length going from about 2&amp;#34; on top to over 6&amp;#34; and it does what i need all along the way.  I have long, thick, and wavy hair now and its the best thing i have found thus far in my quest for the perfect hair product.</li>
            <li> The product was not sealed and may have been exposed to air. It made the product dry and unusable.</li>
            <li> Liked it and used it for a while.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever used. Smells great as well and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky and nasty like some products would.</li>
            <li> Such a great product. It is like a clay and is great for a matte finish for any length of hair, just to keep the flyaways down.</li>
            <li> While I did receive label.m Matt Paste, I received a different a product with a red label and not white.  The consistency and hold is nothing like the original.  I really don&#x27;t care for it now.  This is probably the reason my hair stylist stopped selling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, just not as well as the original product.</li>
            <li> It was dried up and unable to use.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Does not smell and is not greasy or stiff. A little bit goes a long way. Keeps my hair in place without overdoing it.</li>
            <li> I was on a cruise and forgot to take my regular product, so I stopped in a hair salon on one of my stops and this product was recommended. Although it was a good alternative, it is extremely matte, and very dry. Also, note that the jar is on the narrow side. This means that after you start getting past the top of the paste, it gets very hard to take the product out. You have to did down into the jar to get it out which gets all under the fingernails. This is the only reason I gave it 3 stars. It has great holding power. If they re-design the jar, it gets a better rating.</li>
            <li> Works well.  This product was discontinued at the salon that I go to.  I like it and bought online to keep at home.</li>
            <li> The plastic container was broken. The paste that was in the container was dry and it looked to have been tampered with.</li>
            <li> The top was cracked and the contents ruined.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone by this product on line.  I will not do so again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering if its genuine, it is. This is a pretty unique mix that really gives your hair a matte look without the shine of a wax. I got it from my stylist who recommended it because I have very light fine hair. Seller got it to me on time and on target</li>
