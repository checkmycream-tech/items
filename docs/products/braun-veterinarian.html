            <li>Cruzer 5 is a perfect name for this work of art.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this thing is perfect for what it does.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Not the best shaver ever!!</li>
            <li>I was impressed.</li>
            <li>Is it the greatest trimmer ever to hit the market as some seem to believe?</li>
            <li>They have excellent products and the two shavers I have from them have lasted for years.</li>
            <li>It works awesome for me.  </li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT ! !!</li>
            <li>This is the very best beard shaver I have ever owned....</li>
            <li>but it is my best trimmer yet.</li>
            <li>Use it to trim my face and body hair and it works perfect for both.</li>
            <li>Excellent razer.</li>
            <li>It is excellent!</li>
            <li>Best way to describe the hair cut experience is cousin itt being sucked into a jet turbine and turned into a powdered mist of hair.</li>
            <li>It is a very good trimmer, because it fits perfectly in my hand and it has the guides on the sides</li>
            <li>Nice !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle--because its cordless and charges then runs for  about 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery life is also very good.</li>
            <li>very good quality.</li>
            <li>but this is very good quality</li>
            <li>This is a very good trimmer.</li>
            <li>Awesome trimmer, great price.</li>
            <li>Great product for keeping your hair and beard neat or stubby as you prefer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is a great for grooming all types of breards.</li>
            <li>in all I would say that this is extremely good value for money and is an ideal addition to a man&#x27;s accessories.</li>
            <li>Because of it&#x27;s convenient size and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of attachments, it&#x27;s a great trimmer to take along when you travel.</li>
            <li>If you are someone who has a beard, or shaves your head close, this is a great place to start when thinking about a trimmer.   </li>
            <li>I had been concerned that the guide might be a bit flimsy but after dropping it 10 or so times, its still great.</li>
            <li>Great product you can trim while it is plugged in.  </li>
            <li>The battery still works great.  </li>
            <li>without it works great.  </li>
            <li>I found this product great for trimming my chest and stomach.</li>
            <li>I use this for my moustache and to cut my hair (buzz cut) and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Got it on time as advertized and in great condition.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done for a great price.</li>
            <li>He loves the product and is happy in can be used for the head if desired.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product and serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to operate &amp; the trimming &amp; hair cut was perfect.</li>
            <li>nice product and very good price</li>
            <li>For me it worked great  for shaving my neck and sides--I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews 11 months ago, I chose this one because I was impressed about claims about battery/motor strength and about the adjustable length attachment.</li>
            <li>Ive got a nice beard going now because of this product!</li>
            <li>This very cool beard trimmer is perfect for my husband who doesn&#x27;t like a close shave.  </li>
            <li>But any trimmer will do that fairly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good battery life and bi-voltage</li>
            <li>charge on it is good too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>I truly loved the simplicity &amp; efficiency of Braun Cruzer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer provides a good range.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, this a good set for home use.</li>
            <li>GOod  trimmer , i use to all the time still working like a charm ..  </li>
            <li>, it seems good.</li>
            <li>ver y good</li>
            <li>and I still didn&#x27;t get a good trim.  </li>
            <li>Unlike my Braun shaver you need a good battery in order to shave.</li>
            <li>Made in China but quality is good.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to if this is a good beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I have found this to be the closest guide and a good experience for stubble...</li>
            <li>Good for manscaping too.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;bt ovel all it is good comparing the price</li>
            <li>Good build quality.</li>
            <li>I thought this looked good</li>
            <li>Braun Cruzer 5 Trimmer does a really good job of trimming mustaches and beards.  </li>
            <li>but it seems that the company just isn&#x27;t as good with trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing does a good job, cuts evenly, and costs a fraction of all the others.</li>
            <li>Good looks is about all this shaver has going for itself.</li>
            <li>he loved it when he got it for his birthday</li>
            <li>I use it on Christmas morning before many visits, and it trims beautifully.  </li>
            <li>the cut is very precise and has a great feel on your face.</li>
            <li>He uses it mostly as a trimmer between haircuts and for his sideburns and says that it works great.  </li>
            <li>Great dial in length with the lengths that most trimmers just skip.</li>
            <li>Has a great shape with many features to it</li>
            <li>This is a well-designed, effective, product that feels good in the hand.    </li>
            <li>While it is a nice compact size and good attachments, the shaver is too under-powered.</li>
            <li>Works well, just mnake sure to take care of those attachments!</li>
            <li>May never need them but it will come in handy if we do.</li>
            <li>Fully washable, nice design.</li>
            <li>I was so completely thrilled by the quality and simplicity of using it.</li>
            <li>(The beard, that is--I&#x27;m keeping the trimmer either way for my sideburns, as it does nice touch-up work.)</li>
            <li>Nice to see Braun still coming out with quality stuff.</li>
            <li>Trims nice and even and doesnt pull hairs out.</li>
            <li>I really wish though that this came with a micro trimmer for detailing and a nose trimmer attachment, then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>upon looking at the product in the store it seemed like everything would be good and have all the options that I needed and more.  </li>
            <li>However, I found the razor to be quite nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice trimmer that can be used in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this on sale for $25 and it is really good for that price point, I can&#x27;t see paying more than $30 for it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very easy to use, nice slim size, and lots of power.</li>
            <li>My husband decided he no longer wanted the clean shaven look!!</li>
            <li>All in all, he was very happy with his new trimmer.</li>
            <li>Good solid product but not the best.</li>
            <li>The razor itself is great, holds a charge and works well -- but the beard attachment started to fall apart quickly and now has lost all its teeth.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>by far the best beard trimmer i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using mine for a just-shaved stubble type of look and so far it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li>Also I would have liked more finesse in length adjustments.</li>
            <li>I have an old trimmer that use s attached guides that does a perfect job for my bard.  </li>
            <li>In good condition, looks like one LED light not functioning.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Has a good battery life, and very useful for all your trimming needs.</li>
            <li>Best razor ever, can&#x27;t be compared with other, very nice and very precise cut.</li>
            <li>Not a consumer friendly company, nor a good beard trimmer razor.</li>
            <li>rarely 5-star happy with most products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rarely 5-star happy with most products but the Cruzer earns every star.</li>
            <li>Also fits nicely into my hand and a breeze to clean!</li>
            <li>Very nice trimmer - compact package, easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>Being my own barber, I was excited to try it out on my own head.</li>
            <li>I thought that by spending a bit more I would own a better and more durable product.</li>
            <li>The guard is very innovative and locks securely into place.</li>
            <li>It is also very light weight,</li>
            <li>it trims nicely and easy to use anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a beard-trimming guy for about 20 years, and I&#x27;ve had many trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Feels good in the hand and easy to control and to clean.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of given him the look he wants, and can also go shorter of longer too if he wants.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like the Cruzer 6 is much better, though I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li>So overall I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love mine and use it every day.</li>
            <li>Braun is still a top maker of shaving products.....</li>
            <li>He has thicker stubble and was pleased with the ease of trimming it up, and it also works to grab sporadic body hair as desired.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly comfortable; you can&#x27;t even feel it doing its work!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Charging is anywhere 6-8 hours and you get many shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Norelco, which has been used weekly without proper oil cleaning for years, is still my best option.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>so I am sure it easier for the trimmer to cut through it.</li>
            <li>An included attachment allows to keep better length on your head up to 20mm (around 3/4\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>and I was particularly pleased with the locking adjustable trimmer attachments.  </li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s a good indicator of the worth of this</li>
            <li>He said it sometimes takes more than one pass over his face</li>
            <li>This was an interesting dichotomy.</li>
            <li>Glad that there is an adjustable guide instead of all of the attachments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unreliable and that&#x27;s worrisome for one of the most noticeable parts of your body.  </li>
            <li>, what more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know there are newer or better models of the Cruzer out there, but this was the cheapest and gets me what I need.  </li>
            <li>This thing skips more hair than it cuts .</li>
            <li>not gona be able to shave your head with this, unless you have 3hrs to spare.  </li>
            <li>It took me more than 5 minutes longer to trim my beard</li>
            <li>Works much better than the Wahl I just replaced.  </li>
            <li>The product does not specifically mention whether it should be used on the body, but I find it&#x27;s better than products like Phillips&#x27; Norelco Bodygroomer.</li>
            <li>I usually love everything Braun makes.</li>
            <li>I have a cruzer 6 razor but wanted a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>This gives more teeth so slightly better beard trimming.</li>
            <li>Would still like more guides</li>
            <li>I have to go over my beard many many many times at all angles, and I still have to get some hairs manually with scissors afterward.</li>
            <li>Much better choice</li>
            <li>I had a Remington before and the Braun is much better.</li>
            <li>This trimmer turned out to be better than expected--namely in battery life.  </li>
            <li>The locking mechanism on the removable &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; is top notch</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>It also shaves smoothly without catching hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes of shaving, my beard looks even more unruly then before I started trimming.  </li>
            <li>I had gotten one of these for my National Guard Son My Baby but someone in his unit needed it more</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>The trimmer did a good and quick job on his hair, it is well-made, and runs smoothly.  </li>
            <li>For the price this is the best trimmer I have had and am hoping for a long life ahead of it.</li>
            <li>I wish the trimmer cut a bit closer, but the battery has lasted quite a long time and I am fairly impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li>Its compact size nice and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Hi,&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product and I am more than satisfied than my previous Norelco, but I lost the charger and could not find it anywhere, Can anybody please suggest me something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see how the clippers and attachments are suppose to make trimming easier or more precise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my friends&#x27; and it performed flawlessly, with a wide range of adjustment between.4mm - 5mm, a sturdy trimmer head and no missed hairs at all.</li>
            <li>The chatrge, at 30 minutes or so, is ample for most jobs it will encounter and the unit itself is light and easily stored in a toiletries bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other trimmers for around this price range and have found this one to be of the best value.</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate.</li>
            <li>The fact that it has 1 adjustable attachment makes it so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to just click it to switch lengths.</li>
            <li>Easy to use tool for your hair and beard maintenance.</li>
            <li>The clean-up is easy because it&#x27;s waterproof and you can just run it under the faucet when you&#x27;re finished using it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Clean up is easy, run under some water.</li>
            <li>Detachable &#x27;comb&#x27; can be removed easily so you can rinse both the comb and the trimmer under running tap water.</li>
            <li>easy for use</li>
            <li>i ostepped on one of mine and it broke fairly easily.</li>
            <li>but the motor seems adequately strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, a good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li>but honestly, I find that with nearly any trimmer, including the Wahl I liked.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this trimmer and it is good for beard or head or</li>
            <li>4 years and still an amazing razor that has never failed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only beautiful to look at and hold, but it&#x27;s a masterpiece of ergonomics.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is OK, I guess, for those who with a full beard.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>And once on, it has the same wonderful sliding adjustment feature to get your beard exactly the way you like</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine with him.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works fine otherwise.</li>
            <li>They design products that are comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I use this machine to be working fine and you are advised to..ya uje ispolzivuyu mashinku normalno rabotaet,domashnom uslovie..</li>
            <li>Originally we had a wahl trimmer which he did like, but this is just so easy to use and easy to store.</li>
            <li>The first time was a disaster--it didn&#x27;t look good, and I didn&#x27;t have the right tools to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>length attachment is easy to use  easy clean up (waterproof)  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied and highly recommended at this price point.</li>
            <li>Device is easy to clean as well, which for me is important.</li>
            <li>He liked it much better than his old razor.  </li>
            <li>Not the most powerful trimmer available, but for the price and functionality</li>
            <li>light  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re obviously looking for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>The fact that you don&#x27;t have a cord hanging in the way is also a plus and it is great for travel since you only have to bring the one piece.</li>
            <li>I think) which includes precise cut features and a case.</li>
            <li>There is no battery light</li>
            <li>is just a cheap product that does not cut hair well.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>Can clean easily under water</li>
            <li>Total win.</li>
            <li>After about a month or light use, it wouldn&#x27;t charge up.</li>
            <li>Spend the money on a better trimmer, this one isn&#x27;t worth the aggravation.</li>
            <li>This trimmer would have gotten a four-star rating if not for the obviously cheap construction of the beard trimmer guard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is cheap.</li>
            <li>120/240 volt, comfortable design&lt;br /&gt;Minus:</li>
            <li>C-mon, that is just cheap product design.</li>
            <li>It has been a great tool for keeping a beard at the proper length.  </li>
            <li>It works great, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it charging or running out of juice in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a second one for my gf&#x27;s house, that one works great also.</li>
            <li>You would think for the MSRP that Braun is asking for you would get a quality razor fit for even the curliest and thickest of hair, no matter where it lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>A nice ergonomic feel, a beard length adjustment mechanism that stays where I set it and a handy push-button on-off switch on the middle of the handle cap off the review.</li>
            <li>bought this item because of the good reviews, but it does not cut my beard nearly as well as my 5-year-old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I know have to make sure its plugged in for a good 30 minuted before the motor works well enough to shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to clean, fits well and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, 3) It will trim fairly well WITHOUT the guard, if you&#x27;re trying to shave off your hair down to about 1mm.  </li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t nicked himself with it yet and says that it seems pretty safe in that</li>
            <li>First of all, this thing is sleek and sexy.</li>
            <li>I replaced the first one because the times on the trimmer comb simultaneously crumbled off (6 between the top and bottom comb) halfway through trimming my hair.  </li>
            <li>THis is a replacement to the original one i got.</li>
            <li>After more than 15 years ordering on Amazon, this is my first return.</li>
            <li>Now that I don&#x27;t have to be clean shaved all the time I used this to keep my face/head looking neat.</li>
            <li>to clean.</li>
            <li>It can also be used with water, which allows you to easily clean it.</li>
            <li>Removing the trimmers to clean the blades are not as intuitive as you might think.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several brands but this one is by far the best groomer I have purchased to date.</li>
            <li>It feels good in the hand, is light, has plenty of adjustment for beard length (for me anyway), and has enough power to do the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;o won&#x27;t hold the hair as you cut, need to clean afterwards</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and highly functional.</li>
            <li>If you are searching for a decent edger that also offers a great trim then the Braun Beard Trimmer is the one you have been searching for.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair from front to back, side to side, using the slider to get the lengths just right; it was quick and it looked great</li>
            <li>Even better (MUCH better) is you can simply run the trimmer blades under the faucet for a quick wash and you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li>It has worked awesome for 4 years and now it is 2014 and the blade has started to dull</li>
            <li>only good features of this product are 1)</li>
            <li>I bought this yesterday and tried it after a full charge and while still plugged in to trim my beard which had about one week of growth.</li>
            <li>This thing is too cool.</li>
            <li>I have used an old Wahl to cut my own hair for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for something with a good amount of power, don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it really doesn&#x27;t add too much more time to shaving.</li>
            <li>good trimmer especially for the money</li>
            <li>For the outcome of use this is not worth more than $10.00 on a good day,</li>
            <li>The set was easy to use and in no time at all our kid went from looking like a respectable second-grader to a budding delinquent.  </li>
            <li>Does not get super close but enough to look good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty compact and lightweight, making it easy to pack for travel.    </li>
            <li>Since the blades are not that sharp, I have to finish the job with another set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery life is not that great.  </li>
            <li>So we searched around for a product that he could use to get a decent stubble :)</li>
            <li>Six settings make it super adjustable so that anyone can find a comb that works for them.  </li>
            <li>this hair trimmer is most likely a better version than your barber, person who does your hair uses.</li>
            <li>The removable heads, for beard and heair trimming, are easily removable but once fitted are steady and secure.</li>
            <li>So I got over my frustration quickly.</li>
            <li>So I got over my frustration quickly.</li>
            <li>but it does the job adequately</li>
            <li>battery seems to run out quick.  </li>
            <li>These seemed to have plenty of power at the beginning but that quickly began to fade.</li>
            <li>Despite the company claims that it works well for 7 years, you will be lucky to get 7 weeks of service out of it.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I live in Europe and own a Braun trimmer which I like very much.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the setting lengths and its consistency in maintaining a short &amp;#34;summer beard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>, the trimmer blade itself gets VERY HOT after a bit of shaving.</li>
            <li>Feels very well made and the quick change heads feel durable and strong.</li>
            <li>super easy to clean, easily surpasses my last remington.</li>
            <li>Once you are done using it you can use the brush to clean it and then easily place it back in the case it comes with for easy traveling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really surprising that they made a beard trimmer with such large comb length increments.</li>
            <li>I am back to buy another one since a $25 purchase of this item for 4 years has been amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My old, crappy Norelco with the broken-off comb tooth is better than this--and that&#x27;s the one I was trying to replace with this</li>
            <li>thinking for the younger men of 20 to 30 would most enjoy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He likes the feel of it, ease of it and is so enthusiastic about it, he took it back to his apartment in Manhattan to replace the one he was using.</li>
            <li>It has several nice features.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacement combs under $20 - which is nearly the cost of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I think this is my favorite trimmer so far, though, so</li>
            <li>It definitely wins in the bang for the buck department.</li>
            <li>My 15 yr old Norelco still worked 5 times better.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is right to the point.</li>
            <li>this may NOT be the right piece of equipment for you.</li>
            <li>I have to pass it like 10 times in a zone to get it right</li>
            <li>In fact, this Cruzer5 is just right for me.    </li>
            <li>As well, just after a year ( right after the warranty ran out)</li>
            <li>I found the Braun Cruzer 5 and it offered the adjustable setting that was the one feature I was looking for at a price that seemed about right for the amount of use it will receive.  </li>
            <li>The shaver then took right off, I was momentarily jubilant until I got to my sink and mirror</li>
            <li>The shaver&#x27;s length adjustment piece, called the Adjustable beard comb, is easy to break and Braun will not send you a new ne under warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the battery last long, and its easy to use, the guards make it easy for me not to ruin my mustache, and the ability to use it while its charging is nice.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with Braun&#x27;s service, even though their initial attempt to solve the issue failed.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally shopping for a competitor model, but because this was less money and had good reviews, I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver, its quiet and very sharp with 1-11mm settings.</li>
            <li>I used it to trim my lengthy locks but it required more than I charge and although the result was very sharp and crisp, the unit performed better at the shorter lengths than at the longer.</li>
            <li>Pure bliss!</li>
            <li>I like to take off the guard to clean up my neck, but even this does not cut hairs as well as my older trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He loves this beard cruzer--it trims his facial hair nicely at whatever length he wants.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with supplied brush and the power adapter is a international one</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product to keep the facial hair (or even your hair) neat.</li>
            <li>The reviews of this trimmer were great, but I find that it doesn&#x27;t trim short enough.  </li>
            <li>and they work very, very well.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipper.</li>
            <li>Second, it charges quickly and can be removed from the cord, making the whole process more convenient.</li>
            <li>I got it at Target without reading the reviews here first.  </li>
            <li>As a beard trimmer it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I also love that it has an attachment and different levels.</li>
            <li>I doubt it will last 15 years like my Wahl, but it&#x27;s inexpensive, portable and much more convenient.</li>
            <li>The second time was better, but the trimmer I had at the time--which had to be plugged in to use it--still didn&#x27;t give me the level of precision</li>
            <li>I use it every morning to keep my beard exactly the length I want it.</li>
            <li>The first two times I grew a beard everyone told me to shave it off; this time, everyone says I should keep it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t point to exactly what the problem is - is it the size, angle, or position of the teeth on the comb?  </li>
            <li>But those of us who opt to take it all off, this trimmer could make us look pretty foolish.</li>
            <li>Overall I would say I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>His last razor had about eight attachments, so two was much more convenient.  </li>
            <li>It never performed as advertised and died within the first year.</li>
            <li>Even after six or more passes over my beard at all different angles and differing pressures, I still had untrimmed hair plus sore skin to boot.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to last longer than the manual would lead you to believe and, in my opinion, a much better value than the Cruzer 6.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>It was working pretty well until this.  </li>
            <li>so you have to make sure that it has enough charge for the day you plan on trimming.</li>
            <li>This problem can be solved, however, by upgrading to the Cruzer 6 which charges a lot quicker (an hour, I think).&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to take more than one pass to get all of my beard the same length.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the fact that it isn&#x27;t terribly loud and have found that cleaning it is pretty easy.    </li>
            <li>This product is nice, but does not have all of the settings of other shavers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it easy and simple to use on my beard and I experimented with various lengths and always achieved outstanding results.</li>
            <li>maintain a pretty long and full beard, with that being said I use this to clean up my cheeks and trim my mustache.</li>
            <li>First, this trimmer has an easily adjustable head that you can adjust for several lengths.</li>
            <li>The sleek design is pretty much where its perks end.  </li>
            <li>I have to go over it many times to get a smooth short facial beard.</li>
            <li>Product did not meet my expectations at all despite their past good reputation for quality products.</li>
            <li>Braun for me, is the epitomy of style and this handy beard and hair trimmer is typical of the thought and care Braun put into their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With only 2 attachments it is easy to use and just about anyone could do it.</li>
            <li>I am a razor guy by choice, so I can&#x27;t really complain because it really cuts pretty close</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and is fairly quiet, but not quite what we were hoping for.</li>
            <li>guess I was lucky in that I felt like I needed a trimmer immediately to replace my old one and bought it from Target.  </li>
            <li>It takes a couple passes to be sure I&#x27;ve got everything the way I want it, but the Cruzer is quiet and gentle--whereas other trimmers I&#x27;ve used have been loud and apt to poke me with their guides.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is nothing special about this product, I actually had better results from using a regular pair of hair clippers.</li>
            <li>I am not too certain what to make of these trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer is solid, well built, battery works fine, as does the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Nice little cutter if you want the stuble look, but no option for close cut.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and found on first use, as have many other reviewers, that it is very under powered.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes this handy little hair and beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Had this trimmer a little over a month or so now and so far it has been extremely good.</li>
            <li>This has been great for my beard over the last few years.  </li>
            <li>It just grows that fast.</li>
            <li>Very deceptive.</li>
            <li>I got this product for my husband, who absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>My shaver uses readily replaceable batteries, which is what i wanted in the trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimming was even and the result was very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always charged up and ready.  </li>
            <li>I got the Cruzer, being a beardless man, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to really use this.</li>
            <li>It is very well made, but the design doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>This Braun Cruzer 5 Beard and Head Cruzer, 5 Beard and Head Trimmer (say that 3 times fast) cuts close.</li>
            <li>and I use it to shave in areas I can&#x27;t really see.</li>
            <li>This trimmer worked very well for the job.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job very well.  </li>
            <li>Does not work very well for close cropped beards/mustaches.  </li>
            <li>No pulling, but not as fast as the Remington either.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t cut much with the adjuster on.  </li>
            <li>The two built-in rechargable battery powers the trimmer and produces low buzzing sound that doesn&#x27;t disturb your roomies when you use it in the morning.    </li>
            <li>I waited for more than a week for a replacement guard and, sure enough, two teeth subsequently broke again only six months</li>
            <li>Even on the shortest setting, it leaves my husband&#x27;s beard longer than he wants.  </li>
            <li>the trimmer did work, it provide a reasonable shave without pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li>The battery is not user replaceable so after one year it is ready for the trash.</li>
            <li>I could tell from the very detail of each corner.</li>
            <li>that allowed me to get really close to create stubble.  </li>
            <li>One - I didn&#x27;t think this trimmer could match my old Panasonic that finally quit on me after many years.  </li>
            <li>Very durable, water resistant (haven&#x27;t submerged it), and wonderfully long battery life (haven&#x27;t plugged it in in about a week and still going strong and varied amounts of usage).</li>
            <li>Clean up is simple you don&#x27;t have to fool around with all the separate attachments and then try and fit them back into a case it is so compact.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly a step up from my older one.</li>
            <li>The product comes with a lot of options for length and other things, and there is a web site that you can go to with even more hints and ideas.</li>
            <li>Look around for other trimmers that offer more power (based on reviews of course).  </li>
            <li>It takes several passes to get a good shave, has an extremely short battery life, and is generally under powered.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to use this as a hair trimmer, don&#x27;t expect it to cut on the first pass, the motor isn&#x27;t powerful enough fr it.</li>
            <li>much lighter then the older one that I have.</li>
            <li>and he doesn&#x27;t give me a problem when I have to trim his hair with it, so that is definitly a plus, because this one is much quieter then my older one.</li>
            <li>Not sure if anyone else has had this problem but the battery stopped holding a charge for more than 10 minutes worth of time.  </li>
            <li>He liked that it charges really quickly and holds a charge for a long time, and that there are only two attachments that have multiple adjustments for length.  </li>
            <li>It has enough power to make it perfect for personal use that is not overly complex.</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s good for Braun&#x27;s bottom line, but it&#x27;s not good business.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For now, going back to my tried and true Panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re holding it with your hand in the way the average user might hold it, your fingers might be touching it</li>
            <li>Try making a trimmer with a cord that can power a motor that will rip you a new one (like real men use).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trimming your head is a whole new story of misery.</li>
            <li>At this price, I expected it to be easily to adjust.</li>
            <li>The older one is a conair.</li>
            <li>To the dismay of my family I needed to actually grow a short beard to be able to give the review justice.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older Braun that stopped charging (that one lasted 3 years).</li>
            <li>But I would recommend this unit, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li>I have two main problems with the Cruzer 5.</li>
            <li>If youre at all particular about your beard, this IS NOT the trimmer for you.  </li>
            <li>And I expected that it would have a strong motor.</li>
            <li>This is a great beard trimmer with many setting and crazy long battery life.</li>
            <li>The trimmer feels just right in my hand, comfortable enough to be held on either left or right hand at different angle.</li>
            <li>It does the job and does it right and fast and simple.</li>
            <li>A high pitch noise</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you dont want to spend a bunch of money.</li>
            <li>I love this new trimmer and it is from Braun the only name in personal groomers.</li>
            <li>it takes me way to long to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>how many times I go over them, so I have to either use scissors or my other, old trimmer to fix the screwups</li>
            <li>anything new, take off less hair to begin with then more until desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had several brands over the years and this one generally works as good as any other trimmer i have purchased.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get the Conair iStubble.</li>
            <li>It is very smartly made with removable cutting guides...and it also has a very nice color combination to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>My hair is not thick</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not wasteful but who really wants someone&#x27;s 20 year old hair</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not wasteful but who really wants someone&#x27;s 20 year old hair trimmer?).     </li>
            <li>It will do the job eventually, but takes much longer to trim compared to the old trimmer</li>
            <li>I also found the battery performance far below the advertisement (not that that is much of an issue for me).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste any more time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds a charge for a good while and is small enough to take when traveling.</li>
            <li>It will turn a normal haircut.</li>
            <li>It fits in the hand nicely, it is very simple, with an easy on/off button placed perfectly, and a single (not 5) attachment that easily slides up or down to adjust for cutting length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably only strong enough to trim the hair of a preteen aka peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>You can also trim other areas but it does not give a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time i used it i had a messy beard and thick.. took some time to get it the length i wanted but for the money its a great buy and cheaper</li>
            <li>I decided a new trimmer would probably trim faster and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After ~1 year the flimsy plastic header broke, and i discovered that for the price of a new header i could practically replace the unit.</li>
            <li>I can grow a nice even beard but with an equal amount of pressure it trims unevenly.</li>
            <li>It holds charge for a good amount of time and the charging cord is coiled so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled as badly as the cheap cords most trimers I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful and you need to go over the same spot multiple times in order to ensure an even trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s either going to be too short (i.e. smallest setting) or too long for most of you (i.e. the first increment in the comb is way too long).</li>
            <li>My wife no longer complains as it does a much better job that past razors.</li>
            <li>That is fine and all but apparently my previous trimmer worked at 4mm which is a length I like to keep my beard.</li>
            <li>but I have read other reviews of people having significant issues with returning the device.  </li>
            <li>#1 - The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that you can only choose odd-number settings on the adjustable trimmer head attachment (1mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, 9mm and 11mm).</li>
            <li>Not only does it not have all the options that an average person would want but it is very cheaply constructed.  </li>
            <li>Instead of testing it out on my husband&#x27;s goatee, however, we first used it to give our seven year old son a mohawk (at his request, for the last day of school).  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you are using it for longer hair, where a little fluxuation in length isn&#x27;t going to be a problem, this trimmer might be fine.  </li>
            <li>Often I can get a week&#x27;s worth of use on a single charge.</li>
            <li>It also does not give a as tight and smooth a cut as others.  </li>
            <li>Good basic trimmer, but the battery is weak.</li>
            <li>Rather large and only has settings for even (2, 4, 6, etc).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s many attachments fills my little travel bag- a big jumble of things to dig through when it&#x27;s time to cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I do think this is a valid criticism and potential buyers should be aware of this major oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I do think this is a valid criticism and potential buyers should be aware of this major oversight.    </li>
            <li>Your better off buying dull rusty sheep shears.</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>I bought a braun battery operated shaver to replace the old shaver, so now I have a shaver and a trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It is also not wide so if you are trimming your head it will take longer then normal.</li>
            <li>I literally threw my 20 year old Wahl in the trash</li>
            <li>Since I threw out the 10 piece Wahl set, I used the old case for my Cruzer</li>
            <li>I literally threw my 20 year old Wahl in the trash</li>
            <li>Since I threw out the 10 piece Wahl set, I used the old case for my Cruzer</li>
            <li>I recommend staying away, unless you plan to trim to near the skin.</li>
            <li>This one is wildly inferior to what you get in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:  </li>
            <li>Battery would not charge despite the green light indicating it was charging.</li>
            <li>Even with charger attached &amp; green light on, the trimmer would not turn on.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco beard trimmer broke after about 10 years.</li>
            <li>(can tell this by the sound fading in and out over a few seconds).&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>Closest vendor near me is 600 miles away.</li>
            <li>the old Braun did.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;1mm&amp;#34; sounds like it should be a close trim, but it comes nowhere near that.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old vintage backup shaver has about 6 times the power and battery life.</li>
            <li>Brought for my young adult, bearded son.</li>
            <li>so I could get a complete shave, and when that didn&#x27;t work,I shaved with the cord</li>
            <li>So far in my life i&#x27;ve had 3 beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>The battery gives nowhere near the life they claim it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>decade+ old Norelco</li>
            <li>The wide range of lengths let us get the haircut just right, even though neither of us has ever given someone a mohawk before.  </li>
            <li>Im writing this review while i let the trimmer recharged for round 2 of misery and my hair to dry after having to shower to remove the very fine hair clippings that invade every pour and orfice of my body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a small trimmer, easy to hold and of course rechargeable.</li>
            <li>When it comes to cleaning, the Braun wins hands down, the fold down head is a breeze to clean.  </li>
            <li>The basic unit is a small electric razor which fits comfortably into the palm of the hand and seems to me to be very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>(though I won&#x27;t deny I usually love their products), the Cruzer package has 1 serious flaw-</li>
            <li>(though I won&#x27;t deny I usually love their products), the Cruzer package has 1 serious flaw-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various Norelco and Remington trimmers in the past with much better results.</li>
            <li>you have finer hair that sticks straight out of your head, only need odd-number trim lengths and can be totally conscious of the way you&#x27;re holding the trimmer the entire time you&#x27;re using it, it&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t think I can even grow one), but this is useful for me to trim it down to amount to even things and make it look like it is being taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The top half was short while the pesky curlier hairs towards the south stayed long and looked as if the razor had no effect on them.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended if you&#x27;re in the market for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last 2 years, still it does the job like a new Cruzer.</li>
            <li>THE TOUTED TWO BATTERY HIGH TORQUE SYSTEM DOES NOT CONSISTENTLY GIVE A STEADY CLIPPING SPEED;    </li>
            <li>If you enjoy uneven shaving and having to go over the same spot 10x to try to make it even, this is the product you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>think I will go with a cheap WaHL what the hell if it dies I am only out a few bucks.</li>
            <li>It cuts very unevenly and requires too many passes to get the job even half way decently done.  </li>
            <li>It went online looking for a replacement part and the only place that actually has them charges almost as much as a new razor!</li>
            <li>I purchased this, however, because it was the only trimmer I could find locally (for a decent price)</li>
            <li>but he generally charges it when he finishes using it</li>
            <li>This is the trimmer&#x27;s primary job - and it sucks at</li>
            <li>Not only that but the trimming height stays where you set it, which the old shaver/trimmer did not, which could be humiliating.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, you have to get the Cruzer 6 if you want to store your trimmer</li>
            <li>Apparently, you have to get the Cruzer 6 if you want to store your trimmer</li>
            <li>As I slouch into my mid-thirties, I&#x27;ve grown and kept a beard three different times in my adult life.</li>
            <li>He said it did not give him a really close shave, but it did as much as he expected for an electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I have used their shavers since I was old enough to shave.</li>
            <li>Like that it shave so close leaving a barely there stubble.</li>
            <li>It barely holds a charge for two trims.</li>
            <li>The settings may work for some but really do not allow for much customization in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>It barely cuts.</li>
            <li>last minus point is not a deal breaker, but for the each of the first two are.</li>
            <li>Good for a lot of things except close cutting.</li>
            <li>The only complaint i have is that i when i have a thicker/longer beard and want to cut it short, the guard has to be removed a fair amount to keep down excess hair buildup which effects performance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades are not not very sharp.  </li>
            <li>My old trimmer, which was made by Philips (and which is no longer made) and is 15 years old, still cuts better despite being a little dull.</li>
            <li>As with other Braun products that I have, I would expect this trimmer to be long lasting beyond its 2-years warranty coverage period with pretty decent battery life even after years of regular usage.</li>
            <li>Small brush is included in the box so you can clean even the tricky inner side and corners of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>This has never happened with my usual trimmer); it says washable, but in instructions says if you was regularly you need to apply oil (not needed if you clean with a brush.</li>
            <li>far as hair goes, I would have to say at the outset, that although the Cruzer is capable of trimming long hair, it is not really the task it was designed for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned other Braun trimmers and have always really like them</li>
            <li>Because there&#x27;s no battery light, it&#x27;s hard to tell when the battery is low.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the personal nature of the produce I&#x27;m not returning this, and since it would essentially cost double to try another trimmer I&#x27;ll live with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is typical for this price range, but it does take more than one pass.</li>
            <li>The old trimmer I had finally died and I needed a replacement for occasional facial hair trimming needs.</li>
            <li>Two teeth broke off within the first few months of use.</li>
            <li>Doesnt trim well at all, left lots of random hairs, and I had to go back over my beard with my old trimmer to make sure I got them all.  </li>
            <li>The guard is durable and strong (that was my problem with my previous trimmer; one day the guard just broke in half!).</li>
            <li>THE FIRST REP CLEARLY MISREAD MY COMPLAINT AND GAVE AN INCORRECT ANSWER BECAUSE OF IT.</li>
            <li>Price was good, shipping was quick, one less thing annoying me.</li>
            <li>Looks cool,  feels good in hand but does a horrible job.  </li>
            <li>For those of us who might like other lengths, it&#x27;s not clear in the description (which simply says 1-11mm) that the trimmer isn&#x27;t capable of doing, say, 2mm.</li>
            <li>When using it on more sensitive areas of skin, it&#x27;s down right painful if the metal touches my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly  recommend the shaver for any man&lt;br /&gt;Braun has never let me down with their products</li>

            <li> Not the best shaver ever!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Is it the greatest trimmer ever to hit the market as some seem to believe?</li>
            <li> They have excellent products and the two shavers I have from them have lasted for years.</li>

            <li> Excellent razer.</li>
            <li> It is excellent!</li>
            <li> Best way to describe the hair cut experience is cousin itt being sucked into a jet turbine and turned into a powdered mist of hair.</li>
            <li> It is a very good trimmer, because it fits perfectly in my hand and it has the guides on the sides</li>
            <li> Nice !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle--because its cordless and charges then runs for  about 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery life is also very good.</li>
            <li> very good quality.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great for grooming all types of breards.</li>
            <li> in all I would say that this is extremely good value for money and is an ideal addition to a man&#x27;s accessories.</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s convenient size and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of attachments, it&#x27;s a great trimmer to take along when you travel.</li>
            <li> If you are someone who has a beard, or shaves your head close, this is a great place to start when thinking about a trimmer.   </li>
            <li> I had been concerned that the guide might be a bit flimsy but after dropping it 10 or so times, its still great.</li>
            <li> Great product you can trim while it is plugged in.  </li>
            <li> The battery still works great.  </li>
            <li> without it works great.  </li>
            <li> I found this product great for trimming my chest and stomach.</li>
            <li> I use this for my moustache and to cut my hair (buzz cut) and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Got it on time as advertized and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done for a great price.</li>
            <li> He loves the product and is happy in can be used for the head if desired.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product and serves its purpose well.</li>

            <li> nice product and very good price</li>
            <li> For me it worked great  for shaving my neck and sides--I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews 11 months ago, I chose this one because I was impressed about claims about battery/motor strength and about the adjustable length attachment.</li>
            <li> Ive got a nice beard going now because of this product!</li>
            <li> This very cool beard trimmer is perfect for my husband who doesn&#x27;t like a close shave.  </li>
            <li> But any trimmer will do that fairly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good battery life and bi-voltage</li>
            <li> charge on it is good too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is good.  </li>
            <li> I truly loved the simplicity &amp; efficiency of Braun Cruzer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer provides a good range.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, this a good set for home use.</li>
            <li> GOod  trimmer , i use to all the time still working like a charm ..  </li>
            <li> , it seems good.</li>
            <li> ver y good</li>
            <li> and I still didn&#x27;t get a good trim.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my Braun shaver you need a good battery in order to shave.</li>
            <li> Made in China but quality is good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to if this is a good beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have found this to be the closest guide and a good experience for stubble...</li>
            <li> Good for manscaping too.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;bt ovel all it is good comparing the price</li>
            <li> Good build quality.</li>
            <li> I thought this looked good</li>
            <li> Braun Cruzer 5 Trimmer does a really good job of trimming mustaches and beards.  </li>
            <li> but it seems that the company just isn&#x27;t as good with trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing does a good job, cuts evenly, and costs a fraction of all the others.</li>
            <li> Good looks is about all this shaver has going for itself.</li>
            <li> he loved it when he got it for his birthday</li>
            <li> I use it on Christmas morning before many visits, and it trims beautifully.  </li>
            <li> the cut is very precise and has a great feel on your face.</li>
            <li> He uses it mostly as a trimmer between haircuts and for his sideburns and says that it works great.  </li>
            <li> Great dial in length with the lengths that most trimmers just skip.</li>
            <li> Has a great shape with many features to it</li>
            <li> This is a well-designed, effective, product that feels good in the hand.    </li>
            <li> While it is a nice compact size and good attachments, the shaver is too under-powered.</li>
            <li> Works well, just mnake sure to take care of those attachments!</li>
            <li> May never need them but it will come in handy if we do.</li>
            <li> Fully washable, nice design.</li>
            <li> I was so completely thrilled by the quality and simplicity of using it.</li>
            <li> (The beard, that is--I&#x27;m keeping the trimmer either way for my sideburns, as it does nice touch-up work.)</li>
            <li> Nice to see Braun still coming out with quality stuff.</li>
            <li> Trims nice and even and doesnt pull hairs out.</li>
            <li> I really wish though that this came with a micro trimmer for detailing and a nose trimmer attachment, then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> upon looking at the product in the store it seemed like everything would be good and have all the options that I needed and more.  </li>
            <li> However, I found the razor to be quite nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer that can be used in the shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this on sale for $25 and it is really good for that price point, I can&#x27;t see paying more than $30 for it</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very easy to use, nice slim size, and lots of power.</li>
            <li> My husband decided he no longer wanted the clean shaven look!!</li>
            <li> All in all, he was very happy with his new trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good solid product but not the best.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is great, holds a charge and works well -- but the beard attachment started to fall apart quickly and now has lost all its teeth.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> by far the best beard trimmer i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using mine for a just-shaved stubble type of look and so far it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> Also I would have liked more finesse in length adjustments.</li>
            <li> I have an old trimmer that use s attached guides that does a perfect job for my bard.  </li>
            <li> In good condition, looks like one LED light not functioning.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Has a good battery life, and very useful for all your trimming needs.</li>
            <li> Best razor ever, can&#x27;t be compared with other, very nice and very precise cut.</li>
            <li> Not a consumer friendly company, nor a good beard trimmer razor.</li>
            <li> rarely 5-star happy with most products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rarely 5-star happy with most products but the Cruzer earns every star.</li>
            <li> Also fits nicely into my hand and a breeze to clean!</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer - compact package, easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> Being my own barber, I was excited to try it out on my own head.</li>
            <li> I thought that by spending a bit more I would own a better and more durable product.</li>
            <li> The guard is very innovative and locks securely into place.</li>
            <li> It is also very light weight,</li>
            <li> it trims nicely and easy to use anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a beard-trimming guy for about 20 years, and I&#x27;ve had many trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Feels good in the hand and easy to control and to clean.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of given him the look he wants, and can also go shorter of longer too if he wants.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like the Cruzer 6 is much better, though I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> So overall I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love mine and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Braun is still a top maker of shaving products.....</li>
            <li> He has thicker stubble and was pleased with the ease of trimming it up, and it also works to grab sporadic body hair as desired.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly comfortable; you can&#x27;t even feel it doing its work!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Charging is anywhere 6-8 hours and you get many shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Norelco, which has been used weekly without proper oil cleaning for years, is still my best option.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> so I am sure it easier for the trimmer to cut through it.</li>
            <li> An included attachment allows to keep better length on your head up to 20mm (around 3/4\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> and I was particularly pleased with the locking adjustable trimmer attachments.  </li>
            <li> Guess that&#x27;s a good indicator of the worth of this</li>
            <li> He said it sometimes takes more than one pass over his face</li>
            <li> This was an interesting dichotomy.</li>
            <li> Glad that there is an adjustable guide instead of all of the attachments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unreliable and that&#x27;s worrisome for one of the most noticeable parts of your body.  </li>
            <li> , what more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know there are newer or better models of the Cruzer out there, but this was the cheapest and gets me what I need.  </li>
            <li> This thing skips more hair than it cuts .</li>
            <li> not gona be able to shave your head with this, unless you have 3hrs to spare.  </li>
            <li> It took me more than 5 minutes longer to trim my beard</li>
            <li> Works much better than the Wahl I just replaced.  </li>
            <li> The product does not specifically mention whether it should be used on the body, but I find it&#x27;s better than products like Phillips&#x27; Norelco Bodygroomer.</li>
            <li> I usually love everything Braun makes.</li>
            <li> I have a cruzer 6 razor but wanted a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> This gives more teeth so slightly better beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Would still like more guides</li>
            <li> I have to go over my beard many many many times at all angles, and I still have to get some hairs manually with scissors afterward.</li>
            <li> Much better choice</li>
            <li> I had a Remington before and the Braun is much better.</li>
            <li> This trimmer turned out to be better than expected--namely in battery life.  </li>
            <li> The locking mechanism on the removable &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; is top notch</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> It also shaves smoothly without catching hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes of shaving, my beard looks even more unruly then before I started trimming.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten one of these for my National Guard Son My Baby but someone in his unit needed it more</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> The trimmer did a good and quick job on his hair, it is well-made, and runs smoothly.  </li>
            <li> For the price this is the best trimmer I have had and am hoping for a long life ahead of it.</li>
            <li> I wish the trimmer cut a bit closer, but the battery has lasted quite a long time and I am fairly impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Its compact size nice and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product and I am more than satisfied than my previous Norelco, but I lost the charger and could not find it anywhere, Can anybody please suggest me something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see how the clippers and attachments are suppose to make trimming easier or more precise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my friends&#x27; and it performed flawlessly, with a wide range of adjustment between.4mm - 5mm, a sturdy trimmer head and no missed hairs at all.</li>
            <li> The chatrge, at 30 minutes or so, is ample for most jobs it will encounter and the unit itself is light and easily stored in a toiletries bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other trimmers for around this price range and have found this one to be of the best value.</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate.</li>
            <li> The fact that it has 1 adjustable attachment makes it so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to just click it to switch lengths.</li>
            <li> Easy to use tool for your hair and beard maintenance.</li>
            <li> The clean-up is easy because it&#x27;s waterproof and you can just run it under the faucet when you&#x27;re finished using it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Clean up is easy, run under some water.</li>
            <li> Detachable &#x27;comb&#x27; can be removed easily so you can rinse both the comb and the trimmer under running tap water.</li>
            <li> easy for use</li>
            <li> i ostepped on one of mine and it broke fairly easily.</li>
            <li> but the motor seems adequately strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, a good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li> but honestly, I find that with nearly any trimmer, including the Wahl I liked.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this trimmer and it is good for beard or head or</li>
            <li> 4 years and still an amazing razor that has never failed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only beautiful to look at and hold, but it&#x27;s a masterpiece of ergonomics.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is OK, I guess, for those who with a full beard.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> And once on, it has the same wonderful sliding adjustment feature to get your beard exactly the way you like</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine with him.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> They design products that are comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I use this machine to be working fine and you are advised to..ya uje ispolzivuyu mashinku normalno rabotaet,domashnom uslovie..</li>
            <li> Originally we had a wahl trimmer which he did like, but this is just so easy to use and easy to store.</li>
            <li> The first time was a disaster--it didn&#x27;t look good, and I didn&#x27;t have the right tools to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> length attachment is easy to use  easy clean up (waterproof)  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied and highly recommended at this price point.</li>
            <li> Device is easy to clean as well, which for me is important.</li>
            <li> He liked it much better than his old razor.  </li>
            <li> Not the most powerful trimmer available, but for the price and functionality</li>
            <li> light  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re obviously looking for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> The fact that you don&#x27;t have a cord hanging in the way is also a plus and it is great for travel since you only have to bring the one piece.</li>
            <li> I think) which includes precise cut features and a case.</li>
            <li> There is no battery light</li>
            <li> is just a cheap product that does not cut hair well.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Can clean easily under water</li>
            <li> Total win.</li>
            <li> After about a month or light use, it wouldn&#x27;t charge up.</li>
            <li> Spend the money on a better trimmer, this one isn&#x27;t worth the aggravation.</li>
            <li> This trimmer would have gotten a four-star rating if not for the obviously cheap construction of the beard trimmer guard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is cheap.</li>
            <li> 120/240 volt, comfortable design&lt;br /&gt;Minus:</li>
            <li> C-mon, that is just cheap product design.</li>
            <li> It has been a great tool for keeping a beard at the proper length.  </li>
            <li> It works great, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it charging or running out of juice in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a second one for my gf&#x27;s house, that one works great also.</li>
            <li> You would think for the MSRP that Braun is asking for you would get a quality razor fit for even the curliest and thickest of hair, no matter where it lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> A nice ergonomic feel, a beard length adjustment mechanism that stays where I set it and a handy push-button on-off switch on the middle of the handle cap off the review.</li>
            <li> bought this item because of the good reviews, but it does not cut my beard nearly as well as my 5-year-old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I know have to make sure its plugged in for a good 30 minuted before the motor works well enough to shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to clean, fits well and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, 3) It will trim fairly well WITHOUT the guard, if you&#x27;re trying to shave off your hair down to about 1mm.  </li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t nicked himself with it yet and says that it seems pretty safe in that</li>
            <li> First of all, this thing is sleek and sexy.</li>
            <li> I replaced the first one because the times on the trimmer comb simultaneously crumbled off (6 between the top and bottom comb) halfway through trimming my hair.  </li>
            <li> THis is a replacement to the original one i got.</li>
            <li> After more than 15 years ordering on Amazon, this is my first return.</li>
            <li> Now that I don&#x27;t have to be clean shaved all the time I used this to keep my face/head looking neat.</li>
            <li> to clean.</li>
            <li> It can also be used with water, which allows you to easily clean it.</li>
            <li> Removing the trimmers to clean the blades are not as intuitive as you might think.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several brands but this one is by far the best groomer I have purchased to date.</li>
            <li> It feels good in the hand, is light, has plenty of adjustment for beard length (for me anyway), and has enough power to do the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;o won&#x27;t hold the hair as you cut, need to clean afterwards</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and highly functional.</li>
            <li> If you are searching for a decent edger that also offers a great trim then the Braun Beard Trimmer is the one you have been searching for.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair from front to back, side to side, using the slider to get the lengths just right; it was quick and it looked great</li>
            <li> Even better (MUCH better) is you can simply run the trimmer blades under the faucet for a quick wash and you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> It has worked awesome for 4 years and now it is 2014 and the blade has started to dull</li>
            <li> only good features of this product are 1)</li>
            <li> I bought this yesterday and tried it after a full charge and while still plugged in to trim my beard which had about one week of growth.</li>
            <li> This thing is too cool.</li>
            <li> I have used an old Wahl to cut my own hair for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for something with a good amount of power, don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it really doesn&#x27;t add too much more time to shaving.</li>
            <li> good trimmer especially for the money</li>
            <li> For the outcome of use this is not worth more than $10.00 on a good day,</li>
            <li> The set was easy to use and in no time at all our kid went from looking like a respectable second-grader to a budding delinquent.  </li>
            <li> Does not get super close but enough to look good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty compact and lightweight, making it easy to pack for travel.    </li>
            <li> Since the blades are not that sharp, I have to finish the job with another set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery life is not that great.  </li>
            <li> So we searched around for a product that he could use to get a decent stubble :)</li>
            <li> Six settings make it super adjustable so that anyone can find a comb that works for them.  </li>
            <li> this hair trimmer is most likely a better version than your barber, person who does your hair uses.</li>
            <li> The removable heads, for beard and heair trimming, are easily removable but once fitted are steady and secure.</li>
            <li> So I got over my frustration quickly.</li>
            <li> So I got over my frustration quickly.</li>
            <li> but it does the job adequately</li>
            <li> battery seems to run out quick.  </li>
            <li> These seemed to have plenty of power at the beginning but that quickly began to fade.</li>
            <li> Despite the company claims that it works well for 7 years, you will be lucky to get 7 weeks of service out of it.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I live in Europe and own a Braun trimmer which I like very much.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the setting lengths and its consistency in maintaining a short &amp;#34;summer beard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> , the trimmer blade itself gets VERY HOT after a bit of shaving.</li>
            <li> Feels very well made and the quick change heads feel durable and strong.</li>
            <li> super easy to clean, easily surpasses my last remington.</li>
            <li> Once you are done using it you can use the brush to clean it and then easily place it back in the case it comes with for easy traveling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really surprising that they made a beard trimmer with such large comb length increments.</li>
            <li> I am back to buy another one since a $25 purchase of this item for 4 years has been amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My old, crappy Norelco with the broken-off comb tooth is better than this--and that&#x27;s the one I was trying to replace with this</li>
            <li> thinking for the younger men of 20 to 30 would most enjoy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He likes the feel of it, ease of it and is so enthusiastic about it, he took it back to his apartment in Manhattan to replace the one he was using.</li>
            <li> It has several nice features.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacement combs under $20 - which is nearly the cost of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I think this is my favorite trimmer so far, though, so</li>
            <li> It definitely wins in the bang for the buck department.</li>
            <li> My 15 yr old Norelco still worked 5 times better.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is right to the point.</li>
            <li> this may NOT be the right piece of equipment for you.</li>
            <li> I have to pass it like 10 times in a zone to get it right</li>
            <li> In fact, this Cruzer5 is just right for me.    </li>
            <li> As well, just after a year ( right after the warranty ran out)</li>
            <li> I found the Braun Cruzer 5 and it offered the adjustable setting that was the one feature I was looking for at a price that seemed about right for the amount of use it will receive.  </li>
            <li> The shaver then took right off, I was momentarily jubilant until I got to my sink and mirror</li>
            <li> The shaver&#x27;s length adjustment piece, called the Adjustable beard comb, is easy to break and Braun will not send you a new ne under warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the battery last long, and its easy to use, the guards make it easy for me not to ruin my mustache, and the ability to use it while its charging is nice.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with Braun&#x27;s service, even though their initial attempt to solve the issue failed.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally shopping for a competitor model, but because this was less money and had good reviews, I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, its quiet and very sharp with 1-11mm settings.</li>
            <li> I used it to trim my lengthy locks but it required more than I charge and although the result was very sharp and crisp, the unit performed better at the shorter lengths than at the longer.</li>
            <li> Pure bliss!</li>
            <li> I like to take off the guard to clean up my neck, but even this does not cut hairs as well as my older trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He loves this beard cruzer--it trims his facial hair nicely at whatever length he wants.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with supplied brush and the power adapter is a international one</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product to keep the facial hair (or even your hair) neat.</li>
            <li> The reviews of this trimmer were great, but I find that it doesn&#x27;t trim short enough.  </li>
            <li> and they work very, very well.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipper.</li>
            <li> Second, it charges quickly and can be removed from the cord, making the whole process more convenient.</li>
            <li> I got it at Target without reading the reviews here first.  </li>
            <li> As a beard trimmer it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I also love that it has an attachment and different levels.</li>
            <li> I doubt it will last 15 years like my Wahl, but it&#x27;s inexpensive, portable and much more convenient.</li>
            <li> The second time was better, but the trimmer I had at the time--which had to be plugged in to use it--still didn&#x27;t give me the level of precision</li>
            <li> I use it every morning to keep my beard exactly the length I want it.</li>
            <li> The first two times I grew a beard everyone told me to shave it off; this time, everyone says I should keep it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t point to exactly what the problem is - is it the size, angle, or position of the teeth on the comb?  </li>
            <li> But those of us who opt to take it all off, this trimmer could make us look pretty foolish.</li>
            <li> Overall I would say I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> His last razor had about eight attachments, so two was much more convenient.  </li>
            <li> It never performed as advertised and died within the first year.</li>
            <li> Even after six or more passes over my beard at all different angles and differing pressures, I still had untrimmed hair plus sore skin to boot.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last longer than the manual would lead you to believe and, in my opinion, a much better value than the Cruzer 6.  </li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> It was working pretty well until this.  </li>
            <li> so you have to make sure that it has enough charge for the day you plan on trimming.</li>
            <li> This problem can be solved, however, by upgrading to the Cruzer 6 which charges a lot quicker (an hour, I think).&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to take more than one pass to get all of my beard the same length.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the fact that it isn&#x27;t terribly loud and have found that cleaning it is pretty easy.    </li>
            <li> This product is nice, but does not have all of the settings of other shavers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it easy and simple to use on my beard and I experimented with various lengths and always achieved outstanding results.</li>
            <li> maintain a pretty long and full beard, with that being said I use this to clean up my cheeks and trim my mustache.</li>
            <li> First, this trimmer has an easily adjustable head that you can adjust for several lengths.</li>
            <li> The sleek design is pretty much where its perks end.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over it many times to get a smooth short facial beard.</li>
            <li> Product did not meet my expectations at all despite their past good reputation for quality products.</li>
            <li> Braun for me, is the epitomy of style and this handy beard and hair trimmer is typical of the thought and care Braun put into their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With only 2 attachments it is easy to use and just about anyone could do it.</li>
            <li> I am a razor guy by choice, so I can&#x27;t really complain because it really cuts pretty close</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and is fairly quiet, but not quite what we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> guess I was lucky in that I felt like I needed a trimmer immediately to replace my old one and bought it from Target.  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple passes to be sure I&#x27;ve got everything the way I want it, but the Cruzer is quiet and gentle--whereas other trimmers I&#x27;ve used have been loud and apt to poke me with their guides.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is nothing special about this product, I actually had better results from using a regular pair of hair clippers.</li>
            <li> I am not too certain what to make of these trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer is solid, well built, battery works fine, as does the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice little cutter if you want the stuble look, but no option for close cut.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and found on first use, as have many other reviewers, that it is very under powered.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes this handy little hair and beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Had this trimmer a little over a month or so now and so far it has been extremely good.</li>
            <li> This has been great for my beard over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> It just grows that fast.</li>
            <li> Very deceptive.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my husband, who absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> My shaver uses readily replaceable batteries, which is what i wanted in the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimming was even and the result was very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always charged up and ready.  </li>
            <li> I got the Cruzer, being a beardless man, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to really use this.</li>
            <li> It is very well made, but the design doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> This Braun Cruzer 5 Beard and Head Cruzer, 5 Beard and Head Trimmer (say that 3 times fast) cuts close.</li>
            <li> and I use it to shave in areas I can&#x27;t really see.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked very well for the job.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job very well.  </li>
            <li> Does not work very well for close cropped beards/mustaches.  </li>
            <li> No pulling, but not as fast as the Remington either.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cut much with the adjuster on.  </li>
            <li> The two built-in rechargable battery powers the trimmer and produces low buzzing sound that doesn&#x27;t disturb your roomies when you use it in the morning.    </li>
            <li> I waited for more than a week for a replacement guard and, sure enough, two teeth subsequently broke again only six months</li>
            <li> Even on the shortest setting, it leaves my husband&#x27;s beard longer than he wants.  </li>
            <li> the trimmer did work, it provide a reasonable shave without pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li> The battery is not user replaceable so after one year it is ready for the trash.</li>
            <li> I could tell from the very detail of each corner.</li>
            <li> that allowed me to get really close to create stubble.  </li>
            <li> One - I didn&#x27;t think this trimmer could match my old Panasonic that finally quit on me after many years.  </li>
            <li> Very durable, water resistant (haven&#x27;t submerged it), and wonderfully long battery life (haven&#x27;t plugged it in in about a week and still going strong and varied amounts of usage).</li>
            <li> Clean up is simple you don&#x27;t have to fool around with all the separate attachments and then try and fit them back into a case it is so compact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly a step up from my older one.</li>
            <li> The product comes with a lot of options for length and other things, and there is a web site that you can go to with even more hints and ideas.</li>
            <li> Look around for other trimmers that offer more power (based on reviews of course).  </li>
            <li> It takes several passes to get a good shave, has an extremely short battery life, and is generally under powered.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to use this as a hair trimmer, don&#x27;t expect it to cut on the first pass, the motor isn&#x27;t powerful enough fr it.</li>
            <li> much lighter then the older one that I have.</li>
            <li> and he doesn&#x27;t give me a problem when I have to trim his hair with it, so that is definitly a plus, because this one is much quieter then my older one.</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else has had this problem but the battery stopped holding a charge for more than 10 minutes worth of time.  </li>
            <li> He liked that it charges really quickly and holds a charge for a long time, and that there are only two attachments that have multiple adjustments for length.  </li>
            <li> It has enough power to make it perfect for personal use that is not overly complex.</li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s good for Braun&#x27;s bottom line, but it&#x27;s not good business.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For now, going back to my tried and true Panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re holding it with your hand in the way the average user might hold it, your fingers might be touching it</li>
            <li> Try making a trimmer with a cord that can power a motor that will rip you a new one (like real men use).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trimming your head is a whole new story of misery.</li>
            <li> At this price, I expected it to be easily to adjust.</li>
            <li> The older one is a conair.</li>
            <li> To the dismay of my family I needed to actually grow a short beard to be able to give the review justice.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Braun that stopped charging (that one lasted 3 years).</li>
            <li> But I would recommend this unit, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li> I have two main problems with the Cruzer 5.</li>
            <li> If youre at all particular about your beard, this IS NOT the trimmer for you.  </li>
            <li> And I expected that it would have a strong motor.</li>
            <li> This is a great beard trimmer with many setting and crazy long battery life.</li>
            <li> The trimmer feels just right in my hand, comfortable enough to be held on either left or right hand at different angle.</li>
            <li> It does the job and does it right and fast and simple.</li>
            <li> A high pitch noise</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you dont want to spend a bunch of money.</li>
            <li> I love this new trimmer and it is from Braun the only name in personal groomers.</li>
            <li> it takes me way to long to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> how many times I go over them, so I have to either use scissors or my other, old trimmer to fix the screwups</li>
            <li> anything new, take off less hair to begin with then more until desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had several brands over the years and this one generally works as good as any other trimmer i have purchased.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get the Conair iStubble.</li>
            <li> It is very smartly made with removable cutting guides...and it also has a very nice color combination to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> My hair is not thick</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not wasteful but who really wants someone&#x27;s 20 year old hair</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not wasteful but who really wants someone&#x27;s 20 year old hair trimmer?).     </li>
            <li> It will do the job eventually, but takes much longer to trim compared to the old trimmer</li>
            <li> I also found the battery performance far below the advertisement (not that that is much of an issue for me).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste any more time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds a charge for a good while and is small enough to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> It will turn a normal haircut.</li>
            <li> It fits in the hand nicely, it is very simple, with an easy on/off button placed perfectly, and a single (not 5) attachment that easily slides up or down to adjust for cutting length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably only strong enough to trim the hair of a preteen aka peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> You can also trim other areas but it does not give a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time i used it i had a messy beard and thick.. took some time to get it the length i wanted but for the money its a great buy and cheaper</li>
            <li> I decided a new trimmer would probably trim faster and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After ~1 year the flimsy plastic header broke, and i discovered that for the price of a new header i could practically replace the unit.</li>
            <li> I can grow a nice even beard but with an equal amount of pressure it trims unevenly.</li>
            <li> It holds charge for a good amount of time and the charging cord is coiled so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled as badly as the cheap cords most trimers I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful and you need to go over the same spot multiple times in order to ensure an even trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either going to be too short (i.e. smallest setting) or too long for most of you (i.e. the first increment in the comb is way too long).</li>
            <li> My wife no longer complains as it does a much better job that past razors.</li>
            <li> That is fine and all but apparently my previous trimmer worked at 4mm which is a length I like to keep my beard.</li>
            <li> but I have read other reviews of people having significant issues with returning the device.  </li>
            <li> #1 - The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that you can only choose odd-number settings on the adjustable trimmer head attachment (1mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, 9mm and 11mm).</li>
            <li> Not only does it not have all the options that an average person would want but it is very cheaply constructed.  </li>
            <li> Instead of testing it out on my husband&#x27;s goatee, however, we first used it to give our seven year old son a mohawk (at his request, for the last day of school).  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if you are using it for longer hair, where a little fluxuation in length isn&#x27;t going to be a problem, this trimmer might be fine.  </li>
            <li> Often I can get a week&#x27;s worth of use on a single charge.</li>
            <li> It also does not give a as tight and smooth a cut as others.  </li>
            <li> Good basic trimmer, but the battery is weak.</li>
            <li> Rather large and only has settings for even (2, 4, 6, etc).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s many attachments fills my little travel bag- a big jumble of things to dig through when it&#x27;s time to cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I do think this is a valid criticism and potential buyers should be aware of this major oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I do think this is a valid criticism and potential buyers should be aware of this major oversight.    </li>
            <li> Your better off buying dull rusty sheep shears.</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> I bought a braun battery operated shaver to replace the old shaver, so now I have a shaver and a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is also not wide so if you are trimming your head it will take longer then normal.</li>
            <li> I literally threw my 20 year old Wahl in the trash</li>
            <li> Since I threw out the 10 piece Wahl set, I used the old case for my Cruzer</li>
            <li> I literally threw my 20 year old Wahl in the trash</li>
            <li> Since I threw out the 10 piece Wahl set, I used the old case for my Cruzer</li>
            <li> I recommend staying away, unless you plan to trim to near the skin.</li>
            <li> This one is wildly inferior to what you get in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:  </li>
            <li> Battery would not charge despite the green light indicating it was charging.</li>
            <li> Even with charger attached &amp; green light on, the trimmer would not turn on.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco beard trimmer broke after about 10 years.</li>
            <li> (can tell this by the sound fading in and out over a few seconds).&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> Closest vendor near me is 600 miles away.</li>
            <li> the old Braun did.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;1mm&amp;#34; sounds like it should be a close trim, but it comes nowhere near that.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old vintage backup shaver has about 6 times the power and battery life.</li>
            <li> Brought for my young adult, bearded son.</li>
            <li> so I could get a complete shave, and when that didn&#x27;t work,I shaved with the cord</li>
            <li> So far in my life i&#x27;ve had 3 beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> The battery gives nowhere near the life they claim it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> decade+ old Norelco</li>
            <li> The wide range of lengths let us get the haircut just right, even though neither of us has ever given someone a mohawk before.  </li>
            <li> Im writing this review while i let the trimmer recharged for round 2 of misery and my hair to dry after having to shower to remove the very fine hair clippings that invade every pour and orfice of my body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a small trimmer, easy to hold and of course rechargeable.</li>
            <li> When it comes to cleaning, the Braun wins hands down, the fold down head is a breeze to clean.  </li>
            <li> The basic unit is a small electric razor which fits comfortably into the palm of the hand and seems to me to be very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> (though I won&#x27;t deny I usually love their products), the Cruzer package has 1 serious flaw-</li>
            <li> (though I won&#x27;t deny I usually love their products), the Cruzer package has 1 serious flaw-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various Norelco and Remington trimmers in the past with much better results.</li>
            <li> you have finer hair that sticks straight out of your head, only need odd-number trim lengths and can be totally conscious of the way you&#x27;re holding the trimmer the entire time you&#x27;re using it, it&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t think I can even grow one), but this is useful for me to trim it down to amount to even things and make it look like it is being taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The top half was short while the pesky curlier hairs towards the south stayed long and looked as if the razor had no effect on them.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended if you&#x27;re in the market for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 2 years, still it does the job like a new Cruzer.</li>
            <li> THE TOUTED TWO BATTERY HIGH TORQUE SYSTEM DOES NOT CONSISTENTLY GIVE A STEADY CLIPPING SPEED;    </li>
            <li> If you enjoy uneven shaving and having to go over the same spot 10x to try to make it even, this is the product you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> think I will go with a cheap WaHL what the hell if it dies I am only out a few bucks.</li>
            <li> It cuts very unevenly and requires too many passes to get the job even half way decently done.  </li>
            <li> It went online looking for a replacement part and the only place that actually has them charges almost as much as a new razor!</li>
            <li> I purchased this, however, because it was the only trimmer I could find locally (for a decent price)</li>
            <li> but he generally charges it when he finishes using it</li>
            <li> This is the trimmer&#x27;s primary job - and it sucks at</li>
            <li> Not only that but the trimming height stays where you set it, which the old shaver/trimmer did not, which could be humiliating.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, you have to get the Cruzer 6 if you want to store your trimmer</li>
            <li> Apparently, you have to get the Cruzer 6 if you want to store your trimmer</li>
            <li> As I slouch into my mid-thirties, I&#x27;ve grown and kept a beard three different times in my adult life.</li>
            <li> He said it did not give him a really close shave, but it did as much as he expected for an electric trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have used their shavers since I was old enough to shave.</li>
            <li> Like that it shave so close leaving a barely there stubble.</li>
            <li> It barely holds a charge for two trims.</li>
            <li> The settings may work for some but really do not allow for much customization in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> It barely cuts.</li>
            <li> last minus point is not a deal breaker, but for the each of the first two are.</li>
            <li> Good for a lot of things except close cutting.</li>
            <li> The only complaint i have is that i when i have a thicker/longer beard and want to cut it short, the guard has to be removed a fair amount to keep down excess hair buildup which effects performance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are not not very sharp.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer, which was made by Philips (and which is no longer made) and is 15 years old, still cuts better despite being a little dull.</li>
            <li> As with other Braun products that I have, I would expect this trimmer to be long lasting beyond its 2-years warranty coverage period with pretty decent battery life even after years of regular usage.</li>
            <li> Small brush is included in the box so you can clean even the tricky inner side and corners of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This has never happened with my usual trimmer); it says washable, but in instructions says if you was regularly you need to apply oil (not needed if you clean with a brush.</li>
            <li> far as hair goes, I would have to say at the outset, that although the Cruzer is capable of trimming long hair, it is not really the task it was designed for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Braun trimmers and have always really like them</li>
            <li> Because there&#x27;s no battery light, it&#x27;s hard to tell when the battery is low.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the personal nature of the produce I&#x27;m not returning this, and since it would essentially cost double to try another trimmer I&#x27;ll live with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is typical for this price range, but it does take more than one pass.</li>
            <li> The old trimmer I had finally died and I needed a replacement for occasional facial hair trimming needs.</li>
            <li> Two teeth broke off within the first few months of use.</li>
            <li> Doesnt trim well at all, left lots of random hairs, and I had to go back over my beard with my old trimmer to make sure I got them all.  </li>
            <li> The guard is durable and strong (that was my problem with my previous trimmer; one day the guard just broke in half!).</li>
            <li> THE FIRST REP CLEARLY MISREAD MY COMPLAINT AND GAVE AN INCORRECT ANSWER BECAUSE OF IT.</li>
            <li> Price was good, shipping was quick, one less thing annoying me.</li>
            <li> Looks cool,  feels good in hand but does a horrible job.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who might like other lengths, it&#x27;s not clear in the description (which simply says 1-11mm) that the trimmer isn&#x27;t capable of doing, say, 2mm.</li>
            <li> When using it on more sensitive areas of skin, it&#x27;s down right painful if the metal touches my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly  recommend the shaver for any man&lt;br /&gt;Braun has never let me down with their products</li>
            <li> difficult to cut beard: did not cut well, and took a long time to cut; the trim function blade was very hot (really burnt above my lip.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my Phillips Norelco vacuum beard trimmer which I had used for years.  </li>
            <li> The cutting template breaks off very easily.</li>
            <li> They are easily cleaned with a small brush to remove small pieces of hair.</li>
            <li> idea is to make a product that won&#x27;t last too long (planned obselesence).</li>
            <li> Did not last for long.</li>
            <li> There are always stray long hairs that we find later.  </li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> So basically the two attachments are for either long or short hair and depending on what you are using the device for (beard or haircut).  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts long enough to do what you need it to.</li>
            <li> It takes me so long to trim my beard in the morning it sort of boggles my mind, and when I&#x27;ve finally given up there are still loads of patchy hairs all over.  </li>
            <li> The Cruzer has very little power and constantly sounds as if the batteries are about to die as it trims my not particularly thick beard once every 10 days.</li>
            <li> This leaves many longer hairs sticking out of my face awkwardly among a short beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially the same as if they sent an empty box with a note that said &amp;#34;gotcha!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this hing does not hold charge for that long; also, it&#x27;s not as powerful as other trimmers.</li>
            <li> The hair is shredded into such a fine cloud, its easily inhaled during your miserable trim irratating your throat, sinuses and lungs.</li>
            <li> I do believe it is a little pricy, but I guess that&#x27;s where the old saying comes from \\&quot;You</li>
            <li> The Braun does an OK job cutting.  </li>
            <li> I received this today and was not expecting much after reading some of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have spots where the trimmer could not get close enough and my face seems patchy after spending 3x longer trimming than I did in the past with my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair with our old trimmer and it would take a few times going over his head to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I cannot give a long term review for the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> 3mm is shorter than I&#x27;m used to and 5mm is too long.</li>
            <li> I like the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look and the 3 is still a tad too long for that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent close to $400 on various razors over the years.</li>
            <li> is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bothered to review anything in my life, but damn i get tired of these products which don&#x27;t even perform the simple function for which they are sold.  </li>
            <li> Braun, since bought by Proctor &amp; Gamble, is easy to find on the Internet but their website keeps cutting you off and having you rewrite the same information over and over.  </li>
            <li> YOU CAN ONLY DO ODD NUMBERS IN MM ON THE ACTUAL TRIMMER.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really decent trimmer and one he&#x27;s used steadily for months without fail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this first also to trim it to a thin amount, right before using a razor to shave, makes it less painful for a clean shave</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to men who need to get ride of a no-shave November beard or even other body hair.</li>
            <li> use it on various other parts of my body to trim things up.</li>
            <li> He uses it to trim his facial hair after a few days growth (he has a very heavy, fast growing beard), and then a hand held razor for closest shave.</li>
            <li> battery life isn&#x27;t very long, I think it&#x27;s like 40 or 45 minutes after an eight hour charge.</li>
            <li> I guess his lack of complaint is a decent endorsement.  </li>
            <li> I also face the issue with uneven trim and have to go over multiple times on the same area to get it trimmed evenly.</li>
            <li> Gives me 3 to 4 days use on a single charge.</li>
            <li> The battery starts to lag during a single shave.</li>
            <li> After about four users, it pulls on my beard every single time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of painful having this thing jam up in your beard due to lack of power from a dying battery.  </li>
            <li> The only negative we found is that you have to be careful to check that the attachments are completely clicked into place.  </li>
            <li> Odd that the electrical connections of the 2 products are different</li>
            <li> but that is not realistic.</li>
            <li> I only wish it cut just a little closer on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> The only issue i find is that the lowest 1mm setting still seems like it is trimming it a little longer then that</li>
            <li> but it takes nothing more than a little pinch of the sides to remove the hair cutting piece with the beard trimming piece.</li>
            <li> The teeth are too widely spaced to pick up the hairs in order to cut them, so it just runs over them, and over them, and over them.  </li>
            <li> I use it a few different ways:  1)</li>
            <li> I trim my beard with the depth attachment (although it&#x27;s not really an attachment like on the Wahl).  </li>
            <li> It cannot get wet and has to be oiled after every use to keep the blades from sticking together.</li>
            <li> BRAUN CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS NOT VERY HELPFUL.</li>
            <li> Battery on the Braun will not hold a charge unless constantly plugged in and even then you can hear the trimmer start to die out after a few minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> The two biggest ones I can think of are that it does not have enough power, and sometimes there is an uneven trim.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> stopped using it after a few months and went back to the dying blunt</li>
            <li> The trim length settings are not fine enough.</li>
            <li> In addition to the Cruzer5 being a miserable excuse of a beard trimmer, the spacer broke after 6 months of normal use, and Braun won&#x27;t replace the part under warranty; and on top of all that, they wan&#x27;t to charge me over half the price of the trimmer for a replacement spacer.</li>
            <li> It also, emits a horrible high pitched squeal when charging, although most folks may not hear it (my wife doesn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> The motor is extremely underpowered and the rotations significantly varied without the trimmer even cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes up to 8 hours to charge which is a little long, but a charge lasts for about 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It comes with an attachable hair cutting extension and the always present handy-dandy small brush to clean the blades.</li>
            <li> Pulling out facial hair is not a pleasant feeling when the shaver stalls in the middle of a pass.</li>
            <li> It is relatively small and compact, yet has a solid feel.</li>
            <li> Says it can do 1-11mm for beard on one side of the box, says it can do 1,2,3,4,5,6 on the other side.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Another thing to note is that the trimmer has an internal battery, so i need to carry the small charger when i travel.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cord, oil, brush, and the other attachment.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cord, oil, brush, and the other attachment.</li>
            <li> This is a pain for us since we use the 2 on all other shavers.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Usage: Every other day</li>
            <li> So you can shave with 1 hand and hold it plugged in with the other.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s return policy worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> and I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> My big beef is the battery run time was never more than a couple of minutes, so I got in the habit of leaving it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yesterday the thing just stopped abruptly when it was doing</li>
            <li> and it died abruptly again, this time for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They initially sent me a replacement head (for the wrong model, the CruZer 1 which has a completely different design) and then agreed to take it back.</li>
            <li> I got this to have in the house when my son comes home weekends from New York City where he works as a game designer.    </li>
            <li> I had recently broken my trimmer and was shopping for a new one when I saw this one.</li>
            <li> Really sad that this is so bad, I do use a Braun series 5 shaver and am happy with that</li>
            <li> I was once a teenager who thought a little bit of fluff was a beard.  </li>
            <li> It is impossible to get a clean close shave with this thing.</li>
            <li> I used it on my husband --he complained that it wasn&#x27;t close enough for him.</li>
            <li> Not useful at all as an edger.</li>
            <li> The adjustable head is very helpful (instead of the multitude of attachments which are either the wrong size, or get lost).  </li>
            <li> I with there was a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; in between 1 and 3 is probably my only complaint.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;o not powerful, takes time to trim&lt;br</li>
            <li> The guards are not worth anything as you cannot cut all of your posterior hairs to an even length.</li>
            <li> This product is the most limp-dick piece of consumer crap that i&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of believing in.</li>
            <li> but unlike the Wahl, you don&#x27;t have to break down the trimmer to oil it.</li>
            <li> you can use it with cord, helps when battery is down</li>
            <li> no gradual winding down.</li>
            <li> The performance goes down from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but it functions as well as any other trimmer that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The blue guard is too thick for tight corners and close spaces.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over it a few times, like some of the other reviews state...</li>
            <li> The depth comb is very loose thus not very effective.  </li>
            <li> The plastic teeth on this trimmer are also not very strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month, so</li>
            <li> I had to do several passes to trim the hairs even though I was not using the trim guard and was cutting directly on my face.</li>
            <li> I probably charge this less than once a month</li>
            <li> Ive been through less invasive dust storms.</li>
            <li> Just very odd compared to some of the other trimmers I have</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not making a mess in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the Braun has proven to be very satisfactory for both cutting down my dense beard and trimming my mustache.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s power, as it never seems to bog down, the guides or cutting teeth just don&#x27;t grab and channel the hair in to get cut very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cruzer 5 comes with a little bottle of oil for the blades (just as the Wahl did)</li>
            <li> I usually use the closest trim, but the other settings work reliable.</li>
            <li> No idea how often, as instructions don&#x27;t specify, but carrying around a little bottle of oil it not my idea of &amp;#34;easy washing.&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what it&#x27;s intended purpose is other than to add another electronic item to the trash pile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of this item, and a few people reviewed it as if were a razor.</li>
            <li> Two - the somewhat uneven ratings did give me pause.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would function as a shaver and a trimmer as had the defunct shaver/trimmer, but alas it is only a trimmer, which cuts to stubble length at the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I get to the results may I just say a few words about the ease of use and cleaning for this product.</li>
            <li> It is a heavy, corded monster with 5 different attachments for cutting different lengths of hair.</li>
            <li> The last one I owned was also a Braun I got over twenty years ago ,work like a charm until it got tired and died .I</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time and money with this...</li>
            <li> Waste of $$$$</li>
            <li> Product stopped working after few months of use.</li>
            <li> Within a few months of use I broke off a few of the teeth ...</li>
            <li> so passing it a few times doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> And what I get is visibly uneven.</li>
            <li> I bought this over 6 months ago and have been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Uneven cut.</li>
            <li> I may have killed it by leaving it plugged in, contrary to instructions about how you are supposed to let it discharge fully between charges....</li>
            <li> I bought it at Target a few months ago and have regretted throwing the box away.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll give yourself an uneven cut.</li>
            <li> After only a few dozen shaves they were difficult to use because they would struggle to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> Super annoying.  </li>
            <li> adjustable head has a weak structure and it collapses from its set position upon slightly harder pressure against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The trim length adjuster that attaches on the end of the device was sliding from a 5 to a 3 or 1 with very little pressure.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it didn&#x27;t work out, I really wanted to like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I will say it takes hours to fully charge, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the dual powered battery, but you have to be prepared.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, lightweight and cordless and comes with one adjustable attachment for length.  </li>
            <li> has the small detailing part.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s even a small bottle of mechanical oil provided in the packaging to keep the trimmer blade slick.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but it just does not cut well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using a Remington MB 4040 which while not perfect (4 stars out of 5) puts this Braun to shame.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.  </li>
            <li> not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> And in small portions at that.</li>
            <li> Requires 4-5 passes and is very slow compared to other brands i have used including Norelco.</li>
            <li> Very few I have used allow a once or twice pass...</li>
            <li> I have extremely short hair and this thing cannot handle giving me a buzz cut without clogging up and pulling my hair after just a few seconds of cutting.  </li>
            <li> If you have an inlaw you hate, a roomate you despise, or a barber you want to play a prank on, this is the best cruel gift for them to cut their hair with.</li>
            <li> And also the biggest failure - the trimmer leaves tons of uncut hairs, evenly distributed, on both my face and head - even after multiple passes.</li>
            <li> but if your a die hard shaved head guy....</li>
            <li> and it can be hard to get an even shave sometimes.</li>
            <li> My son did say that the adjustable shaver part is hard</li>
            <li> whatever it is) at least once a week for years to trim my beard.  </li>
            <li> Being cordless makes it convenient to get close to the mirror it ensure proper cutting.</li>
            <li> and it sucks.</li>
            <li> I must have a lemon because the motor&#x27;s rpm is very low and pulls hair out rather than cutting it sometimes.</li>
            <li> Same thing when cutting hair on my head and body.</li>
            <li> only thing i didnt like in it, if u use some level of cutting the Hair will not be equal&lt;</li>
            <li> I find it extremely uncomfortable to run a blade across my face, and conventional shaving leaves my skin chafed, regardless of whether I apply moisturizer afterward.  </li>
            <li> But when the beard guard comb broke on a recent trip, it&#x27;s impossible to buy a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I popped the cutting head and cleaned out the hair and oiled the blades, which seemed to be dry.</li>
            <li> It is either defective or it is just not a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Weak ass motor powered by a wimpy battery.</li>
            <li> The trimmer strength is weak.  </li>
            <li> The power is weak.  </li>
            <li> None have been rendered useless in less than three years, and none of them failed because of poor design.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a a battery powered shaver that had gotten broken.  </li>
            <li> Cut to as thin as 1mm</li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun doesn&#x27;t stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> Also not really happy with the range of trim lengths on the Cruzer 5.  </li>
            <li> The problem is it cuts my beard poorly.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed.</li>
            <li> That was irritating because the coiled word is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trust the other bad reviews, this thing is garbage.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading some of the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> it sucks at cutting beard hair.</li>
            <li> Tedious and dangerous, it was not a favorite chore.</li>
            <li> I hated the fact that I had to pay to ship this piece of trash back, but those are the breaks.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull, pulls the hairs  painfully instead of clipping  them like</li>
            <li> The problem is that the comb is designed wrong.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, a wrong assumption.</li>
            <li> This product, however, if seriously flawed.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor from a local store and it is terrible.</li>
            <li> I find that these newer design with adjustable guides are useless.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is commpletely useless.  </li>
            <li> He is allowed to be casual at work: wears shorts, t-shirts, sandals, and doesn&#x27;t have to be clean-shaven.  </li>
            <li> and it was a little cheaper; however, it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> Also I think the design stinks.</li>
            <li> Depth gauge broke from cutting hair.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The motor always sounds like it&#x27;s straining, especially if cutting thick hair.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially impossible to use as it just doesn&#x27;t have the power to uh</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have been very disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> SEE: [...]</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews for anything, but this trimmer is so bad that I had to!</li>
            <li> BAD CHOICE!</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Pathetic!</li>
            <li> This terrible trimmer would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> This Braun trimmer is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself it is not the worst one out there, but there are some problems.</li>
            <li> but this Cruzer 5 is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product considering what it costs.  </li>
            <li> The battery is awful and the blade speed is permanently set on Level Rip-the-whisker-dont-cut.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good for a lot of things except close cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a beard-trimming guy for about 20 years, and I&#x27;ve had many trimmers.  This is the worst, but it looks the best.  I got it at Target without reading the reviews here first.  Bad move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others say, it&#x27;s underpowered, but the worst aspect, without a doubt, is that it MISSES MANY, MANY HAIRS.  The problem is that the comb is designed wrong.  The teeth are too widely spaced to pick up the hairs in order to cut them, so it just runs over them, and over them, and over them.  Super annoying.  Some hairs will NEVER get cut no matter how many times I go over them, so I have to either use scissors or my other, old trimmer to fix the screwups this one leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old, crappy Norelco with the broken-off comb tooth is better than this--and that&#x27;s the one I was trying to replace with this Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good features of this product are 1) You can wash it off with water, 2) It looks nice, 3) It will trim fairly well WITHOUT the guard, if you&#x27;re trying to shave off your hair down to about 1mm.  But any trimmer will do that fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Best razor ever, can&#x27;t be compared with other, very nice and very precise cut. Good battery life and bi-voltage a +++++</li>
            <li> If you enjoy uneven shaving and having to go over the same spot 10x to try to make it even, this is the product you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I used to shave my face and head every day. Tedious and dangerous, it was not a favorite chore. Now that I don&#x27;t have to be clean shaved all the time I used this to keep my face/head looking neat. Does the job. I only wish it cut just a little closer on the lowest setting. Feels good in the hand and easy to control and to clean. Gives me 3 to 4 days use on a single charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a number of people complain about this trimmer and my thought is that they are using it as a hair trimmer then a beard trimmer. If you are looking to use this as a hair trimmer, don&#x27;t expect it to cut on the first pass, the motor isn&#x27;t powerful enough fr it. As a beard trimmer it works pretty well. I have had several brands over the years and this one generally works as good as any other trimmer i have purchased. It&#x27;s easier to clean, fits well and comfortable in my hand. The only complaint i have is that i when i have a thicker/longer beard and want to cut it short, the guard has to be removed a fair amount to keep down excess hair buildup which effects performance.</li>
            <li> I often need to have the back of my neck shaved 2-3 times between haircuts. It just grows that fast. I&#x27;ve tried several razors and they just didn&#x27;t get close enough. The Braun Cruzer has given me the closest shave yet. My wife no longer complains as it does a much better job that past razors. I also love that it has an attachment and different levels. May never need them but it will come in handy if we do. And, it is cordless! Can&#x27;t complain there! For the price range, this is one of the best you can get!</li>
            <li> My son has been testing this product for me, and he quite likes it. It is relatively small and compact, yet has a solid feel. It is easy to operate. He uses it to trim his facial hair after a few days growth (he has a very heavy, fast growing beard), and then a hand held razor for closest shave. The product comes with a lot of options for length and other things, and there is a web site that you can go to with even more hints and ideas. Great product for keeping your hair and beard neat or stubby as you prefer.</li>
            <li> This is a well-designed, effective, product that feels good in the hand.    At this price, I expected it to be easily to adjust. It is. And I expected that it would have a strong motor. It does.    I really appreciate the fact that it isn&#x27;t terribly loud and have found that cleaning it is pretty easy.    I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times and everything still seems to work a-ok!</li>
            <li> I read reviews of this item, and a few people reviewed it as if were a razor. It&#x27;s not a razor; it&#x27;s a trimmer.  It simply will not give you a shave; it&#x27;ll trim.  I use it a few different ways:  1) If I let my sideburns go out of control, I trim with this to get to a length where my Mach 3 razor will work. It leaves 1/16\\&quot; to 1/8\\&quot; of stubble.  2) I trim my beard with the depth attachment (although it&#x27;s not really an attachment like on the Wahl).  3) My wife cuts my hair, and she uses it as a trimmer for that.  Pro:  light  cordless  waterproof  length attachment is easy to use  easy clean up (waterproof)  Neutral  It takes 8 hours to charge, but I just charge it overnight when the battery is low.   Con:  It seems like it doesn&#x27;t have enough power. The motor always sounds like it&#x27;s straining, especially if cutting thick hair.   Because there&#x27;s no battery light, it&#x27;s hard to tell when the battery is low. Because it&#x27;s low on power, it always sounds like the battery is dieing.  I doubt it will last 15 years like my Wahl, but it&#x27;s inexpensive, portable and much more convenient.</li>
            <li> My husband decided he no longer wanted the clean shaven look!! So we searched around for a product that he could use to get a decent stubble :) Reading the reviews we went for this one. It does a great job of given him the look he wants, and can also go shorter of longer too if he wants.&lt;br /&gt;The charge on it is good too.</li>
            <li> Says it can do 1-11mm for beard on one side of the box, says it can do 1,2,3,4,5,6 on the other side. Says you can do 1-11mm in the manual. YOU CAN ONLY DO ODD NUMBERS IN MM ON THE ACTUAL TRIMMER. Very deceptive. Definitely returning it.</li>
            <li> Good basic trimmer, but the battery is weak. It looks like the Cruzer 6 is much better, though I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer is a great trimmer! I cut my husband&#x27;s hair with our old trimmer and it would take a few times going over his head to make a difference. This trimmer is right to the point. It was very easy to use. The design is awesome and will make well for travel. I&#x27;m really happy with it. I do believe it is a little pricy, but I guess that&#x27;s where the old saying comes from \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;. So overall I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re obviously looking for a great trimmer. Don&#x27;t waste any more time. Buy it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I absolutely love mine and use it every day. Often I can get a week&#x27;s worth of use on a single charge. It&#x27;s Awesome!</li>
            <li> Braun is still a top maker of shaving products.....but this one just didn&#x27;t do it all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking for the younger men of 20 to 30 would most enjoy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on myself but also on my husband. For me it worked great  for shaving my neck and sides--I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it on my husband --he complained that it wasn&#x27;t close enough for him. He shaves his head and beard daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it seems to be made for men and not woman...I must offer a mixed review. It is very smartly made with removable cutting guides...and it also has a very nice color combination to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean--just run it through the water. Nice !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle--because its cordless and charges then runs for  about 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think you should give it a try --if your just looking to neaten and  trim yourself up once in awhile...but if your a die hard shaved head guy....this may NOT be the right piece of equipment for you.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my husband, who absolutely loves it. Originally we had a wahl trimmer which he did like, but this is just so easy to use and easy to store. The fact that it has 1 adjustable attachment makes it so easy to use. It is so easy to just click it to switch lengths. Clean up is simple you don&#x27;t have to fool around with all the separate attachments and then try and fit them back into a case it is so compact. The fact that you don&#x27;t have a cord hanging in the way is also a plus and it is great for travel since you only have to bring the one piece. I would highly recommend this trimmer and it is good for beard or head or anywhere else you might need to use a trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a great for grooming all types of breards. Any lengthgreat for short stubble look. I use scissors of years. What a difference.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer so I can use it on my son in between his haircuts. It is a very good trimmer, because it fits perfectly in my hand and it has the guides on the sides so I don&#x27;t scratch him. It is also very light weight, much lighter then the older one that I have. The older one is a conair. I&#x27;ve also used this on my grandson, who is only 2 yrs. old and he doesn&#x27;t give me a problem when I have to trim his hair with it, so that is definitly a plus, because this one is much quieter then my older one.</li>
            <li> by far the best beard trimmer i&#x27;ve used. doesn&#x27;t cause any rashes, it&#x27;s very easy to use, nice slim size, and lots of power. i&#x27;ve been using mine for a just-shaved stubble type of look and so far it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> This very cool beard trimmer is perfect for my husband who doesn&#x27;t like a close shave.  He has thicker stubble and was pleased with the ease of trimming it up, and it also works to grab sporadic body hair as desired.  Six settings make it super adjustable so that anyone can find a comb that works for them.  I will say it takes hours to fully charge, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the dual powered battery, but you have to be prepared.  Other than that it&#x27;s a really decent trimmer and one he&#x27;s used steadily for months without fail.</li>
            <li> Easy to use tool for your hair and beard maintenance. Fully washable, nice design. But if I could go back I would check the pro version (Braun Cruzer 6 I think) which includes precise cut features and a case.</li>
            <li> One - I didn&#x27;t think this trimmer could match my old Panasonic that finally quit on me after many years.  Two - the somewhat uneven ratings did give me pause.  Three - This Braun trimmer operates a somewhat slower speed than did my Panasonic.  Nonetheless, the Braun has proven to be very satisfactory for both cutting down my dense beard and trimming my mustache.  A nice ergonomic feel, a beard length adjustment mechanism that stays where I set it and a handy push-button on-off switch on the middle of the handle cap off the review.</li>
            <li> I detest shaving.  I find it extremely uncomfortable to run a blade across my face, and conventional shaving leaves my skin chafed, regardless of whether I apply moisturizer afterward.  Enter the Braun Cruzer 5 beard trimmer.  It&#x27;s incredibly comfortable; you can&#x27;t even feel it doing its work!  I now use my trimmer two to three times a week, on the 1mm setting, and shave with a razor blade only when absolutely necessary.  Pure bliss!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a a battery powered shaver that had gotten broken.  I thought it would function as a shaver and a trimmer as had the defunct shaver/trimmer, but alas it is only a trimmer, which cuts to stubble length at the lowest setting.  Still, it is an excellent beard trimmer, so I kept it.  After all, i do have a beard, and it occasionally needs trimming.  I use it on Christmas morning before many visits, and it trims beautifully.  Not only that but the trimming height stays where you set it, which the old shaver/trimmer did not, which could be humiliating.  I bought a braun battery operated shaver to replace the old shaver, so now I have a shaver and a trimmer.  Another thing to note is that the trimmer has an internal battery, so i need to carry the small charger when i travel.  My shaver uses readily replaceable batteries, which is what i wanted in the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is THEE head trimmer!  Note I&#x27;ve not used this as a beard trimmer as I don&#x27;t have a beard (no facial hair at work).  So my review aims at the hair aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this hair trimmer is most likely a better version than your barber, person who does your hair uses. It&#x27;s cordless, and instead of the plastic clips they keep changing (#1, #2, #3, etc)its either a beard clip or hair clip.  Then you move the desired length via centimeters along side the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With anything new, take off less hair to begin with then more until desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is good.  I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month, so I cannot give a long term review for the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean. I&#x27;ve only had to blow out excess hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging is anywhere 6-8 hours and you get many shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver.  Try it out.</li>
            <li> Braun for me, is the epitomy of style and this handy beard and hair trimmer is typical of the thought and care Braun put into their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style, in of itself, is insufficient for a product, it must be up to the task it was designed for and so it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research work on this product through growing a beard and, a longer process, growing out my hair, something I had not done for some years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I get to the results may I just say a few words about the ease of use and cleaning for this product. As I said initially, I have always felt that Braun is the epitomy of style. This style is substantive however. The basic unit is a small electric razor which fits comfortably into the palm of the hand and seems to me to be very ergonomic. The removable heads, for beard and heair trimming, are easily removable but once fitted are steady and secure. They are easily cleaned with a small brush to remove small pieces of hair. The chatrge, at 30 minutes or so, is ample for most jobs it will encounter and the unit itself is light and easily stored in a toiletries bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it easy and simple to use on my beard and I experimented with various lengths and always achieved outstanding results. The trimming was even and the result was very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as hair goes, I would have to say at the outset, that although the Cruzer is capable of trimming long hair, it is not really the task it was designed for. I used it to trim my lengthy locks but it required more than I charge and although the result was very sharp and crisp, the unit performed better at the shorter lengths than at the longer. Since that time I have used my cruzer on a regular basis to keep my hair neat and even and it has performed admirably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would say that this is extremely good value for money and is an ideal addition to a man&#x27;s accessories.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is solid, well built, battery works fine, as does the trimmer. The only issue i find is that the lowest 1mm setting still seems like it is trimming it a little longer then that and it can be hard to get an even shave sometimes.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this handy little hair and beard trimmer.  It&#x27;s small, lightweight and cordless and comes with one adjustable attachment for length.  The clean-up is easy because it&#x27;s waterproof and you can just run it under the faucet when you&#x27;re finished using it.  He uses it mostly as a trimmer between haircuts and for his sideburns and says that it works great.  I like that it&#x27;s not too noisy but the motor seems adequately strong.  He hasn&#x27;t nicked himself with it yet and says that it seems pretty safe in that respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes up to 8 hours to charge which is a little long, but a charge lasts for about 40 minutes.  There is no battery light but he generally charges it when he finishes using it so it&#x27;s always charged up and ready.  Because of it&#x27;s convenient size and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of attachments, it&#x27;s a great trimmer to take along when you travel.</li>
            <li> I bought shaver 6 months back to replace another Braun I had for several years. Unfortunately, I have been very disappointed. While it is a nice compact size and good attachments, the shaver is too under-powered. Keeping a &#x27;designer stubble&#x27; (number one) requires 4-5+ passes in every place to get an even cut. I would suggest getting something a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> I truly loved the simplicity &amp; efficiency of Braun Cruzer. It was very easy to operate &amp; the trimming &amp; hair cut was perfect.</li>
            <li> Beware beard enthusiasts!&lt;br /&gt;I have worn a beard for several years.  I have used my Norelco g380 (or whatever it is) at least once a week for years to trim my beard.  I decided a new trimmer would probably trim faster and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item because of the good reviews, but it does not cut my beard nearly as well as my 5-year-old trimmer.  It misses multiple random hairs despite going over them many times.  This leaves many longer hairs sticking out of my face awkwardly among a short beard. I like to take off the guard to clean up my neck, but even this does not cut hairs as well as my older trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This is just a cheap product that does not cut hair well.  My Norelco, which has been used weekly without proper oil cleaning for years, is still my best option.&lt;br /&gt;One star for the neat color.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works but it does not have enough power to trim face hairs in one pass. I bought this yesterday and tried it after a full charge and while still plugged in to trim my beard which had about one week of growth. I had to do several passes to trim the hairs even though I was not using the trim guard and was cutting directly on my face. My old trimmer, which was made by Philips (and which is no longer made) and is 15 years old, still cuts better despite being a little dull.</li>
            <li> The trimmer provides a good range.  The trimmer is light and easy to use.  My hair is not thick so I am sure it easier for the trimmer to cut through it. It is also not wide so if you are trimming your head it will take longer then normal. An included attachment allows to keep better length on your head up to 20mm (around 3/4\\&quot;) Being cordless makes it convenient to get close to the mirror it ensure proper cutting. You can also trim other areas but it does not give a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is easy, run under some water. The trimmer is sealed so no water should get into the trimmer. The trimmer is not overpriced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this trimmer to friends and family</li>
            <li> This thing is too cool. I have used an old Wahl to cut my own hair for over 20 years. It is a heavy, corded monster with 5 different attachments for cutting different lengths of hair. It cannot get wet and has to be oiled after every use to keep the blades from sticking together. The Wahl and it&#x27;s many attachments fills my little travel bag- a big jumble of things to dig through when it&#x27;s time to cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comes the cordless, rechargeable Cruzer 5... First of all, this thing is sleek and sexy. It is the epitome of excellent design. Perhaps the designer once worked for Apple. It&#x27;s not only beautiful to look at and hold, but it&#x27;s a masterpiece of ergonomics. It fits in the hand nicely, it is very simple, with an easy on/off button placed perfectly, and a single (not 5) attachment that easily slides up or down to adjust for cutting length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this for a beard (for I have none) but it takes nothing more than a little pinch of the sides to remove the hair cutting piece with the beard trimming piece. And once on, it has the same wonderful sliding adjustment feature to get your beard exactly the way you like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cruzer 5 comes with a little bottle of oil for the blades (just as the Wahl did) but unlike the Wahl, you don&#x27;t have to break down the trimmer to oil it. Even better (MUCH better) is you can simply run the trimmer blades under the faucet for a quick wash and you&#x27;re done! That would ruin the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the Cruzer, being a beardless man, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to really use this. I was going to give it as a gift to a bearded friend and have him review the product. Once I received it, I realized that it was a fully functional hair cutter/trimmer. Being my own barber, I was excited to try it out on my own head. I was so completely thrilled by the quality and simplicity of using it. I cut my hair from front to back, side to side, using the slider to get the lengths just right; it was quick and it looked great (if I don&#x27;t mind saying so myself)! I swear, I literally threw my 20 year old Wahl in the trash can (I&#x27;m not wasteful but who really wants someone&#x27;s 20 year old hair trimmer?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rarely 5-star happy with most products but the Cruzer earns every star. Cruzer 5 is a perfect name for this work of art. And just so you know that I&#x27;m not some shill for Braun (though I won&#x27;t deny I usually love their products), the Cruzer package has 1 serious flaw- it doesn&#x27;t come with a case. Apparently, you have to get the Cruzer 6 if you want to store your trimmer and it&#x27;s cord, oil, brush, and the other attachment. This ticked me off. Since I threw out the 10 piece Wahl set, I used the old case for my Cruzer and it&#x27;s fewer parts. So I got over my frustration quickly. But I do think this is a valid criticism and potential buyers should be aware of this major oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this thing is perfect for what it does.o myself)!

            <li> As I slouch into my mid-thirties, I&#x27;ve grown and kept a beard three different times in my adult life. The first time was a disaster--it didn&#x27;t look good, and I didn&#x27;t have the right tools to keep it under control. The second time was better, but the trimmer I had at the time--which had to be plugged in to use it--still didn&#x27;t give me the level of precision I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around I have the Cruzer 5 and it&#x27;s entirely possible it&#x27;s for keeps. (The beard, that is--I&#x27;m keeping the trimmer either way for my sideburns, as it does nice touch-up work.) I use it every morning to keep my beard exactly the length I want it. It takes a couple passes to be sure I&#x27;ve got everything the way I want it, but the Cruzer is quiet and gentle--whereas other trimmers I&#x27;ve used have been loud and apt to poke me with their guides. The first two times I grew a beard everyone told me to shave it off; this time, everyone says I should keep it. A sign of the times? Perhaps. Still, this trimmer is definitely recommended without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Nice little cutter if you want the stuble look, but no option for close cut. Wish it had that for around the edges, neck, etc.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in February but did not use it until about April. The product seemed to have everything I wanted and I was particularly pleased with the locking adjustable trimmer attachments.  I used the Cruzer once a week to keep my hair and beard trimmed. I think I had about four trims (or four weeks) when it simply stopped working mid-shave. I thought that by spending a bit more I would own a better and more durable product. Apparently, a wrong assumption.</li>
            <li> This product is the most limp-dick piece of consumer crap that i&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of believing in. Battery life is equivalent to that of a bot-fly. After ~1 year the flimsy plastic header broke, and i discovered that for the price of a new header i could practically replace the unit. Guess that&#x27;s a good indicator of the worth of this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is to make a product that won&#x27;t last too long (planned obselesence). Braun nails it with this product. Weak ass motor powered by a wimpy battery. Try making a trimmer with a cord that can power a motor that will rip you a new one (like real men use).</li>
            <li> Did not last for long.</li>
            <li> I got this to have in the house when my son comes home weekends from New York City where he works as a game designer.    He is allowed to be casual at work: wears shorts, t-shirts, sandals, and doesn&#x27;t have to be clean-shaven.  He loves this beard cruzer--it trims his facial hair nicely at whatever length he wants. He said it sometimes takes more than one pass over his face but that&#x27;s fine with him.  He likes the feel of it, ease of it and is so enthusiastic about it, he took it back to his apartment in Manhattan to replace the one he was using.</li>
            <li> If you are searching for a decent edger that also offers a great trim then the Braun Beard Trimmer is the one you have been searching for. It has enough power to make it perfect for personal use that is not overly complex. With only 2 attachments it is easy to use and just about anyone could do it. Once you are done using it you can use the brush to clean it and then easily place it back in the case it comes with for easy traveling. It can also be used with water, which allows you to easily clean it. Overall a great product I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer - compact package, easy to clean and use. Nice to see Braun still coming out with quality stuff. Battery life is also very good. Very satisfied and highly recommended at this price point.</li>
            <li> The battery starts to lag during a single shave. Pathetic!</li>
            <li> This was an interesting dichotomy. It is very well made, but the design doesn&#x27;t do the job. Had to &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; it all over my goatee to get a so-so even cut. Not useful at all as an edger.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent beard trimmer.  If you are someone who has a beard, or shaves your head close, this is a great place to start when thinking about a trimmer.   It is a little pricey, but it functions as well as any other trimmer that I have ever used.  The adjustable head is very helpful (instead of the multitude of attachments which are either the wrong size, or get lost).  Has a good battery life, and very useful for all your trimming needs.</li>
            <li> I had recently broken my trimmer and was shopping for a new one when I saw this one. It&#x27;s certainly a step up from my older one. It has several nice features. First, this trimmer has an easily adjustable head that you can adjust for several lengths. I usually use the closest trim, but the other settings work reliable. Second, it charges quickly and can be removed from the cord, making the whole process more convenient. Finally, the trimmer is fairly quiet - you can even shave when your spouse is sleeping. Definitely recommended if you&#x27;re in the market for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, but does not have all of the settings of other shavers.  I has 1, 3, 5...etc.  It does not have 2, 4...etc.  This is a pain for us since we use the 2 on all other shavers.  It also does not give a as tight and smooth a cut as others.  There are always stray long hairs that we find later.  Not the best shaver ever!!</li>
            <li> I am not too certain what to make of these trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see how the clippers and attachments are suppose to make trimming easier or more precise.  Removing the trimmers to clean the blades are not as intuitive as you might think.  To adjust the length, you would use your thumb.  However, to remove the guard, you have to grip the sides instead of continue to press out with your thumb.  Just very odd compared to some of the other trimmers I have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But trimmers are not why I would rate this product low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are not not very sharp.  After about four users, it pulls on my beard every single time.  Since the blades are not that sharp, I have to finish the job with another set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery life is not that great.  If I wanted to trim, I have to remember to plug it in.  Otherwise, the battery does not keep a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a well-bearded man whose woman likes the beard to be kept neat, I could not recommend these trimmers to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a beard (I don&#x27;t think I can even grow one), but this is useful for me to trim it down to amount to even things and make it look like it is being taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this first also to trim it to a thin amount, right before using a razor to shave, makes it less painful for a clean shave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Can clean easily under water&lt;br /&gt;- Not just for your facial hair, but also can be used for your head&lt;br /&gt;- Cut to as thin as 1mm</li>
            <li> i HAVE USED BEARD TRIMMERS FOR OVER 35 YEARS ...THIS ONE IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENTS. THE TOUTED TWO BATTERY HIGH TORQUE SYSTEM DOES NOT CONSISTENTLY GIVE A STEADY CLIPPING SPEED;    I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING CLOSE TO A 40 MINUTE RUN TIME (CLOSER TO 10 MINUTES BEFORE A NOTICEABLE DROP IN SPEED);    I MISTAKENLY BELIEVED THE BRAUN WEBSITE WITH RESPECT TO THE CHARGING TIME.    SEE: [...]l WHICH STATES THAT BOTH THE MODEL 5 AND 6 HAVE A ONE HOUR CHARGING TIME. THE AMAZON DESCRIPTION CORRECTLY DESCRIBES THE 5&#x27;s CHARGING TIME AS 8 HOURS.    BRAUN CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS NOT VERY HELPFUL. THE FIRST REP CLEARLY MISREAD MY COMPLAINT AND GAVE AN INCORRECT ANSWER BECAUSE OF IT. THE SECOND REP CLAIMED THAT THE MODEL 5 WILL RECHARGE AFTER 1 HOUR FOLLOWING AN INITIAL 8 HOUR CHARGE.AMAZON AND INSTRUCTION MANUAL DISAGREES.</li>
            <li> This Braun Cruzer 5 Beard and Head Cruzer, 5 Beard and Head Trimmer (say that 3 times fast) cuts close. I was impressed. Got for a present. I am a razor guy by choice, so I can&#x27;t really complain because it really cuts pretty close and I use it to shave in areas I can&#x27;t really see.</li>
            <li> sturdy cordless trimmer. Glad that there is an adjustable guide instead of all of the attachments. I had been concerned that the guide might be a bit flimsy but after dropping it 10 or so times, its still great. Device is easy to clean as well, which for me is important.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad for Christmas. I have the same one except mine has the small detailing part. I was hessitant to buy because I got my trimmer the year before and it sucks. I must have a lemon because the motor&#x27;s rpm is very low and pulls hair out rather than cutting it sometimes. Not so with this one! I&#x27;m jealous of my dads trimmer. His hums along and you can hear the difference. This thing sounds like a helicopter engine. Trims nice and even and doesnt pull hairs out.</li>
            <li> My husband has had the same inexpensive trimmer set for ages.  He lost all of the accessories and, after hearing him complain about it when trimming his beard, I jumped at the chance to try the Braun Cruzer 5.  Instead of testing it out on my husband&#x27;s goatee, however, we first used it to give our seven year old son a mohawk (at his request, for the last day of school).  This trimmer worked very well for the job.  The wide range of lengths let us get the haircut just right, even though neither of us has ever given someone a mohawk before.  The set was easy to use and in no time at all our kid went from looking like a respectable second-grader to a budding delinquent.  Since then, my husband has used the trimmers not only to keep his goatee neat and reports that it \\&quot;works fine.\\&quot;  I guess his lack of complaint is a decent endorsement.  The only negative we found is that you have to be careful to check that the attachments are completely clicked into place.  Sometimes it can seem like they&#x27;re on all the way when they&#x27;re actually a bit off.  Otherwise, this a good set for home use.</li>
            <li> Simply put: a trimmer should make the job of trimming your hair easier, not add stress.  For whatever reason, this trimmer simply doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job very well.  I can&#x27;t point to exactly what the problem is - is it the size, angle, or position of the teeth on the comb?  Is it something with the blades on the trimmer?  I don&#x27;t know and after weeks of using it, I can only say that this unit leaves me with inconsistent trims each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trim my head near-bald about once a week, sometimes once every two weeks.  I&#x27;ve used this trimmer since I got it a month or so ago and since then, I&#x27;ve found that it leaves patches that, while trimmed, are not as well-trimmed as others, and I have to go over them again.  It will also leave streaks of trimmed hair if you&#x27;re not paying attention, which leaves me wondering if the comb-head is flexing in height as I&#x27;m trimming.  It&#x27;s unreliable and that&#x27;s worrisome for one of the most noticeable parts of your body.  Perhaps if you are using it for longer hair, where a little fluxuation in length isn&#x27;t going to be a problem, this trimmer might be fine.  But those of us who opt to take it all off, this trimmer could make us look pretty foolish.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to review this product. To the dismay of my family I needed to actually grow a short beard to be able to give the review justice. Overall I would say I&#x27;m pleased. I know my family is as well since after trying this out I shaved my beard off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a small trimmer, easy to hold and of course rechargeable. What I like about it is it can be cleaned with water which is definitely a plus. It comes with an attachable hair cutting extension and the always present handy-dandy small brush to clean the blades. Very easy to use and highly functional. Is it the greatest trimmer ever to hit the market as some seem to believe? I have no idea but it does the job adequately, what more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, a good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li> GOod  trimmer , i use to all the time still working like a charm ..  Does not get super close but enough to look good</li>
            <li> 4 years and still an amazing razor that has never failed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one of this model.  I replaced the first one because the times on the trimmer comb simultaneously crumbled off (6 between the top and bottom comb) halfway through trimming my hair.  Today, the second did the same.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacement combs under $20 - which is nearly the cost of the trimmer.  I recommend staying away, unless you plan to trim to near the skin.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well for close cropped beards/mustaches.  Rather large and only has settings for even (2, 4, 6, etc).  I&#x27;m used to using a 1 setting.  Other than that, it seems good.</li>
            <li> Had this trimmer a little over a month or so now and so far it has been extremely good. Very durable, water resistant (haven&#x27;t submerged it), and wonderfully long battery life (haven&#x27;t plugged it in in about a week and still going strong and varied amounts of usage). Feels very well made and the quick change heads feel durable and strong. For the price this is the best trimmer I have had and am hoping for a long life ahead of it. I really wish though that this came with a micro trimmer for detailing and a nose trimmer attachment, then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> if you are looking to accomplish the 2 or 3  day growth look and have a coarse beard then you will not like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful and you need to go over the same spot multiple times in order to ensure an even trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing special about this product, I actually had better results from using a regular pair of hair clippers. - Strike One !</li>
            <li> This trimmer does the trick. I bought this to replace an older Braun that stopped charging (that one lasted 3 years). It holds charge for a good amount of time and the charging cord is coiled so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled as badly as the cheap cords most trimers I&#x27;ve used in the past do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning though, this thing vibrates quite a bit. That might be a turn-off for some. Also I would have liked more finesse in length adjustments. It only lets you set length in odd-number increments (1mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, etc). That&#x27;s 2mm difference between each setting. That is fine and all but apparently my previous trimmer worked at 4mm which is a length I like to keep my beard. 3mm is shorter than I&#x27;m used to and 5mm is too long. I&#x27;ll adjust, it&#x27;s just something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> I know there are newer or better models of the Cruzer out there, but this was the cheapest and gets me what I need.  I like the design. I&#x27;m constantly clipping my head and I like the the way the clip works it catches the hair so I&#x27;m not making a mess in my bathroom. I like the range of adjustable lengths.  I with there was a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; in between 1 and 3 is probably my only complaint. I like the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look and the 3 is still a tad too long for that and the 1, just a tad short for what I would like. But I would recommend this unit, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li> This has been great for my beard over the last few years.  But when the beard guard comb broke on a recent trip, it&#x27;s impossible to buy a replacement.  I&#x27;m going to end up throwing this functioning unit into a landfill and buying another one, because Braun can&#x27;t manufacture a $5 plastic part.  Guess it&#x27;s good for Braun&#x27;s bottom line, but it&#x27;s not good business.  Braun, please build products that last for a decade, not 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-James&lt;br /&gt;Seattle, WA</li>
            <li> If the trash was not already gone, I would have fished the Remington out and tried replacing the batteries.  This Braun just does not have the same power as the Remington.  I find myself making multiple passes with the Braun.  I never had to do that with the Remington.  When it comes to cleaning, the Braun wins hands down, the fold down head is a breeze to clean.  The Braun does an OK job cutting.  No pulling, but not as fast as the Remington either.  I&#x27;ll keep this Braun and work on getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for over 50 years and in that time this has got to be the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned. This thing skips more hair than it cuts . The last one I owned was also a Braun I got over twenty years ago ,work like a charm until it got tired and died .I think I will go with a cheap WaHL what the hell if it dies I am only out a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I guess my title says it all. My son did say that the adjustable shaver part is hard&lt;br /&gt;to maneuver when working close to your face though.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time and money with this... It has no power at all! I have to pass it like 10 times in a zone to get it right</li>
            <li> trims well, but size clip not ver y good</li>
            <li> it takes me way to long to get a clean cut. about 3 or 4 runs. but i can and do use it in the shower no problem</li>
            <li> Great product you can trim while it is plugged in.  I am very pleased with the setting lengths and its consistency in maintaining a short &amp;#34;summer beard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This terrible trimmer would not hold a charge. The fittings were made of flimsy plastic. I threw it in the trash today, five months after purchase.</li>
            <li> Good solid product but not the best.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son for Christmas so he would stop taking my electric razor and not bringing it back. Price was good, shipping was quick, one less thing annoying me. Total win.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun Cruzer 5 Beard and Head trimmer back in 2010.  I use it to shave my head and do so weekly.  It has worked awesome for 4 years and now it is 2014 and the blade has started to dull and I am back to buy another.  The battery still works great.  I am back to buy another one since a $25 purchase of this item for 4 years has been amazing. I used to pay $20 a month for a hair cut.</li>
            <li> The shaver&#x27;s length adjustment piece, called the Adjustable beard comb, is easy to break and Braun will not send you a new ne under warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parts distributors wanted 25 plus shipping for a plastic piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun doesn&#x27;t stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, shortish batt. life even when charged per the instructions. Would recommend to anyone needing  such a tool</li>
            <li> After about a month or light use, it wouldn&#x27;t charge up. Doesn&#x27;t even work when plugged in to the wall.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  I used to have a Wahl, which lasted (almost) forever, and replaced it with this inexpensive, compact trimmer.  The sleek design is pretty much where its perks end.  It doesn&#x27;t trim as close.  The battery doesn&#x27;t last long.  The trimmer strength is weak.  I have to take several passes after just a couple days growth and it gets choked up.  Spend the money on a better trimmer, this one isn&#x27;t worth the aggravation.</li>
            <li> I buy everything Braun. They have excellent products and the two shavers I have from them have lasted for years. This is a great beard trimmer with many setting and crazy long battery life.</li>
            <li> Usage: Every other day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I maintain a pretty long and full beard, with that being said I use this to clean up my cheeks and trim my mustache. It is impossible to get a clean close shave with this thing. But the battery last long, and its easy to use, the guards make it easy for me not to ruin my mustache, and the ability to use it while its charging is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer. Great dial in length with the lengths that most trimmers just skip.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, its quiet and very sharp with 1-11mm settings. Easy to clean with supplied brush and the power adapter is a international one so can use it in US or any country in the world 110-240V.</li>
            <li> THis is a replacement to the original one i got. The cutting template breaks off very easily. Waste of $$$$</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cut much with the adjuster on.  without it works great.  not gona be able to shave your head with this, unless you have 3hrs to spare.  battery seems to run out quick.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years and it&#x27;s still working.  whatever</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he keeps his hair shaved.  He liked it much better than his old razor.  He liked that it charges really quickly and holds a charge for a long time, and that there are only two attachments that have multiple adjustments for length.  His last razor had about eight attachments, so two was much more convenient.  The trimmer did a good and quick job on his hair, it is well-made, and runs smoothly.  My husband also tried it on his face.  He said it did not give him a really close shave, but it did as much as he expected for an electric trimmer.  All in all, he was very happy with his new trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a sibling named Cruzer6 which has additional precision trimmer. My facial hair is quite manageable so I don&#x27;t see the point of buying a more expensive trimmer. In fact, this Cruzer5 is just right for me.    The trimmer feels just right in my hand, comfortable enough to be held on either left or right hand at different angle. It&#x27;s also pretty compact and lightweight, making it easy to pack for travel.    The two built-in rechargable battery powers the trimmer and produces low buzzing sound that doesn&#x27;t disturb your roomies when you use it in the morning.    Detachable &#x27;comb&#x27; can be removed easily so you can rinse both the comb and the trimmer under running tap water. Small brush is included in the box so you can clean even the tricky inner side and corners of the trimmer. There&#x27;s even a small bottle of mechanical oil provided in the packaging to keep the trimmer blade slick.    Overall, this is a great product to keep the facial hair (or even your hair) neat. Two combs are included for facial hair (1/3/5/7/9/11mm) and hair (10mm onwards). The battery charger operates on 110volt or 220volt so you can plug it in anywhere you travel without worry. Just don&#x27;t forget the adapter to suit the pins shape of your destination country.    As with other Braun products that I have, I would expect this trimmer to be long lasting beyond its 2-years warranty coverage period with pretty decent battery life even after years of regular usage.</li>
            <li> Returned the product.  Was ineffective/defective when trimming at a 0 length (no clip).  It took me more than 5 minutes longer to trim my beard and I still didn&#x27;t get a good trim.  I like a very short and even stubble and this trimmer just could not do it.  I have spots where the trimmer could not get close enough and my face seems patchy after spending 3x longer trimming than I did in the past with my old trimmer.  It is either defective or it is just not a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer would have gotten a four-star rating if not for the obviously cheap construction of the beard trimmer guard. Two teeth broke off within the first few months of use. I waited for more than a week for a replacement guard and, sure enough, two teeth subsequently broke again only six months later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several trimmers over the years. None have been rendered useless in less than three years, and none of them failed because of poor design. I will not buy a Braun product again.</li>
            <li> The trim length settings are not fine enough. I don&#x27;t even use the guard.&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t recharge. The cord is wound and elastic so you can&#x27;t charge it while using it, or the cord will unplug from the wall. However it must be plugged in to have minimum power necessary to operate.  So you can shave with 1 hand and hold it plugged in with the other. I had mine for 1 year. It finally died. I&#x27;ll never buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> still haven&#x27;t use it (Braun Cruzer 5 Beard Trimmer) yet.&lt;br /&gt;it is cheap. at this stage, no advise about it.</li>
            <li> The reviews of this trimmer were great, but I find that it doesn&#x27;t trim short enough.  Even on the shortest setting, it leaves my husband&#x27;s beard longer than he wants.  The blue guard is too thick for tight corners and close spaces.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t have a nose/ear attachment, so now we have two trimmers intstead of one.  It is easy to hold and is fairly quiet, but not quite what we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> Product stopped working after few months of use. The trimmer will not work with or without its charger plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable head has a weak structure and it collapses from its set position upon slightly harder pressure against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the trimmer did work, it provide a reasonable shave without pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading some of the bad reviews.  It works awesome for me.  I don&#x27;t have the thickest beard or hair though.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the Wahl I just replaced.  I use it for sideburns, mustache, and goatee trimming.</li>
            <li> I found this product great for trimming my chest and stomach. I think the beard setting works well, too, but I prefer to use a blade instead. My only complaint is that this hing does not hold charge for that long; also, it&#x27;s not as powerful as other trimmers. I think this is my favorite trimmer so far, though, so I would definitely recommend it to men who need to get ride of a no-shave November beard or even other body hair. The product does not specifically mention whether it should be used on the body, but I find it&#x27;s better than products like Phillips&#x27; Norelco Bodygroomer.</li>
            <li> very good quality. easy for use</li>
            <li> After more than 15 years ordering on Amazon, this is my first return. I live in Europe and own a Braun trimmer which I like very much. I ordered this one for the dual voltage charging, as I am often in the US and wanted one to keep in my travel bag. This one is wildly inferior to what you get in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:  120/240 volt, comfortable design&lt;br /&gt;Minus: difficult to cut beard: did not cut well, and took a long time to cut; the trim function blade was very hot (really burnt above my lip. This has never happened with my usual trimmer); it says washable, but in instructions says if you was regularly you need to apply oil (not needed if you clean with a brush. No idea how often, as instructions don&#x27;t specify, but carrying around a little bottle of oil it not my idea of &amp;#34;easy washing.&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last minus point is not a deal breaker, but for the each of the first two are.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my Phillips Norelco vacuum beard trimmer which I had used for years.  Battery on the Braun will not hold a charge unless constantly plugged in and even then you can hear the trimmer start to die out after a few minutes of use.  It&#x27;s kind of painful having this thing jam up in your beard due to lack of power from a dying battery.  Also not really happy with the range of trim lengths on the Cruzer 5.  My Phillips Norelco went up to 18mm length.  The Cruzer 5 only adjusts up to 11mm.  For the same price, I&#x27;m going back to Phillips Norelco.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer did not work. Battery would not charge despite the green light indicating it was charging. Even with charger attached &amp; green light on, the trimmer would not turn on. I have video if you require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s return policy worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed! I usually love everything Braun makes. I have used their shavers since I was old enough to shave. This product, however, if seriously flawed. Unlike my Braun shaver you need a good battery in order to shave. It does not bypass the battery when plugged in. The plastic teeth on this trimmer are also not very strong. Within a few months of use I broke off a few of the teeth ... WITH MY FACE. C-mon, that is just cheap product design. As well, just after a year ( right after the warranty ran out) the battery started to die. I know have to make sure its plugged in for a good 30 minuted before the motor works well enough to shave. Even then it only lasts a short time. The battery is not user replaceable so after one year it is ready for the trash.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT ! !!</li>
            <li> This is the very best beard shaver I have ever owned.... I knew it just had to be a Braun... All their products seem to rate # 1..............</li>
            <li> In addition to the Cruzer5 being a miserable excuse of a beard trimmer, the spacer broke after 6 months of normal use, and Braun won&#x27;t replace the part under warranty; and on top of all that, they wan&#x27;t to charge me over half the price of the trimmer for a replacement spacer. I&#x27;m going back to Norelco, Braun is all around over priced garbage.</li>
            <li> I have a cruzer 6 razor but wanted a better trimmer. This gives more teeth so slightly better beard trimming. Would still like more guides but it is my best trimmer yet. Odd that the electrical connections of the 2 products are different, I had hoped to use the Cruzer 6 stand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year now.  It has been a great tool for keeping a beard at the proper length.  The battery charge lasts longer than I could hope for.  I probably charge this less than once a month and I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all. But I have decided to keep it. The problem is it cuts my beard poorly. I have to go over it many times to get a smooth short facial beard. Not happy at all. Also I think the design stinks. Would NOT recommend this to anyone. Also it is way over priced. For the outcome of use this is not worth more than $10.00 on a good day,</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer, great price. No cons here. Use it to trim my face and body hair and it works perfect for both.</li>
            <li> I love this new trimmer and it is from Braun the only name in personal groomers. I have tried several brands but this one is by far the best groomer I have purchased to date. Quality and affordability is what I am all about and this one has it all!</li>
            <li> this is my second purchase of the same model. Made in China but quality is good. I could tell from the very detail of each corner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to if this is a good beard trimmer.  I suspect it isn&#x27;t.  I used to have a goatee that I trimmed with a Wahl and it worked well.  I purchased this, however, because it was the only trimmer I could find locally (for a decent price) that allowed me to get really close to create stubble.  The Wahl&#x27;s guard doesn&#x27;t get close enough. I suppose I could try using the blade without a guard, but I haven&#x27;t yet.  Maybe over the weekend.  I like this Braun for stubble.  I have to go over it a few times, like some of the other reviews state... but honestly, I find that with nearly any trimmer, including the Wahl I liked. Very few I have used allow a once or twice pass... so passing it a few times doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I have found this to be the closest guide and a good experience for stubble... again, can&#x27;t speak to its beard capabilities.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 0 stars.  It never performed as advertised and died within the first year. Customer service was virtually nonexistant. I&#x27;d recommend you avoid this product</li>
            <li> The trimmer is OK, I guess, for those who with a full beard. I wanted a trimmer for a daily shadow so I use it without the guard. The trimmer blades are too coarse for my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> Not enough power to get the job done .  I have purchased another brand since..  Requires 4-5 passes and is very slow compared to other brands i have used including Norelco.</li>
            <li> Like that it shave so close leaving a barely there stubble. Cango for that stubble look without looking to unkept. Good for manscaping too.</li>
            <li> I wish the trimmer cut a bit closer, but the battery has lasted quite a long time and I am fairly impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> These seemed to have plenty of power at the beginning but that quickly began to fade. After only a few dozen shaves they were difficult to use because they would struggle to trim my beard. Shop around.</li>
            <li> I had this trimmer for about a month. Just returned it to Braun. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but it just does not cut well. I have to go over my beard many many many times at all angles, and I still have to get some hairs manually with scissors afterward. Same thing when cutting hair on my head and body. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s power, as it never seems to bog down, the guides or cutting teeth just don&#x27;t grab and channel the hair in to get cut very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, the trimmer blade itself gets VERY HOT after a bit of shaving. When using it on more sensitive areas of skin, it&#x27;s down right painful if the metal touches my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, going back to my tried and true Panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li> nice product and very good price&lt;br /&gt;they only thing i didnt like in it, if u use some level of cutting the Hair will not be equal&lt;br /&gt;i dont know it is because of me or the machine&lt;br /&gt;the thing i like in it, it is washable&lt;br /&gt;bt ovel all it is good comparing the price</li>
            <li> Good build quality. I also face the issue with uneven trim and have to go over multiple times on the same area to get it trimmed evenly.</li>
            <li> The old trimmer I had finally died and I needed a replacement for occasional facial hair trimming needs. I found the Braun Cruzer 5 and it offered the adjustable setting that was the one feature I was looking for at a price that seemed about right for the amount of use it will receive.  I ordered it and found on first use, as have many other reviewers, that it is very under powered.  It will do the job eventually, but takes much longer to trim compared to the old trimmer I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the personal nature of the produce I&#x27;m not returning this, and since it would essentially cost double to try another trimmer I&#x27;ll live with it. But if you are looking for something with a good amount of power, don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  Look around for other trimmers that offer more power (based on reviews of course).  If I were to do this over, I&#x27;d try the Remington MB-200.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is great, holds a charge and works well -- but the beard attachment started to fall apart quickly and now has lost all its teeth. It went online looking for a replacement part and the only place that actually has them charges almost as much as a new razor!</li>
            <li> My old Norelco beard trimmer broke after about 10 years. I thought this looked good and it was a little cheaper; however, it&#x27;s horrible. The Cruzer has very little power and constantly sounds as if the batteries are about to die as it trims my not particularly thick beard once every 10 days. It barely holds a charge for two trims. It also, emits a horrible high pitched squeal when charging, although most folks may not hear it (my wife doesn&#x27;t). - I went out and bought another Norelco. Much better choice</li>
            <li> Braun Cruzer 5 Trimmer does a really good job of trimming mustaches and beards.  Its compact size nice and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Had the Cruzer 5 for about a month... upon looking at the product in the store it seemed like everything would be good and have all the options that I needed and more.  Not only does it not have all the options that an average person would want but it is very cheaply constructed.  Really sad that this is so bad, I do use a Braun series 5 shaver and am happy with that but it seems that the company just isn&#x27;t as good with trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues that I have include (after only using 4 - 5 times):&lt;br /&gt;1.  A high pitch noise while charging.&lt;br /&gt;2. The motor is extremely underpowered and the rotations significantly varied without the trimmer even cutting hair.  (can tell this by the sound fading in and out over a few seconds).&lt;br /&gt;3.  The trim length adjuster that attaches on the end of the device was sliding from a 5 to a 3 or 1 with very little pressure.  Basically the attachment can&#x27;t support any pressure without trying to slide to the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The trim length doesn&#x27;t even have an even setting until the hair length attachment is put on.  So basically the two attachments are for either long or short hair and depending on what you are using the device for (beard or haircut).  With the shorter version the attachment transitions from 1mm to 3mm to 5mm... etc so there is no option for cuts in-between.  The settings may work for some but really do not allow for much customization in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;5.  * I did not have to deal with Braun personally but I have read other reviews of people having significant issues with returning the device.  So I cannot vow for this issue myself but I just wanted to pass the information along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I was lucky in that I felt like I needed a trimmer immediately to replace my old one and bought it from Target.  Thank you Target for taking this back after a month and not making me deal with trying to ship it back to Braun.</li>
            <li> And then it just died on me. Doesn&#x27;t turn on or charge. Tried to deal with Braun to get it replaced but they work through third party vendors for service. Closest vendor near me is 600 miles away. Probably only strong enough to trim the hair of a preteen aka peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> This Braun trimmer is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. It lacks the power and the ability to actually trim hair. Even after six or more passes over my beard at all different angles and differing pressures, I still had untrimmed hair plus sore skin to boot. I recharged it and I tried it again the next day with the same result. I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon for a refund. I hated the fact that I had to pay to ship this piece of trash back, but those are the breaks. I&#x27;ve used various Norelco and Remington trimmers in the past with much better results. I&#x27;m currently using a Remington MB 4040 which while not perfect (4 stars out of 5) puts this Braun to shame.</li>
            <li> yes you can find cheaper but this is very good quality and they work very, very well. I had a Remington before and the Braun is much better. Also the battery lasts longer</li>
            <li> We have had the Braun since 12/12 and it has never worked well. The blades are dull, pulls the hairs  painfully instead of clipping  them like the old Braun did. This one is made in China. Despite the company claims that it works well for 7 years, you will be lucky to get 7 weeks of service out of it. Braun, since bought by Proctor &amp; Gamble, is easy to find on the Internet but their website keeps cutting you off and having you rewrite the same information over and over.  Not a consumer friendly company, nor a good beard trimmer razor. Product did not meet my expectations at all despite their past good reputation for quality products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 2 years, still it does the job like a new Cruzer.</li>
            <li> I have two main problems with the Cruzer 5. I&#x27;ve owned it for 8 months and the engine is giving out; even when plugged in it now operates below its former performance level. I also found the battery performance far below the advertisement (not that that is much of an issue for me). Second, I can&#x27;t get a close buzz on my beard. &amp;#34;1mm&amp;#34; sounds like it should be a close trim, but it comes nowhere near that. And what I get is visibly uneven. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this for my moustache and to cut my hair (buzz cut) and it works great.  Seems to have plenty of charge for any use that I have.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself it is not the worst one out there, but there are some problems. The two biggest ones I can think of are that it does not have enough power, and sometimes there is an uneven trim. I can grow a nice even beard but with an equal amount of pressure it trims unevenly.</li>
            <li> I received this today and was not expecting much after reading some of the negative reviews.  However, I found the razor to be quite nice.  It feels good in the hand, is light, has plenty of adjustment for beard length (for me anyway), and has enough power to do the job.</li>
            <li> This is a very good trimmer. I only wish it came with a dock instead of just a plug/wire for recharging.</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews for anything, but this trimmer is so bad that I had to! I finally decided to replace my 5 year old Wahl trimmer that I spent $12 on years ago, and chose the Braun Cruzer 5....BAD CHOICE! I justused it to trim my beard after receiveing it yesterday and this thing is TRASH.  Doesnt trim well at all, left lots of random hairs, and I had to go back over my beard with my old trimmer to make sure I got them all.  If youre at all particular about your beard, this IS NOT the trimmer for you.  Buy the basic WaHL $12-$15 trimmer and save yourself the money!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face to get a stubble every 3 days or so. It works great, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it charging or running out of juice in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on various other parts of my body to trim things up. I&#x27;ve spent close to $400 on various razors over the years. This thing does a good job, cuts evenly, and costs a fraction of all the others. It definitely wins in the bang for the buck department. I bought a second one for my gf&#x27;s house, that one works great also.</li>
            <li> Good looks is about all this shaver has going for itself. This shaver is severely under powered. Pulling out facial hair is not a pleasant feeling when the shaver stalls in the middle of a pass. My 10 year old vintage backup shaver has about 6 times the power and battery life. Well, &#x27;I guess they don&#x27;t make em like they used to&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of junk.  I&#x27;ve owned other Braun trimmers and have always really like them but this Cruzer 5 is terrible.  It takes several passes to get a good shave, has an extremely short battery life, and is generally under powered.</li>
            <li> I ordered this when my son was travelling to NZ. Got it on time as advertized and in great condition.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer that can be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge for a good while and is small enough to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> This trimmer turned out to be better than expected--namely in battery life.  The battery seems to last longer than the manual would lead you to believe and, in my opinion, a much better value than the Cruzer 6.  I&#x27;m also a fan of Braun ergonomics.  They design products that are comfortable and easy to use.  The locking mechanism on the removable &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; is top notch and I have no fear that when I set it to 5mm it&#x27;ll change to 3mm during a trim, leaving my beard in shambles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this over 6 months ago and have been using it everyday. Just love it. Gets the job done for a great price. THANKS!</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else has had this problem but the battery stopped holding a charge for more than 10 minutes worth of time.  Not sure why.  It was working pretty well until this.  So take it into consideration.</li>
            <li> Excellent razer. Very fast shipper. I would recommend this razer to family and friend&#x27;s. I bought one for myslef and brother.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I only use this for my beard and have not used it on my head. I&#x27;ve tried other trimmers for around this price range and have found this one to be of the best value. The guard is very innovative and locks securely into place. The guard is durable and strong (that was my problem with my previous trimmer; one day the guard just broke in half!). It also shaves smoothly without catching hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life isn&#x27;t very long, I think it&#x27;s like 40 or 45 minutes after an eight hour charge. I believe it also recommends that you not shave with it while it&#x27;s plugged in so you have to make sure that it has enough charge for the day you plan on trimming. This problem can be solved, however, by upgrading to the Cruzer 6 which charges a lot quicker (an hour, I think).&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to take more than one pass to get all of my beard the same length. I&#x27;m not sure if this is typical for this price range, but it does take more than one pass. That being said, it really doesn&#x27;t add too much more time to shaving.</li>
            <li> good&lt;br /&gt;o you can use it with cord, helps when battery is down&lt;br /&gt;o fits well in hand&lt;br /&gt;o works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;watch&lt;br /&gt;o not powerful, takes time to trim&lt;br /&gt;o won&#x27;t hold the hair as you cut, need to clean afterwards</li>
            <li> Has a great shape with many features to it&lt;br /&gt;Would highly  recommend the shaver for any man&lt;br /&gt;Braun has never let me down with their products</li>
            <li> Brought for my young adult, bearded son. He loves the product and is happy in can be used for the head if desired.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and has since been working well.  No issues to date. The adjustable grooming attachments are convenient versus the kits that come with a dozen separate attachments.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor from a local store and it is terrible. I wish I could give it 0 Stars but I already gave it 1. When I went to trim my butt hair the razor was simply under powered and could not cut through the jungle of hair that covers my nether regions. The guards are not worth anything as you cannot cut all of your posterior hairs to an even length. The top half was short while the pesky curlier hairs towards the south stayed long and looked as if the razor had no effect on them. You would think for the MSRP that Braun is asking for you would get a quality razor fit for even the curliest and thickest of hair, no matter where it lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it sucks at cutting beard hair.</li>
            <li> Looks cool,  feels good in hand but does a horrible job.  After 10 minutes of shaving, my beard looks even more unruly then before I started trimming.  It cuts very unevenly and requires too many passes to get the job even half way decently done.  No thanks.</li>
            <li> Uneven cut. Depth gauge broke from cutting hair. Poorly designed. Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product and I am more than satisfied than my previous Norelco, but I lost the charger and could not find it anywhere, Can anybody please suggest me something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> not satisfied with the product. It doesn&#x27;t trim close enough to shape beard like it claims. Also it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
            <li> I have an old trimmer that use s attached guides that does a perfect job for my bard.  I find that these newer design with adjustable guides are useless.  From the picture it seemed that this model would be different, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is commpletely useless.  It barely cuts. Several passes over the same area are necissary to make any progress.  My 15 yr old Norelco still worked 5 times better.  The depth comb is very loose thus not very effective.  If you buy one of these you will have a $35.00 paper weight.  Customer service is no help.</li>
            <li> I had gotten one of these for my National Guard Son My Baby but someone in his unit needed it more he loved it when he got it for his birthday</li>
            <li> I have extremely short hair and this thing cannot handle giving me a buzz cut without clogging up and pulling my hair after just a few seconds of cutting.  I constantly have to keep taking the attachment off and clearing the blades manually.  Terrible product considering what it costs.  Back to my trusty Wahl trimmers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really surprising that they made a beard trimmer with such large comb length increments. It&#x27;s either going to be too short (i.e. smallest setting) or too long for most of you (i.e. the first increment in the comb is way too long). Too bad it didn&#x27;t work out, I really wanted to like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to shave private parts because manual razors cause bumping.  It is excellent! It doesn&#x27;t shave so close to irritate; its water proof for in the shower use and its cordless. I love it.</li>
            <li> good trimmer especially for the money</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews 11 months ago, I chose this one because I was impressed about claims about battery/motor strength and about the adjustable length attachment. The latter works okay, but if the shaver was dropped or mishandled, it would likely break. My big beef is the battery run time was never more than a couple of minutes, so I got in the habit of leaving it plugged in between shaves so I could get a complete shave, and when that didn&#x27;t work,I shaved with the cord plugged in. That was irritating because the coiled word is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday the thing just stopped abruptly when it was doing okay...no gradual winding down. I popped the cutting head and cleaned out the hair and oiled the blades, which seemed to be dry. The shaver then took right off, I was momentarily jubilant until I got to my sink and mirror and it died abruptly again, this time for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is likely an electrical flaw. I may have killed it by leaving it plugged in, contrary to instructions about how you are supposed to let it discharge fully between charges....but that is not realistic. Charging systems need to cope with how people actually behave. A stand wit trickle charger is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. In good condition, looks like one LED light not functioning. Close shaves not possible with this trimmer. I am using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I use this machine to be working fine and you are advised to..ya uje ispolzivuyu mashinku normalno rabotaet,domashnom uslovie..ya rad cto pokupal</li>
            <li> Ive got a nice beard going now because of this product! it trims nicely and easy to use anywhere on your body. Battery lasts long enough to do what you need it to. First time i used it i had a messy beard and thick.. took some time to get it the length i wanted but for the money its a great buy and cheaper then it was at target by like $20 It does the job and does it right and fast and simple. Highly recommend if you dont want to spend a bunch of money. Also fits nicely into my hand and a breeze to clean!</li>
            <li> Garbage trimmer. I bought it at Target a few months ago and have regretted throwing the box away. I should have saved the box and thrown the trimmer. The battery is awful and the blade speed is permanently set on Level Rip-the-whisker-dont-cut. Save your money! Buy a Wahl.</li>
            <li> **Update: I did contact Braun to return this product. They initially sent me a replacement head (for the wrong model, the CruZer 1 which has a completely different design) and then agreed to take it back. They sent me a gift card for the purchase amount as well as reimbursement for the return shipping. I am pleased with Braun&#x27;s service, even though their initial attempt to solve the issue failed.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally shopping for a competitor model, but because this was less money and had good reviews, I decided to buy it. It was a mistake, because this is a piece of garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failure #1 - The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that you can only choose odd-number settings on the adjustable trimmer head attachment (1mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, 9mm and 11mm). (I won&#x27;t be using the larger one, which only allows for even-number lengths of 10mm-20mm). For those of us who might like other lengths, it&#x27;s not clear in the description (which simply says 1-11mm) that the trimmer isn&#x27;t capable of doing, say, 2mm. I found this to be borderline deceptive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failure #2 - The adjustable trimmer head clicks into place, but still wiggles around. If you&#x27;re holding it with your hand in the way the average user might hold it, your fingers might be touching it and you&#x27;ll give yourself an uneven cut. When I used it set at 1mm, I could actually double the gap between the blades and the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failure #3 - And also the biggest failure - the trimmer leaves tons of uncut hairs, evenly distributed, on both my face and head - even after multiple passes. This is the trimmer&#x27;s primary job - and it sucks at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have finer hair that sticks straight out of your head, only need odd-number trim lengths and can be totally conscious of the way you&#x27;re holding the trimmer the entire time you&#x27;re using it, it&#x27;ll do the job. Spend a little more and get the Conair iStubble. I&#x27;ve used my friends&#x27; and it performed flawlessly, with a wide range of adjustment between.4mm - 5mm, a sturdy trimmer head and no missed hairs at all.</li>
            <li> I got this on sale for $25 and it is really good for that price point, I can&#x27;t see paying more than $30 for it</li>
            <li> Not the most powerful trimmer available, but for the price and functionality it&#x27;s a great product and serves its purpose well.</li>
            <li> So far in my life i&#x27;ve had 3 beard trimmers. this is by far the best. super easy to clean, easily surpasses my last remington. the cut is very precise and has a great feel on your face. i definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was once a teenager who thought a little bit of fluff was a beard.  This would have been up to the job of letting me imagine I was a man.  I might have even given it a 5 star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the tines on the comb broke almost immediately.  The power is weak.  It pinches and cuts the skin.  The battery gives nowhere near the life they claim it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it after a few months and went back to the dying blunt decade+ old Norelco I bought this to replace.</li>
            <li> Works well, just mnake sure to take care of those attachments! i ostepped on one of mine and it broke fairly easily. I swear im not fat.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a beard and head trimmer. What a disappointment. Close shave without an attachment? Not even. With attachment? The performance goes down from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming your head is a whole new story of misery. Imagine a clipper that shreds instead of cuts. And in small portions at that. It will turn a normal haircut. Best way to describe the hair cut experience is cousin itt being sucked into a jet turbine and turned into a powdered mist of hair. Thats your scalp. The hair is shredded into such a fine cloud, its easily inhaled during your miserable trim irratating your throat, sinuses and lungs. And it takes upwards of 20 passes in 1 spot to even start to resemble an even shave. Your better off buying dull rusty sheep shears. Im writing this review while i let the trimmer recharged for round 2 of misery and my hair to dry after having to shower to remove the very fine hair clippings that invade every pour and orfice of my body. Ive been through less invasive dust storms. If you have an inlaw you hate, a roomate you despise, or a barber you want to play a prank on, this is the best cruel gift for them to cut their hair with.</li>
            <li> Trust the other bad reviews, this thing is garbage.  I&#x27;ve given up and am going to go buy something else, and it won&#x27;t be a Braun.  It takes me so long to trim my beard in the morning it sort of boggles my mind, and when I&#x27;ve finally given up there are still loads of patchy hairs all over.  It&#x27;s essentially impossible to use as it just doesn&#x27;t have the power to uh...cut hair.  Not sure what it&#x27;s intended purpose is other than to add another electronic item to the trash pile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bothered to review anything in my life, but damn i get tired of these products which don&#x27;t even perform the simple function for which they are sold.  What is the point of a shaver that can&#x27;t actually shave hair?  It&#x27;s essentially the same as if they sent an empty box with a note that said &amp;#34;gotcha!&amp;#34;.</li>
