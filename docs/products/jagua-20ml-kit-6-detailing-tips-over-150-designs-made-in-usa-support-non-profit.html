            <li>The transparent paper doesnt work good</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This stuff is so much better than henna!</li>
            <li>Good luck &amp; enjoy</li>
            <li>but i wish my skin would hold it longer :p other than that it was,and still is, perfect for my experiment.</li>
            <li>but if u can draw free handed then you are good to go, u just have to buy better transparent paper.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It was not horrible but not what I thought or wanted.</li>
            <li>Was Ok, but transferred on skin while kids slept</li>
            <li>Make sure to really think about what you want to put and where you want to put it.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Works great, has enough gel to do several tattoos.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li>Product works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Its a really pretty black/blue color.</li>
            <li>and i have to leave it on for on hour then gently wash it off!</li>
            <li>The kit looked nice but came with no instructions other than how to use the transfer paper(which kinda sucked).</li>
            <li>Amazing....lasts as long as henna but smells better.</li>
            <li>We let it sit for over an hour and after peeling it off, there was absolutely nothing on the skin.</li>
            <li>Its so much easier to work with then the powdered henna paste.</li>
            <li>Its very liquidy opposed to a thicker texture.</li>
            <li>and when i got henna done they said i cant move much</li>
            <li>The only fault i found with this product was that it faded quickly.</li>
            <li>Right next to that, the character for father 父 is listed with the translation &amp;#34;sunset.&amp;#34;  When someone is tattooing something on their bodies (for whatever length of time), egregious errors like this are really unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>once it dries its a bright blue color not very authentic at all!</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>Kind of assumed this would be dark blue...</li>
            <li>More of a mixed blue/black color than pure black (which is fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way for sure!</li>
            <li>Im going to keep on using the jagua on my tattoo spot until I&#x27;m completely convinced its were</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit for my 14 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Though it is a little more expensive but it lasts longer, better color and easier to detail the tattoos.</li>
            <li>It was very hard to do detailed work.</li>

            <li> It was very hard to do detailed work.</li>
            <li> Now that might just be my skin, idk maybe I&#x27;m a fast skin shedder (Im extremely pale</li>
            <li> This does not tell me how long to leave it on or what im suposed to do with the product after it is applied to my skin and how am i suposed to defrost it when i want to use it again?</li>
            <li> I left the gel on for 6 hours then lightly washed my hands with cold water.</li>
            <li> The kit that I received did not live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> But none the less that tattoo only stayed dark on my skin for a few days before it began rapidly fading with every night of sleep, shower, and hand wash.</li>
            <li> Just follow the care instructions and the tattoo will last for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t bad, but nothing like the original stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy if you don&#x27;t let it sit and dry.</li>
            <li> so I wiped it off before it dried.</li>
            <li> I must be doing something wrong cause mine turned out weird clean lines</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller about my disappointment in hopes they will refund my money or give me store credit, I have yet to hear back from them.</li>
            <li> not sure if I did something wrong, or if I missed a step or something</li>
            <li> And very very very hard to take off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Giving this 3 stars because of the TERRIBLE translations of the Chinese characters they provide as stencils.  </li>
            <li> Complicated, no instructions either</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s so pretty. But I used it and messed up so I wiped it off before it dried. I woke up the next day &amp; it reappeared on my skin. It&#x27;s very messy if you don&#x27;t let it sit and dry. And very very very hard to take off. Soap and water does not do do he trick. The paper doesn&#x27;t work and the designs are way to big. Make sure to really think about what you want to put and where you want to put it. If not your stuck until who knows when. Good luck &amp; enjoy</li>
            <li> Product works pretty well.  More of a mixed blue/black color than pure black (which is fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving this 3 stars because of the TERRIBLE translations of the Chinese characters they provide as stencils.  For example, the Chinese character for man 男 is shown with the translation &amp;#34;Sunrise.&amp;#34;  Right next to that, the character for father 父 is listed with the translation &amp;#34;sunset.&amp;#34;  When someone is tattooing something on their bodies (for whatever length of time), egregious errors like this are really unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy the product, don&#x27;t use the stencils.</li>
            <li> Amazing....lasts as long as henna but smells better.</li>
            <li> Just tried it, left it on for an hour and when I rinsed my hand, everything washed off, there wasn&#x27;t anything left... not sure if I did something wrong, or if I missed a step or something but it didn&#x27;t work at all? Anyone know what to do??</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I was very disappointed with this product. I left the gel on for 6 hours then lightly washed my hands with cold water. When I washed the gel off there was literally nothing left on my skin, no color, no dye, no anything! I did as directed and left the gel on longer than suggested. I contacted the seller about my disappointment in hopes they will refund my money or give me store credit, I have yet to hear back from them. We will see I guess. Will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The kit looked nice but came with no instructions other than how to use the transfer paper(which kinda sucked). We let it sit for over an hour and after peeling it off, there was absolutely nothing on the skin. Really disappointed. Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great price for quality product!</li>
            <li> The kit was kool cant get the transfer paper to wrk right but oh well</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Looks just like photos. I will order again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> The transparent paper doesnt work good but if u can draw free handed then you are good to go, u just have to buy better transparent paper.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Its so much easier to work with then the powdered henna paste. A little goes a long way for sure! I think the only issue I had was the tattoo design booklet some of the chinese characters weren&#x27;t the actual meanings. Its a really pretty black/blue color. Will defiantly buy again!</li>
            <li> Yes on time and it was great</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t bad, but nothing like the original stuff. Its very liquidy opposed to a thicker texture. It was not horrible but not what I thought or wanted.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with changing my mind a lot! Im planning on getting a permanent tattoo soon and before i did the deed i wanted to see how i felt about my chosen tattoo spot. Happy i did this considering i changed my mind on placement like 5 times! Im going to keep on using the jagua on my tattoo spot until I&#x27;m completely convinced its were i want my permanent tattoo. The only fault i found with this product was that it faded quickly. Now that might just be my skin, idk maybe I&#x27;m a fast skin shedder (Im extremely pale so maybe that had something to do with it?). But none the less that tattoo only stayed dark on my skin for a few days before it began rapidly fading with every night of sleep, shower, and hand wash. I can retrace it over but i wish my skin would hold it longer :p other than that it was,and still is, perfect for my experiment.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so much better than henna! Though it is a little more expensive but it lasts longer, better color and easier to detail the tattoos. Mine lasted longer than 2 weeks. My husband went on a drawing spree and my daughter was tattooed everywhere!</li>
            <li> I must be doing something wrong cause mine turned out weird clean lines but i think u have to wash it off after cause i got henna done last week then i bought this kit and when i got henna done they said i cant move much and i have to leave it on for on hour then gently wash it off! This does not tell me how long to leave it on or what im suposed to do with the product after it is applied to my skin and how am i suposed to defrost it when i want to use it again?</li>
            <li> Was Ok, but transferred on skin while kids slept</li>
            <li> Kind of assumed this would be dark blue...once it dries its a bright blue color not very authentic at all!</li>
            <li> Works great, has enough gel to do several tattoos. I like that it includes ink transfer paper, multiple design tips, and  pre made designs to choose from. Just follow the care instructions and the tattoo will last for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The kit that I received did not live up to my expectations. It was very hard to do detailed work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for my 14 year old granddaughter. She loves it and has created some beautiful tattoos using the designs. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Complicated, no instructions either</li>
