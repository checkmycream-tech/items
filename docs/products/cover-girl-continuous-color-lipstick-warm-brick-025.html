            <li>Glad to discover</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still available!</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite lipstick colors.</li>
            <li>Glad I can still buy it at Amazon</li>
            <li>I wear it but it could be better.</li>
            <li>This was also really cheap because if I buy it at Walgreen  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Product is as advertised, and is genuine.</li>
            <li>Smooth application as well.</li>
            <li>I received this product fairly quick.</li>
            <li>This color is really pretty!</li>
            <li>Very smooth &amp; makes lips soft.</li>
            <li>Rarely, do I find a product that lives up to its hype and this one does.  </li>
            <li>Good basic lipstick at decent price.</li>
            <li>Just the right shade</li>
            <li>The price even with mail costs was better than buying off the shelf locally.  </li>
            <li>but I most likely would not reorder.</li>
            <li>It really does stay on as advertised!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very chalky.</li>
            <li>I like it, but the color seemed more like orange than pink.</li>
            <li>This color and product should have never been discontinued - it is very wearable and comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite the color I wanted, it&#x27;s hard to choose a color online, I guess it will have to do for more</li>

            <li>Cover Girl Continuous Color lipstick was in all the major drug stores and then they were just gone.  </li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;lipstick stays on even after eating, doesn&#x27;t get that dry hard look and didn&#x27;t cost that much.  </li>
            <li> This is not quite the color I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not orangy like bricks, but not too pink.</li>
            <li> Did not have to waste gas going to the store and got what I wanted while I just sat home and went about my business.</li>
            <li> I just hate I always buy the same shades on accident.</li>
            <li> it also was really bad because it was hard.</li>

            <li> For my wife. The local store where she buys this product doesn&#x27;t handle it anymore. The product is exactly what she expected. The price even with mail costs was better than buying off the shelf locally.  Regards,  Dwight</li>
