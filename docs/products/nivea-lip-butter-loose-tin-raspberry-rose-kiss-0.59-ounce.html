            <li>and im good to go.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister from her wishlist and she loved it,</li>
            <li>I looks like it will do a good job by appearance (in a tin, kinda thicker consistency than the stick types), but it literally does nothing on my lips.</li>
            <li>It feels good.  </li>
            <li>it smells good.  </li>
            <li>good price.  </li>

            <li>I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Beautiful light moisture for your lips,  </li>
            <li>and I fell in love!</li>
            <li>It is so hydrating and cute as well!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this lip butter!</li>
            <li>love this product :) smells soooo good!</li>
            <li>They smell amazing and are moisfurizing.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell of this is amazing and it has no taste</li>
            <li>I have tried all four available flavors, all are great</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>this smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t asked her if she liked it</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>I find with most things that claim to be rose scented they fall short on capturing the beauty of the flower, this product pulls it off brilliantly with the wonderful compliment of raspberry.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful consistency&lt;</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I will save the tins and fill them up with my own formula.</li>
            <li>I have two of the Carmel Kiss, one of the Raspberry Rose kiss, and one of the Macadamia scented ones.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my lips.</li>
            <li>Love love love this lip butter!!</li>
            <li>This is the best lip butter that I came across so far.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is almost worth the hype.</li>
            <li>:) Its very smooth</li>
            <li>Love it, just wish it come with an applicator.</li>
            <li>Love these lip butters.</li>
            <li>Not the most moisturizing lip balms ever, but they do the job.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i just pop the top out comes the raspberry aroma and apply across my lips</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think something you&#x27;re going to put on your lips would taste better.</li>
            <li>I will be a dedicated user and am glad I found it at the start of winter.</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my lips feel when I put it on at bedtime and sleep.</li>
            <li>The smell is divine to me and the taste is okay.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, lovely raspberry fragrance.</li>
            <li>but Raspberry is my favorite.</li>
            <li>love the packaging, I love the product.</li>
            <li>But I love them all, even the vanilla one, and I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but wouldn&#x27;t choose this again.</li>
            <li>Okay to start off this review</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>, like you use sunscreen and your skin get whiter, after you apply this on your lips, you don&#x27;t look healthy, so you have to make sure to wear lipsticks after using this thing.</li>
            <li>I love this lip butter.</li>
            <li>i will buy more.  </li>
            <li>If you want to try something better from Nivea in the lip department, a kiss of milk and honey is one of my favorite drugstore lip balms.</li>
            <li>the more product you use.</li>
            <li>I love this lip butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried too many lip products, and this is a really REALLY nice one for a drugstore brand and is worth more than a lot of the high-end ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Very simple, a good price, and makes my lips feel good.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, the feel, and the light hue.</li>
            <li>Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a cute tin full of lip butter</li>
            <li>This product offers a highly moisturizing formula with a delicious scent.</li>
            <li>but that is just fine.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was!  </li>
            <li>Just sat on top, feeling greasy, and quickly dissipates away.</li>
            <li>Smells great, goes on smooth and tin is easy to open which are all a plus.</li>
            <li>I gave this away rather than bother to return it; the formula is nice but the smell is so intense I could not stand it.</li>
            <li>but I bought one for myself that I really have liked</li>
            <li>I received this for free through an offer on Nivea&#x27;s Facebook and I won&#x27;t ever be buying it.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the quality of the Raspberry Rose</li>
            <li>Cute little pot, smells delicious and moisturizes very well:</li>
            <li>I had developed an allergy to beeswax, which is in SO MANY lip balms!</li>
            <li>The Rose Kiss one is more gooey and less like a butter, more like a cream.  </li>
            <li>My lips feel great in this very dry season in Los Angeles.  </li>
            <li>Up until then it left a good impression.</li>
            <li>I also love this one I put it on when I am running around my house getting ready any time of the day</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift for one of my friends it shipped quick</li>
            <li>super moisture...</li>
            <li>keeps lips healthy, smooth, and soft.  </li>
            <li>And if you want something similar, but better than this, and are willing to fork over some extra money, creme de rose is amazing.</li>
            <li>Long lasting balm with a delicious flavor.  </li>
            <li>It goes on slippery and never actually stops being kind of slippery.</li>
            <li>I thought it looked pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this at Walmart but loved it so much I decided to write a review.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and really keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li>It not only smells like heaven, but it&#x27;s nice on the lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a handy size too--great to keep one in different spots.</li>
            <li>The flavor isn&#x27;t too strong and the container is easy to open.  </li>
            <li>This lip butter smells amazing and keeps my lips moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li>Really mostutizes my lips and smells so yummy!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried it.</li>
            <li>First of all i was attracted to the name of the flavor &amp;#34;rasberry rose&amp;#34; and it just sounded devine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a scent not an actual flavor, but whatever you breath into your mouth can also translate in your brain as a flavor,</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend :)</li>
            <li>It leaves the lips smooth and moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the packaging, but I know some people don&#x27;t like pots; in fact, I&#x27;m extremely fond of CD creme de rose lip balm, which also comes in a pot.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, raspberry rose is my favorite, though it seems to be the least favorite of the four products in general.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t make lips more  moisturized, but just protects them from getting dry.</li>
            <li>Another thing is that it makes your lips super soft and kissable.</li>
            <li>The small flat tin is a very good idea, but the scent is over-powering, and the cream is goopy, slimy, and it will melt in your pocket.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long after it is applied!</li>
            <li>so I stop losing it when I really want it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a tint</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This really does the job on your lips.</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and my lips are no longer chapped since I started using these.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes my lips</li>
            <li>Even over using straight petroleum jelly or Vaseline.</li>
            <li>It really needs to have beeswax in it to give it some body and staying power.</li>
            <li>The downside is CdR is very pricy($30), and I was hoping this would be a dupe, but it really didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend that over this any day!</li>
            <li>Smells and feels nice, but made lips crack after a few days of use.</li>
            <li>Great lip balm to use at night, gives you a slight whitish film, extremely moisturizing though.</li>
            <li>I picked this up in conjugtion on restocking on my classic Nivea cream</li>
            <li>Light pink and very creamy texture,</li>
            <li>I love the little tin and will re-purpose it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>If you put too much it doesn&#x27;t get in clear it sort of stays there.</li>
            <li>cute pale pinkish tint</li>
            <li>I like them, and actually prefer them sometimes, and this one is well made, and easy to open.  </li>
            <li>As for the light pink tint I feel like wasn&#x27;t a good idea because its lighter than the natural color of my lips and makes it look unhealthy.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips look a little pearlized - very pretty!</li>
            <li>Its also a subtle muted rose colour, I am pleased its not a bright shade.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping it would be a clear balm.</li>
            <li>From the texture, I would say this stuff is likely very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>For one pot of balm, even if it does last forever, I find that a bit much.</li>
            <li>I LOVE them - the feel of them, the weight and glide, the smell, the fact that I have soft lips even after it&#x27;s soaked in (true moisturization), the shine, the subtlety, how long the application lasts, how long the pots last (months!), the fact that I lose them so much less often because they don&#x27;t just roll out of my pocket when I pull stuff out...</li>
            <li>Makes your lips feel great, but look weird!</li>
            <li>About a year ago, I started randomly breaking out; this rash would start on the outer edge of my lips, and I noticed that as I used more balm (trying to soothe the rash!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more runny, gloppy, and messy than the other ones.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend, especially if you have a sensitive palate.</li>
            <li>I put it on before bed and my lips are so soft by the next morning</li>
            <li>It smells so good and adds a hint of color without being crazy.</li>
            <li>I took off a star because the staying power is not great, but since I love putting it on and smelling this product, I don&#x27;t care too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re into glosses in cute little tin pots like me, then this is one of the rarest products out there that is a gloss that you can purchase in a little tin.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t give me any color, and it doesn&#x27;t have the same formula as the other Nivea lip butter varieties -- thinner and less rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the other Nivea lip butters but not this one.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried too many lip products, and this is a really REALLY nice one for a drugstore brand and is worth more than a lot of the high-end ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very simple, a good price, and makes my lips feel good.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, the feel, and the light hue.</li>
            <li> Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a cute tin full of lip butter</li>
            <li> This product offers a highly moisturizing formula with a delicious scent.</li>
            <li> but that is just fine.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was!  </li>
            <li> Just sat on top, feeling greasy, and quickly dissipates away.</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on smooth and tin is easy to open which are all a plus.</li>
            <li> I gave this away rather than bother to return it; the formula is nice but the smell is so intense I could not stand it.</li>
            <li> but I bought one for myself that I really have liked</li>
            <li> I received this for free through an offer on Nivea&#x27;s Facebook and I won&#x27;t ever be buying it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the quality of the Raspberry Rose</li>
            <li> Cute little pot, smells delicious and moisturizes very well:</li>
            <li> I had developed an allergy to beeswax, which is in SO MANY lip balms!</li>
            <li> The Rose Kiss one is more gooey and less like a butter, more like a cream.  </li>
            <li> My lips feel great in this very dry season in Los Angeles.  </li>
            <li> Up until then it left a good impression.</li>
            <li> I also love this one I put it on when I am running around my house getting ready any time of the day</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for one of my friends it shipped quick</li>
            <li> super moisture...</li>
            <li> keeps lips healthy, smooth, and soft.  </li>
            <li> And if you want something similar, but better than this, and are willing to fork over some extra money, creme de rose is amazing.</li>
            <li> Long lasting balm with a delicious flavor.  </li>
            <li> It goes on slippery and never actually stops being kind of slippery.</li>
            <li> I thought it looked pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at Walmart but loved it so much I decided to write a review.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and really keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li> It not only smells like heaven, but it&#x27;s nice on the lips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handy size too--great to keep one in different spots.</li>
            <li> The flavor isn&#x27;t too strong and the container is easy to open.  </li>
            <li> This lip butter smells amazing and keeps my lips moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li> Really mostutizes my lips and smells so yummy!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried it.</li>
            <li> First of all i was attracted to the name of the flavor &amp;#34;rasberry rose&amp;#34; and it just sounded devine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a scent not an actual flavor, but whatever you breath into your mouth can also translate in your brain as a flavor,</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend :)</li>
            <li> It leaves the lips smooth and moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the packaging, but I know some people don&#x27;t like pots; in fact, I&#x27;m extremely fond of CD creme de rose lip balm, which also comes in a pot.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, raspberry rose is my favorite, though it seems to be the least favorite of the four products in general.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make lips more  moisturized, but just protects them from getting dry.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that it makes your lips super soft and kissable.</li>
            <li> The small flat tin is a very good idea, but the scent is over-powering, and the cream is goopy, slimy, and it will melt in your pocket.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long after it is applied!</li>
            <li> so I stop losing it when I really want it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a tint</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This really does the job on your lips.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and my lips are no longer chapped since I started using these.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes my lips</li>
            <li> Even over using straight petroleum jelly or Vaseline.</li>
            <li> It really needs to have beeswax in it to give it some body and staying power.</li>
            <li> The downside is CdR is very pricy($30), and I was hoping this would be a dupe, but it really didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend that over this any day!</li>
            <li> Smells and feels nice, but made lips crack after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm to use at night, gives you a slight whitish film, extremely moisturizing though.</li>
            <li> I picked this up in conjugtion on restocking on my classic Nivea cream</li>
            <li> Light pink and very creamy texture,</li>
            <li> I love the little tin and will re-purpose it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you put too much it doesn&#x27;t get in clear it sort of stays there.</li>
            <li> cute pale pinkish tint</li>
            <li> I like them, and actually prefer them sometimes, and this one is well made, and easy to open.  </li>
            <li> As for the light pink tint I feel like wasn&#x27;t a good idea because its lighter than the natural color of my lips and makes it look unhealthy.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips look a little pearlized - very pretty!</li>
            <li> Its also a subtle muted rose colour, I am pleased its not a bright shade.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping it would be a clear balm.</li>
            <li> From the texture, I would say this stuff is likely very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> For one pot of balm, even if it does last forever, I find that a bit much.</li>
            <li> I LOVE them - the feel of them, the weight and glide, the smell, the fact that I have soft lips even after it&#x27;s soaked in (true moisturization), the shine, the subtlety, how long the application lasts, how long the pots last (months!), the fact that I lose them so much less often because they don&#x27;t just roll out of my pocket when I pull stuff out...</li>
            <li> Makes your lips feel great, but look weird!</li>
            <li> About a year ago, I started randomly breaking out; this rash would start on the outer edge of my lips, and I noticed that as I used more balm (trying to soothe the rash!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more runny, gloppy, and messy than the other ones.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend, especially if you have a sensitive palate.</li>
            <li> I put it on before bed and my lips are so soft by the next morning</li>
            <li> It smells so good and adds a hint of color without being crazy.</li>
            <li> I took off a star because the staying power is not great, but since I love putting it on and smelling this product, I don&#x27;t care too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re into glosses in cute little tin pots like me, then this is one of the rarest products out there that is a gloss that you can purchase in a little tin.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t give me any color, and it doesn&#x27;t have the same formula as the other Nivea lip butter varieties -- thinner and less rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the other Nivea lip butters but not this one.</li>
            <li> I normally use Rosebud Salve from Sephora but didn&#x27;t feel like driving all the way out to the mall to get it, so i saw this in a little tin pot and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell, it is very raspberry not rose at all, but subtle and sweet, which I like.</li>
            <li> Ultra moisturizing and long lasting without being sticky...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the only products that helps my dry lips</li>
            <li> actually, now that I think about it, I haven&#x27;t lost a single one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was never able to keep it on long enough before the taste just completely got to me.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> , the formula is completely different then the consistency of the other Nivea lip butters.</li>
            <li> It rather has the white color (maybe due to the titanium dioxide in the ingredient.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it might work like the other varieties of the same product and hoping it might (unlike those) give some pink tint to my lips.</li>
            <li> It was very dry and didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hoarded of all things moisturizing for my lips, which tend to get very dry.</li>
            <li> I have always used some sort of lip balm (as in, applied-multiple-times-a-day usage) and for at least the last ten years, had no problems.</li>
            <li> When you put it on it has a frost pink color.</li>
            <li> Like bitter chemicals.</li>
            <li> Product as expected, had used before</li>
            <li> It is not really something you want to eat</li>
            <li> I never really tried lip butter.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy the other flavors as well.</li>
            <li> The texture is heavy and sticky, it makes my lips a weird pale color, and the tin doesn&#x27;t close securely so I can&#x27;t keep it in a bag.</li>
            <li> It also gives my lips a slightly frsted pink color that makes me feel like I&#x27;m wearing play makeup from Claire&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> So if you were wondering this product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I picked up the raspberry-rose scent at my CVS for $4 (fairly average lip balm price for CA).</li>
            <li> Very hard to open, seems to make my lips dry after a few minutes</li>
            <li> A lot of people don&#x27;t like pots because they are not very healthy, sticking your fingers in there.  </li>
            <li> When you put it on, it doesn&#x27;t go on clear so that can be a little weird</li>
            <li> but, this one isn&#x27;t giving me much trouble at all.</li>
            <li> , it got progressively worse until it was over my entire lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a deeper skin tone and it makes my lips look unusually pale.  </li>
            <li> Nicer than any sticks I have bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and heavy but it keeps me from having chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Consistence is very thick and stays on longer than any other lipstick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s texture is a little too heavy for my liking and the lack of hygienic application make it a poor choice for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to dip my fingers in it, makes it all dirty and stuff; wished it was in a regular tube.</li>
            <li> I did and caught a cold the next day....</li>
            <li> But then when I put some one my lips it felt thick and pasty.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ridiculously priced at over $4.</li>
            <li> Lid is impossible to get off if you get any of this on your fingers.</li>
            <li> It tastes AWFUL.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great, goes on smooth and tin is easy to open which are all a plus. The only thing is it has a shimmer to it and I was hoping it would be a clear balm. When you put it on it has a frost pink color. If you want shimmer than its great...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  Ultra moisturizing and long lasting without being sticky...light scent is perfect too.</li>
            <li> Love it, just wish it come with an applicator.</li>
            <li> I may just buy one for every purse so I stop losing it when I really want it. I love the scent, the feel, and the light hue.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips feel great, but look weird!</li>
            <li> The texture is heavy and sticky, it makes my lips a weird pale color, and the tin doesn&#x27;t close securely so I can&#x27;t keep it in a bag.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long after it is applied!</li>
            <li> It was very dry and didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> Love these lip butters. They smell amazing and are moisfurizing. Not the most moisturizing lip balms ever, but they do the job. it doesn&#x27;t make lips more  moisturized, but just protects them from getting dry.</li>
            <li> Very hard to open, seems to make my lips dry after a few minutes so I use it often. Lid is impossible to get off if you get any of this on your fingers.</li>
            <li> great product! lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> Great lip butter!  My lips feel great in this very dry season in Los Angeles.  The flavor isn&#x27;t too strong and the container is easy to open.  I find it difficult to open most tins of this sort but, this one isn&#x27;t giving me much trouble at all.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but I don&#x27;t like the packaging. I don&#x27;t like to dip my fingers in it, makes it all dirty and stuff; wished it was in a regular tube. You get a lot of product and this lasted me forever. Great lip balm to use at night, gives you a slight whitish film, extremely moisturizing though. Not so great to use in the day time, prefer one that contains SPF.</li>
            <li> It has great smell and my boyfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Really mostutizes my lips and smells so yummy!</li>
            <li> This lip butter smells amazing and keeps my lips moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li> I gave this away rather than bother to return it; the formula is nice but the smell is so intense I could not stand it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I love it. I don&#x27;t really see a tint like others say but I don&#x27;t care because I didn&#x27;t want a tint. Smells amazing. Moisturizing and not waxy. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This really does the job on your lips. i just pop the top out comes the raspberry aroma and apply across my lips and im good to go.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for one of my friends it shipped quick and I haven&#x27;t asked her if she liked it but I bought one for myself that I really have liked</li>
            <li> I received this for free through an offer on Nivea&#x27;s Facebook and I won&#x27;t ever be buying it. The best thing about this product is the smell. It smells nice. It tastes AWFUL. Like bitter chemicals. You&#x27;d think something you&#x27;re going to put on your lips would taste better. From the texture, I would say this stuff is likely very moisturizing. It&#x27;s the consistency of body lotion. I was never able to keep it on long enough before the taste just completely got to me. It goes on slippery and never actually stops being kind of slippery. It also gives my lips a slightly frsted pink color that makes me feel like I&#x27;m wearing play makeup from Claire&#x27;s. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend, especially if you have a sensitive palate.</li>
            <li> Product as expected, had used before</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and my lips are no longer chapped since I started using these. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Long lasting balm with a delicious flavor.  Nicer than any sticks I have bought in the past.  I will be a dedicated user and am glad I found it at the start of winter.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my lips feel when I put it on at bedtime and sleep. It is thick and heavy but it keeps me from having chapped lips. The smell is divine to me and the taste is okay. It is not really something you want to eat but if you taste it - it will not taste medicine like.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Beautiful light moisture for your lips,  with a beautiful scent....  I will stock up</li>
            <li> I bought the raspberry, like the feel, but need to reply often - I like the smaller container, but I&#x27;m going back to the Rosebud Salve.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, lovely raspberry fragrance. Its also a subtle muted rose colour, I am pleased its not a bright shade.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is amazing and it has no taste so youre not tempted to lick it off! lol :) Its very smooth</li>
            <li> Love this!! Really moisturizes my lips but, if you use lots at once, it does make ur lips look white lol but I just use it at night and my lips are so moisturized in the morning</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister from her wishlist and she loved it,</li>
            <li> I never really tried lip butter. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried it. I bought this and when I opened the tin I thought it looked pretty cool. So, like any one else would do, I sniffed it. To see what it&#x27;s smelled like. I thought it smelled like those Swedish fish candy. Up until then it left a good impression. But then when I put some one my lips it felt thick and pasty. And it didn&#x27;t feel like my lips were getting moisturized at all. I then looked into a mirror and saw that my lips were white. Yes white. If you put too much it doesn&#x27;t get in clear it sort of stays there. So if you were wondering this product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect for on the go. It&#x27;s one of the only products that helps my dry lips</li>
            <li> This is the best lip butter that I came across so far. I have tried all four available flavors, all are great but Raspberry is my favorite. Consistence is very thick and stays on longer than any other lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is a cute tin full of lip butter but that&#x27;s about it.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell/taste and don&#x27;t find it overpowering...but the consistency of this product is undesirable.  I have the Vanilla &amp; Macadamia lip butter but the formulations seem to be different.  The Rose Kiss one is more gooey and less like a butter, more like a cream.  I also don&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;pink tint&amp;#34;.  I have a deeper skin tone and it makes my lips look unusually pale.  I&#x27;ll use the rest when i&#x27;m around the house but I wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase it.</li>
            <li> What a great happenstance purchase! I&#x27;m a hoarded of all things moisturizing for my lips, which tend to get very dry. I picked this up in conjugtion on restocking on my classic Nivea cream and I fell in love! This product offers a highly moisturizing formula with a delicious scent. I find with most things that claim to be rose scented they fall short on capturing the beauty of the flower, this product pulls it off brilliantly with the wonderful compliment of raspberry.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful consistency&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on the lips&lt;br /&gt;Abundant amount of product&lt;br /&gt;Try it out!</li>
            <li> I debated about how to rate this one. I bought it because of the internet hype and I just wanted to try it out. Smells nice. Light pink and very creamy texture, but it&#x27;s a bit gunky. No applicator, so if you don&#x27;t have a lip brush, you&#x27;ll probably use your finger. I did and caught a cold the next day.... I love the little tin and will re-purpose it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again. It&#x27;s texture is a little too heavy for my liking and the lack of hygienic application make it a poor choice for me.</li>
            <li> This is quite a messy product each time lid is opened and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much benefit for your lips.  I do not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It smells just like a vanilla bean frap with a pump of raspberries. It is so hydrating and cute as well!</li>
            <li> Nivea products are always great. Smells delicious and does good job keeping lips moist. When you put it on, it doesn&#x27;t go on clear so that can be a little weird but I like it.</li>
            <li> I have always used some sort of lip balm (as in, applied-multiple-times-a-day usage) and for at least the last ten years, had no problems. About a year ago, I started randomly breaking out; this rash would start on the outer edge of my lips, and I noticed that as I used more balm (trying to soothe the rash!), it got progressively worse until it was over my entire lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial self-prescribed treatment was Vaseline, so it went away. After another cycle or two of this, I noticed that it was any product containing beeswax. I had developed an allergy to beeswax, which is in SO MANY lip balms! I can now only use petroleum based products, and the nivea lip butters have been a God send. I LOVE them - the feel of them, the weight and glide, the smell, the fact that I have soft lips even after it&#x27;s soaked in (true moisturization), the shine, the subtlety, how long the application lasts, how long the pots last (months!), the fact that I lose them so much less often because they don&#x27;t just roll out of my pocket when I pull stuff out...actually, now that I think about it, I haven&#x27;t lost a single one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging, I love the product. Even over using straight petroleum jelly or Vaseline. Oddly enough, raspberry rose is my favorite, though it seems to be the least favorite of the four products in general. But I love them all, even the vanilla one, and I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla. This stuff is awesome, and a balm-lover-turned-allergic&#x27;s life saver! Definitely try one, if not all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, don&#x27;t buy these at a drug store. They&#x27;re ridiculously priced at over $4. For one pot of balm, even if it does last forever, I find that a bit much. I find mine at Walmart (ugh, yes, Walmart) in the pharmacy section, or buy them on here, for the $3.</li>
            <li> The small flat tin is a very good idea, but the scent is over-powering, and the cream is goopy, slimy, and it will melt in your pocket. It really needs to have beeswax in it to give it some body and staying power. I will save the tins and fill them up with my own formula.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but wouldn&#x27;t choose this again. I bought it thinking it might work like the other varieties of the same product and hoping it might (unlike those) give some pink tint to my lips. But it doesn&#x27;t give me any color, and it doesn&#x27;t have the same formula as the other Nivea lip butter varieties -- thinner and less rich and moisturizing. Unless on deep discount, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I also love this one I put it on when I am running around my house getting ready any time of the day</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at Walmart but loved it so much I decided to write a review.  I normally use Rosebud Salve from Sephora but didn&#x27;t feel like driving all the way out to the mall to get it, so i saw this in a little tin pot and decided to try it.  First of all i was attracted to the name of the flavor &amp;#34;rasberry rose&amp;#34; and it just sounded devine.  Luckily it was!  It&#x27;s more of a scent not an actual flavor, but whatever you breath into your mouth can also translate in your brain as a flavor, so what&#x27;s the difference??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing.  The way it feels is just like the way body butter feels on your skin....super moisture...not sticky at all on your lips nor does it leave a film.  And if you&#x27;re into glosses in cute little tin pots like me, then this is one of the rarest products out there that is a gloss that you can purchase in a little tin.</li>
            <li> I love this! It smells so good and adds a hint of color without being crazy. Very simple, a good price, and makes my lips feel good.</li>
            <li> Okay to start off this review I have all of the Nivea Lip butters except the unscented one. I have two of the Carmel Kiss, one of the Raspberry Rose kiss, and one of the Macadamia scented ones. I really don&#x27;t like the quality of the Raspberry Rose, the formula is completely different then the consistency of the other Nivea lip butters. It&#x27;s a lot more runny, gloppy, and messy than the other ones. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as the Carmel or Macadamia. As for the light pink tint I feel like wasn&#x27;t a good idea because its lighter than the natural color of my lips and makes it look unhealthy. As for the scent I think it smells okay but I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent. I would highly recommend the other Nivea lip butters but not this one.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, it is very raspberry not rose at all, but subtle and sweet, which I like. I looks like it will do a good job by appearance (in a tin, kinda thicker consistency than the stick types), but it literally does nothing on my lips. It rather has the white color (maybe due to the titanium dioxide in the ingredient., like you use sunscreen and your skin get whiter, after you apply this on your lips, you don&#x27;t look healthy, so you have to make sure to wear lipsticks after using this thing.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lip butter!!</li>
            <li> I love this lip butter. It smells amazing and really keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li> It feels good.  it smells good.  i will buy more.  good price.  keeps lips healthy, smooth, and soft.  a win win.</li>
            <li> Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this, because a friend suggested it. Great product, I would buy again. They also smell great as well!!!</li>
            <li> I just DO NOT get the hype over this product. I picked up the raspberry-rose scent at my CVS for $4 (fairly average lip balm price for CA). I don&#x27;t mind the packaging, but I know some people don&#x27;t like pots; in fact, I&#x27;m extremely fond of CD creme de rose lip balm, which also comes in a pot. The downside is CdR is very pricy($30), and I was hoping this would be a dupe, but it really didn&#x27;t do it for me. The smell is nice, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my lips. Just sat on top, feeling greasy, and quickly dissipates away. If you want to try something better from Nivea in the lip department, a kiss of milk and honey is one of my favorite drugstore lip balms. I&#x27;d highly recommend that over this any day! And if you want something similar, but better than this, and are willing to fork over some extra money, creme de rose is amazing.</li>
            <li> This lip butter smells so yummy.  A lot of people don&#x27;t like pots because they are not very healthy, sticking your fingers in there.  I like them, and actually prefer them sometimes, and this one is well made, and easy to open.  It not only smells like heaven, but it&#x27;s nice on the lips.  Not sticky at all, and not too waxy either.  I took off a star because the staying power is not great, but since I love putting it on and smelling this product, I don&#x27;t care too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent for the formula.  I&#x27;ve tried too many lip products, and this is a really REALLY nice one for a drugstore brand and is worth more than a lot of the high-end ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Cute little pot, smells delicious and moisturizes very well: I like this lip balm. It&#x27;s a handy size too--great to keep one in different spots.</li>
            <li> My mom says it tastes good and feels good</li>
            <li> Smells and feels nice, but made lips crack after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I love this lip butter! I put it on before bed and my lips are so soft by the next morning and they feel good all day. I would totally recommend :)</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT. LO still buy, EXCELLENT QUALITY AND CAME TO THE SHIPPING TIME.</li>
            <li> love this product :) smells soooo good! not sticky at all! cute pale pinkish tint the more product you use.</li>
            <li> ✨✨This product is very nice. It smells great and is almost worth the hype. It smells just like raspberries. Another thing is that it makes your lips super soft and kissable. I love it!!!✨✨</li>
            <li> smells great and makes my lips feel great</li>
            <li> I love this lip butter.I have a lot of lip balms and butters,and this is one of the best.It leaves the lips smooth and moist and soft.I am going to buy the other flavors as well.</li>
            <li> this smells AMAZING. it does not taste like anything but that is just fine. It makes my lips look a little pearlized - very pretty! and this is one of the only lip products that I have tried that does not make my lips peel!! Give it a try!</li>
