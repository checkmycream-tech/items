            <li>The spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t leak at all, so that is nice.</li>
            <li>They spray nicely and they look nice too.</li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy, compact, and the spray is adjustable from \\&quot;mist\\&quot; to \\&quot;squirt\\&quot;, depending on your need.</li>
            <li>I ordered six of these and nicely was given seven.  </li>
            <li>Nice spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Nice and durable bottle.</li>
            <li>These bottles are so handy.</li>
            <li>Although it was cheap, there are cheaper ones at the Dollar Store or wherever that I&#x27;m sure work just as great.</li>
            <li>even though I got it at a price that was good for me it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Been very happy with this one so far.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to be able to choose which colors you get.</li>
            <li>Gotta keep it filled if you spray at an angle, but it&#x27;s a good size.</li>
            <li>Does a great job and the size is just right.</li>
            <li>Operation is EASY!</li>
            <li>This sprayer sprays a very fine mist.</li>
            <li>Very fast, great price.</li>
            <li>Great product - exactly what I was</li>
            <li>bought this for very light duty as a mister for house plants.</li>
            <li>Nice fine spray.</li>
            <li>It sprays a nice fine even mist of water</li>
            <li>but when they arrived there is no indication on the package or bottle that these are safe plastic.  </li>
            <li>love the way the spray tip can be adjusted to manipulate the out come or way the water is released.</li>
            <li>love the way the spray tip can be adjusted to manipulate the out come or way the water is released.</li>
            <li>The inner straw-like tube is the perfect length to draw from the bottle&#x27;s bottom-most recesses.  </li>
            <li>Just completely mind-boggling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Love the size, love how it evenly sprays water.</li>
            <li>I love this bottle because of its size.</li>
            <li>Also, there are times you have to keep turning the top of the nozzle head to ensure an even spray</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more as the needs arise.</li>
            <li>and I will not hesitate to order more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna order a couple more to keep around for plants or ironing.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you order the color you need.</li>
            <li>Im sure thatll be the outcome.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the trigger mechanisms seem okay-</li>
            <li>The plastic bottles themselves are a softer, more &amp;#34;bendable&amp;#34; plastic rather than rigid.</li>
            <li>Its ok</li>
            <li>Now I pull the trigger with my thumb and it seems better.</li>
            <li>Yes I have to refill it more often, but it is still not even every time.  </li>
            <li>then it would be better</li>
            <li>works well :)</li>
            <li>cute and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This spray bottle is okay.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use these for poison sprays, as the contents can leak when the top is unscrewed.</li>
            <li>glad I bought two.  </li>
            <li>These are durable and cute.  </li>
            <li>I love everything aboutt his bottle.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more for dedicated usage</li>
            <li>otherwise the pump won&#x27;t be able to pick up any of the bottle&#x27;s contents.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the tube should be more flexible or bent in  way so that it tilts towards the bottom of the bottle when it is tipped during use?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m entirly satisfied with this bottle.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
            <li>13 words are required so I&#x27;m typing more words here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love a glass version.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to have cleaning chemicals in some, make sure the kids know the rules</li>
            <li>is more detail. \\&quot;Flimsy\\</li>
            <li>It does OK at this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it, would definitely recommend it, and would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these spray bottles.  </li>
            <li>Love this spray bottle.</li>
            <li>It would help to be a bit more sturdy</li>
            <li>Much better quality than what you can get for cheaper at Walmart or target.</li>
            <li>(Its been dropped too many times to count)&lt;br</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t shake the bottle or tilt it so that the liquid touches the top because it leaks if you do.  </li>
            <li>I think I am safe.  </li>
            <li>Did not include the spray top.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many spray bottles.  </li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I will buy them again if I ever need more</li>
            <li>Received these water bottles, filled one up and it worked!  </li>
            <li>I love the size</li>
            <li>that he&#x27;s more mobile.  </li>
            <li>It is solidly made the perfect size.</li>
            <li>Much better than the &amp;#34;spray/off&#x27; style  for misting plants.</li>
            <li>This works great - no mess and a nice misty stream.</li>
            <li>So its very accessible and entertaining at most times of the day</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, good quality, super cheap</li>
            <li>the kids like playing with these, and they make pretty good squirt guns.</li>
            <li>This was a cute bottle that I can use to easily refill with bleach water, cleaner or whatever else</li>
            <li>This one, so far, works very well and sprays a very fine mist, perfect for misting poultry with water in the oven and so forth.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very sturdy and has good stream throw.  </li>
            <li>wet - the bottles have a stream or a spray, excellent &amp;#34;pressure,&amp;#34; easy to use/squeeze, they don&#x27;t leak when sideways (fallen</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t look flimsy or easily breakable.  </li>
            <li>Shoots far and precisely, which is great for when the cat is across the room scratching your couch.</li>
            <li>These things are really easy to shatter---and break.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy to use</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and do not stress my hands.  </li>
            <li>A lot break easily - too large,leak,  </li>
            <li>This spray bottle works well and is easy to refill.</li>
            <li>These bottles have an easy to use twist end to control the spray diameter and strength.</li>
            <li>Trigger handle enables strong pump leverage, in contrast to those finger-spray bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong spray.</li>
            <li>Still going strong after two month.</li>
            <li>Strong and durable</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Spray is strong, even, and adjustable.</li>
            <li>The walls of the container are about as strong as plasticized paper, and I&#x27;m giving the sprayer the benefit of the doubt</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>The spray is a kind of &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; instead of a steady stream which I love because it&#x27;s easier to distribute product throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>This is actually my SECOND order for this particular bottle, the first one was great, good adjustable nozzle, nice mist and spray.</li>
            <li>It holds about a cup of liquid and the squirter adjusts from fine to stream.</li>
            <li>fine though</li>
            <li>Work just fine for small-scale garden spraying, or spraying on yourself while walking in 90-100 degree weather.</li>
            <li>Fine.</li>
            <li>It worked fine until it fell off my belt and the bottle cracked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a spray bottle and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>The bottle sprays a fine mist of water instead of doing a stream like some spray bottles.</li>
            <li>They suit our purpose fine.  </li>
            <li>This spray bottle does not deliver a fine spray, so I don&#x27;t recommend it for use with setting lotions.</li>
            <li>For the price, this little thing is priceless.</li>
            <li>Perfect little spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Thought these came up as BPA free</li>
            <li>I used it when I was making my own shampoo that was really runny and required a spray bottle to apply.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The trigger handle pumps smoothly.  </li>
            <li>, i.e., a smooth even spray.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>Packaged securely.</li>
            <li>However, it was cheap and it does 95% of what I wanted, so</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>They work great as sprayers and misters and can reach about 20ft with proper angling.  </li>
            <li>The lid doesn&#x27;t fit on the bottle.</li>
            <li>(Also works great when set to stream at keeping cats off counters, out of Christmas trees, and ultimately away from my sharpening stuff...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown money away on cheap spray bottles (I could have returned them, but one never does.)</li>
            <li>Cheap Spray bottle- Would be overpriced @ .50.</li>
            <li>Had it a few months now and still works great, no issues!</li>
            <li>It should be marketed as a cheap water gun instead of a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Also I don&#x27;t think this thing is BPA free, but</li>
            <li>The bottle is sturdy, but light, and you can adjust the spray.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I had another use for it than what I intended.</li>
            <li>Sprayer seems well made for a cheap bottle.</li>
            <li>In fact, I have a bunch of them that you can have for free.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I decided to order another one.</li>
            <li>This bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is great because it gives a larger trigger displacement and this limits the number of times you have to squeeze the trigger to get the amount of spray you want.</li>
            <li>Some choice of color would have been nice, but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;on creates a nice gentle mist.  </li>
            <li>I keep these on several counter tops around the apartment to spray the gnats and mosquitoes that fly around the bathroom mirror, kitchen counter, and me.</li>
            <li>I keep them filled with 91% rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Nice color (bright pink), too.</li>
            <li>These bottles are just the right size and so far the sprayers work great.</li>
            <li>So many of these spray bottles just don&#x27;t spray correctly, but this one works right from the start.  </li>
            <li>These 8oz bottles are great for spraying even the largest of plants (within reason, they are only 8oz!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nozzle adjusts from closed, to an ultra-fine mist (perfect for foliar feeding), all the way to a solid stream (great cat deterrent, with pure water of course!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light, small, great spray!</li>
            <li>Perfect for a small spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>I just like the first order better.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Has a good misting spray, doesn&#x27;t make a good hard squirt</li>
            <li>You fill it up with your favorite spay-able fluid and it sprays out in a nice adjustable fashion.</li>
            <li>The whole unit has a nice solid weight to it (many small spray bottles are feather-weight and seem really cheap and flimsy); the sprayer seems good quality and fits perfectly to hand; the spray action is dependable every time, no sputtering or having to pump it to prime it; it can be adjusted from a fine mist to heavier droplets; the tube goes all the way to the bottom of the bottle to capture all the water.</li>
            <li>Nothing really special</li>
            <li>Nothing special for the price.</li>
            <li>And much more convenient than large spray bottles.</li>
            <li>These are a good size and shoot pretty far.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and does exactly what it says it can - sprays water.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but this is such a good product I had to.</li>
            <li>These bottles are so cool and work so well.</li>
            <li>Smal, Cheap, Powerful sprayer</li>
            <li>if it isn&#x27;t full, it topples over  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a good quality spray bottle at my local Target</li>
            <li>&quot; is the word that comes most readily to mind.  </li>
            <li>You would think it would be simple to find a good squirt bottle.</li>
            <li>I make bleach t-shirts for my craft store, so I definitely did some hunting to find a good spray bottle and these ended up being the winners.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also very study as it has taken many tumbles and still has all of it&#x27;s plastic parts.</li>
            <li>Its a good price and its a simple product</li>
            <li>When you set it down it is perfectly balanced and doesn&#x27;t even come close to thinking about tipping over, very stable.</li>
            <li>A fine misting spray, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize the squirts would be super &amp;#34;concentrated&amp;#34; if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised and perfect size for small plants or using to spray clothes while ironing.</li>
            <li>action on the trigger is good and the whole unit is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>this was for my dog training, arrived quickly, pefect size.</li>
            <li>and they always stopped working fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>It will stand out when I need to find it quickly.</li>
            <li>The complete item is very sturdy, handy and works really fine.</li>
            <li>When I first filled it the water came out in a stream</li>
            <li>Very cheap plastic (you can easily push in), which is the last thing I want for the purpose I bought it for (storing vegetable wash).  </li>
            <li>Pretty good although it&#x27;s a lot smaller than pictured.</li>
            <li>The units r very sturdy and it&#x27;s easy to label them, either with a Sharpie marking pen or even a product label off a product container.</li>
            <li>I suppose since I&#x27;m ok with my masculinity, that&#x27;s ok as long</li>
            <li>This product is solid, well-made, doesn&#x27;t leak, and has both mist and squirt options (with pretty good distance).</li>
            <li>It shoots out a satisfyingly strong, straight spray.  </li>
            <li>These are easy to handle and spray very well...</li>
            <li>You can adjust it to spray pretty far which is nice.</li>
            <li>It comes pretty clean - I still rinsed it out before spraying plants and animals, but there&#x27;s no unpleasant chemical odor.</li>
            <li>Overall though, for the price, these bottles were a good value and thankfully, my yogi friends loved the hot pink color.</li>
            <li>While the hinge lasted it was working fine, and had it not broken</li>
            <li>Great little spray bottle.</li>
            <li>A great little spray bottle and it does not leak.</li>
            <li>This little pump sprayer works great.  </li>
            <li>Great little spray bottles for whatever your needs.</li>
            <li>great little item for spraying my house plants with water.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I got pink, which was fine since it was for my 3 year old daughter, but might not have been as great if it was for my son.</li>
            <li>so they sit up on their own and won&#x27;t knock over easily as some other spray bottles this size tend to be.</li>
            <li>The one I was sent is bright pink.  </li>
            <li>All the spray bottles sold at Target have a really cheap pump mechanism and the volume of each spray in those bottles is very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>but why did they have to send me a bright pink one?</li>
            <li>Had for a few weeks and works great.</li>
            <li>Excellent for the price for thin liquids like water, vinegar and liquid</li>
            <li>This is a useful feature when mixing two liquids.  </li>
            <li>This thing is a piece of junk - I have no idea why anyone thinks it is useful at all.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The sprayer is kind of big for my hands, and it sometimes malfunctions.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe so many people would write these fantastic reviews all for a simple spray bottle...</li>
            <li>Doing some test sprays produced a good range of spray area (focused stream versus wide spray).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the performance so far (have had it only a month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was ordering one to replace my old one that I dropped and the top broke off.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the bottle came in pink which was surprising based on the product image.</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth:</li>
            <li>A nice smaller size.  </li>
            <li>The Tolco 8 oz proves it once again.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I guess it was worth it.</li>
            <li>They are useful.</li>
            <li>I use my green Tolco bottles for the greatest cleaning product on the market, Bio-Green Clean, and have several Tolco bottles spread around the house now.</li>
            <li>One didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I ordered it right off the page I had ordered before.  </li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>I got this to water my starter pots for some seeds I planted and this works just right.</li>
            <li>(It is laying on its side right now, and nothing is leaking out)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>One or two sprays and the gnats fall right to the ground</li>
            <li>This thing is perfect for misting plants, spraying my cat when he&#x27;s being naughty, and hitting giant flies on the ceiling that are trying to spread disease.</li>
            <li>It is a small botel which requires refilling frequently... but it mists perfectly!  </li>
            <li>The first caved in on itself and since this one is nice and sturdy and did not do that, it received an extra star.  </li>
            <li>I think they are a good value for the money, and the reason for the four stars is the threading is a bit twitchy (just be careful) and one of the seven refused to spray at first without some persuasion.  </li>
            <li>Great little bottle, I use it to spray my cats when they misbehave!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use; has a tiny dial on the nozzle where one can adjust the flow from a spritz to a stream of water.</li>
            <li>Great size for small bathroom-works well</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty fun.  </li>
            <li>Works great, small, fits in my cabinet</li>
            <li>It is not worth the $5,  seeing the price I felt it would be of superior quality than the alternatives.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, really.</li>
            <li>Smart cats!)</li>
            <li>It sprays a large volume!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a widespread spray action than a straight jetstream line-esque squirt.</li>
            <li>I saw that other reviewers didn&#x27;t necessarily get a good color - mine was a purple top with translucent clear bottom (the translucency is from the surface being finely pebbled).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny to get so excited about a water bottle, but I had been looking for a decent one for quite a while before I found this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two small drawbacks, but most people won&#x27;t care because they&#x27;ll be so happy to have found a spray bottle that actually works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can adjust it from a clear stream to a fine mist, and anything in between.</li>
            <li>wonderful small spray bottle for various uses</li>
            <li>so have to refill pretty often</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Much higher quality than anticipated.</li>
            <li>Size was exactly what I was looking for (I was making some home-made yoga mat cleaner as gifts for a couple of fellow yogis).</li>
            <li>I am ordering several more to have around the house.</li>
            <li>but it would be better if it was a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>Solid construction, looks nicer than most spray bottles.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the fact that it is only an 8 ounce bottle and will not work for what I had intended.</li>
            <li>you can get better at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>This bottle leaks and seems cheaply constructed; far from the quality I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>They function will enough for spray bottles, but I was wanted they sprayer to have more of an adjustment.  </li>
            <li>The spray bottle is exactly what I needed to mist my air plants.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived with no flaws or defects, and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do: it sprays water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but this is one I&#x27;ll be buying more of in the future.  </li>
            <li>first sprayer that I received was severely ruptured with a two-inch tear in the container.</li>
            <li>I doubt that the sprayer will hold up to more regular and intensive use.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted at a very affordable price!</li>
            <li>The top hasn&#x27;t disintegrated in my hand like the last squirt bottle I bought.</li>
            <li>but these do exactly what you expect of them.  </li>
            <li>(It actually has a rounded shoulder on top.)</li>
            <li>so the first time I went to shake the bottle, the contents splashed everywhere.</li>
            <li>I use it as a water gun when my wife and I have water fights randomly in the summer, works great!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Tolco!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s s sturdy acrylic, pretty, and</li>
            <li>This one is more solid than the others, seals well, and does the job.</li>
            <li>Out of several spray bottles I have tested out, these are the most efficient.</li>
            <li>Why show a nice neutral color bottle and then send a pink one?  </li>
            <li>They make more industrial spray bottles if you are looking to use it for some sort of manual labor task such as making a bleach spray bottle to use for cleaning.</li>
            <li>But other than needing a bit more attention, these are great little bottles for the price.</li>
            <li>My other dripped drops of water and this one sprays evenly and in a nice mist.  </li>
            <li>Nice small compact easy to  hold  and nice spray for indoor plants.&lt;br /&gt;Expected red,yellow,blue or green but</li>
            <li>So cheap that it is not quite worth the time to send it back.</li>
            <li>The spray is always ready to go on first pump, even if u haven&#x27;t used it in days.</li>
            <li>The thumb hook on the back side of the handle makes it much more comfortable to use compared to standard spray bottles.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have pointed this out as well, so it appears to be an issue regardless of the seller (I purchased mine from Big Fly Sports).</li>
            <li>to much to say about a spray bottle, but it&#x27;s exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty much all I was hoping for in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>They are small and well made, and can shoot a stream a good distance.</li>
            <li>This bottle is small but a good size for my use.</li>
            <li>It is good for hair or watering small plants where you don&#x27;t want a stream of water.</li>
            <li>The trigger action is smooth and its quick to spray with out excessive &#x27;dry shots&#x27; which is great when you have a wiggling toddler waiting for a mist of water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s great for wetting down short hair that is being temperamental and misting a cat that is also being temperamental.</li>
            <li>Large radius of spraying.</li>
            <li>and I have not had any issues with mistakenly getting large grips on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>but I certainly won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li>One star ding because one of the bottles screw top is a bit loose, and requires care when threading.</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re not misting a greenhouse full of plants, these will probably be adequate.</li>
            <li>The alcohol evaporates quickly and leaves no mess.</li>
            <li>It was fine with me that it isn&#x27;t the same triangular shape as what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>The most recent one lasted less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Anybody have any suggestions for a sprayer that&#x27;s more durable?  </li>
            <li>This spray bottle works fine and is small and easy to store.</li>
            <li>Really gets a lot of water spraying</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the cheap flimsy device I feared at this low price.  </li>
            <li>I use mine to shine my shoes, and it has been very durable.</li>
            <li>I really like this spray bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s short and takes up a lot of horizontal space, but it does fit in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>Plastic is not thin.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold much, but the spray is adjustable and it pumps a lot out.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34; but you can still see if water is in it, and how much.</li>
            <li>This spray bottle really helps in the application.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and relatively quiet.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>One thing I didn&#x27;t love is they sent me a bottle in pink.</li>
            <li>Like the gentle spray coming from this bottle..</li>
            <li>(Hope for pink, it is better than the alternative. . . .)</li>
            <li>Literally it was only after I filled it once.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bread baker and use it to gently spray water on the loaf before going into the oven</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>Tall, white and industrial looking and sound like a goose when you pull the trigger.</li>
            <li>maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description good enough, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>and I liked the green colored one pictured.</li>
            <li>but it is most certainly NOT a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The intake tub inside the bottle is very rigid and after the liquid level gets down to a certain point, you may have to make sure that you are holding the bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are a ton of other uses for it as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy more for other household applications</li>
            <li>Even my husband was excited about how this spray bottle worked - you know your life is vastly different from your pre-kids era when a spray bottle is reason for excitement...</li>
            <li>They are small enough to carry just the perfect amount of water for me to do one spraying of all my plants and rooms at the same time.  </li>
            <li>So glad we got pink!</li>
            <li>One bottle, in green, fits perfectly in the small circular indentation of my OXO brush and sponge caddy, made of metal and plastic, on my kitchen sink.</li>
            <li>I got a small, round purple one, perfect for what I needed it for, which was to keep in the car as a discipline threat to our dog.</li>
            <li>I keep diluted white vinegar in this, and a shaker of baking soda, in the bathroom to clean the sink and tub.  </li>
            <li>Long and Accurate Stream  </li>
            <li>First of all, I ordered thinking I was getting clear</li>
            <li>I require that superfine mist setting, which these each delivered for about 6 months so long as I emptied them immediately after use and rinsed them out thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I needed bottles that can produce a fine mist for my indoor plants and to just put humidity into my dry winter, heated air.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good range, and small enough that they don&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the dining room table or wherever they are scattered about the house.</li>
            <li>I like the smaller size vs a full size bottle.  </li>
            <li>Good sturdy bottle, only had for a short time, but seems like it will last.</li>
            <li>Nice small spray bottle</li>
            <li>I got this to spray peppermint oil around the house and so far it does this really well!</li>
            <li>Handle broke only after a hand full of spays.  </li>
            <li>This is a small bottle, but a nice size for my hair spritzes.</li>
            <li>But I figured blue would be cool, purple, or orange.</li>
            <li>Also very hard to even try to fit over the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine and the only time it leaked was when I didn&#x27;t completely twist the tip shut.  </li>
            <li>O long as you don&#x27;t knd getting a new one every couple of months, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>This think doesn&#x27;t squirt half the time - better off buying one at home depot.</li>
            <li>In many previous bottles water leaking out of the handle when pressed.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a quick learner, and it only took a couple squirts before he stopped jumping up on the counters.</li>
            <li>So much so that I dug back up the purchase to let you know that it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>The spray only comes out in one steady stream, and there is no way to adjust it to open the stream up more.</li>
            <li>This spray bottle was pretty cheap, so I decided to pick it up to teach my kittens not to be so naughty.</li>
            <li>It had decent reviews</li>
            <li>When I took the top off to check it out, then tried to screw back on, discovered it is crooked and won&#x27;t seat square.  </li>
            <li>Sure they are a touch more expensive than your typical HUGE spray bottles at your local garden supply, the problem those is, they are HUGE.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This little guy helps make sure that happens.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this little spray bottle and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Love this little spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>The tension is just a little greater than I&#x27;d prefer, but hey, I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li>I put chlorine bleach in it to clean the black mold from our hot tub.  </li>
            <li>The thing is completely accurate and I have absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li>Can adjust mist to spray very misty or direct spray.</li>
            <li>It is so top heavy</li>
            <li>They are small, but a useful size, about fit in the palm of your hand.  </li>
            <li>I saw the one pictured was green, my favorite color.</li>
            <li>This kind of spray bottle used to be common.</li>
            <li>One was doa, the other worked fine</li>
            <li>They are just the right size for the occasional use.  </li>
            <li>(too big, poor quality/didn&#x27;t last) spray bottle and this one has been the best by far.</li>
            <li>The bottle is comfortable in big or small hands and the reach of the trigger is comfortable as well.</li>
            <li>I threw it out and went to CVS to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>They shipped me bright purple and pink, while all I wanted was black and clear.</li>
            <li>I have to push hard and fit it on just right to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li>Can tilt bottle down and it sprays fine.</li>
            <li>The plastic is frosted, semi-see-through&lt;br /&gt;and comes in a very soft watery-aqua color.  </li>
            <li>Nice little bottle and holds up well to daily use as well as frequent &#x27;play&#x27; by a toddler.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what more quality anyone could want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the second order did not include two of them like the first order did.  </li>
            <li>And the one bottle that was sent is much smaller than the two that were sent on the first order.  </li>
            <li>I knocked the second star off because the bottle itself is a pretty flimsy plastic and also leaked when turned on its side -</li>
            <li>My 7-year old son loves squirt bottles and will go around the house squirting things for hours!  </li>
            <li>But if you are going to do that, then remember that you have to keep the hydrogen peroxide bottle in the dark because light breaks it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of other spray bottles before, and I always thought, \\&quot;We have amazing technology that allows us to make iPhones, supersonic planes, and nuclear submarines, but we can&#x27;t figure out how to make a simple spray bottle that actually works?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>None so far, but it is new.  </li>
            <li>At the risk of raining upon the parade of rave reviews, I feel compelled to point out that this is little more than an inexpensive and cheaply made dollar store sprayer.</li>
            <li>Every single day, I run into this problem, and if it weren&#x27;t one of the cheapest spray bottles I could get, I&#x27;d say it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>With a little rock sea salt and a bit of water, one can get fantastic results, that always varies.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small which is nice because it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as other bottles.</li>
            <li>This is a very nifty little squirt bottle that will fit where larger bottles won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a fogged clear plastic in the picture.</li>
            <li>The photo is clear and frosted, I want that one</li>
            <li>a whole big shard broke completely away.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pink,not clear as shown.</li>
            <li>It is working perfectly so far</li>
            <li>You can spray out nearly every drop that was in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on the smaller side, which is what I wanted, and works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a nozzle at the tip of the bottle that allows you to change the spray of water (direct stream- misty spray).</li>
            <li>It works as it should, and the mist is gentle enough for plants in my windowsill greenhouse.</li>
            <li>completely upright-</li>
            <li>The trigger is angled far to the front.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s holding up really well with daily use.</li>
            <li>Just buy an old atomizer if you need something that will produce a mist.</li>
            <li>Only real surprise was the size.  </li>
            <li>I use it to spray my two year old daughters hair in the morning to help me style it easier.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t expect this to last a month.</li>
            <li>So far we&#x27;ve gone through three of them.  </li>
            <li>Baby is 7 months old</li>
            <li>this spray bottle, only one spray type, like the size and wanted a good spray bottle that had at least 2 different spray types.</li>
            <li>but I got pink with a pink sprayer which is okay.</li>
            <li>Perfect for spraying nuisances, annoying roommates, or moochers with.</li>
            <li>The problem with it is that it only shoots out a thin, high powered stream rather than a nice mist, resulting in baby oil flying all over the shower.  </li>
            <li>Cute little pink bottle but the finest mist you can get from turning nozzle still spits heavy drops along with fine mist.</li>
            <li>This is the second spray bottle (the first was a different brand) that I&#x27;ve purchased for spraying baby oil after my shower.  </li>
            <li>I receive a teal-ish color, I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t get pink like some of the other people!</li>
            <li>I bought several cheap bottles at Target and they lasted less than a day.</li>
            <li>I am salvaging parts from other bottles to keep them working,but bottles that were only marginally more expensive are holding up much better.</li>
            <li>Mine is hot pink, but I don&#x27;t think you have any control over what color they send you.</li>
            <li>and I got hot pink.</li>
            <li>I bought something similar from Target and the hand pump didn&#x27;t last for more than a few days.</li>
            <li>Loses one star because it empties very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the green Tolco bottle but not the pink one which came with my order of three.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine they would probably last much longer if you were only using water.</li>
            <li>It worked for a few weeks then quit, I expected more</li>
            <li>The top is a little hard to screw back on sometimes, you have to set it just right.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the clear bottle with the black nozzle that&#x27;s shown in the picture; I got a light pink bottle with a fuschia nozzle and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li>As strange as it may seem, I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding a decent spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>The only con is that the top is hard to screw back on but with a little patience it will eventually go on the right way.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fault the company for my expectation that the bottle would be a bit larger, because it clearly states it&#x27;s 8 oz.</li>
            <li>Translucent bottle is clear enough to see how much fluid you&#x27;ve poured so far.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint, echoed by others, is not being able to order a specific color.</li>
            <li>I bought this bottle for some natural cleaner that only comes in a gallon size.  </li>
            <li>Barely musters a spit.</li>
            <li>First off, judging from the picture, I expected to receive three bottles and aprt of my order, but I only got one.</li>
            <li>Ordered 3 of these bottles and received 2 in a hot pink color and 1 blue.</li>
            <li>Note that you don&#x27;t know what color you will get so prepare yourself for the potential of hot pink.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a nozzle that has intermediate stages between the strong hard line of fluid and the misty fan spray.  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate, and I use the bottle to create a fine spray for my hair, which goes limp in dry weather.</li>
            <li>Now that I have received this in PINK, I read the other reviews &amp; appears pink is the color most often sent.  </li>
            <li>The only option is a single, straight stream which doesn&#x27;t work well for reviving my curls in the morning.</li>
            <li>It is kind of small and takes a couple pumps to get any spray action initially, but other than that it works well / as expected.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit smaller than I expected, but absolutely fits the purpose of what we needed it for (to mist an orchid).</li>
            <li>I bought two and got a light green and a pink.  </li>
            <li>An old sprayer we had on hand was breaking down, so I went looking for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Empty or near empty, it wants to tip over.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the bottle if I can&#x27;t shake it first - waste of money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love my dogs, but they can get VERY loud and they set each other off frequently.)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the peg supporting the squirt handle broke within two weeks, and the handle itself broke within the month under mild to moderate use.</li>
            <li>It really shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to make a decent water spray bottle, but the last 3 I bought from Target and</li>
            <li>It does spray really well, so I can&#x27;t give it less than 3 stars...</li>
            <li>All the previous water bottles I have bought have not sprayed very well</li>
            <li>I was tired of using cheap spray bottles that barely worked.</li>
            <li>To begin with, mine arrived shattered - the plastic body was so thin and flimsy that I can see how that might easily have happened.</li>
            <li>So as long as you don&#x27;t mind a random chance for the color, this is a great little sprayer to purchase.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that it is food safe, come to think of it, and the big \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; sticker on the bottom makes me a little</li>
            <li>I put my lotto-body setting lotion in this container to dilute it, with sprays very well while setting my hair in curlers for the dryer without making a mess.</li>
            <li>Not good enough for my needs but too cheap to send back.</li>
            <li>This is a very efficient little spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not too much, not too little.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much you twist open the nozzle to change the pattern all it does is squirt a little line of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good or bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for spraying bad cats to get them off the table.</li>

            <li> Surprising strong spray!  </li>
            <li> This bottle is a great size to easily manipulate.</li>
            <li> gives a real fine mist spray up to a stream - nice adjustment control on the spray head</li>
            <li> These are great bottles with fine adjusting capabilities.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leak when you tilt it, like the one I was replacing, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> It has a nice spray, nice trigger, seems durable and doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> The spray/mist is good for refreshing my curly hair; it comes out diffuse, which is what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Handy spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Nice to hold.</li>
            <li> Came fast and works great!</li>
            <li> It encourages good reviewers to publish more and help the rest of us.</li>
            <li> It encourages good reviewers to publish more and help the rest of us.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t leak at all, so that is nice.</li>
            <li> They spray nicely and they look nice too.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy, compact, and the spray is adjustable from \\&quot;mist\\&quot; to \\&quot;squirt\\&quot;, depending on your need.</li>
            <li> I ordered six of these and nicely was given seven.  </li>
            <li> Nice spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Nice and durable bottle.</li>
            <li> These bottles are so handy.</li>
            <li> Although it was cheap, there are cheaper ones at the Dollar Store or wherever that I&#x27;m sure work just as great.</li>
            <li> even though I got it at a price that was good for me it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Been very happy with this one so far.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to be able to choose which colors you get.</li>
            <li> Gotta keep it filled if you spray at an angle, but it&#x27;s a good size.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and the size is just right.</li>
            <li> Operation is EASY!</li>
            <li> This sprayer sprays a very fine mist.</li>
            <li> Very fast, great price.</li>
            <li> Great product - exactly what I was</li>
            <li> bought this for very light duty as a mister for house plants.</li>
            <li> Nice fine spray.</li>
            <li> It sprays a nice fine even mist of water</li>
            <li> but when they arrived there is no indication on the package or bottle that these are safe plastic.  </li>
            <li> love the way the spray tip can be adjusted to manipulate the out come or way the water is released.</li>
            <li> love the way the spray tip can be adjusted to manipulate the out come or way the water is released.</li>
            <li> The inner straw-like tube is the perfect length to draw from the bottle&#x27;s bottom-most recesses.  </li>
            <li> Just completely mind-boggling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Love the size, love how it evenly sprays water.</li>
            <li> I love this bottle because of its size.</li>
            <li> Also, there are times you have to keep turning the top of the nozzle head to ensure an even spray</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more as the needs arise.</li>
            <li> and I will not hesitate to order more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna order a couple more to keep around for plants or ironing.</li>
            <li> Just be sure you order the color you need.</li>
            <li> Im sure thatll be the outcome.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the trigger mechanisms seem okay-</li>
            <li> The plastic bottles themselves are a softer, more &amp;#34;bendable&amp;#34; plastic rather than rigid.</li>
            <li> Its ok</li>
            <li> Now I pull the trigger with my thumb and it seems better.</li>
            <li> Yes I have to refill it more often, but it is still not even every time.  </li>
            <li> then it would be better</li>
            <li> works well :)</li>
            <li> cute and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle is okay.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use these for poison sprays, as the contents can leak when the top is unscrewed.</li>
            <li> glad I bought two.  </li>
            <li> These are durable and cute.  </li>
            <li> I love everything aboutt his bottle.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying more for dedicated usage</li>
            <li> otherwise the pump won&#x27;t be able to pick up any of the bottle&#x27;s contents.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the tube should be more flexible or bent in  way so that it tilts towards the bottom of the bottle when it is tipped during use?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m entirly satisfied with this bottle.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
            <li> 13 words are required so I&#x27;m typing more words here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love a glass version.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to have cleaning chemicals in some, make sure the kids know the rules</li>
            <li> is more detail. \\&quot;Flimsy\\</li>
            <li> It does OK at this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it, would definitely recommend it, and would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these spray bottles.  </li>
            <li> Love this spray bottle.</li>
            <li> It would help to be a bit more sturdy</li>
            <li> Much better quality than what you can get for cheaper at Walmart or target.</li>
            <li> (Its been dropped too many times to count)&lt;br</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t shake the bottle or tilt it so that the liquid touches the top because it leaks if you do.  </li>
            <li> I think I am safe.  </li>
            <li> Did not include the spray top.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many spray bottles.  </li>
            <li> and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I will buy them again if I ever need more</li>
            <li> Received these water bottles, filled one up and it worked!  </li>
            <li> I love the size</li>
            <li> that he&#x27;s more mobile.  </li>
            <li> It is solidly made the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Much better than the &amp;#34;spray/off&#x27; style  for misting plants.</li>
            <li> This works great - no mess and a nice misty stream.</li>
            <li> So its very accessible and entertaining at most times of the day</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, good quality, super cheap</li>
            <li> the kids like playing with these, and they make pretty good squirt guns.</li>
            <li> This was a cute bottle that I can use to easily refill with bleach water, cleaner or whatever else</li>
            <li> This one, so far, works very well and sprays a very fine mist, perfect for misting poultry with water in the oven and so forth.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very sturdy and has good stream throw.  </li>
            <li> wet - the bottles have a stream or a spray, excellent &amp;#34;pressure,&amp;#34; easy to use/squeeze, they don&#x27;t leak when sideways (fallen</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t look flimsy or easily breakable.  </li>
            <li> Shoots far and precisely, which is great for when the cat is across the room scratching your couch.</li>
            <li> These things are really easy to shatter---and break.  </li>
            <li> Its so easy to use</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and do not stress my hands.  </li>
            <li> A lot break easily - too large,leak,  </li>
            <li> This spray bottle works well and is easy to refill.</li>
            <li> These bottles have an easy to use twist end to control the spray diameter and strength.</li>
            <li> Trigger handle enables strong pump leverage, in contrast to those finger-spray bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strong spray.</li>
            <li> Still going strong after two month.</li>
            <li> Strong and durable</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Spray is strong, even, and adjustable.</li>
            <li> The walls of the container are about as strong as plasticized paper, and I&#x27;m giving the sprayer the benefit of the doubt</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> The spray is a kind of &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; instead of a steady stream which I love because it&#x27;s easier to distribute product throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> This is actually my SECOND order for this particular bottle, the first one was great, good adjustable nozzle, nice mist and spray.</li>
            <li> It holds about a cup of liquid and the squirter adjusts from fine to stream.</li>
            <li> fine though</li>
            <li> Work just fine for small-scale garden spraying, or spraying on yourself while walking in 90-100 degree weather.</li>
            <li> Fine.</li>
            <li> It worked fine until it fell off my belt and the bottle cracked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spray bottle and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> The bottle sprays a fine mist of water instead of doing a stream like some spray bottles.</li>
            <li> They suit our purpose fine.  </li>
            <li> This spray bottle does not deliver a fine spray, so I don&#x27;t recommend it for use with setting lotions.</li>
            <li> For the price, this little thing is priceless.</li>
            <li> Perfect little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Thought these came up as BPA free</li>
            <li> I used it when I was making my own shampoo that was really runny and required a spray bottle to apply.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The trigger handle pumps smoothly.  </li>
            <li> , i.e., a smooth even spray.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> Packaged securely.</li>
            <li> However, it was cheap and it does 95% of what I wanted, so</li>
            <li> Comfortable.</li>
            <li> They work great as sprayers and misters and can reach about 20ft with proper angling.  </li>
            <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t fit on the bottle.</li>
            <li> (Also works great when set to stream at keeping cats off counters, out of Christmas trees, and ultimately away from my sharpening stuff...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown money away on cheap spray bottles (I could have returned them, but one never does.)</li>
            <li> Cheap Spray bottle- Would be overpriced @ .50.</li>
            <li> Had it a few months now and still works great, no issues!</li>
            <li> It should be marketed as a cheap water gun instead of a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Also I don&#x27;t think this thing is BPA free, but</li>
            <li> The bottle is sturdy, but light, and you can adjust the spray.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I had another use for it than what I intended.</li>
            <li> Sprayer seems well made for a cheap bottle.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have a bunch of them that you can have for free.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I decided to order another one.</li>
            <li> This bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is great because it gives a larger trigger displacement and this limits the number of times you have to squeeze the trigger to get the amount of spray you want.</li>
            <li> Some choice of color would have been nice, but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;on creates a nice gentle mist.  </li>
            <li> I keep these on several counter tops around the apartment to spray the gnats and mosquitoes that fly around the bathroom mirror, kitchen counter, and me.</li>
            <li> I keep them filled with 91% rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Nice color (bright pink), too.</li>
            <li> These bottles are just the right size and so far the sprayers work great.</li>
            <li> So many of these spray bottles just don&#x27;t spray correctly, but this one works right from the start.  </li>
            <li> These 8oz bottles are great for spraying even the largest of plants (within reason, they are only 8oz!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nozzle adjusts from closed, to an ultra-fine mist (perfect for foliar feeding), all the way to a solid stream (great cat deterrent, with pure water of course!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light, small, great spray!</li>
            <li> Perfect for a small spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> I just like the first order better.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> Has a good misting spray, doesn&#x27;t make a good hard squirt</li>
            <li> You fill it up with your favorite spay-able fluid and it sprays out in a nice adjustable fashion.</li>
            <li> The whole unit has a nice solid weight to it (many small spray bottles are feather-weight and seem really cheap and flimsy); the sprayer seems good quality and fits perfectly to hand; the spray action is dependable every time, no sputtering or having to pump it to prime it; it can be adjusted from a fine mist to heavier droplets; the tube goes all the way to the bottom of the bottle to capture all the water.</li>
            <li> Nothing really special</li>
            <li> Nothing special for the price.</li>
            <li> And much more convenient than large spray bottles.</li>
            <li> These are a good size and shoot pretty far.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and does exactly what it says it can - sprays water.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this is such a good product I had to.</li>
            <li> These bottles are so cool and work so well.</li>
            <li> Smal, Cheap, Powerful sprayer</li>
            <li> if it isn&#x27;t full, it topples over  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a good quality spray bottle at my local Target</li>
            <li> &quot; is the word that comes most readily to mind.  </li>
            <li> You would think it would be simple to find a good squirt bottle.</li>
            <li> I make bleach t-shirts for my craft store, so I definitely did some hunting to find a good spray bottle and these ended up being the winners.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also very study as it has taken many tumbles and still has all of it&#x27;s plastic parts.</li>
            <li> Its a good price and its a simple product</li>
            <li> When you set it down it is perfectly balanced and doesn&#x27;t even come close to thinking about tipping over, very stable.</li>
            <li> A fine misting spray, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the squirts would be super &amp;#34;concentrated&amp;#34; if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised and perfect size for small plants or using to spray clothes while ironing.</li>
            <li> action on the trigger is good and the whole unit is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> this was for my dog training, arrived quickly, pefect size.</li>
            <li> and they always stopped working fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> It will stand out when I need to find it quickly.</li>
            <li> The complete item is very sturdy, handy and works really fine.</li>
            <li> When I first filled it the water came out in a stream</li>
            <li> Very cheap plastic (you can easily push in), which is the last thing I want for the purpose I bought it for (storing vegetable wash).  </li>
            <li> Pretty good although it&#x27;s a lot smaller than pictured.</li>
            <li> The units r very sturdy and it&#x27;s easy to label them, either with a Sharpie marking pen or even a product label off a product container.</li>
            <li> I suppose since I&#x27;m ok with my masculinity, that&#x27;s ok as long</li>
            <li> This product is solid, well-made, doesn&#x27;t leak, and has both mist and squirt options (with pretty good distance).</li>
            <li> It shoots out a satisfyingly strong, straight spray.  </li>
            <li> These are easy to handle and spray very well...</li>
            <li> You can adjust it to spray pretty far which is nice.</li>
            <li> It comes pretty clean - I still rinsed it out before spraying plants and animals, but there&#x27;s no unpleasant chemical odor.</li>
            <li> Overall though, for the price, these bottles were a good value and thankfully, my yogi friends loved the hot pink color.</li>
            <li> While the hinge lasted it was working fine, and had it not broken</li>
            <li> Great little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> A great little spray bottle and it does not leak.</li>
            <li> This little pump sprayer works great.  </li>
            <li> Great little spray bottles for whatever your needs.</li>
            <li> great little item for spraying my house plants with water.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I got pink, which was fine since it was for my 3 year old daughter, but might not have been as great if it was for my son.</li>
            <li> so they sit up on their own and won&#x27;t knock over easily as some other spray bottles this size tend to be.</li>
            <li> The one I was sent is bright pink.  </li>
            <li> All the spray bottles sold at Target have a really cheap pump mechanism and the volume of each spray in those bottles is very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> but why did they have to send me a bright pink one?</li>
            <li> Had for a few weeks and works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price for thin liquids like water, vinegar and liquid</li>
            <li> This is a useful feature when mixing two liquids.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of junk - I have no idea why anyone thinks it is useful at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The sprayer is kind of big for my hands, and it sometimes malfunctions.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe so many people would write these fantastic reviews all for a simple spray bottle...</li>
            <li> Doing some test sprays produced a good range of spray area (focused stream versus wide spray).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the performance so far (have had it only a month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was ordering one to replace my old one that I dropped and the top broke off.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the bottle came in pink which was surprising based on the product image.</li>
            <li> what it&#x27;s worth:</li>
            <li> A nice smaller size.  </li>
            <li> The Tolco 8 oz proves it once again.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I guess it was worth it.</li>
            <li> They are useful.</li>
            <li> I use my green Tolco bottles for the greatest cleaning product on the market, Bio-Green Clean, and have several Tolco bottles spread around the house now.</li>
            <li> One didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I ordered it right off the page I had ordered before.  </li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> I got this to water my starter pots for some seeds I planted and this works just right.</li>
            <li> (It is laying on its side right now, and nothing is leaking out)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> One or two sprays and the gnats fall right to the ground</li>
            <li> This thing is perfect for misting plants, spraying my cat when he&#x27;s being naughty, and hitting giant flies on the ceiling that are trying to spread disease.</li>
            <li> It is a small botel which requires refilling frequently... but it mists perfectly!  </li>
            <li> The first caved in on itself and since this one is nice and sturdy and did not do that, it received an extra star.  </li>
            <li> I think they are a good value for the money, and the reason for the four stars is the threading is a bit twitchy (just be careful) and one of the seven refused to spray at first without some persuasion.  </li>
            <li> Great little bottle, I use it to spray my cats when they misbehave!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use; has a tiny dial on the nozzle where one can adjust the flow from a spritz to a stream of water.</li>
            <li> Great size for small bathroom-works well</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty fun.  </li>
            <li> Works great, small, fits in my cabinet</li>
            <li> It is not worth the $5,  seeing the price I felt it would be of superior quality than the alternatives.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, really.</li>
            <li> Smart cats!)</li>
            <li> It sprays a large volume!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a widespread spray action than a straight jetstream line-esque squirt.</li>
            <li> I saw that other reviewers didn&#x27;t necessarily get a good color - mine was a purple top with translucent clear bottom (the translucency is from the surface being finely pebbled).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny to get so excited about a water bottle, but I had been looking for a decent one for quite a while before I found this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two small drawbacks, but most people won&#x27;t care because they&#x27;ll be so happy to have found a spray bottle that actually works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can adjust it from a clear stream to a fine mist, and anything in between.</li>
            <li> wonderful small spray bottle for various uses</li>
            <li> so have to refill pretty often</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Much higher quality than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Size was exactly what I was looking for (I was making some home-made yoga mat cleaner as gifts for a couple of fellow yogis).</li>
            <li> I am ordering several more to have around the house.</li>
            <li> but it would be better if it was a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> Solid construction, looks nicer than most spray bottles.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the fact that it is only an 8 ounce bottle and will not work for what I had intended.</li>
            <li> you can get better at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> This bottle leaks and seems cheaply constructed; far from the quality I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> They function will enough for spray bottles, but I was wanted they sprayer to have more of an adjustment.  </li>
            <li> The spray bottle is exactly what I needed to mist my air plants.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived with no flaws or defects, and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do: it sprays water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this is one I&#x27;ll be buying more of in the future.  </li>
            <li> first sprayer that I received was severely ruptured with a two-inch tear in the container.</li>
            <li> I doubt that the sprayer will hold up to more regular and intensive use.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted at a very affordable price!</li>
            <li> The top hasn&#x27;t disintegrated in my hand like the last squirt bottle I bought.</li>
            <li> but these do exactly what you expect of them.  </li>
            <li> (It actually has a rounded shoulder on top.)</li>
            <li> so the first time I went to shake the bottle, the contents splashed everywhere.</li>
            <li> I use it as a water gun when my wife and I have water fights randomly in the summer, works great!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Tolco!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s s sturdy acrylic, pretty, and</li>
            <li> This one is more solid than the others, seals well, and does the job.</li>
            <li> Out of several spray bottles I have tested out, these are the most efficient.</li>
            <li> Why show a nice neutral color bottle and then send a pink one?  </li>
            <li> They make more industrial spray bottles if you are looking to use it for some sort of manual labor task such as making a bleach spray bottle to use for cleaning.</li>
            <li> But other than needing a bit more attention, these are great little bottles for the price.</li>
            <li> My other dripped drops of water and this one sprays evenly and in a nice mist.  </li>
            <li> Nice small compact easy to  hold  and nice spray for indoor plants.&lt;br /&gt;Expected red,yellow,blue or green but</li>
            <li> So cheap that it is not quite worth the time to send it back.</li>
            <li> The spray is always ready to go on first pump, even if u haven&#x27;t used it in days.</li>
            <li> The thumb hook on the back side of the handle makes it much more comfortable to use compared to standard spray bottles.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have pointed this out as well, so it appears to be an issue regardless of the seller (I purchased mine from Big Fly Sports).</li>
            <li> to much to say about a spray bottle, but it&#x27;s exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty much all I was hoping for in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> They are small and well made, and can shoot a stream a good distance.</li>
            <li> This bottle is small but a good size for my use.</li>
            <li> It is good for hair or watering small plants where you don&#x27;t want a stream of water.</li>
            <li> The trigger action is smooth and its quick to spray with out excessive &#x27;dry shots&#x27; which is great when you have a wiggling toddler waiting for a mist of water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s great for wetting down short hair that is being temperamental and misting a cat that is also being temperamental.</li>
            <li> Large radius of spraying.</li>
            <li> and I have not had any issues with mistakenly getting large grips on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> but I certainly won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> One star ding because one of the bottles screw top is a bit loose, and requires care when threading.</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not misting a greenhouse full of plants, these will probably be adequate.</li>
            <li> The alcohol evaporates quickly and leaves no mess.</li>
            <li> It was fine with me that it isn&#x27;t the same triangular shape as what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The most recent one lasted less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Anybody have any suggestions for a sprayer that&#x27;s more durable?  </li>
            <li> This spray bottle works fine and is small and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Really gets a lot of water spraying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the cheap flimsy device I feared at this low price.  </li>
            <li> I use mine to shine my shoes, and it has been very durable.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short and takes up a lot of horizontal space, but it does fit in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Plastic is not thin.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold much, but the spray is adjustable and it pumps a lot out.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34; but you can still see if water is in it, and how much.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle really helps in the application.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and relatively quiet.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t love is they sent me a bottle in pink.</li>
            <li> Like the gentle spray coming from this bottle..</li>
            <li> (Hope for pink, it is better than the alternative. . . .)</li>
            <li> Literally it was only after I filled it once.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bread baker and use it to gently spray water on the loaf before going into the oven</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> Tall, white and industrial looking and sound like a goose when you pull the trigger.</li>
            <li> maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description good enough, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I liked the green colored one pictured.</li>
            <li> but it is most certainly NOT a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The intake tub inside the bottle is very rigid and after the liquid level gets down to a certain point, you may have to make sure that you are holding the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are a ton of other uses for it as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy more for other household applications</li>
            <li> Even my husband was excited about how this spray bottle worked - you know your life is vastly different from your pre-kids era when a spray bottle is reason for excitement...</li>
            <li> They are small enough to carry just the perfect amount of water for me to do one spraying of all my plants and rooms at the same time.  </li>
            <li> So glad we got pink!</li>
            <li> One bottle, in green, fits perfectly in the small circular indentation of my OXO brush and sponge caddy, made of metal and plastic, on my kitchen sink.</li>
            <li> I got a small, round purple one, perfect for what I needed it for, which was to keep in the car as a discipline threat to our dog.</li>
            <li> I keep diluted white vinegar in this, and a shaker of baking soda, in the bathroom to clean the sink and tub.  </li>
            <li> Long and Accurate Stream  </li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered thinking I was getting clear</li>
            <li> I require that superfine mist setting, which these each delivered for about 6 months so long as I emptied them immediately after use and rinsed them out thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I needed bottles that can produce a fine mist for my indoor plants and to just put humidity into my dry winter, heated air.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good range, and small enough that they don&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the dining room table or wherever they are scattered about the house.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller size vs a full size bottle.  </li>
            <li> Good sturdy bottle, only had for a short time, but seems like it will last.</li>
            <li> Nice small spray bottle</li>
            <li> I got this to spray peppermint oil around the house and so far it does this really well!</li>
            <li> Handle broke only after a hand full of spays.  </li>
            <li> This is a small bottle, but a nice size for my hair spritzes.</li>
            <li> But I figured blue would be cool, purple, or orange.</li>
            <li> Also very hard to even try to fit over the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine and the only time it leaked was when I didn&#x27;t completely twist the tip shut.  </li>
            <li> O long as you don&#x27;t knd getting a new one every couple of months, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> This think doesn&#x27;t squirt half the time - better off buying one at home depot.</li>
            <li> In many previous bottles water leaking out of the handle when pressed.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a quick learner, and it only took a couple squirts before he stopped jumping up on the counters.</li>
            <li> So much so that I dug back up the purchase to let you know that it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> The spray only comes out in one steady stream, and there is no way to adjust it to open the stream up more.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle was pretty cheap, so I decided to pick it up to teach my kittens not to be so naughty.</li>
            <li> It had decent reviews</li>
            <li> When I took the top off to check it out, then tried to screw back on, discovered it is crooked and won&#x27;t seat square.  </li>
            <li> Sure they are a touch more expensive than your typical HUGE spray bottles at your local garden supply, the problem those is, they are HUGE.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This little guy helps make sure that happens.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this little spray bottle and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this little spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> The tension is just a little greater than I&#x27;d prefer, but hey, I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> I put chlorine bleach in it to clean the black mold from our hot tub.  </li>
            <li> The thing is completely accurate and I have absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Can adjust mist to spray very misty or direct spray.</li>
            <li> It is so top heavy</li>
            <li> They are small, but a useful size, about fit in the palm of your hand.  </li>
            <li> I saw the one pictured was green, my favorite color.</li>
            <li> This kind of spray bottle used to be common.</li>
            <li> One was doa, the other worked fine</li>
            <li> They are just the right size for the occasional use.  </li>
            <li> (too big, poor quality/didn&#x27;t last) spray bottle and this one has been the best by far.</li>
            <li> The bottle is comfortable in big or small hands and the reach of the trigger is comfortable as well.</li>
            <li> I threw it out and went to CVS to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> They shipped me bright purple and pink, while all I wanted was black and clear.</li>
            <li> I have to push hard and fit it on just right to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li> Can tilt bottle down and it sprays fine.</li>
            <li> The plastic is frosted, semi-see-through&lt;br /&gt;and comes in a very soft watery-aqua color.  </li>
            <li> Nice little bottle and holds up well to daily use as well as frequent &#x27;play&#x27; by a toddler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what more quality anyone could want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the second order did not include two of them like the first order did.  </li>
            <li> And the one bottle that was sent is much smaller than the two that were sent on the first order.  </li>
            <li> I knocked the second star off because the bottle itself is a pretty flimsy plastic and also leaked when turned on its side -</li>
            <li> My 7-year old son loves squirt bottles and will go around the house squirting things for hours!  </li>
            <li> But if you are going to do that, then remember that you have to keep the hydrogen peroxide bottle in the dark because light breaks it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of other spray bottles before, and I always thought, \\&quot;We have amazing technology that allows us to make iPhones, supersonic planes, and nuclear submarines, but we can&#x27;t figure out how to make a simple spray bottle that actually works?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> None so far, but it is new.  </li>
            <li> At the risk of raining upon the parade of rave reviews, I feel compelled to point out that this is little more than an inexpensive and cheaply made dollar store sprayer.</li>
            <li> Every single day, I run into this problem, and if it weren&#x27;t one of the cheapest spray bottles I could get, I&#x27;d say it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> With a little rock sea salt and a bit of water, one can get fantastic results, that always varies.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small which is nice because it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as other bottles.</li>
            <li> This is a very nifty little squirt bottle that will fit where larger bottles won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a fogged clear plastic in the picture.</li>
            <li> The photo is clear and frosted, I want that one</li>
            <li> a whole big shard broke completely away.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink,not clear as shown.</li>
            <li> It is working perfectly so far</li>
            <li> You can spray out nearly every drop that was in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the smaller side, which is what I wanted, and works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a nozzle at the tip of the bottle that allows you to change the spray of water (direct stream- misty spray).</li>
            <li> It works as it should, and the mist is gentle enough for plants in my windowsill greenhouse.</li>
            <li> completely upright-</li>
            <li> The trigger is angled far to the front.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s holding up really well with daily use.</li>
            <li> Just buy an old atomizer if you need something that will produce a mist.</li>
            <li> Only real surprise was the size.  </li>
            <li> I use it to spray my two year old daughters hair in the morning to help me style it easier.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t expect this to last a month.</li>
            <li> So far we&#x27;ve gone through three of them.  </li>
            <li> Baby is 7 months old</li>
            <li> this spray bottle, only one spray type, like the size and wanted a good spray bottle that had at least 2 different spray types.</li>
            <li> but I got pink with a pink sprayer which is okay.</li>
            <li> Perfect for spraying nuisances, annoying roommates, or moochers with.</li>
            <li> The problem with it is that it only shoots out a thin, high powered stream rather than a nice mist, resulting in baby oil flying all over the shower.  </li>
            <li> Cute little pink bottle but the finest mist you can get from turning nozzle still spits heavy drops along with fine mist.</li>
            <li> This is the second spray bottle (the first was a different brand) that I&#x27;ve purchased for spraying baby oil after my shower.  </li>
            <li> I receive a teal-ish color, I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t get pink like some of the other people!</li>
            <li> I bought several cheap bottles at Target and they lasted less than a day.</li>
            <li> I am salvaging parts from other bottles to keep them working,but bottles that were only marginally more expensive are holding up much better.</li>
            <li> Mine is hot pink, but I don&#x27;t think you have any control over what color they send you.</li>
            <li> and I got hot pink.</li>
            <li> I bought something similar from Target and the hand pump didn&#x27;t last for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> Loses one star because it empties very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the green Tolco bottle but not the pink one which came with my order of three.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine they would probably last much longer if you were only using water.</li>
            <li> It worked for a few weeks then quit, I expected more</li>
            <li> The top is a little hard to screw back on sometimes, you have to set it just right.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the clear bottle with the black nozzle that&#x27;s shown in the picture; I got a light pink bottle with a fuschia nozzle and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> As strange as it may seem, I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding a decent spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> The only con is that the top is hard to screw back on but with a little patience it will eventually go on the right way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fault the company for my expectation that the bottle would be a bit larger, because it clearly states it&#x27;s 8 oz.</li>
            <li> Translucent bottle is clear enough to see how much fluid you&#x27;ve poured so far.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, echoed by others, is not being able to order a specific color.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle for some natural cleaner that only comes in a gallon size.  </li>
            <li> Barely musters a spit.</li>
            <li> First off, judging from the picture, I expected to receive three bottles and aprt of my order, but I only got one.</li>
            <li> Ordered 3 of these bottles and received 2 in a hot pink color and 1 blue.</li>
            <li> Note that you don&#x27;t know what color you will get so prepare yourself for the potential of hot pink.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a nozzle that has intermediate stages between the strong hard line of fluid and the misty fan spray.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate, and I use the bottle to create a fine spray for my hair, which goes limp in dry weather.</li>
            <li> Now that I have received this in PINK, I read the other reviews &amp; appears pink is the color most often sent.  </li>
            <li> The only option is a single, straight stream which doesn&#x27;t work well for reviving my curls in the morning.</li>
            <li> It is kind of small and takes a couple pumps to get any spray action initially, but other than that it works well / as expected.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit smaller than I expected, but absolutely fits the purpose of what we needed it for (to mist an orchid).</li>
            <li> I bought two and got a light green and a pink.  </li>
            <li> An old sprayer we had on hand was breaking down, so I went looking for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Empty or near empty, it wants to tip over.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the bottle if I can&#x27;t shake it first - waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love my dogs, but they can get VERY loud and they set each other off frequently.)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the peg supporting the squirt handle broke within two weeks, and the handle itself broke within the month under mild to moderate use.</li>
            <li> It really shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to make a decent water spray bottle, but the last 3 I bought from Target and</li>
            <li> It does spray really well, so I can&#x27;t give it less than 3 stars...</li>
            <li> All the previous water bottles I have bought have not sprayed very well</li>
            <li> I was tired of using cheap spray bottles that barely worked.</li>
            <li> To begin with, mine arrived shattered - the plastic body was so thin and flimsy that I can see how that might easily have happened.</li>
            <li> So as long as you don&#x27;t mind a random chance for the color, this is a great little sprayer to purchase.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that it is food safe, come to think of it, and the big \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; sticker on the bottom makes me a little</li>
            <li> I put my lotto-body setting lotion in this container to dilute it, with sprays very well while setting my hair in curlers for the dryer without making a mess.</li>
            <li> Not good enough for my needs but too cheap to send back.</li>
            <li> This is a very efficient little spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not too much, not too little.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much you twist open the nozzle to change the pattern all it does is squirt a little line of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good or bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for spraying bad cats to get them off the table.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used plain water in it, and used it very infrequently.</li>
            <li> Need a steady stream to shoot your little brother?</li>
            <li> So far the other one still works--</li>
            <li> I try to keep everything gender neutral and hot pink does not fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the bottle to spray my ivy plants so they don&#x27;t get dusty, and the bottle is nice and small so it doesn&#x27;t stand out when place amongst my plants.  </li>
            <li> The plastic quality of the spray top is not good enough, so the hinge broke after a week, and renders the bottle pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Black is clearly pictured, but \\&quot;Assorted Colors\\&quot; leaves it open to interpretation I suppose.</li>
            <li> They would leak and generally not spray well.  </li>
            <li> The image online is of a clear and black bottle.</li>
            <li> As a male jock, I was hoping for blue, but I got pink.</li>
            <li> BUT, though it might not be my choice, I think the underside of my bathroom cabinet will not be offended, and I am not inviting Martha Stewart to help spray the toilet, so</li>
            <li> For those who complain about the price - think about how long you&#x27;ll be using this thing.</li>
            <li> It take multiple tries.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t spray as far and in a narrow stream.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s strange</li>
            <li> I searched for empty GLASS spray bottles, since I need them for use with essential oils, and this bottle came up in the search results.</li>
            <li> That may be my fault, however if you do not want pink don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> and they came in 2 colors (blue and pink), which works for me.  </li>
            <li> , I cant see anyone posting a long review on this item.</li>
            <li> The second one I ordered I included a note with my order, \\&quot;Please no pink this time, green if you have it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Out of all the colors (don&#x27;t care if blue, green, clear, black, red)</li>
            <li> : They work very well on small yappy dogs too!</li>
            <li> From spay to stream, no drips or other possible problems arose, which is as it should be.</li>
            <li> I received a different bottle it was not what I see in other reviews</li>
            <li> I recieved mine the other day and it keeps toppling over and it will only shoot a stream at all rotation spots on the spout.  </li>
            <li> that don&#x27;t work or not for very long.  </li>
            <li> I use the spray bottles in our chicken coop for coop cleaners, refreshing sprays and other homemade sprays that I make.</li>
            <li> I also keep a mixture of vinegar and water in one, next to my sink, to disinfect fruits, vegetables, cutting boards, and kitchen surfaces--in combination with spritzes of hydrogen peroxide, which I keep in its original light-blocking opaque bottle, topped with the spray head from a Tolco.</li>
            <li> only real complain, aside from the unrealistic one that they don&#x27;t last forever, is that the two I got were both neon pink.</li>
            <li> Instead of a &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34; color, I received a hideous black and white zebra stripe bottle.</li>
            <li> You can probably find one for less at a local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are tired of struggling with the large spray bottles, you might want to give these a try.</li>
            <li> i got crappy color pink.</li>
            <li> I got a pink one.  </li>
            <li> I was not expecting to receive a pink product.</li>
            <li> Also, it came in pink, which was a surprise and not what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> but, their drive for people food is stronger than their aversion to getting sprayed and they stark sneaking back to the table within a few minutes, only to be sprayed again.</li>
            <li> They send me a pink bottle for a boy.</li>
            <li> It often gets things wet in between myself and my target.  </li>
            <li> one I received was pink.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my waterstones wet whils honing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll be pink.  </li>
            <li> Well, it was pink.</li>
            <li> : Can&#x27;t pick the color, I got pink.</li>
            <li> The pink nozzle stopped working one day after purchased.  </li>
            <li> They sent me a pink bottle even though the picture shows a \\&quot;frosted\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li> I got a pink one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I got a pink one.</li>
            <li> I have to refill it about every 2 days, but that was expected.</li>
            <li> But it was pink.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Lasts linger than expected and you can adjust for either spray or line of water.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d have known pink was an option</li>
            <li> What we received was pink.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in my art room to wet paint and keep watercolor paper damp.</li>
            <li> Wish they would have sent something other than pink.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, I can&#x27;t believe I am taking the time to review a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small yet shoots out a big stream of water.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not better than the one&#x27;s at your local dollar store.</li>
            <li> If you are using it for disinfecting purposes, one can be for vinegar and the other for hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> One for my 50/50 mixture of Bac Out and the other for homemade diaper wipes solution.</li>
            <li> Small enough to be portable.</li>
            <li> I received a PINK one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plastic and PINK!</li>
            <li> seems like i find endless uses for it...</li>
            <li> But I got PINK!</li>
            <li> At least not in 4 different stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them to spray my cats when they are destroying something, sharpening their claws on furniture, trying to run outside, etc.</li>
            <li> not much to say except the worked, they squirt, and they held the water!  </li>
            <li> If it is not straight up and down it will not spray.</li>
            <li> I bought three, for separate purposes, and ended up with two pink and one black.</li>
            <li> The image shows a black spray bottle and what arrived was pink.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, on the day it arrived, it also sprang a leak, with a large crack up the side.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are somewhat textured which makes them a little easier to grip when wet.</li>
            <li> But it is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry if you were hoping that Yhis was a real bargain, but this is not that.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle of returning it,</li>
            <li> Squirt my cat when he is naughty.</li>
            <li> So far the trigger has broken on all that I have had.  </li>
            <li> I use it to squirt my kitten when he&#x27;s being naughty.</li>
            <li> The bottles are like Weebles; they Weeble, but they do fall down.</li>
            <li> Five stars hands down.</li>
            <li> I could only find very small ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i have to order over and over again until i get black.</li>
            <li> I knocked off 1-star because the sprayer head did leak slightly even after the nozzle was turned to the &#x27;Off&#x27; position.</li>
            <li> Fine for me, but I would have been a bit disappointed if I wasn&#x27;t a chick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The picture here is a black bottle and they do advertise that it is \\&quot;frosted assorted colors\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was ordering black</li>
            <li> So, at this moment (January 2014) &amp;#34;various colors&amp;#34; are not industrial black with clear/opaque.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those odd products that you buy hoping you never have to use it.</li>
            <li> A somewhat appalling lavender/purple--with a similar slight purple tint to the bottle.  </li>
            <li> (Which is not cool at all.)</li>
            <li> The seal is tight.  </li>
            <li> Ehat appears to be typical handling by the post office was diffident to literally shred the container.</li>
            <li> Wish I had received the color in the picture (green with black sprayer)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several bottles that were just too weak.</li>
            <li> you can spray in a mist or in a squirt with these misty little bottles.</li>
            <li> For a little effort, you get a lot done.  </li>
            <li> I played around with the knob for a little bit until I got it to stop spraying streams.</li>
            <li> I use it to spray a little bit water on shirts to get the wrinkles out.  </li>
            <li> but every time my little guy knocks it off the changing table</li>
            <li> You can use this little bottle for a lot of functions.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for clear or green, but that is random selection for ya.</li>
            <li> so two of these see heavy, everyday usage and have held up for 8 months.  </li>
            <li> Broke within a few days.</li>
            <li> They learn to stop begging for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I had one that was Dead On Arrival</li>
            <li> Save yourself a few dollars.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I have the green one.</li>
            <li> Too small and not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> The mist is even and firm.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small water bottle I could carry with me when walking my (occasionally) naughty dog.</li>
            <li> The one I got was green.</li>
            <li> It has been in my possession for a few months now</li>
            <li> Its not a cheap bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought it a few months ago to mist my houseplants</li>
            <li> It seems like every one that I&#x27;ve bought stops working after a few uses and just quits spraying at all.</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I know we are using ours \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered one bottle hoping I would get the green one since you could not specify a color choice.</li>
            <li> Just...not this, unless you&#x27;re willing to be frustrated whilst using it.</li>
            <li> Looks small, convienent, like not a drop of material will be wasted and</li>
            <li> What made this unusable for me is the fact that the cap screws down wonky on the threads -</li>
            <li> I got so sick of spray bottles that break after a few months or a year of very occasional use, and finally found these.  </li>
            <li> In my batch there were three &amp;#34;Barbie Pink&amp;#34; ones--and to add insult to injury, not just the handle and spray mechanism was pink, but the bottle itself a faint pink hue.  </li>
            <li> This is a well-made little spray bottle, which, considering its price, it well should be!</li>
            <li> Other bottles are either clear (ugly) or opaque (blind).&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> I just need a small amount of.</li>
            <li> These spray bottles are small, but functional and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and multipurpose adaptable.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this came up while I was looking for GLASS.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small glass sprayer</li>
            <li> I needed a small water bottle to take with me to yoga, so I found this.  </li>
            <li> I understand the product says \\&quot;assorted colors\\&quot;, but with Amazon, usually you get the color which is advertised in the photo.</li>
            <li> Quite small too</li>
            <li> Not sure what else you would need out of this</li>
            <li> so I could place a small bottle of windex in each bathroom for cleaning the mirror and shower doors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; small build.</li>
            <li> The bottle is functional and small.  </li>
            <li> Works on my dog too when he excessively barks.</li>
            <li> and I thought I had wasted my money, but I fiddled with the sprayer and kept spraying and voila!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, not bulky.</li>
            <li> BUT if you need to use it multiple times a day, every day, you&#x27;re probably already fed up with terrible sprayers, which is why you&#x27;re looking here in the first place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) if you have small hands, this bottle is not for you.</li>
            <li> But if you have small hands, it&#x27;s going to be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted a small spray bottle to help keep my small indoor plants moist and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really pleased with my purchase, BUT it&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> Small Bottle Size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small, light-weight atomizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already dropped it a few times, and it&#x27;s hanging in like a champ!</li>
            <li> Its so convenient usually there when i need to do something in a hurry with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because they were small</li>
            <li> Well my order arrived and it was GREEN!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you&#x27;ll have no idea whether you will receive pink or black.</li>
            <li> I got the spray bottle and it was fine , but it was the wrong color!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this on Amazon because I was tired of buying bottles from beauty suppliers and other places and finding they had no mist option or no good range of spray.</li>
            <li> A hard shooter like this goes through the mass of frizzy hair and leaves a shirt stain.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding one of these in stores.</li>
            <li> I wish the seller would allow you to choose the color, or at least see which one you were getting in advance.</li>
            <li> At least not as I was told it would.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I received pink, the color I was hoping against.</li>
            <li> Random selection gave me pink.</li>
            <li> This at least gave me a chance to examine the sprayer&#x27;s construction</li>
            <li> Maybe too efficient and I find I need to refill often over an 8 hour slow cook.</li>
            <li> Needed a small spray bottle for travel - this is it!  </li>
            <li> One very small thing, however.  </li>
            <li> Second, when I tried to screw on the sprayer head so that I could recycle it in one piece, the straw bumped against the bottom of the bottle, making it impossible to close.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived without a spray nozzle... unable to use and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Some people have said that it&#x27;s not good for oil.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not TOO bad except that they&#x27;ve all broken in the last 2 months now</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t weak at all and gives an even spread.  </li>
            <li> but it came in this teal green color!!!</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> We have a game where they get squirted with water</li>
            <li> Only included the plastic base.</li>
            <li> Poor amount of pressure when you squeeze.  </li>
            <li> Came broken.</li>
            <li> I wanted black!!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like pink, but random colors means random colors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad experiences before with other brands</li>
            <li> I bought this to deter my cat from getting on the counters and other bad behavior.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t hold up well and have already broken.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that they will not handle cooking oils.</li>
            <li> The trigger is at a bad angle for small hands.</li>
            <li> My bad for not noticing how small this was.</li>
            <li> The sprayer head was assembled wrong at the factory so that the handle doesn&#x27;t move at all.</li>
            <li> Useless</li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately you receive a random color (if that matters to you).</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are plastic frosted bottles.</li>
            <li> wrong--</li>
            <li> They come in random colors.</li>
            <li> When it fails, I&#x27;ll hit the dollar store instead.</li>
            <li> I like this one but am tired of having them break. :(</li>
            <li> This spray bottle was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This is probably a fluke, but is disappointing nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I put it on the stream setting and use it to deter my dog from bad behavior.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> I searched and everything in the stores is industrial-sized and ugly.</li>
            <li> It sounds like they intentionally deceive people to offload their ugly bottles.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I must say, Im disappointed to find that this is not the one.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed the bottle leak when you spray it.</li>
            <li> The dogs hate it and it doesn&#x27;t leak...</li>
            <li> Hated the color</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle was awful.  </li>
            <li> Totally outrageous at over $5.00</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

            <li> It is working perfectly so far</li>
            <li> wonderful small spray bottle for various uses</li>
            <li> Works well, sturdy, well made.</li>
            <li> No sprayer....how the heck am I gonna use this?????</li>
            <li> This was a cute bottle that I can use to easily refill with bleach water, cleaner or whatever else I just need a small amount of.</li>
            <li> i got crappy color pink. i have to order over and over again until i get black. of coarse ups has to get my package for return.</li>
            <li> I ordered two. One didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Thought these came up as BPA free but when they arrived there is no indication on the package or bottle that these are safe plastic.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great bottle! affordable! love the way the spray tip can be adjusted to manipulate the out come or way the water is released. great material! convenient! can be used for various things around the house. Works great for people...</li>
            <li> I used this for my hair. Took it into the shower with me. Dropped it once and it broke. Screw it</li>
            <li> These spray bottles are small, but functional and inexpensive. As long as you&#x27;re not misting a greenhouse full of plants, these will probably be adequate. Just don&#x27;t imagine you are getting a full-size sprayer. This is tiny, but does the trick.</li>
            <li> It really shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to make a decent water spray bottle, but the last 3 I bought from Target and Safeway sucked!  They would leak and generally not spray well.  Been very happy with this one so far.  Really gets a lot of water spraying so have to refill pretty often but that&#x27;s a good thing as I see it.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, I can&#x27;t believe I am taking the time to review a spray bottle.  I got so sick of spray bottles that break after a few months or a year of very occasional use, and finally found these.  I use a spray bottle for wipe solution for my baby so two of these see heavy, everyday usage and have held up for 8 months.  The others I have are used to spray the cats, and these are great for that purpose as well.  Pretty good range, and small enough that they don&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the dining room table or wherever they are scattered about the house.</li>
            <li> I use these misting/spraying water on paintings on which I&#x27;m working.  With a little rock sea salt and a bit of water, one can get fantastic results, that always varies.  One very small thing, however.  The bottles are like Weebles; they Weeble, but they do fall down.</li>
            <li> Bummed that there&#x27;s no way to get this bottle to mist.  The only option is a single, straight stream which doesn&#x27;t work well for reviving my curls in the morning.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this is such a good product I had to. Five stars hands down. I would give it six if that were an option.</li>
            <li> This was a sold-by loveotc, fulfilled-by Amazon purchase. The sprayer head was assembled wrong at the factory so that the handle doesn&#x27;t move at all. The trigger unit was not properly inserted into the sprayer head, so you can&#x27;t squeeze the trigger.  So cheap that it is not quite worth the time to send it back.</li>
            <li> First off, judging from the picture, I expected to receive three bottles and aprt of my order, but I only got one. It did everything a spray bottle should do. I used it when I was making my own shampoo that was really runny and required a spray bottle to apply. Although it was cheap, there are cheaper ones at the Dollar Store or wherever that I&#x27;m sure work just as great. If money isn&#x27;t an issue, this is a great product. But if you&#x27;re wanting to save a couple of bucks, I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It squirts! IT does NOT spray!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!</li>
            <li> Good: Good range of mist and stream. Comfortable to use. Holding up well after months of use. Excellent for the price for thin liquids like water, vinegar and liquid fertilizers.&lt;br /&gt;Not so good: It will not \\&quot;mist\\&quot; any cooking oils, even the lightest oils. Oils form a stream, not a mist, no matter what setting you select.&lt;br /&gt;Notes: I have several. Some for kitchen use and some for garden use. I like them all. Excellent to mist or stream water onto a charcoal fire to control its temperatures. Excellent to evenly coat foods with water, vinegar and the like. Excellent for liquid fertilizers and for \\&quot;misting\\&quot; poison ivy with weed control chemicals. I was a little disappointed that they will not handle cooking oils.</li>
            <li> Great bottle! affordable! love the way the spray tip can be adjusted to manipulate the out come or way the water is released. great material! convenient! can be used for various things around the house. Works great for people and pets as well!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and multipurpose adaptable.  It&#x27;s not the cheap flimsy device I feared at this low price.  The plastic is sturdy.  The seal is tight.  The trigger handle pumps smoothly.  The nozzle sparys evenly.  I&#x27;m not sure what more quality anyone could want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Flawless at its primary function, i.e., a smooth even spray.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Attractive design.  Decorative color.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Translucent bottle is clear enough to see how much fluid you&#x27;ve poured so far.  This is a useful feature when mixing two liquids.  Other bottles are either clear (ugly) or opaque (blind).&lt;br /&gt;4.  The inner straw-like tube is the perfect length to draw from the bottle&#x27;s bottom-most recesses.  You can spray out nearly every drop that was in the bottle.  No waste!&lt;br /&gt;5.  Trigger handle enables strong pump leverage, in contrast to those finger-spray bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES:&lt;br /&gt;(none)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a spray. It&#x27;s just a tube. Useless</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spray bottle what are you expecting? For the price it does what it&#x27;s required to do nothing else.</li>
            <li> Great little spray bottle. (I use it on the mist setting to help reinforce scratching &amp;#34;no zones&amp;#34; for my cats, and it&#x27;s very effective. They react to the sight of the bottle now, no water necessary. Smart cats!) Packaged securely. Delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this came up while I was looking for GLASS. This is plastic. The description is misleading. I can&#x27;t speak for the bottle itself. I make essential oils and only use glass.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leak when you tilt it, like the one I was replacing, so that&#x27;s nice. Also has a sturdy hand grip so it won&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> I bought several different squirt bottles and these were the prettiest.  Unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t hold up well and have already broken.  I am salvaging parts from other bottles to keep them working,but bottles that were only marginally more expensive are holding up much better.</li>
            <li> I like this spray bottle it is so efficient and even though I got it at a price that was good for me it works just fine. I will be buying from this seller again</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small glass sprayer</li>
            <li> This bottle is a great size to easily manipulate.</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of junk - I have no idea why anyone thinks it is useful at all. To begin with, mine arrived shattered - the plastic body was so thin and flimsy that I can see how that might easily have happened. Second, when I tried to screw on the sprayer head so that I could recycle it in one piece, the straw bumped against the bottom of the bottle, making it impossible to close. Just completely mind-boggling. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for some spray bottles to keep around the house when training cats, look no further. These are a good size and shoot pretty far. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: They work very well on small yappy dogs too! ;) From cacophony to silence in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love my dogs, but they can get VERY loud and they set each other off frequently.)</li>
            <li> I needed a small water bottle to take with me to yoga, so I found this.  I got a pink one.  It works just fine and the only time it leaked was when I didn&#x27;t completely twist the tip shut.  But it&#x27;s water, so it&#x27;s no big deal.  I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s great for wetting down short hair that is being temperamental and misting a cat that is also being temperamental.</li>
            <li> Broke within a few days. WTF?</li>
            <li> I got this squirt bottle to help train my kitten. He&#x27;s a quick learner, and it only took a couple squirts before he stopped jumping up on the counters. It now stands guard at the end of the kitchen counter, and when he sees it, he knows he isn&#x27;t to go there. It&#x27;s worked quite well for us.    It is easy to clean and does exactly what it says it can - sprays water. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a spray bottle that was adjustable - not with just a stream setting - and this was perfect for that.  I&#x27;m using the bottle to spray my ivy plants so they don&#x27;t get dusty, and the bottle is nice and small so it doesn&#x27;t stand out when place amongst my plants.  I saw that other reviewers didn&#x27;t necessarily get a good color - mine was a purple top with translucent clear bottom (the translucency is from the surface being finely pebbled).  My one complaint is that the bottle is somewhat difficult to screw shut - the threads are probably just not that great.  However, it was cheap and it does 95% of what I wanted, so I would recommend this to you if you need a spray bottle!</li>
            <li> I understand the product says \\&quot;assorted colors\\&quot;, but with Amazon, usually you get the color which is advertised in the photo. I was not expecting to receive a pink product. I wish the seller would allow you to choose the color, or at least see which one you were getting in advance.</li>
            <li> This is a very nifty little squirt bottle that will fit where larger bottles won&#x27;t. It holds about a cup of liquid and the squirter adjusts from fine to stream. Works great. We have one stashed in our car with Windex in it (to get off those doggy nose prints) as well as one at home. For those who complain about the price - think about how long you&#x27;ll be using this thing. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This bottle has to be pumped 5-6 times before anything comes out. Doesn&#x27;t work well as a cat-discipline instrument, as they can hear it and run before they get squirted.</li>
            <li> Good quality and works well.</li>
            <li> The sprayer is kind of big for my hands, and it sometimes malfunctions. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Love the size, love how it evenly sprays water. No leaks. Great spray radius.</li>
            <li> I received a purple handle, and I would have chosen that color, so score! I love this bottle because of its size. I searched and everything in the stores is industrial-sized and ugly. I wanted something that I could leave on my counter without it standing out and this does the trick. I use a homemade vinegar/water solution and it sprays well.</li>
            <li> Pretty good although it&#x27;s a lot smaller than pictured. Also, there are times you have to keep turning the top of the nozzle head to ensure an even spray</li>
            <li> Very cheap plastic (you can easily push in), which is the last thing I want for the purpose I bought it for (storing vegetable wash).  Also, it came in pink, which was a surprise and not what I wanted.  Quite small too (holds about a cup?).</li>
            <li> These bottles are so cool and work so well. The spray is always ready to go on first pump, even if u haven&#x27;t used it in days. The ultra-compact size is so adaptable, creating opportunities to station a bottle in a bathroom or kitchen niche that won&#x27;t allow a larger bottle. The units r very sturdy and it&#x27;s easy to label them, either with a Sharpie marking pen or even a product label off a product container. I use my green Tolco bottles for the greatest cleaning product on the market, Bio-Green Clean, and have several Tolco bottles spread around the house now. One bottle, in green, fits perfectly in the small circular indentation of my OXO brush and sponge caddy, made of metal and plastic, on my kitchen sink. My only complaint, echoed by others, is not being able to order a specific color. I love the green Tolco bottle but not the pink one which came with my order of three. I will be ordering more as the needs arise.</li>
            <li> This think doesn&#x27;t squirt half the time - better off buying one at home depot.</li>
            <li> These are great spray bottles for foliar feeding as well as spraying insecticides.  Sure they are a touch more expensive than your typical HUGE spray bottles at your local garden supply, the problem those is, they are HUGE.  Ever try to spray a 4\\&quot; tall plant with a 1/3 gallon spray bottle?  These 8oz bottles are great for spraying even the largest of plants (within reason, they are only 8oz!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nozzle adjusts from closed, to an ultra-fine mist (perfect for foliar feeding), all the way to a solid stream (great cat deterrent, with pure water of course!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought two of these and I will not hesitate to order more</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe so many people would write these fantastic reviews all for a simple spray bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welp, pass the Kool-Aid, because this spray bottle is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy. Strong spray. Comfortable. An old sprayer we had on hand was breaking down, so I went looking for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider me convinced. All hail the spray bottle! I&#x27;m gonna order a couple more to keep around for plants or ironing.</li>
            <li> My Ivy has always done well when misted daily. This little guy helps make sure that happens. Came packaged perfectly and has stood the test of time. So much so that I dug back up the purchase to let you know that it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> I bought three of these to train my two dogs to stop begging for our food and to stay away from the front door when people come knocking.  They learn to stop begging for a few minutes but, their drive for people food is stronger than their aversion to getting sprayed and they stark sneaking back to the table within a few minutes, only to be sprayed again. However, this isn&#x27;t a review about my dogs...    They work great as sprayers and misters and can reach about 20ft with proper angling.  I had one that was Dead On Arrival but, after working on it for a day it came to life.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just be sure you order the color you need. They send me a pink bottle for a boy. I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Perfect for a small spray bottle.  I use it for my cloth diaper wipes solution in my travel diaper bag. It&#x27;s perfect and does not leak.</li>
            <li> Much higher quality than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Consistently good spray with no drips. Perfect for morning hair brushing spritz with water.  Great bottle.</li>
            <li> The selling point for me were the reviews that said it was durable.  I am completely satisfied with this little spray bottle and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great value and great spray bottle!  I use mine to spritz the pup with ice water when we walk in the summer.  He likes it!</li>
            <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t fit on the bottle. I have to push hard and fit it on just right to get it to stay on. It take multiple tries. The bottle sprays fine though once I manage to screw the lid on.</li>
            <li> I must say, Im disappointed to find that this is not the one. Looks small, convienent, like not a drop of material will be wasted and Im sure thatll be the outcome. But in the end its not HDPE. The journey varied on.</li>
            <li> I got this to spray my cat with when he is misbehaving. Unfortunately you receive a random color (if that matters to you). The nozzle can be adjusted for stream or spray. Not sure what else you would need out of this so I gave it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny to get so excited about a water bottle, but I had been looking for a decent one for quite a while before I found this one. I love it. I wanted one that was small, stable (wouldn&#x27;t tip over, empty or full) and durable. This one fits the bill. I put it on the stream setting and use it to deter my dog from bad behavior. It works like a charm. It would also be great for hair or whatever else. Mine is hot pink, but I don&#x27;t think you have any control over what color they send you. It&#x27;s a surprise!</li>
            <li> What is there to say about a spray bottle?  It has a nice spray, nice trigger, seems durable and doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle works fine and is small and easy to store. I use it to spray bleach on counters.</li>
            <li> A great little spray bottle and it does not leak.</li>
            <li> Good, sturdy bottle with even spray.  The spray could be a bit finer for my acrylics.</li>
            <li> This thing is perfect for misting plants, spraying my cat when he&#x27;s being naughty, and hitting giant flies on the ceiling that are trying to spread disease. I like it</li>
            <li> Like everyone else said, this sprayer works great.  My other dripped drops of water and this one sprays evenly and in a nice mist.  You can twist the nozzle to regulate the stream/spray.</li>
            <li> I ordered it right off the page I had ordered before.  But the second order did not include two of them like the first order did.  And the one bottle that was sent is much smaller than the two that were sent on the first order.  It also doesn&#x27;t spray as far and in a narrow stream.  It often gets things wet in between myself and my target.  I buy these to use on the cats when they&#x27;re waking me up in the middle the night or doing something they&#x27;re not supposed to do.  It still sprays and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I just like the first order better.</li>
            <li> great size of spray bottle.</li>
            <li> works perfectly, thank you.</li>
            <li> Ordered 3 of these bottles and received 2 in a hot pink color and 1 blue. Size was exactly what I was looking for (I was making some home-made yoga mat cleaner as gifts for a couple of fellow yogis). The sprayer felt like it was solidly constructed and would last for a while. Doing some test sprays produced a good range of spray area (focused stream versus wide spray). I knocked off 1-star because the sprayer head did leak slightly even after the nozzle was turned to the &#x27;Off&#x27; position. I knocked the second star off because the bottle itself is a pretty flimsy plastic and also leaked when turned on its side - I believe the seal between the sprayer head and bottle wasn&#x27;t quite perfect, allowing for some leakage. Overall though, for the price, these bottles were a good value and thankfully, my yogi friends loved the hot pink color.</li>
            <li> Great durable spray bottle! I use mine to shine my shoes, and it has been very durable. Still going strong after two month.</li>
            <li> Have been using for awhile, good quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small yet shoots out a big stream of water.  I&#x27;m happy with the performance so far (have had it only a month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I received was pink.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle was awful.  They&#x27;re not better than the one&#x27;s at your local dollar store. Save yourself a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Good mister. I really like this spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived without a spray nozzle... unable to use and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Bought these for our misbehaving cat. He just would not listen to reason. They are small and well made, and can shoot a stream a good distance.</li>
            <li> The frosted look is really beautiful and the nozzle looks great too. It&#x27;s on the smaller side, which is what I wanted, and works very well.</li>
            <li> Smal, Cheap, Powerful sprayer</li>
            <li> I purchased these 8 oz. spray bottles so I could place a small bottle of windex in each bathroom for cleaning the mirror and shower doors.  They are just the right size for the occasional use.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the trigger mechanisms seem okay- don&#x27;t look flimsy or easily breakable.  The plastic bottles themselves are a softer, more &amp;#34;bendable&amp;#34; plastic rather than rigid. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good or bad.</li>
            <li> Its ok but you have to squeeze the bottle to get it to spray</li>
            <li> I used it for five minutes and it stopped working. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; small build. The trigger is at a bad angle for small hands. It gave my hand a cramp. Now I pull the trigger with my thumb and it seems better. It&#x27;s short and takes up a lot of horizontal space, but it does fit in my medicine cabinet. The spray/mist is good for refreshing my curly hair; it comes out diffuse, which is what I was hoping for. I have only tried it with water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spray bottle, it works. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;There is a nozzle at the tip of the bottle that allows you to change the spray of water (direct stream- misty spray). Strong and durable</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my waterstones wet whils honing.  I like the smaller size vs a full size bottle.  Yes I have to refill it more often, but it is still not even every time.  (Also works great when set to stream at keeping cats off counters, out of Christmas trees, and ultimately away from my sharpening stuff... I think they learned to recognize the bottle...)</li>
            <li> This little pump sprayer works great.  The thumb hook on the back side of the handle makes it much more comfortable to use compared to standard spray bottles.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a fogged clear plastic in the picture. The one I was sent is bright pink.  I suppose since I&#x27;m ok with my masculinity, that&#x27;s ok as long it works, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it doesn&#x27;t work.  At least not as I was told it would.  There is no mist function.  I bought this for a &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; function.  The bottle I was sent has two modes, pressure washer and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> Great value and great spray bottle. I use mine to spritz the pup with ice water when we walk in the summer and he likes it.</li>
            <li> This product is solid, well-made, doesn&#x27;t leak, and has both mist and squirt options (with pretty good distance). We are currently using it to train our cats, but it will also work well for spraying plants. I am ordering several more to have around the house.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother, as a gift. She says she is very pleased with it. She recommended it to all her friends</li>
            <li> Does what you want it to do whether that be a stream, a mist or something in between.</li>
            <li> No rocket science here, it is a spray bottle. And that is what it does. You fill it up with your favorite spay-able fluid and it sprays out in a nice adjustable fashion. From spay to stream, no drips or other possible problems arose, which is as it should be.</li>
            <li> Bought this on Amazon because I was tired of buying bottles from beauty suppliers and other places and finding they had no mist option or no good range of spray. This one had good reviews and when it arrived I tried it out and it does mist -- which is what I wanted. It&#x27;s small which is nice because it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as other bottles.</li>
            <li> Great little spray bottles for whatever your needs. The bottles are somewhat textured which makes them a little easier to grip when wet. One star ding because one of the bottles screw top is a bit loose, and requires care when threading. But other than needing a bit more attention, these are great little bottles for the price. I use mine to store StarSan solution for homebrew applications</li>
            <li> It is not worth the $5,  seeing the price I felt it would be of superior quality than the alternatives. But it is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nothing really special but it works good but it would be better if it was a bigger bottle then it would be better</li>
            <li> This is a very efficient little spray bottle.  It shoots out a satisfyingly strong, straight spray.  I was looking for more of a misting spray to water my indoor plant, but I am quite happy with this.  Excellent value for money.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, looks nicer than most spray bottles. Shoots far and precisely, which is great for when the cat is across the room scratching your couch.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle was disappointing.  It is so top heavy if it isn&#x27;t full, it topples over  I should have paid more attention to the fact that it is only an 8 ounce bottle and will not work for what I had intended. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle for some natural cleaner that only comes in a gallon size.  The bottle is very sturdy and has good stream throw.  It isn&#x27;t weak at all and gives an even spread.  I&#x27;ll definitely get another one!  I&#x27;ve tried several bottles that were just too weak.</li>
            <li> Barely musters a spit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown money away on cheap spray bottles (I could have returned them, but one never does.) that don&#x27;t work or not for very long.  These are easy to handle and spray very well...spray being adjustable too.</li>
            <li> I use the bottle to dampen my hair to scrunch it up. This bottle is small but a good size for my use. It sprays out beautifully.</li>
            <li> you can spray in a mist or in a squirt with these misty little bottles. bought them for my water I use to manipulate my curly hair and for my homemade setting spray. works well :)</li>
            <li> I put my lotto-body setting lotion in this container to dilute it, with sprays very well while setting my hair in curlers for the dryer without making a mess.</li>
            <li> Did not mist. Useless.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed it this spray bottle, only one spray type, like the size and wanted a good spray bottle that had at least 2 different spray types. maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description good enough, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> cute and gets the job done. Just over priced lol you can get better at your local drug store. I did get cute colors tho!</li>
            <li> This is a great bottle. The photo is clear and frosted, I want that one but there is no option to choose. I have the green one. It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ll buy another one if they give me the option to choose.</li>
            <li> Cheap Spray bottle- Would be overpriced @ .50. Totally outrageous at over $5.00</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s strange but I&#x27;m picky with my squirt bottles and I love this one!</li>
            <li> Great size for small bathroom-works well</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered thinking I was getting clear and I got hot pink. But also, there was only one spray setting (jet stream) and not the soft-mist setting I wanted.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle is okay. That&#x27;s about all I can say... If it is not straight up and down it will not spray. I was ordering one to replace my old one that I dropped and the top broke off. I think I bought it for about $2.00, but it had the perfect mist for my plants and you could turn it any direction and it would still spray. This one is somewhere between a spray and a mist, so depending on what you are using it for it may work for you. I do like the color... I receive a teal-ish color, I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t get pink like some of the other people!</li>
            <li> This is the best bottle ever for squirting your pets!</li>
            <li> This spray bottle is great. Unfortunately, you&#x27;ll have no idea whether you will receive pink or black. Black is clearly pictured, but \\&quot;Assorted Colors\\&quot; leaves it open to interpretation I suppose. Unfortunately, I received pink, the color I was hoping against. Other reviewers have pointed this out as well, so it appears to be an issue regardless of the seller (I purchased mine from Big Fly Sports). So as long as you don&#x27;t mind a random chance for the color, this is a great little sprayer to purchase. I use mine for watering my bonsai.</li>
            <li> I thought this was frosted glass because when I did a search for glass spray bottles, this pulled up. Unfortunately, they are plastic frosted bottles. You also can&#x27;t put a label on them because the texture causes things to unstick. Too bad I purchased two of them but I use them to spray linens and plants.</li>
            <li> Did not mist - only jet streams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No adjustment either to alter mist.</li>
            <li> GREAT price and works well! I use this to hold the spray mix I made to use with my daughters cloth wipes and it works great. Had it a few months now and still works great, no issues! Very pleased</li>
            <li> It does say assorted colors in the title, but hey, I figured what are the odds it&#x27;ll be pink.  Well, it was pink.</li>
            <li> Its a spray bottle. It works as intended.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  It fell off the counter and shattered like it was made of glass.</li>
            <li> The bottle sprays well. Well made and sprays evenly. I use it to dampen my hair to make it curl. Plastic is not thin.</li>
            <li> 3 out of 7 trigger sprayers were defective in last order.  2 leaked and 1 wouldn&#x27;t spray.  I think they need to improve their inspection process.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, good quality, super cheap</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s not great. For the price, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This spray has no spread at all. If a regular spray bottle was like a shotgun, this thing is like a sniper rifle. It should be marketed as a cheap water gun instead of a spray bottle. Also I don&#x27;t think this thing is BPA free, but oh well.</li>
            <li> From the photo &amp; description, I somehow thought that this was going to be a frosted glass bottle.  But actually, it&#x27;s made of plastic.  After I received them, I looked at the description again &amp; realized that they never mentioned &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; anywhere.  It was just a wrongful assumption on my part.  I got 3 of these, I use them for spraying alcohol in the bathrooms to sanitize things.  It&#x27;s got a great spray, great product.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> My 7-year old son loves squirt bottles and will go around the house squirting things for hours!  I actually bought it for my students.  We have a game where they get squirted with water that&#x27;s pretty fun.  The bottle is functional and small.  The only con is that the top is hard to screw back on but with a little patience it will eventually go on the right way.</li>
            <li> I spray my fiance and I with lavender essential oil every night!</li>
            <li> Too small and not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the squirts would be super &amp;#34;concentrated&amp;#34; if that makes sense. I was hoping for more of a widespread spray action than a straight jetstream line-esque squirt. Perhaps, I&#x27;m doing something wrong-- if so, someone let me know!!</li>
            <li> Bought two. One was doa, the other worked fine but it is most certainly NOT a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a SQUIRT bottle. No matter how much you twist open the nozzle to change the pattern all it does is squirt a little line of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible. You truly get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Work just fine for small-scale garden spraying, or spraying on yourself while walking in 90-100 degree weather. Not the highest quality, but not the lowest, either. Always good to have around. I wouldn&#x27;t use these for poison sprays, as the contents can leak when the top is unscrewed.</li>
            <li> Very fast, great price.</li>
            <li> Works well but it should grant wishes for the price tag it comes with...It&#x27;s the only food grade spray bottle I&#x27;ve found and it&#x27;s tiny</li>
            <li> It is a small botel which requires refilling frequently... but it mists perfectly!  Not too much, not too little.  Just right.</li>
            <li> Squirt my cat when he is naughty. Great and painless cat deterrent. Works on my dog too when he excessively barks.</li>
            <li> Good sturdy bottle, only had for a short time, but seems like it will last.</li>
            <li> The bottle is sturdy, but light, and you can adjust the spray. I live in a dry climate, and I use the bottle to create a fine spray for my hair, which goes limp in dry weather.</li>
            <li> Stable. Does not leak water. In many previous bottles water leaking out of the handle when pressed. Large radius of spraying.</li>
            <li> Bottle water sprayer does work great and was shipped on time .</li>
            <li> Wish they would have sent something other than pink.</li>
            <li> The spraying functionality is generally good, but sometimes struggles. Additionally, the bottle came in pink which was surprising based on the product image.</li>
            <li> Good size for my needs and well made.</li>
            <li> It was a bit smaller than I expected, but absolutely fits the purpose of what we needed it for (to mist an orchid). I can&#x27;t fault the company for my expectation that the bottle would be a bit larger, because it clearly states it&#x27;s 8 oz. in the description. My only criticism is that it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> Instead of a &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34; color, I received a hideous black and white zebra stripe bottle. The bottle itself is perfectly functional, however. It works for misting plants.</li>
            <li> Works great, small, fits in my cabinet</li>
            <li> My bad for not noticing how small this was. Fortunately I had another use for it than what I intended. It&#x27;s perfect for spritzing meat on the smoker. Sprayer seems well made for a cheap bottle.</li>
            <li> This bottle leaks and seems cheaply constructed; far from the quality I was hoping for. Gets the job done, but you have to refill it daily.</li>
            <li> Handy spray bottle. Random selection gave me pink. Was hoping for clear or green, but that is random selection for ya. It works as it should, and the mist is gentle enough for plants in my windowsill greenhouse. The mist is even and firm.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small water bottle I could carry with me when walking my (occasionally) naughty dog. This is the perfect size and seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can&#x27;t pick the color, I got pink. Fine for me, but I would have been a bit disappointed if I wasn&#x27;t a chick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Sprays water. Nice to hold. Doesn&#x27;t drip.</li>
            <li> Came fast and works great!</li>
            <li> It is kind of small and takes a couple pumps to get any spray action initially, but other than that it works well / as expected.  Handling comfort is good.</li>
            <li> great little item for spraying my house plants with water.  It is pretty small and has a small footprint, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> They function will enough for spray bottles, but I was wanted they sprayer to have more of an adjustment.  The spray only comes out in one steady stream, and there is no way to adjust it to open the stream up more.</li>
            <li> I bought two and got a light green and a pink.  The pink nozzle stopped working one day after purchased.  So far the other one still works--glad I bought two.  I wanted to spritz my cat with water and some ants with vinegar.  This does not achieve a mist, only a squirt.</li>
            <li> This is the second spray bottle (the first was a different brand) that I&#x27;ve purchased for spraying baby oil after my shower.  The first caved in on itself and since this one is nice and sturdy and did not do that, it received an extra star.  The problem with it is that it only shoots out a thin, high powered stream rather than a nice mist, resulting in baby oil flying all over the shower.  I&#x27;ve tried adjusting the nozzel, filling to different levels and even tried adjusting the handle, but nothing has helped.</li>
            <li> Sprays water in every way I wanted. I use it to spray plants at the house. I would purchase again</li>
            <li> I received a different bottle it was not what I see in other reviews</li>
            <li> Bought this for my baking recipes that call for flavor spritzing. Does a great job and the size is just right.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold much, but the spray is adjustable and it pumps a lot out. I like it and like using it.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle was pretty cheap, so I decided to pick it up to teach my kittens not to be so naughty. Unfortunately, the peg supporting the squirt handle broke within two weeks, and the handle itself broke within the month under mild to moderate use. I&#x27;d look elsewhere for spray bottles.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle is exactly what I needed to mist my air plants. I&#x27;m sure there are a ton of other uses for it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray nozzle is adjustable with a twist between stream and mist. Mine arrived with no flaws or defects, and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do: it sprays water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care about the color, so being randomized wasn&#x27;t an issue for me. The one I received was purple. The bottle itself is &amp;#34;frosted&amp;#34; but you can still see if water is in it, and how much.</li>
            <li> These are durable and cute.  Note that you don&#x27;t know what color you will get so prepare yourself for the potential of hot pink.  I have had these for two years now at home and at work and they still work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love everything aboutt his bottle.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for my leave-in conditioner.  I&#x27;d buy more for other household applications exc ept that the nozzle twists but does not adjust spray.  I feel like I&#x27;m being hit with a Super-Soaker because the flow is streamlined and high-pressure.  The tip rotates but the style does not change.  I was looking for a nozzle that has intermediate stages between the strong hard line of fluid and the misty fan spray.  Neither setting is good for shooting yourself in the head with product.  A hard shooter like this goes through the mass of frizzy hair and leaves a shirt stain.  A misty fan spray would condition my face as well, which is NOT the goal.  Still a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the clear bottle with the black nozzle that&#x27;s shown in the picture; I got a light pink bottle with a fuschia nozzle and I could not be happier. When I first filled it the water came out in a stream and I thought I had wasted my money, but I fiddled with the sprayer and kept spraying and voila! A fine misting spray, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I use this bottle for hair sprays that I make.  It&#x27;s small, not bulky.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle really helps in the application.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was tired of using cheap spray bottles that barely worked. I bought this spray bottle and received the purple color. It sprays great and I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> Surprising strong spray!  I used this for a number of things - wetting my hair for styling, blasting spider egg sacs off the window screens, misting my plants, etc.  For a little effort, you get a lot done.  Will be buying more for dedicated usage</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised and perfect size for small plants or using to spray clothes while ironing.</li>
            <li> Nice little bottle and holds up well to daily use as well as frequent &#x27;play&#x27; by a toddler. The trigger action is smooth and its quick to spray with out excessive &#x27;dry shots&#x27; which is great when you have a wiggling toddler waiting for a mist of water. The bottle is comfortable in big or small hands and the reach of the trigger is comfortable as well.</li>
            <li> I got a small, round purple one, perfect for what I needed it for, which was to keep in the car as a discipline threat to our dog.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a good quality spray bottle at my local Target so I decided to look online.  All the spray bottles sold at Target have a really cheap pump mechanism and the volume of each spray in those bottles is very inconsistent.  These are great quality and I am very happy so far  UPDATE: After using this bottle for a while, I&#x27;ve downgraded my rating to 3 stars.  The intake tub inside the bottle is very rigid and after the liquid level gets down to a certain point, you may have to make sure that you are holding the bottle completely upright- otherwise the pump won&#x27;t be able to pick up any of the bottle&#x27;s contents.  Perhaps the tube should be more flexible or bent in  way so that it tilts towards the bottom of the bottle when it is tipped during use?</li>
            <li> Nice fine spray. Just what I wanted. No leaking.</li>
            <li> Good quality bottle that I am using for travel.</li>
            <li> They sent me a pink bottle even though the picture shows a \\&quot;frosted\\&quot; color. It sounds like they intentionally deceive people to offload their ugly bottles. Buyer beware</li>
            <li> Love this little spray bottle.  It&#x27;s just the right size and works perfectly.  I put chlorine bleach in it to clean the black mold from our hot tub.  The spray squirts quite a ways and was just what I needed to do the job.</li>
            <li> If you just need something that functions as a spray bottle for one or two squirts every now and then, save a couple bucks and get one at the dollar store. In fact, I have a bunch of them that you can have for free. BUT if you need to use it multiple times a day, every day, you&#x27;re probably already fed up with terrible sprayers, which is why you&#x27;re looking here in the first place. This is a good one! You can adjust it from a clear stream to a fine mist, and anything in between. It&#x27;s smooth and relatively quiet. The one I got was green. It comes pretty clean - I still rinsed it out before spraying plants and animals, but there&#x27;s no unpleasant chemical odor. The tension is just a little greater than I&#x27;d prefer, but hey, I&#x27;m not complaining. Keep in mind it is only 8 oz, and buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> For the price, this little thing is priceless. I use it all around the house. It has been in my possession for a few months now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I bought something similar from Target and the hand pump didn&#x27;t last for more than a few days. This one, however, seems like it will last a while.</li>
            <li> It worked for a few weeks then quit, I expected more</li>
            <li> Great product! Very easy to use; has a tiny dial on the nozzle where one can adjust the flow from a spritz to a stream of water. Nice color (bright pink), too.</li>
            <li> Light, small, great spray!</li>
            <li> Perfect little spray bottle. I use it on my plants. I know it says assorted colors but why did they have to send me a bright pink one? Sheesh!</li>
            <li> Product was advertised as \\&quot;Frosted Assorted Colors\\&quot;. They were neither frosted nor in assorted colors as I&#x27;d wanted.</li>
            <li> This is actually my SECOND order for this particular bottle, the first one was great, good adjustable nozzle, nice mist and spray. I liked it so much, I decided to order another one. And what happens? I get just a plastic bottle. No sprayer. Seriously?</li>
            <li> I got a pink one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like pink, but random colors means random colors! It&#x27;s a great squirt bottle. Works well, and at this price, it cant be beat. 5 stars</li>
            <li> I recieved mine the other day and it keeps toppling over and it will only shoot a stream at all rotation spots on the spout.  Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I use this bottle to hold my distilled water to spray my hair with and then apply hair oil.  Good size- not too tall.</li>
            <li> This bottle is fantastic. Some people have said that it&#x27;s not good for oil. Fine. Don&#x27;t use it with oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for anything that&#x27;s water-based, you can&#x27;t beat this bottle. I&#x27;ve used lots of other spray bottles before, and I always thought, \\&quot;We have amazing technology that allows us to make iPhones, supersonic planes, and nuclear submarines, but we can&#x27;t figure out how to make a simple spray bottle that actually works?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further. This bottle is fantastic. If you look at the picture you will see that there is a plastic piece extending on the side opposite of the trigger. When you hold this spray bottle, you will understand that it&#x27;s one of the greatest features of the bottle. It stabilizes the bottle against the thenar space (i.e. the space between your thumb and index finger) so you can squeeze to your heart&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action on the trigger is good and the whole unit is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two small drawbacks, but most people won&#x27;t care because they&#x27;ll be so happy to have found a spray bottle that actually works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) if you have small hands, this bottle is not for you. The trigger is angled far to the front. This is great because it gives a larger trigger displacement and this limits the number of times you have to squeeze the trigger to get the amount of spray you want. But if you have small hands, it&#x27;s going to be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) the color. You don&#x27;t have a choice. The picture here is a black bottle and they do advertise that it is \\&quot;frosted assorted colors\\&quot;. As a male jock, I was hoping for blue, but I got pink. Still, I can deal with it because this bottle works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recommendation I have is that you order two of them. If you are using it for disinfecting purposes, one can be for vinegar and the other for hydrogen peroxide. But if you are going to do that, then remember that you have to keep the hydrogen peroxide bottle in the dark because light breaks it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: please click on \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; for all helpful reviews.

            <li> I just wanted a simple spray bottle to use on my baby&#x27;s hair.  This works great - no mess and a nice misty stream.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding one of these in stores. It seems that when I wasn&#x27;t looking for one they were every where. I could only find very small ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a water bottle for my hair and my daughters. It works well. Its not a cheap bottle.</li>
            <li> Does what I need it to do!Thought I was ordering black but I got a pink one. Oh well! I still will use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m entirly satisfied with this bottle.  I&#x27;ve had bad experiences before with other brands but this is one I&#x27;ll be buying more of in the future.  Spray is strong, even, and adjustable. Operation is EASY!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that. 13 words are required so I&#x27;m typing more words here and there and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I got this to water my starter pots for some seeds I planted and this works just right. I have to refill it about every 2 days, but that was expected. I didn&#x27;t want a giant bottle to keep around the house. The top is a little hard to screw back on sometimes, you have to set it just right. Otherwise, a quality spray bottle. The spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t leak at all, so that is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice small spray bottle</li>
            <li> Very big misting capabilities. But it was pink. Picture was misleading.</li>
            <li> I use the spray bottles in our chicken coop for coop cleaners, refreshing sprays and other homemade sprays that I make. These bottles are just the right size and so far the sprayers work great. Good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Eggs Daily&lt;br /&gt;www.fresh-eggs-daily.com</li>
            <li> Cute and works great!!</li>
            <li> The threads are lousy...never seals properly.  Same for all of them.</li>
            <li> I use this product to spray my leave in hair condition. It sprays a large volume! I was expecting a mist. I played around with the knob for a little bit until I got it to stop spraying streams. Good product you just might have to play around with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these bottles. One for my 50/50 mixture of Bac Out and the other for homemade diaper wipes solution. They spray nicely and they look nice too. Small enough to be portable. Good shape so they sit up on their own and won&#x27;t knock over easily as some other spray bottles this size tend to be. They come in random colors. I wish you could pick the color but it&#x27;s not really a big deal I suppose. I received a blue/green and a pinkish color. They are plastic. I&#x27;d love a glass version.</li>
            <li> How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;- For a vinegar/water mix to remove pesticides from non-organic produce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Does exactly what it is intended for - to spray.&lt;br /&gt;- Perfectly small size to place next to the kitchen faucet&lt;br /&gt;- Can also be hung</li>
            <li> This works great!  I use it to spray a little bit water on shirts to get the wrinkles out.  It sprays a nice fine even mist of water and I have not had any issues with mistakenly getting large grips on my clothes.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Use these for household cleaning</li>
            <li> Well made - works great.</li>
            <li> These are great bottles! We have a couple of them now. Nice and sturdy, compact, and the spray is adjustable from \\&quot;mist\\&quot; to \\&quot;squirt\\&quot;, depending on your need. I use one on our cat: \\&quot;mist\\&quot; when I&#x27;m within 5 feet, or \\&quot;squirt\\&quot; if I&#x27;m further than 10 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth: the kids like playing with these, and they make pretty good squirt guns. If you&#x27;re going to have cleaning chemicals in some, make sure the kids know the rules re: which color bottles get used on stains, and which colors get used on friends.</li>
            <li> At the risk of raining upon the parade of rave reviews, I feel compelled to point out that this is little more than an inexpensive and cheaply made dollar store sprayer. It works but is not especially well-made or durable. You can probably find one for less at a local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first sprayer that I received was severely ruptured with a two-inch tear in the container. Ehat appears to be typical handling by the post office was diffident to literally shred the container. This at least gave me a chance to examine the sprayer&#x27;s construction is more detail. \\&quot;Flimsy\\&quot; is the word that comes most readily to mind.  The walls of the container are about as strong as plasticized paper, and I&#x27;m giving the sprayer the benefit of the doubt here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for very light duty as a mister for house plants. It does OK at this. I doubt that the sprayer will hold up to more regular and intensive use. O long as you don&#x27;t knd getting a new one every couple of months, you should be fine. I&#x27;m sorry if you were hoping that Yhis was a real bargain, but this is not that.</li>
            <li> gives a real fine mist spray up to a stream - nice adjustment control on the spray head and i needed that \\&quot;mist\\&quot; spray ability - would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> The complete item is very sturdy, handy and works really fine. I gave just 4 stars instead five.  Out of all the colors (don&#x27;t care if blue, green, clear, black, red) I received a PINK one! Argh!</li>
            <li> This is a great little spray bottle. I bought it a few months ago to mist my houseplants and it&#x27;s holding up really well with daily use. The whole unit has a nice solid weight to it (many small spray bottles are feather-weight and seem really cheap and flimsy); the sprayer seems good quality and fits perfectly to hand; the spray action is dependable every time, no sputtering or having to pump it to prime it; it can be adjusted from a fine mist to heavier droplets; the tube goes all the way to the bottom of the bottle to capture all the water. When you set it down it is perfectly balanced and doesn&#x27;t even come close to thinking about tipping over, very stable. I&#x27;m very happy with it, would definitely recommend it, and would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these spray bottles.  I use them for lots of things.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Great!</li>
            <li> I ended up returning these, not because of the bottle design, but because of the colors. They shipped me bright purple and pink, while all I wanted was black and clear. I would definitely repurchase if they let you select the colors.</li>
            <li> Perfect for spraying nuisances, annoying roommates, or moochers with. Lasts linger than expected and you can adjust for either spray or line of water.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product. Does not spray well at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted a small spray bottle to help keep my small indoor plants moist and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect.  I got exactly what I wanted at a very affordable price!</li>
            <li> I was simply looking for a spray bottle that works for use with various cooking tasks. It seems like every one that I&#x27;ve bought stops working after a few uses and just quits spraying at all. This one, so far, works very well and sprays a very fine mist, perfect for misting poultry with water in the oven and so forth. I am not sure that it is food safe, come to think of it, and the big \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; sticker on the bottom makes me a little nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: about six months later, it will not mist anymore at all, but only squirt. What on earth is the reason for this? I&#x27;ve only used plain water in it, and used it very infrequently. Just buy an old atomizer if you need something that will produce a mist.</li>
            <li> I use this for spritzing meat on the BBQ...very efficient. Maybe too efficient and I find I need to refill often over an 8 hour slow cook. Does it job well though!</li>
            <li> Love this spray bottle. I am using it to prevent boil-overs when brewing 5 gallon batches of beer. Loses one star because it empties very quickly. Wish I ordered a larger size.</li>
            <li> Great product, not flimsy by any means!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really pleased with my purchase, BUT it&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault. I searched for empty GLASS spray bottles, since I need them for use with essential oils, and this bottle came up in the search results. Since it does not specify that it is plastic in the description, and since it came up under the GLASS search result, I ordered one. It just arrived. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a very nice plastic bottle but i wanted and needed glass. Sigh.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t function. The handle pulls, but nothing comes out and it appears to have some blockage in the nozzle. Not worth the hassle of returning it, but I certainly won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> It worked fine until it fell off my belt and the bottle cracked.It would help to be a bit more sturdy</li>
            <li> I received the bottle this weekend. It seemed hardy enough. One thing I didn&#x27;t love is they sent me a bottle in pink. I work at a spa and bought the bottle for a body wrap I do. I try to keep everything gender neutral and hot pink does not fit the bill. I will keep it. I wish I&#x27;d have known pink was an option so I could have asked for a different color. That may be my fault, however if you do not want pink don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> I know that every now and then I find myself needing to shoot a liquid at things. Things such as water at flowers, or windex at a mirror, and I have to say, this baby gets the job done. You just pull the handle and WHAM liquid gets shot! Want a spray? Not a problem. Need a steady stream to shoot your little brother? This baby has you covered. I haven&#x27;t tried to shoot urine out of it yet, but I assume it would work all the same. 10/10</li>
            <li> Great flow of spray, evenly sprays, very easy to hold and seems quite durable. It&#x27;s an awesome product I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> The image online is of a clear and black bottle. What we received was pink.  Hideous.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed the bottle leak when you spray it.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than what you can get for cheaper at Walmart or target. Worth it!</li>
            <li> Like the gentle spray coming from this bottle..</li>
            <li> Works great.  A nice smaller size.  Not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> You would think it would be simple to find a good squirt bottle. Boys and girls, it is not. The Tolco 8 oz proves it once again. It&#x27;s not bad, really. The top hasn&#x27;t disintegrated in my hand like the last squirt bottle I bought. Empty or near empty, it wants to tip over. (Which is not cool at all.) It would be nice to be able to choose which colors you get. I bought three, for separate purposes, and ended up with two pink and one black. I&#x27;ll use them for now, but I haven&#x27;t found squirt bottle nirvana. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t exist. I just think it should.</li>
            <li> I make bleach t-shirts for my craft store, so I definitely did some hunting to find a good spray bottle and these ended up being the winners. I require that superfine mist setting, which these each delivered for about 6 months so long as I emptied them immediately after use and rinsed them out thoroughly. I&#x27;d imagine they would probably last much longer if you were only using water. I did find that if I left bleach in one overnight, it was toast the next day in that it would still spray but it would only do a stream instead of that mist I need. They are sturdy, but not indestructible on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complain, aside from the unrealistic one that they don&#x27;t last forever, is that the two I got were both neon pink. Some choice of color would have been nice, but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s not like I was looking for form over function anyway.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  *  Durable construction (Its been dropped too many times to count)&lt;br /&gt;  *  Spill Proof  (It is laying on its side right now, and nothing is leaking out)&lt;br /&gt;  *  Long and Accurate Stream  (especially good if you are using this as a cat deterent)&lt;br /&gt;  *  Mist function works great as well&lt;br /&gt;  *  Ergonomic Grip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  *  Small Bottle Size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this spray bottle to spray my cats with water if they get on the counter.  It has worked perfectly.  The thing is completely accurate and I have absolutely no complaints.  This bottle would also be great for someone that is watering plants or needs to mist something.</li>
            <li> These are great bottles with fine adjusting capabilities.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small, light-weight atomizer.  The plastic is frosted, semi-see-through&lt;br /&gt;and comes in a very soft watery-aqua color.  The spray setting I have it&lt;br /&gt;on creates a nice gentle mist.  I use it to hydrate my face and my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not to much to say about a spray bottle, but it&#x27;s exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The headline says &amp;#34;assorted colors,&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t see any way to&lt;br /&gt;choose which color they sent you.  I like the one I received but&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s the color you&#x27;ll get.)</li>
            <li> Now that I have received this in PINK, I read the other reviews &amp; appears pink is the color most often sent.  When I did a search for a bottle, it was for \\&quot;glass spray bottle\\&quot;.  It had decent reviews so I ordered it without reading through tons of reviews for a basic spray bottle.  Surprise !!  It&#x27;s plastic and PINK! Nowhere in the description does this say what it&#x27;s made is. When I took the top off to check it out, then tried to screw back on, discovered it is crooked and won&#x27;t seat square.  Also very hard to even try to fit over the top of the bottle.  Decided to check for leaks.  None so far, but it is new.  The spray is adjustable from mist to stream by turning the spray nozzle.  That&#x27;s a good thing if it continues to work.  I wanted to use this for essential oils made into a room spray.  They tend to eat &amp; deteriorate plastic.  When it fails, I&#x27;ll hit the dollar store instead.</li>
            <li> Good for intended purpose of spraying flavored vinegars on salads  Adjustable nozzle from stream to fanned out mist.</li>
            <li> The most perfect plant mister that I have ever bought, it has a really fine mist. Buy 2 as they are very handy and you&#x27;ll wish you got 2 after using one.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of spray bottles but these do exactly what you expect of them.  Thank the makers</li>
            <li> It does spray really well, so I can&#x27;t give it less than 3 stars... But don&#x27;t shake the bottle or tilt it so that the liquid touches the top because it leaks if you do.  Maybe I just got a faulty bottle?</li>
            <li> It was fine with me that it isn&#x27;t the same triangular shape as what is shown in the picture. (It actually has a rounded shoulder on top.) What made this unusable for me is the fact that the cap screws down wonky on the threads - so the first time I went to shake the bottle, the contents splashed everywhere. Several attempts at trying to re-seat the cap proved fruitless. Its best seal still leaks. I can&#x27;t use the bottle if I can&#x27;t shake it first - waste of money.</li>
            <li> Needed a small spray bottle for travel - this is it!  it&#x27;s durable and i just tossed it in my luggage and it&#x27;s been doing great! I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered six of these and nicely was given seven.  I think they are a good value for the money, and the reason for the four stars is the threading is a bit twitchy (just be careful) and one of the seven refused to spray at first without some persuasion.  (Once primed they work great.)  They are small, but a useful size, about fit in the palm of your hand.  And now the color lowdown.  In my batch there were three &amp;#34;Barbie Pink&amp;#34; ones--and to add insult to injury, not just the handle and spray mechanism was pink, but the bottle itself a faint pink hue.  The others?  A somewhat appalling lavender/purple--with a similar slight purple tint to the bottle.  So, at this moment (January 2014) &amp;#34;various colors&amp;#34; are not industrial black with clear/opaque.  BUT, though it might not be my choice, I think the underside of my bathroom cabinet will not be offended, and I am not inviting Martha Stewart to help spray the toilet, so I think I am safe.  Only real surprise was the size.  Keep that in mind, and it might be a bonus in some cases.  Worth the money.  (Hope for pink, it is better than the alternative. . . .)</li>
            <li> Great product - exactly what I was l was looking for!</li>
            <li> Great for misting plants. I also keep a mixture of vinegar and water in one, next to my sink, to disinfect fruits, vegetables, cutting boards, and kitchen surfaces--in combination with spritzes of hydrogen peroxide, which I keep in its original light-blocking opaque bottle, topped with the spray head from a Tolco.</li>
            <li> No complaints does the job</li>
            <li> I use it as a water gun when my wife and I have water fights randomly in the summer, works great!  The distance is perfect for all rooms in the house.  She hates it!  Thanks Tolco!</li>
            <li> Nice small compact easy to  hold  and nice spray for indoor plants.&lt;br /&gt;Expected red,yellow,blue or green but no problem at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great for everything from spraying plants to using for haircare products. Doesn&#x27;t clog. I have had it for a year with aloe water to hydrate my hair and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> These things are really easy to shatter---and break.  Dropped one and a whole big shard broke completely away.  Another cracked and everything leaked out.  It&#x27;s like the Pinto of squirt bottles.</li>
            <li> This is a well-made little spray bottle, which, considering its price, it well should be!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink,not clear as shown.</li>
            <li> I got this to spray peppermint oil around the house and so far it does this really well! Its so easy to use</li>
            <li> Simply amazing. I use these with water to get cloth wipes wet - the bottles have a stream or a spray, excellent &amp;#34;pressure,&amp;#34; easy to use/squeeze, they don&#x27;t leak when sideways (fallen over)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a peri-bottle, and a different 16oz (too big, poor quality/didn&#x27;t last) spray bottle and this one has been the best by far. Even my husband was excited about how this spray bottle worked - you know your life is vastly different from your pre-kids era when a spray bottle is reason for excitement...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> So many of these spray bottles just don&#x27;t spray correctly, but this one works right from the start.  Good deal.</li>
            <li> Nice spray bottle. It&#x27;s s sturdy acrylic, pretty, and mists well. I&#x27;m using it in my art room to wet paint and keep watercolor paper damp. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Did not include the spray top. Only included the plastic base. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Handle broke only after a hand full of spays.  Literally it was only after I filled it once.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many spray bottles.  I need one to spray water.  So far the trigger has broken on all that I have had.  This one is more solid than the others, seals well, and does the job.</li>
            <li> Received quickly. Good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spray bottle and it works just fine.  I got pink, which was fine since it was for my 3 year old daughter, but might not have been as great if it was for my son.</li>
            <li> I got the spray bottle and it was fine , but it was the wrong color!!!! I wanted black!!!! but it came in this teal green color!!!</li>
            <li> Great little bottle, I use it to spray my cats when they misbehave!</li>
            <li> When the water level gets low, it takes several squeezes to get the water spraying.</li>
            <li> I got two of these and they came in 2 colors (blue and pink), which works for me.  I needed bottles that can produce a fine mist for my indoor plants and to just put humidity into my dry winter, heated air.  These work great.  They are small enough to carry just the perfect amount of water for me to do one spraying of all my plants and rooms at the same time.  They are easy to use and do not stress my hands.  If you are tired of struggling with the large spray bottles, you might want to give these a try.</li>
            <li> I like the shorter sized bottle, and the sprayer is very good.  I use this for dampening my hair in order to style it.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  I&#x27;m a bread baker and use it to gently spray water on the loaf before going into the oven</li>
            <li> this was for my dog training, arrived quickly, pefect size. Thanks</li>
            <li> Got this bottle as an add-on because my dog has been having some...behavioral issues. Trainer recommended spraying him with water when he gets back This is one of those odd products that you buy hoping you never have to use it. But the bottle itself seems well made and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> just a spray bottle.... don&#x27;t use it for anything with bleach in it tho. It dissolves the inside of the sprayer mechanism and you end up with junk</li>
            <li> the straw broke while trying to wash it, that was before I even got a chance to try it. If I could rate it 0 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> The bottle sprays a fine mist of water instead of doing a stream like some spray bottles. I&#x27;ve had no problems using it.</li>
            <li> As strange as it may seem, I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding a decent spray bottle.  A lot break easily - too large,leak,  etc.  As Goldilocks said, &amp;#34;this one is just right&amp;#34;.  I use my spray bottle for everything - ironing, spritzing curly hair, tending my plants, spraying my neighbors&#x27; cat when it&#x27;s in my yard.... this one has the power and sturdiness to do all that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well constructed.  No leaks, solid feel in your hand.  I&#x27;ve already dropped it a few times, and it&#x27;s hanging in like a champ!</li>
            <li> Ordered 2, neither lasted longer than 2 weeks before spray pattern vanished.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought this earlier. I bought several cheap bottles at Target and they lasted less than a day. This sprayer works great. Very durable. Can tilt bottle down and it sprays fine. Can adjust mist to spray very misty or direct spray. Had for a few weeks and works great. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Out of several spray bottles I have tested out, these are the most efficient. I will buy them again if I ever need more</li>
            <li> Its so convenient usually there when i need to do something in a hurry with it. So its very accessible and entertaining at most times of the day seems like i find endless uses for it...</li>
            <li> Why show a nice neutral color bottle and then send a pink one?  I threw it out and went to CVS to get a new one.  What a waste.</li>
            <li> I keep diluted white vinegar in this, and a shaker of baking soda, in the bathroom to clean the sink and tub.  This spray bottle works well and is easy to refill.</li>
            <li> It has surprising water pressure for something this cheap/small. It&#x27;s good for spraying bad cats to get them off the table.</li>
            <li> Bottle Arrived on time. Works great. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> The image shows a black spray bottle and what arrived was pink.</li>
            <li> Cute little pink bottle but the finest mist you can get from turning nozzle still spits heavy drops along with fine mist. Not good enough for my needs but too cheap to send back.</li>
            <li> So glad we got pink! I use it to spray my two year old daughters hair in the morning to help me style it easier.</li>
            <li> Received these water bottles, filled one up and it worked!  All the previous water bottles I have bought have not sprayed very well and I have had issues with them leaking.  These do not.  They suit our purpose fine.  I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Not the best one out there.  Poor amount of pressure when you squeeze.  I really don&#x27;t expect this to last a month.</li>
            <li> This is a small bottle, but a nice size for my hair spritzes. The spray is a kind of &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; instead of a steady stream which I love because it&#x27;s easier to distribute product throughout my hair. The bottle is also very study as it has taken many tumbles and still has all of it&#x27;s plastic parts.</li>
            <li> Very nice spray bottle.  It is good quality but feel I probably could have got one cheaper at Target but it saved me gas not running to the store so overall I guess it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This item works well for me.  I use it to mist water on wrinkled clothes which helps remove the wrinkles.  One thing to consider is that it is a pretty small bottle and I don&#x27;t think it was meant to be used for &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;.  They make more industrial spray bottles if you are looking to use it for some sort of manual labor task such as making a bleach spray bottle to use for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I know we are using ours \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s the water sprayer for our cloth baby wipes.  I love the size and I like the color but every time my little guy knocks it off the changing table the nozzle breaks off and it&#x27;s back to dipping the wipes in a jar. Can we just buy the sprayer attachment since that&#x27;s the part that breaks?  So far we&#x27;ve gone through three of them.  Baby is 7 months old so that&#x27;s not TOO bad except that they&#x27;ve all broken in the last 2 months now that he&#x27;s more mobile.  The most recent one lasted less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;Anybody have any suggestions for a sprayer that&#x27;s more durable?  I like this one but am tired of having them break. :(</li>
            <li> Got it for squirting the dogs when they bark. Has a good misting spray, doesn&#x27;t make a good hard squirt but maybe that&#x27;s just my bottle. The dogs hate it and it doesn&#x27;t leak... pretty much all I was hoping for in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several &amp;#34;bummer&amp;#34; spray bottles from big box sellers and they always stopped working fairly quickly.  I use this one for misting my hair with lavender water and it works great.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost two months and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the same website I bought concentrated hair setting lotion.  This spray bottle does not deliver a fine spray, so I don&#x27;t recommend it for use with setting lotions.</li>
            <li> Nice and durable bottle. I bought it to hold my aloe juice and water mixture that I spritz my hair with. The nozzle can be adjusted to control the stream of liquid.</li>
            <li> A bottle from the dollar store would have done the trick. Nothing special for the price.</li>
            <li> The bottle came and the cap does not screw on properly and the bottle leaks when you try to spray it.</li>
            <li> It is NOT a glass bottle as the &amp;#34;Frosted&amp;#34; title suggests. It&#x27;&#x27;s made of plastic.</li>
            <li> The plastic quality of the spray top is not good enough, so the hinge broke after a week, and renders the bottle pretty much useless. While the hinge lasted it was working fine, and had it not broken I would have given this a 5 star.</li>
            <li> These bottles are so handy. I saw the one pictured was green, my favorite color. So I ordered one bottle hoping I would get the green one since you could not specify a color choice. But I figured blue would be cool, purple, or orange. But I got PINK! I&#x27;m a guy. Hated the color but I figured what the hell. It will stand out when I need to find it quickly. I ordered these because they were small and I liked the green colored one pictured. Not like the ones I saw in the stores. Tall, white and industrial looking and sound like a goose when you pull the trigger. I keep these on several counter tops around the apartment to spray the gnats and mosquitoes that fly around the bathroom mirror, kitchen counter, and me. I keep them filled with 91% rubbing alcohol. One or two sprays and the gnats fall right to the ground and I can get them. The alcohol evaporates quickly and leaves no mess. The second one I ordered I included a note with my order, \\&quot;Please no pink this time, green if you have it\\&quot;. Well my order arrived and it was GREEN! Made my day. So a 5 star rating for the product and company. I might even order another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use outdoors to spray my lemon tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only 8 ounces, but I don&#x27;t mind filling it when I need to. What I do mind, however (and a big reason why I docked two stars), is when the nozzle decides to twist itself somehow into the off position, and I can&#x27;t actually spray the tree until I twist it around again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no indication as to where the \\&quot;spray\\&quot; position is on the nozzle, and it keeps twisting itself. Every single day, I run into this problem, and if it weren&#x27;t one of the cheapest spray bottles I could get, I&#x27;d say it wasn&#x27;t worth the money. In this case, I get what I paid for, and that&#x27;s sub-par.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend keeping your money and purchasing something a bit costlier, but I can&#x27;t recommend anything specific. Just...not this, unless you&#x27;re willing to be frustrated whilst using it.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I was happy to purchase it.  Unfortunately, on the day it arrived, it also sprang a leak, with a large crack up the side.  This is probably a fluke, but is disappointing nonetheless.</li>
            <li> This kind of spray bottle used to be common. You could find them at every drugstore and even groceries. But when I went looking for some this time I could not find any. At least not in 4 different stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them to spray my cats when they are destroying something, sharpening their claws on furniture, trying to run outside, etc. I wanted one in several rooms. Since the spray is adjustable I can make the spray go 10 feet or make it a diffused spray for ironing. They are useful. And much more convenient than large spray bottles.</li>
            <li> I bought this to deter my cat from getting on the counters and other bad behavior. This thing has range ! I never thought I would rave about the quality of a spray bottle. But I am. It is solidly made the perfect size.</li>
            <li> These bottles have an easy to use twist end to control the spray diameter and strength. Much better than the &amp;#34;spray/off&#x27; style  for misting plants. My Colorado garden is loving these!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I use it to squirt my kitten when he&#x27;s being naughty. You can adjust it to spray pretty far which is nice. Wish I had received the color in the picture (green with black sprayer) but I got pink with a pink sprayer which is okay. If I ever need another one I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> Gotta keep it filled if you spray at an angle, but it&#x27;s a good size.</li>
            <li> Using it for magnesium oil. Wasn&#x27;t getting a mist and realized one has to turn the spray nozzle to adjust the spray pattern.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with nozzle as pictured!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, purchased for food purposes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a water bottle.  not much to say except the worked, they squirt, and they held the water!  Packaging basic and recieved carefree and promptly.</li>
            <li> It works. No problems.</li>
            <li> You can use this little bottle for a lot of functions. Its a good price and its a simple product, I cant see anyone posting a long review on this item. Good bank for the buck.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. Came broken. The bottle is a really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> This sprayer sprays a very fine mist. It is good for hair or watering small plants where you don&#x27;t want a stream of water.</li>
