            <li>It works great, and I caught on immediately.</li>
            <li>This Oral-B toothbrush worked great</li>
            <li>I think it is a lot of money for a toothbrush but the feeling after brushing/ cleaning is great.</li>
            <li>these are great if you care about your teeth,  </li>
            <li>The 4000 is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great electric toothbrush, Oral-B does it well.</li>
            <li>No complaints, and my wife just went for a 6month checkup and was told how great she had been brushing,</li>
            <li>Oral-B makes great products.</li>
            <li>So, even though I&#x27;m happy with the battery-powered toothbrush, I cannot recommend the rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Still happy with it.  </li>

            <li>It is somewhat noisy but is very effective.</li>
            <li>i love it great price and one of the best oral-b</li>
            <li>&amp; I can honestly say that it is a very good electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>What an amazing job it does cleaning!  </li>
            <li>Good battery life and works great</li>
            <li>I am not tech savvy, so I was really impressed at the readability of the user manual and the elegant simplicity of product design.</li>
            <li>Really nice jacket!</li>
            <li>We all love these and am very happy with his product.</li>
            <li>Good quality and has been working great.  </li>
            <li>It cleans better than any that I have had before and the timer system is perfect.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has great power and does a good job</li>
            <li>It works great, just as awesome as my original.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily the best toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Elite uses sound vibration and was good toothbrush, but the Oral-B is a great toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>I used an electric toothbrush some years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>My son has already lost the travel case, which I wasn&#x27;t too happy about, but I liked that it had room for a couple of heads and the brush.</li>
            <li>it work good</li>
            <li>and it looks good too.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a toothbrush with power to give a really good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>They keep making changes to products that are already so good</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>The battery powered Oral B was good for the years I&#x27;ve had one, but this rechargeable felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the Sonicare toothbrushes but this Oral B does a good job.  </li>
            <li>This one was the a good choice.  </li>
            <li>It has power and keeps a good charge.  </li>
            <li>The size is good, both the handle and the brush itself.</li>
            <li>Battery power is good too.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the portable one did not come with a travel case!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I laughed at another review that noted it made her/him drool.  </li>
            <li>i purchased this toothbrush a year ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>(Not as good as the dentist, but close).  </li>
            <li>Good product&lt;br /&gt;Charge lasts a good bit&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality, works good.</li>
            <li>Its a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reading the instruction booklet is a good idea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good practice, if you can, to rinse and swish with water--that&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good practice, if you can, to rinse and swish with water--that&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest tooth brush..absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from that, the product is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It drives me nuts when I&#x27;m trying to buy a product and it turns out the product is good</li>
            <li>The head is a good size and it has good movement.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal.</li>
            <li>to the use of the toothbrush, it is a good deal louder than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Nice design and works very nicely.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is excellent to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Every time I visit the dentist they tell me your teeth are in excellent condition and very healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>I would say I love it because it&#x27;s so much better than my 1000 model I used before (especially love the sensitivity function</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of years now and my dental check ups are quick and flawless.  </li>
            <li>But it was in my own bathroom with a pleasant massage and buffing up of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Gave it as a gift and the recipient was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Great product, like it so much more than the Sonacare.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>This Pro-white brush does an excellent job in keeping your dental visit fresh.</li>
            <li>This one is great because it has a much more distinctive timer feature.  </li>
            <li>It does great for cleaning &amp; whiteing you teeth, my wife &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Oral-B 4000.</li>
            <li>Great quality, love the case for brushes, cleans well.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this toothbrush, I would recommend this toothbrush to my friends, and I will purchase a brush from OralB again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very glad to have this and use it exclusively now, my Sonicare is collecting dust.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own good.</li>
            <li>It works great and makes my teeth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li>It does a very good job of getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>it does an excellent job of clianing your teeth, and it really feels good as well.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this brush cleans great, seems to keep a good charge and is ergonomically comfortable.  </li>
            <li>We love the flossing brush!  </li>
            <li>My teeth still feel like I just came from having them cleaned--it&#x27;s fabulous!!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Oral-B as is 100% better!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>

            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>If you can over-look that 1 thing, you will love this tooth-brush!</li>
            <li>I really love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Love this brush and would buy it again and again!</li>
            <li>This is better than any electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tried!  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>and this one is even better!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love mine!</li>
            <li>Much better!  </li>
            <li>The clean sensation is great after cleaning my teeth and the timing for each side is good.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I am impressed with how much cleaner my mouth and teeth feel!</li>
            <li>It was an amazing feeling.</li>
            <li>so if the charger was 110/220 it would have been amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was especially pleased when I took it on a 10 day vacation and the battery lasted the whole time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use all of the modes on it, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option.</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice travel case, too.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is really nice.</li>
            <li>The difference is astounding.</li>
            <li>Absolute best toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The time alarm feature is a good way to make sure that you are doing diligence with all of your teeth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have the toothbrush protected during travels.</li>
            <li>Nice design.</li>
            <li>and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>I did so much research on the perfect toothbrush for my husband, and he loves this one, he has been using it for amost a year</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a manual brush and floss kind of girl</li>
            <li>a nice option if you&#x27;re sharing.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had great dental check-ups for many years; now we expect them to be even better.</li>
            <li>Fuction wise, I think this brush is way better than sonicare.</li>
            <li>but it requires soldering and you need to quite electronically handy to do that.</li>
            <li>one also comes with a travel case, which is nice if you take your electric toothbrush on vacation</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not 100 percent sold on trusting a vibrating brush instead of my own effort, but I&#x27;m warming up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has helped us brush longer with the nice timer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Travel case is nice - holds the toothbrush and two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i own</li>
            <li>I tried one at the time and was never that thrilled with its performance vs a manual tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Excellent fast shipping so close to the holiday season.</li>
            <li>have one of my own, and have been using it for about 3 years with no</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 1000% thrilled with this toothbrush and will never use a manual brush again.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush is effective.</li>
            <li>The battery charge holds nicely.  </li>
            <li>#34;hands on&amp;#34; a great improvement over my original one.  </li>
            <li>My Teeth was never so clean and my Dentist is happy.</li>
            <li>I found it to operate quite easily and felt it did a good job on cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Before buying I researched and found this brand and model to be rated the best and after using it I completely agree!</li>
            <li>/&gt;so far very happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had an oral b toothbrush before I bought this one, which I liked, but this one is better.  </li>
            <li>model is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product thus far.</li>
            <li>but the new one has much more power and is just a great product!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;A very fine product.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>It has a very nice grip so it is comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Leaves a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>my honest opinion, the Sonicare is the better value and the better toothbrush between the two (Oral-B and Sonicare).</li>
            <li>He was very nice and got my replacement sent to me right away.</li>
            <li>This is a great electric toothbrush and the timing feature really helps!</li>
            <li>The grip on the handle was very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap decision on Oral-B&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li>Now, nice and easy.</li>
            <li>between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage case for brush heads is nice to keep them covered and can be cleaned easily.</li>
            <li>Have been using my new toothbrush and Surprising Good cleaning toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very easy to clean also-bonus!</li>
            <li>I also love the travel box that is included.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My 3rd Oral B brush and the best yet.</li>
            <li>It is a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many year.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that it has a timer to gauge my brushing each section.</li>
            <li>I have a 3000 that I have had for years and love it</li>
            <li>i feel that it has more power.  </li>
            <li>I understand many newer bathrooms may have accommodations for this</li>
            <li>Have been using Oral-B electric brushes for many years.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This one seems like it will do a much better job.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush and found you can get replacement heads at target for this at a discount.</li>
            <li>and I find that each time, as in this case, the emphasis is on style and making things even more sleek.  </li>
            <li>Been using Oral-B/Braun electric brushes for many years.</li>
            <li>although I have been using Sonicare products for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Since I have diabetes, this brush does more to stimulate blood circulation in my gumline as well.  </li>
            <li>I also love the 30 mins intervals so that you know when to switch to another quadrant</li>
            <li>I love the sonicare and don&#x27;t like the oral-B.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It did an OK job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Oral-B for years and love it.</li>
            <li>i love it .i</li>

            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>We both love them.</li>
            <li>Over all, I am pleased with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I love Oral-B toothbrushes and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Though it took some time and thorough research before I decided on this pricey purchase, I&#x27;m glad I did it</li>
            <li>and my teeth are much better for it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned and used the Oral-B triumph for many years..</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and is a great design.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is a bit more vigorous, but I have become accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>this tooth brush is much better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Still don&#x27;t understand how i was living without it before :)</li>
            <li>It also helps your gums stay healthy.</li>
            <li>I feel like a WINNER when I beat my brush, but am I really winning?</li>
            <li>No brush cleans better than that.  </li>
            <li>This is now my favorite electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love Oral B products.  </li>
            <li>Probably would have been satisfied with the 1000 model as I don&#x27;t use any of the additional modes on the 4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I would love this toothbrush if it weren&#x27;t for one thing.</li>
            <li>Love the built in timer where every 30 seconds the toothbrush lets you know to move to another quadrant.</li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>This system seems to do a much better job at cleaning than those.</li>
            <li>I like Oral-B netter and think it provides better cleaning than Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with its performance &amp; would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>so feels better in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Really glad this happened.  </li>
            <li>For this price, I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li>So I had to buy more for the toothbrush plus lost out on the tax</li>
            <li>It has produced significantly better results as verified by my dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>bit as good with updated feathures and should be a solid investment in great dental care.</li>
            <li>My dentist says the spinning heads are better at cleaning than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast shipping, works great</li>
            <li>so no need to spend more money.</li>
            <li>I think Sonicare is better if you have braces, but if you don&#x27;t have braces, the Oral-B product is better.</li>
            <li>but that is OK.</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t even consider another brand as a replacement, since the Oral-B had given such excellent service and performance over so many years.</li>
            <li>All the items and attachments fit together perfectly, and the handy Charger/Storage Case holds 4 Brush Heads (Only 1 included).</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with Oral-B.</li>
            <li>A much better way to brush.</li>
            <li>She says it did a good job but was not as powerful as her Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a friend and he has really enjoyed this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>He stated it makes his teeth feel more like he has just been</li>
            <li>It does a much better job of removing plaque than the sonic care.</li>
            <li>I have not used an electric in decades but decided I needed better brushing.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought the Oral B electric tooth brush and really love it .</li>
            <li>I use this to have healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>There are so many options and fancy doodads on some of these</li>
            <li>/&gt;However; my love for this product led me to leave a review</li>
            <li>fantastic toothbrush has found a permanent place in my home!</li>
            <li>I like the feel of this brush on my gums much more than my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>but I am glad to have them if the need arrises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am most pleased with how my teeth feel when I finish brushing.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>Love the design and functionality of this electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>cleans my teeth better</li>
            <li>I chose the Oral-B based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, online reviews, and claims that it is the most dentist recommended electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>*much* better than a manual toothbrush in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;-Large</li>
            <li>Spend a couple more bucks and get a sonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product is outstanding works just as discribed.</li>
            <li>AND SO GLAD I DID.  </li>
            <li>I always using Oral-B Toothbrushes for many Years now.</li>
            <li>B is famous for its quality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful to have a beeper at the 30 second mark for each quandrant....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be better if you could toggle between each setting without having to turn the brush around to see the settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>And I love the timer</li>
            <li>Pleased with the Oral B product itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing I will have this Oral-B for at lease 10 years! :-)</li>
            <li>Having said that, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>this newer toothbrush operates more efficiently and seems stronger than the one it replaced.  </li>
            <li>This seems to give a much better cleaning and has some features</li>
            <li>her teeth, gums, everything was looking healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this tooth brush</li>
            <li>(It gets more noticeable as the charging process</li>
            <li>Despite my initial skepticism, I am completely impressed.</li>
            <li>My teeth look and feel better.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is OK; I purchased the replaceable battery-powered toothbrush also to compare.  </li>
            <li>Used Sonicares for years but the Oral B is better.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I would add that I would prefer a more slender handle.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that is better than being beeped at, but I would prefer having instructions that apply to the appliance I received.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely good hygiene habits and even the right toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Is that this toothbrush does a very good job at cleaning my teeth and making my whole mouth feel clean and</li>
            <li>Does a great job cleaning and polishing--manual toothbrushes don&#x27;t give you nearly as much of a fresh, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Sure makes you teeth feel nice and clean</li>
            <li>Love it and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works as great as advertised (as did the older 2 oral Bs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and accurate.</li>
            <li>feel like your teeth are getting very clean</li>
            <li>like it , gets teeth very clean , don&#x27;t forget to floss also , save a fortune on your teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Teeth feel very very clean after use.  </li>
            <li>Everything was very clean.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>We went on a week long vacation and it worked perfectly all week with 2 of the 3 bars of charge still lit.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time in years that the dentist said he was doing a good job and had no cavities.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;rechargeable battery is a problem, they cannot hold the charge long after some use, whether you give it your best care or not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This feels good in the mouth and hand, certainly doing a better job than I did by hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that it is still like new.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B 4000 is easy to use and the toothbrushes spin in a circle giving me a better cleaning of my teeth.</li>
            <li>This model, the 4000, seems to do a much better job of cleaning your teeth, but without the head-jarring strong vibration of the cheaper model.  </li>
            <li>the rectangular head of the Sonicare which can tear your gums more easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My gums bled more frequently using the Sonicare than I have experienced with Oral B.  </li>
            <li>Its design is handsome and perfectly fitted to the hand, more comfortable to hold for those minutes twice a day spent brushing.</li>
            <li>my teech become quite quite clean !</li>
            <li>the dentist clean!  </li>
            <li>Mu teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
            <li>Clean your teeth!</li>
            <li>My mouth feels super clean!!</li>
            <li>Great action.</li>
            <li>Now, I greatly prefer the cleaning action with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;be more comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li>It is much more comfortable to use and way quieter.  </li>
            <li>but this oral-b professional 4000 is really a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A blinking light would make much more sense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very pleased with the performance of the ProWhite Precision 4000 and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>, this model feels better built, solid, a bit heavier (in a good way), and has a nice ergonomic grip.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for my mother and she loved it so much that I asked for it for my birthday.</li>
            <li>It works well, leaves my teeth feeling very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put together.</li>
            <li>I feel it does a better job cleaning your teeth, plus the unit is easy to clean after each brushing.  </li>
            <li>have a sonic care and can go two weeks easy w/o charge even after a year.</li>
            <li>It is also much better than the Phillips Sonic which it replaced, teeth feel sparklingly clean.</li>
            <li>the replacement heads are easy to come by.  </li>
            <li>And the increased number of oscillations gives a better, clean feel.</li>
            <li>:  Tried it out now for a week, and the battery life is going strong.  </li>
            <li>Ive been using it for over a year now, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I bought as a gift and was liked very much</li>
            <li>This toothbrush adequately cleans my teeth; however, I don&#x27;t feel it is as good as my first Oral-B 3-D Excel from 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>general, I guess I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>It would be so much better if it was a more distinct sound.</li>
            <li>Well, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used an electric toothbrush, but I can&#x27;t honestly say that I like it.  </li>
            <li>So when I saw this Healthy Clean + ProWhite model was available, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The default works just fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>But, it still works fine.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I liked about the toothbrush is how light it is and how well it fit in my hand.  </li>
            <li>This device is so easy and fun, I brush more often than I did with a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I love the clean, clean feeling of this rechargeable.</li>
            <li>Brushing is more fun now.</li>
            <li>It is probably effective, but i have gum issues and need gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush which has multiple features.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the cheap stuff you find on ebay.</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy at the price i bought during BF</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now with this.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is a great product.</li>
            <li>The travel case is nice too although I don&#x27;t travel as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>Nice product and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT TO THEM.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that we can use different heads for each family member.</li>
            <li>I buy the attachments on ebay for cheap</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended that I try this - I must admit I was a bit skeptic - but I truly enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush was more than worth it.  </li>
            <li>I did request hassle free packaging and got retail</li>
            <li>a day).&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature of the Oral-B is the selection of different types of Interchangeable Brush Heads --</li>
            <li>Also available at Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We liked it so much we bought two of them.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried enough models to test his theory, but I can say that this one does work great.</li>
            <li>IT IS FABULOUS AND</li>
            <li>The case attached to the stand is useful but also means the unit takes up more space on your bathroom sink/</li>
            <li>These enhancements are nice, but don&#x27;t add too much value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is also a feather light mode and a diamond polishing mode.</li>
            <li>I resubmitted the form along with a letter explaining the frustration free shipping label and received another letter from Oral-B, stating that the UPC is not</li>
            <li>I look forward to the sensation of perfectly cleaned teeth and think my oral hygiene just got bumped up a few notches.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I kept all documentation, including a copy of the pertinent information in the instruction booklet.  </li>
            <li>No telephone numbers available, so I called Customer Support.  </li>
            <li>so that batteries will fit into it.  </li>
            <li>I had an old version of an oral b / Braun toothbrush that I loved.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>so far so good...</li>
            <li>If you are not 100% satisfied, return handle, refills and charging unit with original cash receipt postmarked within 60 days of purchase to receive a full refund (full details inside pack)\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it my teeth felt polished like when you leave the dentist office!!</li>
            <li>Very nice electric brush that you can buy different heads for depending on what you need.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.  </li>
            <li>This model is very nice, several settings and streamlined.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a self timer and several settings which are very nice to have.  </li>
            <li>We love the clean, fresh feeling that we can get from an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love the way my mouth feels clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>It is not too large and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to just glide the thing around in my mouth and watch the magic happen from a REAL toothbrush that is hands down the BEST one I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sampled this new and advanced version of the same brush and I am very, very impressed.  </li>
            <li>A tremendous cleaning and easy travel case</li>
            <li>This was a replacement brush, so I&#x27;m familiar with the brand.  </li>
            <li>Great travel case, and long battery charge.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the automatic pause that allows one to move to another section of the mouth and brush for the full amount of time suggested by dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our original Oral-B was over 7 years old.....and still working......</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush and love it.  </li>
            <li>I was going for a straightforward electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up and even though the charging light didn&#x27;t come on right away but took 10 minutes to show up as mentioned in the directions.</li>
            <li>A very good replacement and improvement to my previously discontinued Oral B Triumph.</li>
            <li>Very good action, teeth feel nearly professionally cleaned 6 weeks after my dental visit.  </li>
            <li>Its new feature of varied speeds/pressures brushing are a nice addition.  </li>
            <li>I wore out an older Oral-B electric tooth brush which I thought did a great job, but the new model is even better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You get the dentist clean feeling each time you brush.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ever use a manual toothbrush it doesn&#x27;t or will ever clean as well as this thing.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and energized after brushing.</li>
            <li>it keep teeth clean</li>
            <li>, my teeth feel so clean after brushing</li>
            <li>The stand is actually also a useful and practical place to store the brush heads and they avoided updating the travel case which is and has been a great design.</li>
            <li>After brushing with Oral-B professinal, teeth feels completly clean.</li>
            <li>and my mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li>After brushing with Oral-B professinal, teeth feels completly clean.  </li>
            <li>tootch change to clean and bright.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Once you get used to the clean teeth feeling</li>
            <li>I really love how it stalls every 30 seconds to let you know when the time is up for each quadrant, and there is a light that lets you know when you are applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li>makes my teeth and mouth feel squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li>teeth are clean when I&#x27;m finished using this electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I use the Precision Clean brush head about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>And the clean feeling lasts for hours!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It floats over the teeth and they feel really clean afterward.  </li>
            <li>Definately leaves a clean feeling when using this brush.</li>
            <li>Really like the aggressive action of the brush and the great choice of head designs there are.</li>
            <li>Box not the original, but rather an Amazon special, so no picture on it to check the model.</li>
            <li>preferred Oral-B brush head is Dual Action, but smaller heads provide very good cleaning and are easy to maneuver in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>We have used Braun/Oral B electric toothbrushes pretty much since they first came out, but this is the best we&#x27;ve ever had, by far.</li>
            <li>however I don&#x27;t mind that Oral B is a little louder because it&#x27;s more important for me to have a good clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth definitely feel cleaner (like dentist office clean), so I think this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>head does a good job scrubbing my teeth clean, though as cautioned it did cause some initial bleeding of the gums, but that passed in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Does a very good job of cleaning my teeth without being too harsh.</li>
            <li>Much better than my older model!</li>
            <li>Replaced the same (but older) version (&amp;#34;Triumph Professional&amp;#34;) and as always, was very happy with this Oral-B product.  </li>
            <li>in all, I recommend the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush; but to be honest, it&#x27;s not that much of an upgrade from the Oral B Triumph.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t played around too much with the various modes--to be honest, 4 modes seems to be overkill, but I guess it&#x27;s nice to have options.  </li>
            <li>The darned thing just died, so writing a good review is not possible.  </li>
            <li>I used to use a cheap $30 electric tooth brush, and wondered whether paying $90 would be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a whole lot better than the replacement Braun That it replaced.</li>
            <li>Quality fabric, true to size and color.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a full charge overnight.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be a cool feature for both sight and hearing impaired.</li>
            <li>Dad loved it for a Fathers Day present.</li>
            <li>If your oral health is already really good from just using a manual brush, then an electric toothbrush probably won&#x27;t take things to the next level</li>
            <li>We swear by this unit and recommend it to everyone out there who wants to maintain a healthy set of gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>I researched several sonic toothbrushes before deciding on the Oral-B and feel like I made a good choice.</li>
            <li>The brush and replacement heads are a bit pricey, but occasionally Amazon has good deals and coupons for brush heads.</li>
            <li>I really liked the sensitive and whitening modes on this model and appreciate the beep every 30 seconds for timing.  </li>
            <li>Another handy indicator is battery life as our old brush had a habit of running out after my wife had used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a chat, on-line, with Sumar Jit regarding this matter and explained in full my problem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve always bought the best available model, which happen to be the most expensive of the range too&lt;</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply any pressure because it works smoothly on its own (a red light goes on if you are pressing too much).It</li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush of all time, this product is very well made.</li>
            <li>She also said the DentistRx Intelisonic was just as good and designed by the same person as the Sonicare, but I did not bother to confirm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That was true for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, overall a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>No where does the literature state that you will not receive a full refund.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh  and clean every  time.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is powerful and my teeth and gums feel thoroughly clean after using it.</li>
            <li>It makes your mouth feels really fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li>Maybe, if I&#x27;m lucky, I&#x27;ll forget it in a hotel bathroom.</li>
            <li>There are tremendous improvements.  </li>
            <li>I love the travel case, and it also has a storage tray for extra brush heads if more than one person uses it.</li>
            <li>Super tooth brush</li>
            <li>I had to go to the store and buy the Oral-B in the manufactures box to give it as a Christmas present....and am lucky</li>
            <li>My teeth feel great and compared to a standard brush, my retainer is much cleaner and smoother.  </li>
            <li>It would be even better if it came with more extra heads.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean and fresh after using this brush.</li>
            <li>Great for the busy on-the-go professional.</li>
            <li>I, however, am new to electric toothbrushes and the force with which the brush hit my teeth and gums was kind of jolting at first.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it costs quite a bit up front, but the ability to brush smoothly and in areas you normally can&#x27;t reach easily makes the line of Oral B / Braun electric toothbrushes worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, we&#x27;re very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is able to accommodate several different types of Oral-B toothbrush heads, which is great.</li>
            <li>I got it for Oral B Professional healthy Clean + Precision 4000 Rechargeable tooth brush about two weeks ago, not use it yet, need to confirm that in Singapore need to convert the voltage ?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for about a month now</li>
            <li>The new style brushes actually do a better job.</li>
            <li>I love this new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This new Oral-B cleans so much better than my 10-year-old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Triumph for a couple years and wanted to try this new model to see if it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li>Love my new tooth brush.</li>
            <li>But its lighted index for recharging is my favorite new addition.  </li>
            <li>This is a great improvement over previous versions.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush but battery life seems shorter than my previous Oral-B Pro, and it takes longer to recharge.  </li>
            <li>Great value and from my previous experience</li>
            <li>Heads come off easy and attach fast for sharing the motor with my wife.  </li>
            <li>However, my first two lasted for almost 15 years!  </li>
            <li>Our experience with the Oral-B brand and Amazon make this a very highly-recommended product !!</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist agrees with my assessment, so I guess I should have just asked her first!</li>
            <li>It makes me feel better to know that my teeth are getting a better clean than with conventional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It also keeps the charge for at least 10 days, making it ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li>I like how it has a built in warning light that lets you know if you are putting too much pressure on the gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>Take this system paired with a pro white head &amp; whitening tooth paste; it gets amazing results.  </li>
            <li>They advertise it as 10 days worth of usage</li>
            <li>but I am having much better results with this electric toothbrush vs. manual or my old sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Thus far I am pleased with this model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth it...</li>
            <li>Much better than my old Oral B which I had for 10 years.  </li>
            <li>The additional features work well and are useful.</li>
            <li>I think it does a better job than an old fashoned brush.</li>
            <li>and It make my smile brighter</li>
            <li>like it, I hope it is useful after a couple of months</li>
            <li>Replaced my old electric tooth brush after many years.  </li>
            <li>The battery stays charged for quite a while &amp; it&#x27;s quite powerful.</li>
            <li>No brush is worth $250.  </li>
            <li>But this brush is definately worth what I paid here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact, especially for one person.  </li>
            <li>latest purchase is 4000 with the red light alert</li>
            <li>Kind of like riding a Harley without actually getting on a motorcycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works far better than the Sonicare Elite, which I am now sending over the rainbow.  </li>
            <li>I have been an Oral B user for many years, so when my old one died, I replaced it with a newer model.  </li>
            <li>(make sure you bring a back up if you do) and I have it four stars because of its cleaning power which really was better than my Spinbrush pro.</li>
            <li>worth the investment</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush last fall and  liked it</li>
            <li>It is more comfortable than the old straight one.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is a nice extra.  </li>
            <li>This one takes up a bit more countertop real estate, but I much prefer it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it does do a good job cleaning teeth and the small charging stand is easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>leaves my teeth feeling fresh, feeling clean and sooooo much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Now I do not have the yellow problem anymore and feel much better about how clean my teeth</li>
            <li>leave any more of a clean feeling than a regular manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>&quot; [note that we don&#x27;t really have a choice], cut out and mail the original UPC barcode from your shipping</li>
            <li>We had an earlier version of the Oral-B which we liked very much, but the charger gave out so we ordered this one.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly to those looking for a good oral hygiene; this is definitely the right tool.</li>
            <li>This thing is 20 times better than brushing with a conventional tooth brush - my teeth are polished smooth after ever brushing!</li>
            <li>I just snapped the toothbrush and the charger right out of that unit and through the brush holder away.</li>
            <li>done right.  </li>
            <li>Also the price is right and cones with a travel case.</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>Instead it stops for a moment and then starts right up again.  </li>
            <li>the tooth brushing happens more effectively with very little saliva</li>
            <li>Until this new Professional, highly attractive, all-purpose Braun moved into  the cabinet, I admit there are times when I&#x27;ve returned to the old fashioned, hand-powered brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a Good product, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush, and while I&#x27;m still adjusting to the novelty and slight bulkiness of it, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than the one that we had that broke down after many years of service, will probably buy another one for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i only bought my latest 4000 because i need a quick replacement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>The best feature I like about this toothbrush is the red light that comes on when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>The choice of 30 or 45 second time periods for length of brushing is very handy, since generally I prefer a longer brushing time.</li>
            <li>Holds an amazing long charge.  </li>
            <li>my teeth feel clean and better than they have for a long time.  </li>
            <li>what happened?\\&quot; after their first brushing with the new Professional Braun Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Others have commented on the small head size of the toothbrush, I find it to be perfect for reaching around back teeth etc where a larger tooth brush would not have been able to clean as well.  </li>
            <li>The battery capacity on the new model is a HUGE improvement.</li>
            <li>Its now 15 months old, and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to read the information about the Pressure Sensor as the brush will automatically change to the sensitive mode if it detects you are applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li>A good replacement to my previous one except it has no LCD display screen on this model.</li>
            <li>Second one came without a problem and so far so good...</li>
            <li>After 70 years using a regular toothbrush, I find it noisy, efficient, mechanical, challenging and hopefully worth the money if it helps me keep my teeth.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush is nothing special and nowhere near as effective as a quality sonic-style brush for overall oral and gum health.</li>
            <li>The different settings will give you many options to find the right match.</li>
            <li>My son like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, my latest in a long line, they last almost three years before they start to slow down so very good quality.</li>
            <li>This is a quality toothbrush that is easy to use, easy to clean, and durable for everyday use by a five-member household.</li>
            <li>It is good, just takes a little longer to changer it.</li>
            <li>The major design problem is that the bottom of the handle is much, much wider than the top, and the bottom is also the heaviest part of the handle.  </li>
            <li>hopefully the the new one is as good as the older but same one.</li>
            <li>I love the 30 second timer for brushing quadrants of your teeth; I do top out, top inside, bottom outside, bottom inside and move every 30 seconds when the motor stops for a second or so to notify you</li>
            <li>This toothbrush was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I think it was an okay electric toothbrush while it lasted, but that was only 2 years</li>
            <li>Does exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>I use Plaxx pre rinse first, then brush.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t see that it has any more features to warrant the extra cost).</li>
            <li>We also buy our replacement heads on here; I just wish Amazon would regularly have the orthodontics heads available!</li>
            <li>Have been using several generations of Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The first charge takes sometime</li>
            <li>after several months decided to switch to oral b.  absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an Oral-B</li>
            <li>I ordered a sonicare healthy white, which replaces a sonicare essence that was still working</li>
            <li>so I make sure I&#x27;m hitting all areas equally.</li>
            <li>I let it charge the first time for about 24 hours as directed on the manual.</li>
            <li>However, I have followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I felt like my brain was getting vibrated out of my head, but now that I&#x27;m used to it</li>
            <li>My wife was interested in a electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>While I also like the quadrant timer option; I feel like 30-seconds for each quadrant is too fast for me!  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I like it.</li>
            <li>so gross that I don&#x27;t know how many people touched it or did what to it.</li>
            <li>I first to use the product of Oral-</li>
            <li>This one has multiple settings, my favorite being the feather setting which is slower than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>Grip is big and square for better handling.</li>
            <li>It is the first rechargeable I have had.  </li>
            <li>When it worked, I enjoyed this, but after only 6 months, it no longer powers on or shows any lights.</li>
            <li>I also want to add that Amazon saved me almost $50-$80 dollars because I was going to buy it at Walgreens or Walmart but a family member suggested I buy it through you so thanks!</li>
            <li>Finally I have found one that seems to work better in every way than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Does and proforms exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a better white color to your teeth, then try this.  </li>
            <li>we have pretty much a lifetime investment in brush heads!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It cleans better and actually tells me when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li>This cleans his teeth better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Oral B comes with one toothbrush head (although the stand has space for more), and I was a bit worried that it wouldn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions, yes,</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s why I bought a Sonicare in the first place.  </li>
            <li>but I had to return the first one because it stopped recharging.</li>
            <li>Hopefully my dentist will see the difference in my next visit :)</li>
            <li>I have always been a manual toothbrush user, and this is my first experience with an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but this is something to also be aware of.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the unit could be better by either having a longer lasting battery and/or a better built stand.</li>
            <li>sure you change the heads regularly because they do wear out and stop cleaning after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased and would recommend Oral B over Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, with several different options for cleaning teeth and gums,for which purpose you can choose from different toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge well, and is powerful but will not let you apply too much pressure or it will pause temporarily.</li>
            <li>only got a polishing brush head in the Frustration-Free package, I need to buy more.</li>
            <li>, I may actually order more of those style replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>I have to start by saying that I didn&#x27;t purchase my Oral-B 4000 from Amazon because the local warehouse stores have a better price</li>
            <li>I admit that I skipped the operations part after I read how to charge it the first time.</li>
            <li>First time I used this tooth bush</li>
            <li>love the pause in the motion that alerts you to move to a different quadrant of teeth.</li>
            <li>so you know exactly when to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>, they felt almost polished after the first use .</li>
            <li>Much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love the different modes you can choose and the built in quadrant timer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s working out pretty well</li>
            <li>It has a heavier, more-like-power-equipment sound when compared to the Sonicare&#x27;s soft hum.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s probably a useful feature, since I&#x27;ve heard too much pressure hurts the gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This feature of the toothbrush was exactly the solution to what the dentist recommended.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Much better results than with a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference in shine, whiteness and cleanliness of my teeth after the first use</li>
            <li>Mine is still going strong, but the wife&#x27;s got dropped a few too many times -- it died, and couldn&#x27;t be revived.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charge seems to last a good long while, the heads spin like their supposed to while they clean, and I did indeed feel like it cleaned my mouth very well.  </li>
            <li>but I never personally tried any of their products until I got the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My old charger burned out when I tried to use it with a transformer in a former country, so I&#x27;m also happy that the new charger will also charge my older</li>
            <li>I will not be using any other kind of toothbrush ever again.</li>
            <li>So, I can&#x27;t compare this to the other popular ones that use sonic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, time for another one and so far, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 in 2006.  </li>
            <li>I had been using an Oral-B Sonic complete that cleaned just as well and was so much quieter, but it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li>This set is better at cleaning (floss action heads) and MUCH easier to keep clean than the earlier version.  </li>
            <li>B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Brush Head (4 ct.)]], [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The pressure indicator is very helpful and the timer makes sure every side gets brushed evenly.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has four modes that allow you to choose from normal, light, deep clean, and polish.  </li>
            <li>Brought this because my previous Oral B brush died after more than 10 years!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, holds its charge pretty well, and cleans my teeth well enough that my dentist is always complementing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After back to back pregnancies I am trying to get my gums back in shape, the feather setting is very good for this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This new and improved Oral-B Professional model really does seem to do all the things a good dental hygienist does when cleaning teeth except provide a visual exam and x-rays.</li>
            <li>i should have invested in this a long time ago, its just so much better than using the manual brush.</li>
            <li>Surely this thing doesn&#x27;t need to recharge for so long.  </li>
            <li>Not sure the resultant banging of brush against your teeth is a good thing.</li>
            <li>This one is good as usual, but, maybe it&#x27;s just temporary</li>
            <li>A round head is much better to clean between your gum arches then</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really does clean like a professional.</li>
            <li>So the actual charging station is barely bigger than the toothbrush itself, which is perfect as it fits into the same spot my old toothbrush went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also really like being able to choose what I want the brush to do, be it daily clean, deep clean, sensitive or whitening.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a quickly dying Oral-B  Professional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I also think an oscillating head is going to clean better because it&#x27;s constantly pulling/throwing plaque downwards rather than from side to side such as a pulsating Sonicare would accomplish.  </li>
            <li>The overall feeling of clean is much better than my regular vitality model.</li>
            <li>, I thought that would be easy enough.  </li>
            <li>The large blue Travel Case holds everything neatly and tucks easily into a shaving kit or makeup</li>
            <li>the manual tooth brush where our salivary glands has to produce large amount of saliva and lot of spitting.</li>
            <li>one comes with a nifty (but somewhat large) travel case, which holds the handle and a couple of brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this toothbrush</li>
            <li>This TB is getting a it too smart for</li>
            <li>I can certainly tell a difference in the way my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>That means the travel case is quite large, too.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely powerful, gets into every nook and cranny and has a long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Digital display of remaining battery life is also very useful.</li>
            <li>This model is very much just like the older one.  </li>
            <li>Most companies would just send out a new unit and have me send the defective one back.</li>
            <li>I first used and wow, I should have used this right when it came out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically brush my teeth in quadrants, but it&#x27;s nice to know how much time has passed</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the induction charger doesn&#x27;t do a good job securing the unit so it topples over easily</li>
            <li>It is an absolutely up-to-the-minute way to keep your teeth and mouth clean and, maybe even, free of cavities and other unwanted dental miseries.</li>
            <li>About three years ago, my periodontist (whom I&#x27;ve been seeing 3-4 times annually for the past 25 years) was very insistent that I purchase the earlier version of this OralB/Braun toothbrush because he said it was such a powerful brush for maintaining good, healthy dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer a manual toothbrush, so I mainly use this one to make sure I get my back teeth clean, then finish up with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Oral B Smart 4000 series to replace my Sonic E series I bought in 2006 it still works, but I threw it away today, because I got tired of cleaning the gunk from the inside of handle, but it was a great brush</li>
            <li>A little loud, lots of surprising bells and whistles, but it does do what a toothbrush should do.</li>
            <li>It has a red light that indicates that you are using too much pressure, which is good if you have problems with gum recession from hard brushing.</li>
            <li>The brushing cycle is two minutes, and gives you a red light if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I have one of these and really like them.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I used the carrying case and it works really well and protects it well when on trips.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much cleaner my teeth feel than when I was using a hand brush.</li>
            <li>I guess I don&#x27;t really need the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is very helpful.</li>
            <li>I had a Sonicare for quite some time and decided to switch to Oral B after noticing how much whiter my teeth were after traveling and being away from the Sonicare (using a manual toothbrush).</li>
            <li>/&gt;While both are electric toothbrushes, they work very differently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After charging the Oral-B Precision 4000 overnight it was ready to attack the plaque on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I ended up returning this because it is so much louder than a sonicare</li>
            <li>Much faster spin cycles, longer battery life, slimmer design.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be very satisfactory and would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works very well, and my teeth feels cleaner over the battery operated, which might be just in my head.  </li>
            <li>I really like the carrying case however.  </li>
            <li>Very tacky for a gift.</li>
            <li>Would buy this again if need.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone who wants a cleaner and healthier looking teeth</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>the delivery very in time.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve wanted to try an electric toothbrush for some time now and after much debate,</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE.</li>
            <li>B.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this toothbrush really holds its charge for weeks.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner then ever before, basically like leaving a dentist office every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really travel with this brush.</li>
            <li>and it started making so much noise and skipping</li>
            <li>This brush really keep the tarter away.  </li>
            <li>My husband complains about it every night when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed</li>
            <li>this brush works very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;The deep-cleaning setting I haven&#x27;t really used,</li>
            <li>We really like Oral-B and thanks to Costco</li>
            <li>He needed something that would be fast and effecient.  </li>
            <li>much as i&#x27;m ready to say they brush well, i&#x27;ve to say the quality has not improve much over all these years</li>
            <li>My dentist has already told me that I brush my teeth with too much pressure</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I used to have a sonicare, but my mouth feels much cleaner after using this product.</li>
            <li>, I think there are smaller brushes available if I need to change though.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this type of tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>(the red battery light flashes).</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I have been having much easier trips to the dentist since switching over to this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I had my regular 6 month dentist appointment last week and my dentist actually thanked me for doing such a great job taking care of my teeth!</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>It has a soft rubber piece in the middle which leaves my teeth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>last visit to the dentist (whom I have seen for over 30 years) was fabulous and he even mentioned that my teeth had never looked</li>
            <li>Our daughter uses the Ortho brush as she has braces and really enjoys it as well.enjoys it as well.</li>
            <li>Although there are six available brush heads designed for specific needs, mine came packaged with the all-purpose \\&quot;Precision Clean\\&quot; brush head.</li>
            <li>If that happens a beep and red flashing light gives a warning.</li>
            <li>If the bristles splay or wear too much before three months, that is a sign of using too much pressure.</li>
            <li>The brush does all the work, really.</li>
            <li>The silicon cup within the brush holds paste very well and my teeth feel polished afterwards just like after a dentist visit.  </li>
            <li>I really like the 3 modes of brushing that one can choose from.  </li>
            <li>Product works very well</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for gums, below the gum line or in between teeth&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li>I had to learn how to gently apply it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this toothbrush tells you when you are applying too much force.  </li>
            <li>and I notice the flashing red light when I do so.  </li>
            <li>and I almost kept both because I like it so much.</li>
            <li>but I really have to concentrate on listening for the beeps to know when to move to another area of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I really like the lights that indicated how &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; the battery is.</li>
            <li>so much I bought one for each of my kids for Christmas</li>
            <li>Turns out it is to help prevent you from using too much pressure on your teeth.</li>
            <li>Very happpy with this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like the timer on it.</li>
            <li>I have had others but this really does a very thorough job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily need the reminder to switch areas brushed but probably nice for kids.</li>
            <li>my old Sonicare crapped out without warning, and after doing reviews, it appeared as many others were having similar issues.  </li>
            <li>And the battery lasts a long time, making it easy to bring on a trip without the charger.  </li>
            <li>can only hope to have this product for a long time as I am really enjoying brushing my teeth with it!</li>
            <li>Bigger brush head than my old oral b. really makes teeth feel clean!</li>
            <li>Somehow the base charges the handle through a plastic contact, very easy to use, and works great.</li>
            <li>This product is a significant improvement over the regular toothbrushes, let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definately better than other products that we have purchased.</li>
            <li>Even though it states on the rebate form that frustration free shipping UPC is honored, it apparently is not by Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>but much easier than older models)</li>
            <li>Out of the box, it took a full day and a half to reach full charge (which I didn&#x27;t really mind to be honest).&lt;br</li>
            <li>teeth are definitely left feeling clean after using this.</li>
            <li>(Of course, the head on the brush is fair game...)  ;-)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brushing action is very fast.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t really care about the zone timer, but the greater brush head speed than the model we had been using previously makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>So, the flashing red light is actually nice to remind you that you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job in cleaning my teeth and has 3 different settings to choose from and the attached brush head case definitely helps out in keeping my toothbrush heads protected from dust and curious cats.  </li>
            <li>The charge took all of 24 hours, and initially I didn&#x27;t know if it was really charging or not, because the charge light was so dim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a timer that encourages you to brush your teeth for a full two minutes while vibrating every 30 seconds to signal you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>This is no big deal, especially considering how much life this battery continued to have for so many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this right after my last dental cleaning about four months ago, and it has kept the inside of my bottom front teeth free from tartar, as if they were cleaned just last week.</li>
            <li>The controls take a little getting used to, probably more setting than you really need.</li>
            <li>My old Oral B was about 12 years old and finally gave up the ghost, I am certain that succeeding cleanings will be as easy and painless.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from the Oral-B Vitality, and this is significantly better than the previous product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife prefers the smaller round sensitive brush while I like the Dual Clean brush which is more like a traditional toothbrush but really gets my gumlines clean.  </li>
            <li>They are: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening or polishing.</li>
            <li>It has a variety of settings: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive and whitening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 4 brushing settings: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive and whitening/polishing.  </li>
            <li>valid.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the previous comment that this is indeed NOT Frustration Free Shipping!</li>
            <li>Does a better job than the previous brand.</li>
            <li>Has several different cleaning modes, a red light that alerts you if your brushing pressure is too strong,</li>
            <li>it is a shame because all the older model chargers are 110/220v</li>
            <li>The older model had the soldered in.</li>
            <li>We had an older model Oral-B then called a Braun.  </li>
            <li>My older Oral-B Triumph brush has lasted for years ; this one looks and operates&lt;br</li>
            <li>the future, more likely to get a normal disposable battery operated toothbrush and not a rechargeable battery type because it is not worth the price any more</li>
            <li>I particularly like the timer function that advises you of brushing length of time.  </li>
            <li>The batteries seem to last many days on a charge so no need to worry about packing a the charger for a short vacation or business trip.  </li>
            <li>I love the timer in 30 second intervals that lets you know when to move to the next area to brush (can be set to 45 seconds also).  </li>
            <li>We were replacing an older Oral-B version.  </li>
            <li>I think I was so used to my old, slow electric toothbrush that I didn&#x27;t realize it was not doing a good job anymore.  </li>
            <li>can not find the right replacement for the brush top on Amazon, because other people have the same problems with their tooth brush too.</li>
            <li>I have used Oral-B for several years, the old one was starting to not hold a charge and it was a great excuse to upgrade to a new one.</li>
            <li>so it, too, lasts as long as my original one.</li>
            <li>I find the new unit not as comfortable and lacking in some minor details.</li>
            <li>and hence my reluctance to put it on the stand in a tight fitting bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying one.</li>
            <li>I give this high ratings, every time I use this I feel like I was just at the dentist having my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>Would highly reccommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>also has a timer to let you know how long you need to clean every portion of your mouth.</li>
            <li>found the cheaper model to be VERY strong in the vibration, but certainly no better at cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t seem new which is super gross since it&#x27;s a hygiene product for your mouth!</li>
            <li>The product itself is nice but, as mentioned elsewhere, beware of Oral-B/amazon.com rebates, at least in this particular</li>
            <li>It easily reaches all those hard to reach areas within my mouth and effectively removes plaque due to its design.</li>
            <li>I think it cleans my teeth better than any other tooth brush, ever!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to make sure your back teeth and gums get adequate attention with just a manual toothbrush, so I think this is a good little machine to add to your brushing routine, not necessarily replace it.</li>
            <li>Wow, I bought 4 of these for my whole family this Christmas.</li>
            <li>The brush action is so much faster.  </li>
            <li>It is two-toned and just looks real professional.</li>
            <li>alarm that goes off every 30 seconds, in the normal brushing mode, to let you know</li>
            <li>But, apparently the red light flashes a lot for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for a long time--probably ten years or more.</li>
            <li>And this thing is not only powerful but super-smart--</li>
            <li>Way better than the other major brand.  </li>
            <li>I had the previous generation 4000 series and liked it a lot, but the battery was starting to lose it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Charger is also much smaller than on previous models and therefore handy for travel.</li>
            <li>The button to choose a different type of brushing is also on the handle and is easily pushed just when brushing in regular mode.  </li>
            <li>I like the 30 second beeps to enforce the right regimen.</li>
            <li>It is neat, easy to clean and holds a charge for at least 7 days!  </li>
            <li>Anyway, if you really like electric toothbrushes then you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this one; as for me, I think I&#x27;m going to go back to my old regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The timer system logically breaks your mouth into four areas, upper left and right, as well as lower left and right.  </li>
            <li>Should have bought a new one sooner.</li>
            <li>I received the new toothbrush a week after my cleaning, and started using it after the 24hour charging time.  </li>
            <li>Will probably upgrade that to the new version.</li>
            <li>new brush is, &amp;</li>
            <li>We just decided to get a new one with all the new settings on it.</li>
            <li>Why was it in a cardboard box since I bought it as NEW?</li>
            <li>I used toothbrush before, and this is a new experience for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I even like the new brush head</li>
            <li>I like the new angled brush.  </li>
            <li>and I told her I was using my new 4000.</li>
            <li>would recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain about on the new Oral-B tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It only supports 110-130VAC instead of global voltage supply range 110-240V, so it may not be a good option for travelling to other countries!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my old oral b tooth brush that was an older model of the new one for over a decade</li>
            <li>I think this could be a great tool however for those who need that little extra help; some teeth are probably harder to brush with a manual style brush or normal brush shaped head.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty, gets those teeth clean!</li>
            <li>it really gets my teeth super clean; it was a little messy at first, but that was because I was new at it.</li>
            <li>And right above these \\&quot;windows\\&quot; are three small indicators of the kind of brushing you chose (the fourth choice being all three unlit) --</li>
            <li>Still made in Germany, so expecting the same quality as the first ones.  </li>
            <li>The charger on the first one gave out - probably because it was left on charge all the time.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and my only regret is that I did not purchase sooner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than Sonicare but worth it!  </li>
            <li>I love the different settings and it holds a charge like none other I have used.  </li>
            <li>The battery in the first one finally gave out</li>
            <li>Never spent much time brushing.  </li>
            <li>but it is LOUD!</li>
            <li>and it was the exact same cardboard box.  </li>
            <li>But oh-my-goodness, it is so loud!</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:moS9HZLJRH7PKR]]This was my first and will be my last Oral B product.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, it does!  </li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with my dental results after using it for the past 7 years</li>
            <li>My first charge only lasted a week, but that should improve after a couple of cycles.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Uniquely designed to cup each tooth while at the same time, the longer bristles get in between the teeth similar to flossing.</li>
            <li>Other available brush heads are meant for deeper flossing/plaque removal, one head has a \\&quot;power tip\\&quot; for people with braces, crowns, or bridges, a Pro-whitening head, and a head for sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Full charge from empty takes about 22 hours.</li>
            <li>battery seems to last just fine even on week long vacations.</li>
            <li>Brush holder cover is open at both ends to help brushes dry, and opens for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>main reason for writing this review is to warn about the Mail-in Rebate scam, which seems to be common among many manufacturers.  </li>
            <li>I love the various programs and the red warning light that comes on if you press too hard.</li>
            <li>The brushing action is smooth, and if you brush too hard, the unit has a flashing red light on it and emits a beep.  </li>
            <li>I like the design and the feel of the brush in my hand, and after using for only about a week in the Deep Clean mode I have noticed big, positive changes in removal of stains on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>They also changed the toothbrush handle plug format so you cannot use the old charger with the new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both the 4000 and the 5000 leave teeth feeling as clean as any professional cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had, and both display a red  light when I brush too hard --</li>
            <li>You can use so many different brush heads with this brush too unlike my previous model.</li>
            <li>I also love the stand on this one, previous models had the toothbrush storage toward the back of where the handle charges.</li>
            <li>This model also has a base unit that you can snap on (I don&#x27;t because I live alone) that holds 4 additional brush heads, which is nice if more than one of you use the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My hygenist highly recommended this particular toothbrush for my specific needs.  </li>
            <li>The notification of when you reach the 30 or 45 seconds interval is not as smooth as my previous model as it stop completely instead of just pulsing the brush head and let you keep brushing instead of stop and wait it to complete it notification cycle.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it functions just fine.</li>
            <li>I thought I would not like the smaller brush head, but it provides better access to tight spaces.</li>
            <li>me feel little bit advanced than my ancestors who used to brush with manual tooth brush....</li>
            <li>It was a significant upgrade over our previous Braun electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it alerts if I am brushing too hard and that it&#x27;s programmed to brush each section of your mouth.</li>
            <li>It was time to replace and was pleased to find this toothbrush with the hard plastic travel case.</li>
            <li>Yes, my teeth where cleaner but who cares when they feel like they are about to fall out due to the tremendous vibration.  </li>
            <li>Helping to clear up the gingivitis  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for others and they seem to like it so far</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the various modes.</li>
            <li>therefore this electric toothbrush might have been a bit costlier than it needed to be for me, but it definitely works very well.</li>
            <li>so you know exactly how long to brush for.</li>
            <li>Could not get any for near this price, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Boys</li>
            <li>Upgraded when the old one gave out.</li>
            <li>The package had all the contents advertised in he Amazon description, however the handle does say &amp;#34;Triumph Professional Care&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The Pro white head really makes my teeth fells</li>
            <li>I waited until the battery on my old Oral-B died.</li>
            <li>old toothbrush was a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Using this toothbrush will make you swear that you just visited the dentist for a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>but so old</li>
            <li>It has a lower sensitive setting.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the complete stop</li>
            <li>After I made the switch to Oral-B, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have an old Oral - B which I leave in another bathroom</li>
            <li>It arrived early too.  </li>
            <li>I have been using my old ORAL&lt;</li>
            <li>The charging method (where the plug meets the stand) is a completely sealed electrical system, i.e. no water can get in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li>Using it feels like having just had a professional teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li>My old one wore out after almost 10 years of faithful service.  </li>
            <li>but I have used the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; setting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lighter feeling on the teeth, and avoids some of the irritation that sensitive teeth might feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Despite being 6 years old, it was still faithfully working every day with out issues.  </li>
            <li>brushing from the Oral-B professional electric toothbrushes continue to amaze me.  </li>
            <li>you get from this brush, standard toothbrushes seem to fall very flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t received any replies on this matter after giving feedback.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s quite bothersome in the early morning.</li>
            <li>I drink lots of tea and coffee and suffer staining between quarterly professional cleanings.</li>
            <li>Of course, that&#x27;s all personal preference, so what you really want to know is if the toothbrush performs well for an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>When I went in recently for my six-month cleaning, she said that she could really tell an improvement in plaque removal.</li>
            <li>Btw, I&#x27;m too far away from the states to bother with warrant/ replacements.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement order for one that was old and</li>
            <li>I used to have stains around my retainer and those have completely gone.</li>
            <li>I used my old oral b for years and it still worked.</li>
            <li>For a professional cleaning every time i brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with the 4000 because it was the cheapest of their models that included a sensitive setting.  </li>
            <li>I use the Sensitive Gum brush head every day.</li>
            <li>and you get TWO complete units (toothbrushes and chargers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like the different types of brushes which Oral-B has for this toothbrush as well.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li>and, as she predicted, the signs of early gum disease disappeared.</li>
            <li>I will no longer need two electric handles and an old stand-by manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So, naturally, I skipped the \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; instructions and just went at it.</li>
            <li>There was so much going on with the 30 second beeps</li>
            <li>Replaced our old Oral B and could not believe the difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;TO PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li>B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like it as much as the ProWhite brush head, which is very similar to the one I use on my Triumph.  </li>
            <li>Some reviewers said it is too loud, but I almost feel that is a given for a brush that does all the things this does.</li>
            <li>and it can&#x27;t be too loud because it has never woken them up.</li>
            <li>What really frosts my jaw with this toothbrush is that I only get 5 or 6 brushings out of it before the battery runs out of gas and needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Oral-B that I had had for about 8 years</li>
            <li>I also was a bit startled by the red light that occasionally came on from the back of the brush.</li>
            <li>It was like I was sitting in the dentist chair (without the pain, of course) and getting a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on different electric tooth brushes I ordered and received the Oral-B 4000 a few days ago.</li>
            <li>The only useful extra to me is the prolonged battery life (10 days vs. 7 days).  </li>
            <li>There is nothing more annoying to me that working on a good brushing and having to wait as it stops then starts again several times during a brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more powerful than my last electric toothbrush (a much older Oral-B model), but not so powerful that it&#x27;s irritating.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that all the extra features came with the brush such as the travel case and extra brush holder.</li>
            <li>But using the Vitality every day proved too strong for the teeth and gums to tolerate, even though I followed the instructions of no more than 2 minutes brushing per time.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, brushing right after eating is a common cause of tooth decay.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, brushing right after eating is a common cause of tooth decay.</li>
            <li>It has a similar stand/charger to the older models (so you could use the old charger if for any reason you needed to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is there really a difference between all the different models of electric toothbrushes from the major brands?</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;--Easier than older models to get to the very back teeth</li>
            <li>Its value is well worth the money, both long and short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using one for years, a similar older model Oral-B, so I got this model for her for Xmas.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, because of the price, but am pleasantly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Bought this set to replace a older version that finally died after 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded from an older model, and find several improvements.</li>
            <li>I think this is a major improvement over my old, now defunct model. . .</li>
            <li>This past visit, after using my new Oral B 4000 for about a month, she remarked that my teeth were extremely clean and free of the usual coatings.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Oral-B Precision 4000 for your next electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>vibration is a lot less intense than the current battery operated toothbrushes and the clean feeling left</li>
            <li>I bought this product because Braun is supposed to be a highly acclaimed German engineering &amp; manufacturing company.</li>
            <li>In response to other reviews about vibration - yes it does vibrate a little more than other cordless toothbrushes I have owned - however I quickly got accustomed to it to the point that I no longer notoice it.</li>
            <li>The main benefit for me is the pressure sensor that keeps me from brushing too hard (a clearly visible red light in the handle near the neck that you can see while brushing).</li>
            <li>My old Oral-B finally died, so I decided to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I only purchased a new one because my old one no longer held a charge.  </li>
            <li>But it will run for three minutes straight if you decide you want to brush for that long.</li>
            <li>Easily reaches hard to get to areas and helps remove plaque.</li>
            <li>Keeps me from brushing too hard and still getting my teeth cleaner than I am able to with a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and it was simply time to get a new toothbrush</li>
            <li>so i bought a brand new one for her and a different toothbrush came in.  </li>
            <li>a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They updated the look, but everything works the same.</li>
            <li>She told me that it was because the toothbrush was actually getting under the gum line and was properly cleaning my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>Our old Professional 3000 finally stopped holding the charge</li>
            <li>I thought I wouldn&#x27;t love this toothbrush as much as my Sonicare, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how long it takes to charge and, subsequently, how fast the battery drained on the Oral-B. With the Sonicare, I got 2 handles and 3 brush heads, as well as the carrying case.</li>
            <li>Second to a professional dental visit!  </li>
            <li>This thing cleans your yap like no other.</li>
            <li>If you have soft teeth, there is no excuse for you not to invest in one.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth like no other electric I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>They sent me back a scan of exactly what I sent in which totally meets the requirements, and they do not ask for anything specific, just reject my rebate</li>
            <li>There is no other UPC anywhere else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally there is enough plaque and tartar to keep her busy with the feared Cavitron for several minutes.</li>
            <li>And, for me at least, the ideal time to have a series of little beeps informing me of when to brush where is when I am still half asleep.</li>
            <li>And, for me at least, the ideal time to have a series of little beeps informing me of when to brush where is when I am still half asleep.</li>
            <li>The problem is, and I reported it to the company, that even if you dry the brush before you put it back in the little holder, it gets gunky inside for lack of a better term.</li>
            <li>The head is small, which I like because you can do a good job without holding the jaw wide open for too long.</li>
            <li>I used an electric toothbrush a long time ago when they first came out, but the heads wore down so quickly, that I finally went back to the old standard.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little too powerful...</li>
            <li>It has a pressure sensor based light that will flash if you&#x27;re brushing too hard</li>
            <li>Has an automatic shut off and warning light if you press too hard.</li>
            <li>I generally get through 2-3 stops during my brushing time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Several brush selections are available to choose from, and I use the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; setting and usually the regular brushing head, with the flossers.</li>
            <li>I have ordered the same brush in the past and had no problems receiving the refund until the Amazon frustration free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums and this is the only sonic/vibrating brush that did not hurt my teeth.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t use any of the extra benefits this toothbrush offers over its 3000 version.  </li>
            <li>The company apparently didn&#x27;t understand what I was trying to tell them.</li>
            <li>Apparently it has no warrantly.</li>
            <li>Really what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I like it and can definitely tell a difference between using it and our old electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The first time that I used this the pink was not pink, It was RED!</li>
            <li>My old Oral-B finally died after 10 years.  </li>
            <li>My old one served me well and had just reached the point where the charge would not hold and the brush stopped in the middle of use.  </li>
            <li>I know I can just ignore the pauses/beeps; but I feel like a Pavlov experiment, rushing to complete an entire quadrant before my toothbrush beats me to it  --</li>
            <li>old electric toothbrush, by the same manufacturer gave up the ghost after 10-12 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and when that is paired with all of your adult teeth in the back, the red flashing light on the Oral-B goes</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is definitely quieter than an Oral B and the pulsating action of Sonicare feels like a massage for your teeth...</li>
            <li>I use the floss action brush head for my back teeth about twice a week.  </li>
            <li>The motor on the old one finally gave up</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s different than my old one.</li>
            <li>Oral-B electric replaces both of my old, yet still functioning, Oral-B&#x27;s in the cabinet above the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>Feels like you just left the dentist after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>Sensitive brush is terrific.</li>
            <li>I had the Oral-B Precision 5000 prior to this, and used it for nearly 2 years before losing it on a trip.</li>
            <li>Honestly there was nothing wrong with the 9400.  </li>
            <li>I was using it twice a day, and about the tenth time the top of the brush head just felt off in my mouth, it felt like a broken tooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot to pay, but my last Oral-B lasted a very long time, 5+ years, so in the long run it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>And I found there is a new version which actually supports global voltage range and with addditional LCD display.</li>
            <li>The one thing I do not know is now long the brushes will last before having to buy new replacement brushes, but that is a minor issue as this is a really quality product that does the job better than a couple of other electric toothbrushes that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>, it never stopped working, I just hope that the new one the ( Oral B) lasts as long.</li>
            <li>(in less time)&lt;br /&gt;I must say this is my first electric brushing system.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush comes with a head (mine came with a ProWhite brush head), charging base that stores your heads, the handle and a carrying/travel case.</li>
            <li>The other good thing is that it has a small footprint than the previous Triumph package I had.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say anything that wasn&#x27;t already said in other reviews.</li>
            <li>It seemed to take a long time, but the green light finally went off and that meant I could brush!  </li>
            <li>red light appears when brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>Not only should I not spend more then 30 seconds brushing in one section unless doing an occasional 45 second deep cleaning, I should not press too hard when brushing.</li>
            <li>I only have this for a short time so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and been able to keep a very serious orthodontic problem under control.</li>
            <li>I went through a pretty extensive review of electric toothbrushes and basically got down to Oral-B vs Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The red light alerts you to not press so hard so that you use proper brush pressure</li>
            <li>But, I can say for sure that the Oral-B is less messy than my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few issues, (not so much problems), that I have with this toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush and suggest that the additional cost of the 5000 isn&#x27;t worth it for the small difference in features - buy the 4000.</li>
            <li>I know that the whole \\&quot;stopping when you press down too hard\\&quot; is supposed to be a safety feature, but having my toothbrush quit intermittently like</li>
            <li>At this price  the vibration seems a  little excessive,  ergonomics could be better  </li>
            <li>If you want to replace one later on, its not a one step process, and would need a few extra tools to replace the included battery, so for most, you will after a few years have to discard it, and buy another toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is the variable speed that gradually changes speed from slow to fast &amp; back to slow.  </li>
            <li>The recharging dock separates from the extra-brush holder and is quite small, thus easy to pack along with the brush, so you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about batteries unless you are traveling where you can&#x27;t plug it in (other countries?).  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to spend a lot of money on a toothbrush -- I typically stick to disposable brushes and even the disposable cheapie electric tootbrushes (like Crest Spinbrush).</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush we purchased, we were a little skeptical of how much better it would be.</li>
            <li>Part of the handle lights up red if you brush too hard, but it seems overly sensitive for the first 10 seconds or so of brushing.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the Oral B brush is quite large and i had a little challenge maneuvering with it</li>
            <li>It even flashes a red light when I am brushing too hard!</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that it takes nearly an entire day to get back to full charge but at least you can still use it in</li>
            <li>I really like this little tooth brush.</li>
            <li>While I was certainly no stranger to electric toothbrushes, I had no idea just how crappy those other ones were until I used this for the first time.</li>
            <li>toothbrush itself works very well; the only negative about its performance is that it is quite loud (much louder than my previous Sonicare electric toothbrush).</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this than the regular tooth brash!!!</li>
            <li>if user pressed too hard when brushing, this toothbrush is so loud that it can wake the whole house</li>

            <li> he said that it was awesome.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush has done an excellent job for what I need.</li>

            <li> It does an excellent job massaging my gums and cleaning my teeth and, unlike some electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used, I don&#x27;t like the toothbrush is going to vibrate out of my hands while I\\&quot;m brushing my teeth.</li>

            <li> I received a great service life from the oral-b I was retiring of ~10 years</li>
            <li> has been working great.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not noticing a difference since I already have great teeth/gums?  </li>

            <li> Great product, with lithium rechargeable battery.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a checkup since I&#x27;ve started using this, and while I won&#x27;t give it all the credit, the dentist said my gums and mouth looked great.</li>
            <li> Great price on a rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Great price on a great dental product.  </li>
            <li> lol.  </li>

            <li> It is a great price point, durable, and</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> It works great, and I caught on immediately.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B toothbrush worked great</li>
            <li> I think it is a lot of money for a toothbrush but the feeling after brushing/ cleaning is great.</li>
            <li> these are great if you care about your teeth,  </li>
            <li> The 4000 is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush, Oral-B does it well.</li>
            <li> No complaints, and my wife just went for a 6month checkup and was told how great she had been brushing,</li>
            <li> Oral-B makes great products.</li>
            <li> So, even though I&#x27;m happy with the battery-powered toothbrush, I cannot recommend the rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Still happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush.</li>

            <li> Very effective.</li>
            <li> Very nice for a family.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat noisy but is very effective.</li>
            <li> i love it great price and one of the best oral-b</li>
            <li> &amp; I can honestly say that it is a very good electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> What an amazing job it does cleaning!  </li>
            <li> Good battery life and works great</li>
            <li> I am not tech savvy, so I was really impressed at the readability of the user manual and the elegant simplicity of product design.</li>
            <li> Really nice jacket!</li>
            <li> We all love these and am very happy with his product.</li>
            <li> Good quality and has been working great.  </li>
            <li> It cleans better than any that I have had before and the timer system is perfect.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has great power and does a good job</li>
            <li> It works great, just as awesome as my original.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily the best toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Elite uses sound vibration and was good toothbrush, but the Oral-B is a great toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> I used an electric toothbrush some years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> My son has already lost the travel case, which I wasn&#x27;t too happy about, but I liked that it had room for a couple of heads and the brush.</li>
            <li> it work good</li>
            <li> and it looks good too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothbrush with power to give a really good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> They keep making changes to products that are already so good</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> The battery powered Oral B was good for the years I&#x27;ve had one, but this rechargeable felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Sonicare toothbrushes but this Oral B does a good job.  </li>
            <li> This one was the a good choice.  </li>
            <li> It has power and keeps a good charge.  </li>
            <li> The size is good, both the handle and the brush itself.</li>
            <li> Battery power is good too.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the portable one did not come with a travel case!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I laughed at another review that noted it made her/him drool.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this toothbrush a year ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> (Not as good as the dentist, but close).  </li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Charge lasts a good bit&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good quality, works good.</li>
            <li> Its a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reading the instruction booklet is a good idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good practice, if you can, to rinse and swish with water--that&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good practice, if you can, to rinse and swish with water--that&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest tooth brush..absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from that, the product is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It drives me nuts when I&#x27;m trying to buy a product and it turns out the product is good</li>
            <li> The head is a good size and it has good movement.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal.</li>
            <li> to the use of the toothbrush, it is a good deal louder than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Nice design and works very nicely.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is excellent to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Every time I visit the dentist they tell me your teeth are in excellent condition and very healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> I would say I love it because it&#x27;s so much better than my 1000 model I used before (especially love the sensitivity function</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of years now and my dental check ups are quick and flawless.  </li>
            <li> But it was in my own bathroom with a pleasant massage and buffing up of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift and the recipient was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product, like it so much more than the Sonacare.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This Pro-white brush does an excellent job in keeping your dental visit fresh.</li>
            <li> This one is great because it has a much more distinctive timer feature.  </li>
            <li> It does great for cleaning &amp; whiteing you teeth, my wife &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Oral-B 4000.</li>
            <li> Great quality, love the case for brushes, cleans well.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush, I would recommend this toothbrush to my friends, and I will purchase a brush from OralB again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very glad to have this and use it exclusively now, my Sonicare is collecting dust.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own good.</li>
            <li> It works great and makes my teeth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li> It does a very good job of getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> it does an excellent job of clianing your teeth, and it really feels good as well.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this brush cleans great, seems to keep a good charge and is ergonomically comfortable.  </li>
            <li> We love the flossing brush!  </li>
            <li> My teeth still feel like I just came from having them cleaned--it&#x27;s fabulous!!  </li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Oral-B as is 100% better!</li>

            <li> I really love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Love this brush and would buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> This is better than any electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tried!  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> and this one is even better!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love mine!</li>
            <li> Much better!  </li>
            <li> The clean sensation is great after cleaning my teeth and the timing for each side is good.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I am impressed with how much cleaner my mouth and teeth feel!</li>
            <li> It was an amazing feeling.</li>
            <li> so if the charger was 110/220 it would have been amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was especially pleased when I took it on a 10 day vacation and the battery lasted the whole time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all of the modes on it, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option.</li>
            <li> Comes with a nice travel case, too.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is really nice.</li>
            <li> The difference is astounding.</li>
            <li> Absolute best toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The time alarm feature is a good way to make sure that you are doing diligence with all of your teeth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have the toothbrush protected during travels.</li>
            <li> Nice design.</li>
            <li> and he really liked it.</li>
            <li> I did so much research on the perfect toothbrush for my husband, and he loves this one, he has been using it for amost a year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a manual brush and floss kind of girl</li>
            <li> a nice option if you&#x27;re sharing.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had great dental check-ups for many years; now we expect them to be even better.</li>
            <li> Fuction wise, I think this brush is way better than sonicare.</li>
            <li> but it requires soldering and you need to quite electronically handy to do that.</li>
            <li> one also comes with a travel case, which is nice if you take your electric toothbrush on vacation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not 100 percent sold on trusting a vibrating brush instead of my own effort, but I&#x27;m warming up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has helped us brush longer with the nice timer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Travel case is nice - holds the toothbrush and two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i own</li>
            <li> I tried one at the time and was never that thrilled with its performance vs a manual tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Excellent fast shipping so close to the holiday season.</li>
            <li> have one of my own, and have been using it for about 3 years with no</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 1000% thrilled with this toothbrush and will never use a manual brush again.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush is effective.</li>
            <li> The battery charge holds nicely.  </li>
            <li> #34;hands on&amp;#34; a great improvement over my original one.  </li>
            <li> My Teeth was never so clean and my Dentist is happy.</li>
            <li> I found it to operate quite easily and felt it did a good job on cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Before buying I researched and found this brand and model to be rated the best and after using it I completely agree!</li>
            <li> /&gt;so far very happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had an oral b toothbrush before I bought this one, which I liked, but this one is better.  </li>
            <li> model is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product thus far.</li>
            <li> but the new one has much more power and is just a great product!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;A very fine product.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> It has a very nice grip so it is comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Leaves a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li> my honest opinion, the Sonicare is the better value and the better toothbrush between the two (Oral-B and Sonicare).</li>
            <li> He was very nice and got my replacement sent to me right away.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush and the timing feature really helps!</li>
            <li> The grip on the handle was very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap decision on Oral-B&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li> Now, nice and easy.</li>
            <li> between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage case for brush heads is nice to keep them covered and can be cleaned easily.</li>
            <li> Have been using my new toothbrush and Surprising Good cleaning toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very easy to clean also-bonus!</li>
            <li> I also love the travel box that is included.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My 3rd Oral B brush and the best yet.</li>
            <li> It is a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many year.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has a timer to gauge my brushing each section.</li>
            <li> I have a 3000 that I have had for years and love it</li>
            <li> i feel that it has more power.  </li>
            <li> I understand many newer bathrooms may have accommodations for this</li>
            <li> Have been using Oral-B electric brushes for many years.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This one seems like it will do a much better job.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush and found you can get replacement heads at target for this at a discount.</li>
            <li> and I find that each time, as in this case, the emphasis is on style and making things even more sleek.  </li>
            <li> Been using Oral-B/Braun electric brushes for many years.</li>
            <li> although I have been using Sonicare products for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Since I have diabetes, this brush does more to stimulate blood circulation in my gumline as well.  </li>
            <li> I also love the 30 mins intervals so that you know when to switch to another quadrant</li>
            <li> I love the sonicare and don&#x27;t like the oral-B.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It did an OK job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B for years and love it.</li>
            <li> i love it .i</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> We both love them.</li>
            <li> Over all, I am pleased with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I love Oral-B toothbrushes and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> Though it took some time and thorough research before I decided on this pricey purchase, I&#x27;m glad I did it</li>
            <li> and my teeth are much better for it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned and used the Oral-B triumph for many years..</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and is a great design.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is a bit more vigorous, but I have become accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> this tooth brush is much better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Still don&#x27;t understand how i was living without it before :)</li>
            <li> It also helps your gums stay healthy.</li>
            <li> I feel like a WINNER when I beat my brush, but am I really winning?</li>
            <li> No brush cleans better than that.  </li>
            <li> This is now my favorite electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love Oral B products.  </li>
            <li> Probably would have been satisfied with the 1000 model as I don&#x27;t use any of the additional modes on the 4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I would love this toothbrush if it weren&#x27;t for one thing.</li>
            <li> Love the built in timer where every 30 seconds the toothbrush lets you know to move to another quadrant.</li>
            <li> Outstanding.</li>
            <li> This system seems to do a much better job at cleaning than those.</li>
            <li> I like Oral-B netter and think it provides better cleaning than Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with its performance &amp; would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> so feels better in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Really glad this happened.  </li>
            <li> For this price, I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li> So I had to buy more for the toothbrush plus lost out on the tax</li>
            <li> It has produced significantly better results as verified by my dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> bit as good with updated feathures and should be a solid investment in great dental care.</li>
            <li> My dentist says the spinning heads are better at cleaning than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast shipping, works great</li>
            <li> so no need to spend more money.</li>
            <li> I think Sonicare is better if you have braces, but if you don&#x27;t have braces, the Oral-B product is better.</li>
            <li> but that is OK.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t even consider another brand as a replacement, since the Oral-B had given such excellent service and performance over so many years.</li>
            <li> All the items and attachments fit together perfectly, and the handy Charger/Storage Case holds 4 Brush Heads (Only 1 included).</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with Oral-B.</li>
            <li> A much better way to brush.</li>
            <li> She says it did a good job but was not as powerful as her Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend and he has really enjoyed this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> He stated it makes his teeth feel more like he has just been</li>
            <li> It does a much better job of removing plaque than the sonic care.</li>
            <li> I have not used an electric in decades but decided I needed better brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought the Oral B electric tooth brush and really love it .</li>
            <li> I use this to have healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> There are so many options and fancy doodads on some of these</li>
            <li> /&gt;However; my love for this product led me to leave a review</li>
            <li> fantastic toothbrush has found a permanent place in my home!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this brush on my gums much more than my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> but I am glad to have them if the need arrises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am most pleased with how my teeth feel when I finish brushing.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> Love the design and functionality of this electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> cleans my teeth better</li>
            <li> I chose the Oral-B based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, online reviews, and claims that it is the most dentist recommended electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> *much* better than a manual toothbrush in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;-Large</li>
            <li> Spend a couple more bucks and get a sonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product is outstanding works just as discribed.</li>
            <li> AND SO GLAD I DID.  </li>
            <li> I always using Oral-B Toothbrushes for many Years now.</li>
            <li> B is famous for its quality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful to have a beeper at the 30 second mark for each quandrant....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be better if you could toggle between each setting without having to turn the brush around to see the settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> And I love the timer</li>
            <li> Pleased with the Oral B product itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I will have this Oral-B for at lease 10 years! :-)</li>
            <li> Having said that, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> this newer toothbrush operates more efficiently and seems stronger than the one it replaced.  </li>
            <li> This seems to give a much better cleaning and has some features</li>
            <li> her teeth, gums, everything was looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush</li>
            <li> (It gets more noticeable as the charging process</li>
            <li> Despite my initial skepticism, I am completely impressed.</li>
            <li> My teeth look and feel better.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is OK; I purchased the replaceable battery-powered toothbrush also to compare.  </li>
            <li> Used Sonicares for years but the Oral B is better.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I would add that I would prefer a more slender handle.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that is better than being beeped at, but I would prefer having instructions that apply to the appliance I received.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely good hygiene habits and even the right toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Is that this toothbrush does a very good job at cleaning my teeth and making my whole mouth feel clean and</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning and polishing--manual toothbrushes don&#x27;t give you nearly as much of a fresh, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Sure makes you teeth feel nice and clean</li>
            <li> Love it and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works as great as advertised (as did the older 2 oral Bs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and accurate.</li>
            <li> feel like your teeth are getting very clean</li>
            <li> like it , gets teeth very clean , don&#x27;t forget to floss also , save a fortune on your teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Teeth feel very very clean after use.  </li>
            <li> Everything was very clean.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> We went on a week long vacation and it worked perfectly all week with 2 of the 3 bars of charge still lit.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time in years that the dentist said he was doing a good job and had no cavities.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;rechargeable battery is a problem, they cannot hold the charge long after some use, whether you give it your best care or not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This feels good in the mouth and hand, certainly doing a better job than I did by hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that it is still like new.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B 4000 is easy to use and the toothbrushes spin in a circle giving me a better cleaning of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This model, the 4000, seems to do a much better job of cleaning your teeth, but without the head-jarring strong vibration of the cheaper model.  </li>
            <li> the rectangular head of the Sonicare which can tear your gums more easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My gums bled more frequently using the Sonicare than I have experienced with Oral B.  </li>
            <li> Its design is handsome and perfectly fitted to the hand, more comfortable to hold for those minutes twice a day spent brushing.</li>
            <li> my teech become quite quite clean !</li>
            <li> the dentist clean!  </li>
            <li> Mu teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> Clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> My mouth feels super clean!!</li>
            <li> Great action.</li>
            <li> Now, I greatly prefer the cleaning action with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;be more comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li> It is much more comfortable to use and way quieter.  </li>
            <li> but this oral-b professional 4000 is really a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A blinking light would make much more sense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very pleased with the performance of the ProWhite Precision 4000 and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> , this model feels better built, solid, a bit heavier (in a good way), and has a nice ergonomic grip.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my mother and she loved it so much that I asked for it for my birthday.</li>
            <li> It works well, leaves my teeth feeling very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put together.</li>
            <li> I feel it does a better job cleaning your teeth, plus the unit is easy to clean after each brushing.  </li>
            <li> have a sonic care and can go two weeks easy w/o charge even after a year.</li>
            <li> It is also much better than the Phillips Sonic which it replaced, teeth feel sparklingly clean.</li>
            <li> the replacement heads are easy to come by.  </li>
            <li> And the increased number of oscillations gives a better, clean feel.</li>
            <li> :  Tried it out now for a week, and the battery life is going strong.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using it for over a year now, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I bought as a gift and was liked very much</li>
            <li> This toothbrush adequately cleans my teeth; however, I don&#x27;t feel it is as good as my first Oral-B 3-D Excel from 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> general, I guess I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> It would be so much better if it was a more distinct sound.</li>
            <li> Well, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used an electric toothbrush, but I can&#x27;t honestly say that I like it.  </li>
            <li> So when I saw this Healthy Clean + ProWhite model was available, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The default works just fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> But, it still works fine.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I liked about the toothbrush is how light it is and how well it fit in my hand.  </li>
            <li> This device is so easy and fun, I brush more often than I did with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I love the clean, clean feeling of this rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Brushing is more fun now.</li>
            <li> It is probably effective, but i have gum issues and need gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush which has multiple features.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the cheap stuff you find on ebay.</li>
            <li> Overall a great buy at the price i bought during BF</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now with this.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is a great product.</li>
            <li> The travel case is nice too although I don&#x27;t travel as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> Nice product and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT TO THEM.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that we can use different heads for each family member.</li>
            <li> I buy the attachments on ebay for cheap</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I try this - I must admit I was a bit skeptic - but I truly enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush was more than worth it.  </li>
            <li> I did request hassle free packaging and got retail</li>
            <li> a day).&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature of the Oral-B is the selection of different types of Interchangeable Brush Heads --</li>
            <li> Also available at Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We liked it so much we bought two of them.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried enough models to test his theory, but I can say that this one does work great.</li>
            <li> IT IS FABULOUS AND</li>
            <li> The case attached to the stand is useful but also means the unit takes up more space on your bathroom sink/</li>
            <li> These enhancements are nice, but don&#x27;t add too much value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is also a feather light mode and a diamond polishing mode.</li>
            <li> I resubmitted the form along with a letter explaining the frustration free shipping label and received another letter from Oral-B, stating that the UPC is not</li>
            <li> I look forward to the sensation of perfectly cleaned teeth and think my oral hygiene just got bumped up a few notches.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I kept all documentation, including a copy of the pertinent information in the instruction booklet.  </li>
            <li> No telephone numbers available, so I called Customer Support.  </li>
            <li> so that batteries will fit into it.  </li>
            <li> I had an old version of an oral b / Braun toothbrush that I loved.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> so far so good...</li>
            <li> If you are not 100% satisfied, return handle, refills and charging unit with original cash receipt postmarked within 60 days of purchase to receive a full refund (full details inside pack)\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it my teeth felt polished like when you leave the dentist office!!</li>
            <li> Very nice electric brush that you can buy different heads for depending on what you need.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.  </li>
            <li> This model is very nice, several settings and streamlined.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a self timer and several settings which are very nice to have.  </li>
            <li> We love the clean, fresh feeling that we can get from an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the way my mouth feels clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> It is not too large and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to just glide the thing around in my mouth and watch the magic happen from a REAL toothbrush that is hands down the BEST one I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sampled this new and advanced version of the same brush and I am very, very impressed.  </li>
            <li> A tremendous cleaning and easy travel case</li>
            <li> This was a replacement brush, so I&#x27;m familiar with the brand.  </li>
            <li> Great travel case, and long battery charge.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the automatic pause that allows one to move to another section of the mouth and brush for the full amount of time suggested by dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our original Oral-B was over 7 years old.....and still working......</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush and love it.  </li>
            <li> I was going for a straightforward electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It was easy to set up and even though the charging light didn&#x27;t come on right away but took 10 minutes to show up as mentioned in the directions.</li>
            <li> A very good replacement and improvement to my previously discontinued Oral B Triumph.</li>
            <li> Very good action, teeth feel nearly professionally cleaned 6 weeks after my dental visit.  </li>
            <li> Its new feature of varied speeds/pressures brushing are a nice addition.  </li>
            <li> I wore out an older Oral-B electric tooth brush which I thought did a great job, but the new model is even better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You get the dentist clean feeling each time you brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever use a manual toothbrush it doesn&#x27;t or will ever clean as well as this thing.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and energized after brushing.</li>
            <li> it keep teeth clean</li>
            <li> , my teeth feel so clean after brushing</li>
            <li> The stand is actually also a useful and practical place to store the brush heads and they avoided updating the travel case which is and has been a great design.</li>
            <li> After brushing with Oral-B professinal, teeth feels completly clean.</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels clean.</li>
            <li> After brushing with Oral-B professinal, teeth feels completly clean.  </li>
            <li> tootch change to clean and bright.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the clean teeth feeling</li>
            <li> I really love how it stalls every 30 seconds to let you know when the time is up for each quadrant, and there is a light that lets you know when you are applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> makes my teeth and mouth feel squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li> teeth are clean when I&#x27;m finished using this electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I use the Precision Clean brush head about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> And the clean feeling lasts for hours!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It floats over the teeth and they feel really clean afterward.  </li>
            <li> Definately leaves a clean feeling when using this brush.</li>
            <li> Really like the aggressive action of the brush and the great choice of head designs there are.</li>
            <li> Box not the original, but rather an Amazon special, so no picture on it to check the model.</li>
            <li> preferred Oral-B brush head is Dual Action, but smaller heads provide very good cleaning and are easy to maneuver in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> We have used Braun/Oral B electric toothbrushes pretty much since they first came out, but this is the best we&#x27;ve ever had, by far.</li>
            <li> however I don&#x27;t mind that Oral B is a little louder because it&#x27;s more important for me to have a good clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth definitely feel cleaner (like dentist office clean), so I think this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> head does a good job scrubbing my teeth clean, though as cautioned it did cause some initial bleeding of the gums, but that passed in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Does a very good job of cleaning my teeth without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> Much better than my older model!</li>
            <li> Replaced the same (but older) version (&amp;#34;Triumph Professional&amp;#34;) and as always, was very happy with this Oral-B product.  </li>
            <li> in all, I recommend the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush; but to be honest, it&#x27;s not that much of an upgrade from the Oral B Triumph.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t played around too much with the various modes--to be honest, 4 modes seems to be overkill, but I guess it&#x27;s nice to have options.  </li>
            <li> The darned thing just died, so writing a good review is not possible.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a cheap $30 electric tooth brush, and wondered whether paying $90 would be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a whole lot better than the replacement Braun That it replaced.</li>
            <li> Quality fabric, true to size and color.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a full charge overnight.  </li>
            <li> I find this to be a cool feature for both sight and hearing impaired.</li>
            <li> Dad loved it for a Fathers Day present.</li>
            <li> If your oral health is already really good from just using a manual brush, then an electric toothbrush probably won&#x27;t take things to the next level</li>
            <li> We swear by this unit and recommend it to everyone out there who wants to maintain a healthy set of gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> I researched several sonic toothbrushes before deciding on the Oral-B and feel like I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> The brush and replacement heads are a bit pricey, but occasionally Amazon has good deals and coupons for brush heads.</li>
            <li> I really liked the sensitive and whitening modes on this model and appreciate the beep every 30 seconds for timing.  </li>
            <li> Another handy indicator is battery life as our old brush had a habit of running out after my wife had used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a chat, on-line, with Sumar Jit regarding this matter and explained in full my problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve always bought the best available model, which happen to be the most expensive of the range too&lt;</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply any pressure because it works smoothly on its own (a red light goes on if you are pressing too much).It</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush of all time, this product is very well made.</li>
            <li> She also said the DentistRx Intelisonic was just as good and designed by the same person as the Sonicare, but I did not bother to confirm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That was true for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, overall a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> No where does the literature state that you will not receive a full refund.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh  and clean every  time.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is powerful and my teeth and gums feel thoroughly clean after using it.</li>
            <li> It makes your mouth feels really fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> Maybe, if I&#x27;m lucky, I&#x27;ll forget it in a hotel bathroom.</li>
            <li> There are tremendous improvements.  </li>
            <li> I love the travel case, and it also has a storage tray for extra brush heads if more than one person uses it.</li>
            <li> Super tooth brush</li>
            <li> I had to go to the store and buy the Oral-B in the manufactures box to give it as a Christmas present....and am lucky</li>
            <li> My teeth feel great and compared to a standard brush, my retainer is much cleaner and smoother.  </li>
            <li> It would be even better if it came with more extra heads.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean and fresh after using this brush.</li>
            <li> Great for the busy on-the-go professional.</li>
            <li> I, however, am new to electric toothbrushes and the force with which the brush hit my teeth and gums was kind of jolting at first.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it costs quite a bit up front, but the ability to brush smoothly and in areas you normally can&#x27;t reach easily makes the line of Oral B / Braun electric toothbrushes worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, we&#x27;re very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is able to accommodate several different types of Oral-B toothbrush heads, which is great.</li>
            <li> I got it for Oral B Professional healthy Clean + Precision 4000 Rechargeable tooth brush about two weeks ago, not use it yet, need to confirm that in Singapore need to convert the voltage ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for about a month now</li>
            <li> The new style brushes actually do a better job.</li>
            <li> I love this new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This new Oral-B cleans so much better than my 10-year-old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Triumph for a couple years and wanted to try this new model to see if it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li> Love my new tooth brush.</li>
            <li> But its lighted index for recharging is my favorite new addition.  </li>
            <li> This is a great improvement over previous versions.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but battery life seems shorter than my previous Oral-B Pro, and it takes longer to recharge.  </li>
            <li> Great value and from my previous experience</li>
            <li> Heads come off easy and attach fast for sharing the motor with my wife.  </li>
            <li> However, my first two lasted for almost 15 years!  </li>
            <li> Our experience with the Oral-B brand and Amazon make this a very highly-recommended product !!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist agrees with my assessment, so I guess I should have just asked her first!</li>
            <li> It makes me feel better to know that my teeth are getting a better clean than with conventional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It also keeps the charge for at least 10 days, making it ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li> I like how it has a built in warning light that lets you know if you are putting too much pressure on the gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Take this system paired with a pro white head &amp; whitening tooth paste; it gets amazing results.  </li>
            <li> They advertise it as 10 days worth of usage</li>
            <li> but I am having much better results with this electric toothbrush vs. manual or my old sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Thus far I am pleased with this model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth it...</li>
            <li> Much better than my old Oral B which I had for 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The additional features work well and are useful.</li>
            <li> I think it does a better job than an old fashoned brush.</li>
            <li> and It make my smile brighter</li>
            <li> like it, I hope it is useful after a couple of months</li>
            <li> Replaced my old electric tooth brush after many years.  </li>
            <li> The battery stays charged for quite a while &amp; it&#x27;s quite powerful.</li>
            <li> No brush is worth $250.  </li>
            <li> But this brush is definately worth what I paid here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact, especially for one person.  </li>
            <li> latest purchase is 4000 with the red light alert</li>
            <li> Kind of like riding a Harley without actually getting on a motorcycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works far better than the Sonicare Elite, which I am now sending over the rainbow.  </li>
            <li> I have been an Oral B user for many years, so when my old one died, I replaced it with a newer model.  </li>
            <li> (make sure you bring a back up if you do) and I have it four stars because of its cleaning power which really was better than my Spinbrush pro.</li>
            <li> worth the investment</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush last fall and  liked it</li>
            <li> It is more comfortable than the old straight one.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is a nice extra.  </li>
            <li> This one takes up a bit more countertop real estate, but I much prefer it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it does do a good job cleaning teeth and the small charging stand is easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> leaves my teeth feeling fresh, feeling clean and sooooo much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Now I do not have the yellow problem anymore and feel much better about how clean my teeth</li>
            <li> leave any more of a clean feeling than a regular manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> &quot; [note that we don&#x27;t really have a choice], cut out and mail the original UPC barcode from your shipping</li>
            <li> We had an earlier version of the Oral-B which we liked very much, but the charger gave out so we ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly to those looking for a good oral hygiene; this is definitely the right tool.</li>
            <li> This thing is 20 times better than brushing with a conventional tooth brush - my teeth are polished smooth after ever brushing!</li>
            <li> I just snapped the toothbrush and the charger right out of that unit and through the brush holder away.</li>
            <li> done right.  </li>
            <li> Also the price is right and cones with a travel case.</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> Instead it stops for a moment and then starts right up again.  </li>
            <li> the tooth brushing happens more effectively with very little saliva</li>
            <li> Until this new Professional, highly attractive, all-purpose Braun moved into  the cabinet, I admit there are times when I&#x27;ve returned to the old fashioned, hand-powered brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a Good product, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, and while I&#x27;m still adjusting to the novelty and slight bulkiness of it, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than the one that we had that broke down after many years of service, will probably buy another one for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i only bought my latest 4000 because i need a quick replacement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> The best feature I like about this toothbrush is the red light that comes on when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> The choice of 30 or 45 second time periods for length of brushing is very handy, since generally I prefer a longer brushing time.</li>
            <li> Holds an amazing long charge.  </li>
            <li> my teeth feel clean and better than they have for a long time.  </li>
            <li> what happened?\\&quot; after their first brushing with the new Professional Braun Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Others have commented on the small head size of the toothbrush, I find it to be perfect for reaching around back teeth etc where a larger tooth brush would not have been able to clean as well.  </li>
            <li> The battery capacity on the new model is a HUGE improvement.</li>
            <li> Its now 15 months old, and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be sure to read the information about the Pressure Sensor as the brush will automatically change to the sensitive mode if it detects you are applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> A good replacement to my previous one except it has no LCD display screen on this model.</li>
            <li> Second one came without a problem and so far so good...</li>
            <li> After 70 years using a regular toothbrush, I find it noisy, efficient, mechanical, challenging and hopefully worth the money if it helps me keep my teeth.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is nothing special and nowhere near as effective as a quality sonic-style brush for overall oral and gum health.</li>
            <li> The different settings will give you many options to find the right match.</li>
            <li> My son like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, my latest in a long line, they last almost three years before they start to slow down so very good quality.</li>
            <li> This is a quality toothbrush that is easy to use, easy to clean, and durable for everyday use by a five-member household.</li>
            <li> It is good, just takes a little longer to changer it.</li>
            <li> The major design problem is that the bottom of the handle is much, much wider than the top, and the bottom is also the heaviest part of the handle.  </li>
            <li> hopefully the the new one is as good as the older but same one.</li>
            <li> I love the 30 second timer for brushing quadrants of your teeth; I do top out, top inside, bottom outside, bottom inside and move every 30 seconds when the motor stops for a second or so to notify you</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I think it was an okay electric toothbrush while it lasted, but that was only 2 years</li>
            <li> Does exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> I use Plaxx pre rinse first, then brush.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see that it has any more features to warrant the extra cost).</li>
            <li> We also buy our replacement heads on here; I just wish Amazon would regularly have the orthodontics heads available!</li>
            <li> Have been using several generations of Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The first charge takes sometime</li>
            <li> after several months decided to switch to oral b.  absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an Oral-B</li>
            <li> I ordered a sonicare healthy white, which replaces a sonicare essence that was still working</li>
            <li> so I make sure I&#x27;m hitting all areas equally.</li>
            <li> I let it charge the first time for about 24 hours as directed on the manual.</li>
            <li> However, I have followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I felt like my brain was getting vibrated out of my head, but now that I&#x27;m used to it</li>
            <li> My wife was interested in a electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> While I also like the quadrant timer option; I feel like 30-seconds for each quadrant is too fast for me!  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I like it.</li>
            <li> so gross that I don&#x27;t know how many people touched it or did what to it.</li>
            <li> I first to use the product of Oral-</li>
            <li> This one has multiple settings, my favorite being the feather setting which is slower than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li> Grip is big and square for better handling.</li>
            <li> It is the first rechargeable I have had.  </li>
            <li> When it worked, I enjoyed this, but after only 6 months, it no longer powers on or shows any lights.</li>
            <li> I also want to add that Amazon saved me almost $50-$80 dollars because I was going to buy it at Walgreens or Walmart but a family member suggested I buy it through you so thanks!</li>
            <li> Finally I have found one that seems to work better in every way than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Does and proforms exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a better white color to your teeth, then try this.  </li>
            <li> we have pretty much a lifetime investment in brush heads!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleans better and actually tells me when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> This cleans his teeth better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Oral B comes with one toothbrush head (although the stand has space for more), and I was a bit worried that it wouldn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions, yes,</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s why I bought a Sonicare in the first place.  </li>
            <li> but I had to return the first one because it stopped recharging.</li>
            <li> Hopefully my dentist will see the difference in my next visit :)</li>
            <li> I have always been a manual toothbrush user, and this is my first experience with an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but this is something to also be aware of.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the unit could be better by either having a longer lasting battery and/or a better built stand.</li>
            <li> sure you change the heads regularly because they do wear out and stop cleaning after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased and would recommend Oral B over Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, with several different options for cleaning teeth and gums,for which purpose you can choose from different toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge well, and is powerful but will not let you apply too much pressure or it will pause temporarily.</li>
            <li> only got a polishing brush head in the Frustration-Free package, I need to buy more.</li>
            <li> , I may actually order more of those style replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that I didn&#x27;t purchase my Oral-B 4000 from Amazon because the local warehouse stores have a better price</li>
            <li> I admit that I skipped the operations part after I read how to charge it the first time.</li>
            <li> First time I used this tooth bush</li>
            <li> love the pause in the motion that alerts you to move to a different quadrant of teeth.</li>
            <li> so you know exactly when to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> , they felt almost polished after the first use .</li>
            <li> Much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the different modes you can choose and the built in quadrant timer.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s working out pretty well</li>
            <li> It has a heavier, more-like-power-equipment sound when compared to the Sonicare&#x27;s soft hum.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s probably a useful feature, since I&#x27;ve heard too much pressure hurts the gums.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This feature of the toothbrush was exactly the solution to what the dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Much better results than with a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in shine, whiteness and cleanliness of my teeth after the first use</li>
            <li> Mine is still going strong, but the wife&#x27;s got dropped a few too many times -- it died, and couldn&#x27;t be revived.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last a good long while, the heads spin like their supposed to while they clean, and I did indeed feel like it cleaned my mouth very well.  </li>
            <li> but I never personally tried any of their products until I got the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My old charger burned out when I tried to use it with a transformer in a former country, so I&#x27;m also happy that the new charger will also charge my older</li>
            <li> I will not be using any other kind of toothbrush ever again.</li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t compare this to the other popular ones that use sonic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, time for another one and so far, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 in 2006.  </li>
            <li> I had been using an Oral-B Sonic complete that cleaned just as well and was so much quieter, but it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li> This set is better at cleaning (floss action heads) and MUCH easier to keep clean than the earlier version.  </li>
            <li> B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Brush Head (4 ct.)]], [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The pressure indicator is very helpful and the timer makes sure every side gets brushed evenly.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has four modes that allow you to choose from normal, light, deep clean, and polish.  </li>
            <li> Brought this because my previous Oral B brush died after more than 10 years!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, holds its charge pretty well, and cleans my teeth well enough that my dentist is always complementing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After back to back pregnancies I am trying to get my gums back in shape, the feather setting is very good for this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This new and improved Oral-B Professional model really does seem to do all the things a good dental hygienist does when cleaning teeth except provide a visual exam and x-rays.</li>
            <li> i should have invested in this a long time ago, its just so much better than using the manual brush.</li>
            <li> Surely this thing doesn&#x27;t need to recharge for so long.  </li>
            <li> Not sure the resultant banging of brush against your teeth is a good thing.</li>
            <li> This one is good as usual, but, maybe it&#x27;s just temporary</li>
            <li> A round head is much better to clean between your gum arches then</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really does clean like a professional.</li>
            <li> So the actual charging station is barely bigger than the toothbrush itself, which is perfect as it fits into the same spot my old toothbrush went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also really like being able to choose what I want the brush to do, be it daily clean, deep clean, sensitive or whitening.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a quickly dying Oral-B  Professional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I also think an oscillating head is going to clean better because it&#x27;s constantly pulling/throwing plaque downwards rather than from side to side such as a pulsating Sonicare would accomplish.  </li>
            <li> The overall feeling of clean is much better than my regular vitality model.</li>
            <li> , I thought that would be easy enough.  </li>
            <li> The large blue Travel Case holds everything neatly and tucks easily into a shaving kit or makeup</li>
            <li> the manual tooth brush where our salivary glands has to produce large amount of saliva and lot of spitting.</li>
            <li> one comes with a nifty (but somewhat large) travel case, which holds the handle and a couple of brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this toothbrush</li>
            <li> This TB is getting a it too smart for</li>
            <li> I can certainly tell a difference in the way my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> That means the travel case is quite large, too.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely powerful, gets into every nook and cranny and has a long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Digital display of remaining battery life is also very useful.</li>
            <li> This model is very much just like the older one.  </li>
            <li> Most companies would just send out a new unit and have me send the defective one back.</li>
            <li> I first used and wow, I should have used this right when it came out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically brush my teeth in quadrants, but it&#x27;s nice to know how much time has passed</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the induction charger doesn&#x27;t do a good job securing the unit so it topples over easily</li>
            <li> It is an absolutely up-to-the-minute way to keep your teeth and mouth clean and, maybe even, free of cavities and other unwanted dental miseries.</li>
            <li> About three years ago, my periodontist (whom I&#x27;ve been seeing 3-4 times annually for the past 25 years) was very insistent that I purchase the earlier version of this OralB/Braun toothbrush because he said it was such a powerful brush for maintaining good, healthy dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer a manual toothbrush, so I mainly use this one to make sure I get my back teeth clean, then finish up with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Oral B Smart 4000 series to replace my Sonic E series I bought in 2006 it still works, but I threw it away today, because I got tired of cleaning the gunk from the inside of handle, but it was a great brush</li>
            <li> A little loud, lots of surprising bells and whistles, but it does do what a toothbrush should do.</li>
            <li> It has a red light that indicates that you are using too much pressure, which is good if you have problems with gum recession from hard brushing.</li>
            <li> The brushing cycle is two minutes, and gives you a red light if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I have one of these and really like them.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I used the carrying case and it works really well and protects it well when on trips.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much cleaner my teeth feel than when I was using a hand brush.</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t really need the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare for quite some time and decided to switch to Oral B after noticing how much whiter my teeth were after traveling and being away from the Sonicare (using a manual toothbrush).</li>
            <li> /&gt;While both are electric toothbrushes, they work very differently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After charging the Oral-B Precision 4000 overnight it was ready to attack the plaque on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this because it is so much louder than a sonicare</li>
            <li> Much faster spin cycles, longer battery life, slimmer design.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be very satisfactory and would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works very well, and my teeth feels cleaner over the battery operated, which might be just in my head.  </li>
            <li> I really like the carrying case however.  </li>
            <li> Very tacky for a gift.</li>
            <li> Would buy this again if need.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone who wants a cleaner and healthier looking teeth</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> the delivery very in time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve wanted to try an electric toothbrush for some time now and after much debate,</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE.</li>
            <li> B.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this toothbrush really holds its charge for weeks.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner then ever before, basically like leaving a dentist office every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really travel with this brush.</li>
            <li> and it started making so much noise and skipping</li>
            <li> This brush really keep the tarter away.  </li>
            <li> My husband complains about it every night when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed</li>
            <li> this brush works very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;The deep-cleaning setting I haven&#x27;t really used,</li>
            <li> We really like Oral-B and thanks to Costco</li>
            <li> He needed something that would be fast and effecient.  </li>
            <li> much as i&#x27;m ready to say they brush well, i&#x27;ve to say the quality has not improve much over all these years</li>
            <li> My dentist has already told me that I brush my teeth with too much pressure</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I used to have a sonicare, but my mouth feels much cleaner after using this product.</li>
            <li> , I think there are smaller brushes available if I need to change though.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this type of tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> (the red battery light flashes).</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I have been having much easier trips to the dentist since switching over to this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I had my regular 6 month dentist appointment last week and my dentist actually thanked me for doing such a great job taking care of my teeth!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> It has a soft rubber piece in the middle which leaves my teeth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> last visit to the dentist (whom I have seen for over 30 years) was fabulous and he even mentioned that my teeth had never looked</li>
            <li> Our daughter uses the Ortho brush as she has braces and really enjoys it as well.enjoys it as well.</li>
            <li> Although there are six available brush heads designed for specific needs, mine came packaged with the all-purpose \\&quot;Precision Clean\\&quot; brush head.</li>
            <li> If that happens a beep and red flashing light gives a warning.</li>
            <li> If the bristles splay or wear too much before three months, that is a sign of using too much pressure.</li>
            <li> The brush does all the work, really.</li>
            <li> The silicon cup within the brush holds paste very well and my teeth feel polished afterwards just like after a dentist visit.  </li>
            <li> I really like the 3 modes of brushing that one can choose from.  </li>
            <li> Product works very well</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for gums, below the gum line or in between teeth&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li> I had to learn how to gently apply it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this toothbrush tells you when you are applying too much force.  </li>
            <li> and I notice the flashing red light when I do so.  </li>
            <li> and I almost kept both because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> but I really have to concentrate on listening for the beeps to know when to move to another area of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I really like the lights that indicated how &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; the battery is.</li>
            <li> so much I bought one for each of my kids for Christmas</li>
            <li> Turns out it is to help prevent you from using too much pressure on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Very happpy with this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the timer on it.</li>
            <li> I have had others but this really does a very thorough job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily need the reminder to switch areas brushed but probably nice for kids.</li>
            <li> my old Sonicare crapped out without warning, and after doing reviews, it appeared as many others were having similar issues.  </li>
            <li> And the battery lasts a long time, making it easy to bring on a trip without the charger.  </li>
            <li> can only hope to have this product for a long time as I am really enjoying brushing my teeth with it!</li>
            <li> Bigger brush head than my old oral b. really makes teeth feel clean!</li>
            <li> Somehow the base charges the handle through a plastic contact, very easy to use, and works great.</li>
            <li> This product is a significant improvement over the regular toothbrushes, let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definately better than other products that we have purchased.</li>
            <li> Even though it states on the rebate form that frustration free shipping UPC is honored, it apparently is not by Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> but much easier than older models)</li>
            <li> Out of the box, it took a full day and a half to reach full charge (which I didn&#x27;t really mind to be honest).&lt;br</li>
            <li> teeth are definitely left feeling clean after using this.</li>
            <li> (Of course, the head on the brush is fair game...)  ;-)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brushing action is very fast.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t really care about the zone timer, but the greater brush head speed than the model we had been using previously makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> So, the flashing red light is actually nice to remind you that you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job in cleaning my teeth and has 3 different settings to choose from and the attached brush head case definitely helps out in keeping my toothbrush heads protected from dust and curious cats.  </li>
            <li> The charge took all of 24 hours, and initially I didn&#x27;t know if it was really charging or not, because the charge light was so dim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a timer that encourages you to brush your teeth for a full two minutes while vibrating every 30 seconds to signal you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> This is no big deal, especially considering how much life this battery continued to have for so many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this right after my last dental cleaning about four months ago, and it has kept the inside of my bottom front teeth free from tartar, as if they were cleaned just last week.</li>
            <li> The controls take a little getting used to, probably more setting than you really need.</li>
            <li> My old Oral B was about 12 years old and finally gave up the ghost, I am certain that succeeding cleanings will be as easy and painless.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from the Oral-B Vitality, and this is significantly better than the previous product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife prefers the smaller round sensitive brush while I like the Dual Clean brush which is more like a traditional toothbrush but really gets my gumlines clean.  </li>
            <li> They are: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening or polishing.</li>
            <li> It has a variety of settings: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive and whitening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 4 brushing settings: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive and whitening/polishing.  </li>
            <li> valid.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the previous comment that this is indeed NOT Frustration Free Shipping!</li>
            <li> Does a better job than the previous brand.</li>
            <li> Has several different cleaning modes, a red light that alerts you if your brushing pressure is too strong,</li>
            <li> it is a shame because all the older model chargers are 110/220v</li>
            <li> The older model had the soldered in.</li>
            <li> We had an older model Oral-B then called a Braun.  </li>
            <li> My older Oral-B Triumph brush has lasted for years ; this one looks and operates&lt;br</li>
            <li> the future, more likely to get a normal disposable battery operated toothbrush and not a rechargeable battery type because it is not worth the price any more</li>
            <li> I particularly like the timer function that advises you of brushing length of time.  </li>
            <li> The batteries seem to last many days on a charge so no need to worry about packing a the charger for a short vacation or business trip.  </li>
            <li> I love the timer in 30 second intervals that lets you know when to move to the next area to brush (can be set to 45 seconds also).  </li>
            <li> We were replacing an older Oral-B version.  </li>
            <li> I think I was so used to my old, slow electric toothbrush that I didn&#x27;t realize it was not doing a good job anymore.  </li>
            <li> can not find the right replacement for the brush top on Amazon, because other people have the same problems with their tooth brush too.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B for several years, the old one was starting to not hold a charge and it was a great excuse to upgrade to a new one.</li>
            <li> so it, too, lasts as long as my original one.</li>
            <li> I find the new unit not as comfortable and lacking in some minor details.</li>
            <li> and hence my reluctance to put it on the stand in a tight fitting bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying one.</li>
            <li> I give this high ratings, every time I use this I feel like I was just at the dentist having my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> Would highly reccommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> also has a timer to let you know how long you need to clean every portion of your mouth.</li>
            <li> found the cheaper model to be VERY strong in the vibration, but certainly no better at cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t seem new which is super gross since it&#x27;s a hygiene product for your mouth!</li>
            <li> The product itself is nice but, as mentioned elsewhere, beware of Oral-B/amazon.com rebates, at least in this particular</li>
            <li> It easily reaches all those hard to reach areas within my mouth and effectively removes plaque due to its design.</li>
            <li> I think it cleans my teeth better than any other tooth brush, ever!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to make sure your back teeth and gums get adequate attention with just a manual toothbrush, so I think this is a good little machine to add to your brushing routine, not necessarily replace it.</li>
            <li> Wow, I bought 4 of these for my whole family this Christmas.</li>
            <li> The brush action is so much faster.  </li>
            <li> It is two-toned and just looks real professional.</li>
            <li> alarm that goes off every 30 seconds, in the normal brushing mode, to let you know</li>
            <li> But, apparently the red light flashes a lot for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for a long time--probably ten years or more.</li>
            <li> And this thing is not only powerful but super-smart--</li>
            <li> Way better than the other major brand.  </li>
            <li> I had the previous generation 4000 series and liked it a lot, but the battery was starting to lose it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Charger is also much smaller than on previous models and therefore handy for travel.</li>
            <li> The button to choose a different type of brushing is also on the handle and is easily pushed just when brushing in regular mode.  </li>
            <li> I like the 30 second beeps to enforce the right regimen.</li>
            <li> It is neat, easy to clean and holds a charge for at least 7 days!  </li>
            <li> Anyway, if you really like electric toothbrushes then you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this one; as for me, I think I&#x27;m going to go back to my old regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The timer system logically breaks your mouth into four areas, upper left and right, as well as lower left and right.  </li>
            <li> Should have bought a new one sooner.</li>
            <li> I received the new toothbrush a week after my cleaning, and started using it after the 24hour charging time.  </li>
            <li> Will probably upgrade that to the new version.</li>
            <li> new brush is, &amp;</li>
            <li> We just decided to get a new one with all the new settings on it.</li>
            <li> Why was it in a cardboard box since I bought it as NEW?</li>
            <li> I used toothbrush before, and this is a new experience for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I even like the new brush head</li>
            <li> I like the new angled brush.  </li>
            <li> and I told her I was using my new 4000.</li>
            <li> would recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain about on the new Oral-B tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It only supports 110-130VAC instead of global voltage supply range 110-240V, so it may not be a good option for travelling to other countries!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my old oral b tooth brush that was an older model of the new one for over a decade</li>
            <li> I think this could be a great tool however for those who need that little extra help; some teeth are probably harder to brush with a manual style brush or normal brush shaped head.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, gets those teeth clean!</li>
            <li> it really gets my teeth super clean; it was a little messy at first, but that was because I was new at it.</li>
            <li> And right above these \\&quot;windows\\&quot; are three small indicators of the kind of brushing you chose (the fourth choice being all three unlit) --</li>
            <li> Still made in Germany, so expecting the same quality as the first ones.  </li>
            <li> The charger on the first one gave out - probably because it was left on charge all the time.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and my only regret is that I did not purchase sooner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive than Sonicare but worth it!  </li>
            <li> I love the different settings and it holds a charge like none other I have used.  </li>
            <li> The battery in the first one finally gave out</li>
            <li> Never spent much time brushing.  </li>
            <li> but it is LOUD!</li>
            <li> and it was the exact same cardboard box.  </li>
            <li> But oh-my-goodness, it is so loud!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moS9HZLJRH7PKR]]This was my first and will be my last Oral B product.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it does!  </li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with my dental results after using it for the past 7 years</li>
            <li> My first charge only lasted a week, but that should improve after a couple of cycles.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Uniquely designed to cup each tooth while at the same time, the longer bristles get in between the teeth similar to flossing.</li>
            <li> Other available brush heads are meant for deeper flossing/plaque removal, one head has a \\&quot;power tip\\&quot; for people with braces, crowns, or bridges, a Pro-whitening head, and a head for sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Full charge from empty takes about 22 hours.</li>
            <li> battery seems to last just fine even on week long vacations.</li>
            <li> Brush holder cover is open at both ends to help brushes dry, and opens for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li> main reason for writing this review is to warn about the Mail-in Rebate scam, which seems to be common among many manufacturers.  </li>
            <li> I love the various programs and the red warning light that comes on if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> The brushing action is smooth, and if you brush too hard, the unit has a flashing red light on it and emits a beep.  </li>
            <li> I like the design and the feel of the brush in my hand, and after using for only about a week in the Deep Clean mode I have noticed big, positive changes in removal of stains on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> They also changed the toothbrush handle plug format so you cannot use the old charger with the new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both the 4000 and the 5000 leave teeth feeling as clean as any professional cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had, and both display a red  light when I brush too hard --</li>
            <li> You can use so many different brush heads with this brush too unlike my previous model.</li>
            <li> I also love the stand on this one, previous models had the toothbrush storage toward the back of where the handle charges.</li>
            <li> This model also has a base unit that you can snap on (I don&#x27;t because I live alone) that holds 4 additional brush heads, which is nice if more than one of you use the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My hygenist highly recommended this particular toothbrush for my specific needs.  </li>
            <li> The notification of when you reach the 30 or 45 seconds interval is not as smooth as my previous model as it stop completely instead of just pulsing the brush head and let you keep brushing instead of stop and wait it to complete it notification cycle.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it functions just fine.</li>
            <li> I thought I would not like the smaller brush head, but it provides better access to tight spaces.</li>
            <li> me feel little bit advanced than my ancestors who used to brush with manual tooth brush....</li>
            <li> It was a significant upgrade over our previous Braun electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it alerts if I am brushing too hard and that it&#x27;s programmed to brush each section of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace and was pleased to find this toothbrush with the hard plastic travel case.</li>
            <li> Yes, my teeth where cleaner but who cares when they feel like they are about to fall out due to the tremendous vibration.  </li>
            <li> Helping to clear up the gingivitis  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for others and they seem to like it so far</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the various modes.</li>
            <li> therefore this electric toothbrush might have been a bit costlier than it needed to be for me, but it definitely works very well.</li>
            <li> so you know exactly how long to brush for.</li>
            <li> Could not get any for near this price, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Boys</li>
            <li> Upgraded when the old one gave out.</li>
            <li> The package had all the contents advertised in he Amazon description, however the handle does say &amp;#34;Triumph Professional Care&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The Pro white head really makes my teeth fells</li>
            <li> I waited until the battery on my old Oral-B died.</li>
            <li> old toothbrush was a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Using this toothbrush will make you swear that you just visited the dentist for a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> but so old</li>
            <li> It has a lower sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the complete stop</li>
            <li> After I made the switch to Oral-B, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have an old Oral - B which I leave in another bathroom</li>
            <li> It arrived early too.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my old ORAL&lt;</li>
            <li> The charging method (where the plug meets the stand) is a completely sealed electrical system, i.e. no water can get in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> Using it feels like having just had a professional teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> My old one wore out after almost 10 years of faithful service.  </li>
            <li> but I have used the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; setting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lighter feeling on the teeth, and avoids some of the irritation that sensitive teeth might feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite being 6 years old, it was still faithfully working every day with out issues.  </li>
            <li> brushing from the Oral-B professional electric toothbrushes continue to amaze me.  </li>
            <li> you get from this brush, standard toothbrushes seem to fall very flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t received any replies on this matter after giving feedback.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s quite bothersome in the early morning.</li>
            <li> I drink lots of tea and coffee and suffer staining between quarterly professional cleanings.</li>
            <li> Of course, that&#x27;s all personal preference, so what you really want to know is if the toothbrush performs well for an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> When I went in recently for my six-month cleaning, she said that she could really tell an improvement in plaque removal.</li>
            <li> Btw, I&#x27;m too far away from the states to bother with warrant/ replacements.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement order for one that was old and</li>
            <li> I used to have stains around my retainer and those have completely gone.</li>
            <li> I used my old oral b for years and it still worked.</li>
            <li> For a professional cleaning every time i brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with the 4000 because it was the cheapest of their models that included a sensitive setting.  </li>
            <li> I use the Sensitive Gum brush head every day.</li>
            <li> and you get TWO complete units (toothbrushes and chargers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like the different types of brushes which Oral-B has for this toothbrush as well.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li> and, as she predicted, the signs of early gum disease disappeared.</li>
            <li> I will no longer need two electric handles and an old stand-by manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So, naturally, I skipped the \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; instructions and just went at it.</li>
            <li> There was so much going on with the 30 second beeps</li>
            <li> Replaced our old Oral B and could not believe the difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;TO PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li> B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like it as much as the ProWhite brush head, which is very similar to the one I use on my Triumph.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers said it is too loud, but I almost feel that is a given for a brush that does all the things this does.</li>
            <li> and it can&#x27;t be too loud because it has never woken them up.</li>
            <li> What really frosts my jaw with this toothbrush is that I only get 5 or 6 brushings out of it before the battery runs out of gas and needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Oral-B that I had had for about 8 years</li>
            <li> I also was a bit startled by the red light that occasionally came on from the back of the brush.</li>
            <li> It was like I was sitting in the dentist chair (without the pain, of course) and getting a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on different electric tooth brushes I ordered and received the Oral-B 4000 a few days ago.</li>
            <li> The only useful extra to me is the prolonged battery life (10 days vs. 7 days).  </li>
            <li> There is nothing more annoying to me that working on a good brushing and having to wait as it stops then starts again several times during a brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more powerful than my last electric toothbrush (a much older Oral-B model), but not so powerful that it&#x27;s irritating.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that all the extra features came with the brush such as the travel case and extra brush holder.</li>
            <li> But using the Vitality every day proved too strong for the teeth and gums to tolerate, even though I followed the instructions of no more than 2 minutes brushing per time.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, brushing right after eating is a common cause of tooth decay.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, brushing right after eating is a common cause of tooth decay.</li>
            <li> It has a similar stand/charger to the older models (so you could use the old charger if for any reason you needed to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is there really a difference between all the different models of electric toothbrushes from the major brands?</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;--Easier than older models to get to the very back teeth</li>
            <li> Its value is well worth the money, both long and short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for years, a similar older model Oral-B, so I got this model for her for Xmas.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because of the price, but am pleasantly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this set to replace a older version that finally died after 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded from an older model, and find several improvements.</li>
            <li> I think this is a major improvement over my old, now defunct model. . .</li>
            <li> This past visit, after using my new Oral B 4000 for about a month, she remarked that my teeth were extremely clean and free of the usual coatings.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Oral-B Precision 4000 for your next electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> vibration is a lot less intense than the current battery operated toothbrushes and the clean feeling left</li>
            <li> I bought this product because Braun is supposed to be a highly acclaimed German engineering &amp; manufacturing company.</li>
            <li> In response to other reviews about vibration - yes it does vibrate a little more than other cordless toothbrushes I have owned - however I quickly got accustomed to it to the point that I no longer notoice it.</li>
            <li> The main benefit for me is the pressure sensor that keeps me from brushing too hard (a clearly visible red light in the handle near the neck that you can see while brushing).</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B finally died, so I decided to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I only purchased a new one because my old one no longer held a charge.  </li>
            <li> But it will run for three minutes straight if you decide you want to brush for that long.</li>
            <li> Easily reaches hard to get to areas and helps remove plaque.</li>
            <li> Keeps me from brushing too hard and still getting my teeth cleaner than I am able to with a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and it was simply time to get a new toothbrush</li>
            <li> so i bought a brand new one for her and a different toothbrush came in.  </li>
            <li> a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They updated the look, but everything works the same.</li>
            <li> She told me that it was because the toothbrush was actually getting under the gum line and was properly cleaning my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> Our old Professional 3000 finally stopped holding the charge</li>
            <li> I thought I wouldn&#x27;t love this toothbrush as much as my Sonicare, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how long it takes to charge and, subsequently, how fast the battery drained on the Oral-B. With the Sonicare, I got 2 handles and 3 brush heads, as well as the carrying case.</li>
            <li> Second to a professional dental visit!  </li>
            <li> This thing cleans your yap like no other.</li>
            <li> If you have soft teeth, there is no excuse for you not to invest in one.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth like no other electric I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> They sent me back a scan of exactly what I sent in which totally meets the requirements, and they do not ask for anything specific, just reject my rebate</li>
            <li> There is no other UPC anywhere else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally there is enough plaque and tartar to keep her busy with the feared Cavitron for several minutes.</li>
            <li> And, for me at least, the ideal time to have a series of little beeps informing me of when to brush where is when I am still half asleep.</li>
            <li> And, for me at least, the ideal time to have a series of little beeps informing me of when to brush where is when I am still half asleep.</li>
            <li> The problem is, and I reported it to the company, that even if you dry the brush before you put it back in the little holder, it gets gunky inside for lack of a better term.</li>
            <li> The head is small, which I like because you can do a good job without holding the jaw wide open for too long.</li>
            <li> I used an electric toothbrush a long time ago when they first came out, but the heads wore down so quickly, that I finally went back to the old standard.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little too powerful...</li>
            <li> It has a pressure sensor based light that will flash if you&#x27;re brushing too hard</li>
            <li> Has an automatic shut off and warning light if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> I generally get through 2-3 stops during my brushing time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Several brush selections are available to choose from, and I use the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; setting and usually the regular brushing head, with the flossers.</li>
            <li> I have ordered the same brush in the past and had no problems receiving the refund until the Amazon frustration free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and gums and this is the only sonic/vibrating brush that did not hurt my teeth.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t use any of the extra benefits this toothbrush offers over its 3000 version.  </li>
            <li> The company apparently didn&#x27;t understand what I was trying to tell them.</li>
            <li> Apparently it has no warrantly.</li>
            <li> Really what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I like it and can definitely tell a difference between using it and our old electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The first time that I used this the pink was not pink, It was RED!</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B finally died after 10 years.  </li>
            <li> My old one served me well and had just reached the point where the charge would not hold and the brush stopped in the middle of use.  </li>
            <li> I know I can just ignore the pauses/beeps; but I feel like a Pavlov experiment, rushing to complete an entire quadrant before my toothbrush beats me to it  --</li>
            <li> old electric toothbrush, by the same manufacturer gave up the ghost after 10-12 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and when that is paired with all of your adult teeth in the back, the red flashing light on the Oral-B goes</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is definitely quieter than an Oral B and the pulsating action of Sonicare feels like a massage for your teeth...</li>
            <li> I use the floss action brush head for my back teeth about twice a week.  </li>
            <li> The motor on the old one finally gave up</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s different than my old one.</li>
            <li> Oral-B electric replaces both of my old, yet still functioning, Oral-B&#x27;s in the cabinet above the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Feels like you just left the dentist after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Sensitive brush is terrific.</li>
            <li> I had the Oral-B Precision 5000 prior to this, and used it for nearly 2 years before losing it on a trip.</li>
            <li> Honestly there was nothing wrong with the 9400.  </li>
            <li> I was using it twice a day, and about the tenth time the top of the brush head just felt off in my mouth, it felt like a broken tooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot to pay, but my last Oral-B lasted a very long time, 5+ years, so in the long run it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> And I found there is a new version which actually supports global voltage range and with addditional LCD display.</li>
            <li> The one thing I do not know is now long the brushes will last before having to buy new replacement brushes, but that is a minor issue as this is a really quality product that does the job better than a couple of other electric toothbrushes that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> , it never stopped working, I just hope that the new one the ( Oral B) lasts as long.</li>
            <li> (in less time)&lt;br /&gt;I must say this is my first electric brushing system.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush comes with a head (mine came with a ProWhite brush head), charging base that stores your heads, the handle and a carrying/travel case.</li>
            <li> The other good thing is that it has a small footprint than the previous Triumph package I had.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say anything that wasn&#x27;t already said in other reviews.</li>
            <li> It seemed to take a long time, but the green light finally went off and that meant I could brush!  </li>
            <li> red light appears when brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Not only should I not spend more then 30 seconds brushing in one section unless doing an occasional 45 second deep cleaning, I should not press too hard when brushing.</li>
            <li> I only have this for a short time so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and been able to keep a very serious orthodontic problem under control.</li>
            <li> I went through a pretty extensive review of electric toothbrushes and basically got down to Oral-B vs Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The red light alerts you to not press so hard so that you use proper brush pressure</li>
            <li> But, I can say for sure that the Oral-B is less messy than my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few issues, (not so much problems), that I have with this toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush and suggest that the additional cost of the 5000 isn&#x27;t worth it for the small difference in features - buy the 4000.</li>
            <li> I know that the whole \\&quot;stopping when you press down too hard\\&quot; is supposed to be a safety feature, but having my toothbrush quit intermittently like</li>
            <li> At this price  the vibration seems a  little excessive,  ergonomics could be better  </li>
            <li> If you want to replace one later on, its not a one step process, and would need a few extra tools to replace the included battery, so for most, you will after a few years have to discard it, and buy another toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is the variable speed that gradually changes speed from slow to fast &amp; back to slow.  </li>
            <li> The recharging dock separates from the extra-brush holder and is quite small, thus easy to pack along with the brush, so you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about batteries unless you are traveling where you can&#x27;t plug it in (other countries?).  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to spend a lot of money on a toothbrush -- I typically stick to disposable brushes and even the disposable cheapie electric tootbrushes (like Crest Spinbrush).</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush we purchased, we were a little skeptical of how much better it would be.</li>
            <li> Part of the handle lights up red if you brush too hard, but it seems overly sensitive for the first 10 seconds or so of brushing.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the Oral B brush is quite large and i had a little challenge maneuvering with it</li>
            <li> It even flashes a red light when I am brushing too hard!</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it takes nearly an entire day to get back to full charge but at least you can still use it in</li>
            <li> I really like this little tooth brush.</li>
            <li> While I was certainly no stranger to electric toothbrushes, I had no idea just how crappy those other ones were until I used this for the first time.</li>
            <li> toothbrush itself works very well; the only negative about its performance is that it is quite loud (much louder than my previous Sonicare electric toothbrush).</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this than the regular tooth brash!!!</li>
            <li> if user pressed too hard when brushing, this toothbrush is so loud that it can wake the whole house</li>
            <li> Make one model, make it good and reliable and last a long time, and you&#x27;d dominate the market full of horrible manufacturing quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was hard to know which was the right one to choose.  </li>
            <li> your mouth is crowded, it&#x27;s still tough to fully clean your back teeth (</li>
            <li> The smaller head of Oral B also makes it easier to clean behind my back teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There also other heads for flossing features, sensitive gums, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use other oscillating head brushes by Oral-B, but none made the loud buzzing noise (louder than the tone I use on my alarm clock)</li>
            <li> It has a timer that beeps to let you know that you&#x27;ve brushed long enough and to move on to the next</li>
            <li> Anyway, I thought it was just telling me that I was brushing too hard, because it would typically stop during the time the red light was flashing.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush not only stops when you press too hard, it lights up red and sends a little beeping sound as well -</li>
            <li> like the fact that this brush has four modes (regular, deep cleaning, sensitive and whitening), and it is thicker than the previous model</li>
            <li> Only downfall, is since P&amp;G bought it, the price of the heads has gone up substantially, and don&#x27;t seem to last as long.  </li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an older unit that had heavy use and needed to be retired.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some reviewers mentioned it seemed large for small mouths</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit large/long for my rather small hands, but is certainly manageable.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel just as clean (if not more so) using the Oral-B electric toothbrush than the Sonicare (of course that is not a true measured scientific observation).  </li>
            <li> It did not last very long only about  a year.  </li>
            <li> No more recharging headaches and the units circular motion really cleaned my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> And the battery does not last as long as my first toothbrush which started out maintaining the charge for at least 10 days.  </li>
            <li> That is with brushing at least twice a day and 3 times per day once during the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> and I can confirm that it will last that long.</li>
            <li> There is a normal 2 minute setting, a prolonged setting that has 45 seconds per side instead of 30, and two other settings that don&#x27;t seem very different from each other.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Oral-B to replace a long used member of the same brand.  </li>
            <li> only question is how long will it last&lt;</li>
            <li> You buy a product expecting to get $15 back and they find some flimsy excuse not to give you the money.  </li>
            <li> Battery does not last as long.  </li>
            <li> It gives you clues as to how long you have brushed.</li>
            <li> Feels a little weird to start with, but once I got used to it, I liked this quite a bit.</li>
            <li> and i really like the pressure indicator that lights up red if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> Overall I would probably buy it again, the other brand I have purchased seem to only last about a year.</li>
            <li> Much less noise than the old Braun 3D model.  </li>
            <li> Now this has become a far less convenient toothbrush for travel.  </li>
            <li> but the handle is bigger and harder to hang onto than the last one.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part of this is very simple - the base stays steady.  </li>
            <li> Even with careful use and only recharging it when it is close to empty, the battery is the major flaw in this design.</li>
            <li> Profession Precision 4000 has everything I need now in all with the basic brush on a single rechargeable handle.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained this brush was too harsh, but I think the opposite is true.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a regular user of an electric toothbrush this particular model might not be that hard for you to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Only replaced my old Oral B electric because it fell into a messy situation that could not be cleaned properly without extreme measures.</li>
            <li> We usually buy the brushes that have the small rotating top with a stationary bottom (like these: [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral B Professional Clean Replacement Brush]]</li>
            <li> An improvement I noticed over our previous Oral-B models is that the new Charger uses 16% less electricity to get the same long-length power cycle (about 7 days @</li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li> In the center of the bristles, there is a small rubbery disc that spins, much like the device a dental hygenist uses to polish teeth.  </li>
            <li> There is really no need for the extra clock thing.  </li>
            <li> The trade off for this is an extremely long charging time; about 3 days to fully charge.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has a built in timer that times how long you should brush each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> so you tend to not brush as long on that side).  </li>
            <li> Hopefully my research will pay off in the long run.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and stays charged a long time.</li>
            <li> Mine only came with one head; the polishing brush with the cupped rubber center.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 of these and only charge them when they are completely empty.</li>
            <li> Like it, although it takes longer than expected to recharge and I&#x27;d like the battery to last longer between recharges</li>
            <li> The toothbrush seems to be well made, but time will tell how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> Cant believe I waited this long to get this.</li>
            <li> I prefer the round tooth brush head and that I can buy brush heads for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> sent everything in for the rebate, being as utterly careful as possible since they have a reputation for ripping people off.</li>
            <li> I end up brushing too long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I mailed it, not only did the Oral-B rebate service center reply once that I had not included it</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for Christmas for my fiancé because she had been asking for one for a long time,  </li>
            <li> so you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li> And so, with twice/day brushing, I&#x27;ve kept almost all 28 teeth in my aging mouth -- and the prospect of keeping them for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should of thrown out my tooth brush out a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long admired the quality of the Oral-B brand</li>
            <li> every 30 seconds it stops to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li> I suspect that a few years down the road that won&#x27;t exactly be the case, but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the power lines went down in a freak accident and burnt up most of my connected gadgets.</li>
            <li> the years, I have tried a few battery operated toothbrushes (both Oral-B and other brands), and while I felt they did a little better than manual, I never liked the way they made my entire skull vibrate.  </li>
            <li> It has a few different settings of apparently different pressures but they&#x27;re really not that different...</li>
            <li> There are 4 brush &amp;#34;settings&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t see how they are so different, other than the speeds.  </li>
            <li> the only disavantage that you cant use the charger world widely !</li>
            <li> At the end of 2 weeks there was no red, not even pink!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nut about it remaining pristine, so this might not be a big deal for other shoppers.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ; for the mouth, but I don&#x27;t get that comment, as the removable brush is the same as for other Oral-B elec.</li>
            <li> The handle is large so it was hard to reach the tight spots in the back.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Takes very long to charge though.</li>
            <li> Sounds crazy, but a dentist once told me that he know that I was left-handed since the teeth on my left side were not as clean (it&#x27;s harder to brush on the same side as the hand you&#x27;re using</li>
            <li> I now take off the brush to let the unit air dry</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is loud.</li>
            <li> prepares me mentally for the subsequent mundane daily challenge, by solving them with technology...</li>
            <li> I have used those type of tooth brushes for at least twinty years going back to early models and all of them performed well for me.  </li>
            <li> And... oh, did I mention that in the 6 years of using the Oral-B brushes, I&#x27;ve had no signs of gum disease and no new cavities.tist; and never after meals.</li>
            <li> And... oh, did I mention that in the 6 years of using the Oral-B brushes, I&#x27;ve had no signs of gum disease and no new cavities.</li>
            <li> B007HPJGU6 Philips Sonicare Elite Limited Edition Toothbrush Includes 2 Handles, 3 Brush Heads and 2 Charger Packs]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sonicare charges faster and lasts longer on a single charge than the Oral-B does.</li>
            <li> They suffer from memory effect and limited around charges cycles.</li>
            <li> For those of you who use a conventional toothbrush, I can&#x27;t recommend highly enough getting an electric one.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the extra expense for the 5000 which has the smiling face on a separate screen.</li>
            <li> I think that the rechargeable is no better than the battery-powered one as far as cleaning one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> Overall, my biggest complaint is the large handle - it is hard to grip when your hands aren&#x27;t very big.</li>
            <li> that item delivered to me may not be new because when you buy this at the store, the toothbrush and all its parts are prepackaged in one hard plastic container.</li>
            <li> speed of the toothbrushes had increased (with each new design) in the past but became stagnant for the last few years by now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can brush twice a day and recharge it at only once a week or less.</li>
            <li> I also like that it uses the same brush heads as my previous model since I already had a supply of them.  </li>
            <li> Suggest with the next redesign that it does not stop between the brushing periods, a slight pause would be sufficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people complain that it doesn&#x27;t completely stop after two minutes: do you really not know when to stop brushing?</li>
            <li> I have seen other people complain that there is not a digital screen and other gripes.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this one would be less of a machine, but it&#x27;s more.  </li>
            <li> Extra brushes are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Holder for multiple brushes look a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> head&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> The only concern is the handle which seems large and making it difficult to carry or use for traveling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it may well be the last oral b braun i buy because the last one that went dead, it broke down in less than 12 months, which is a big let down</li>
            <li> The power and options of this model are great, but the shape is awful.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that the charger is not universal.</li>
            <li> The Oral B round head is a much easier to navigate around delicate gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are small &amp; apparently are \\&quot;dentist inspired\\&quot; to get a tooth-by-tooth cleaning.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m just waking up or already tired and ready for bed.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to mentally count to get an even brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The build feels solid and I hope that it lasts me a few years.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, but it does take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> I gave this to my college aged son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> -B has a wide variety of brush heads available and we have several so that multiple people can use the base.</li>
            <li> Since it gets used about 6 times per day we need to recharge it roughly once a week</li>
            <li> FYI: it is the same as the round</li>
            <li> Only one brush head was in the box and the brush holder was missing.  </li>
            <li> The brush works well, as expected for an Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> toothbrushes, no matter how wide the handle is, and that is what goes into your mouth.  </li>
            <li> That one came with two motors though so my wife and I could have our own base units, so P&amp;G seems to have gotten away with yet another price raise.  </li>
            <li> My oldest son has braces and uses the next step-up model that was given to him by his orthodontist (other than the gadget-y little timer thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also struggling a bit with keeping the splatter down to a minimum; but not a big deal, I half expected that to be part of the territory of using an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Annoyingly, the brush pauses for a half-second every 30 seconds or so, just in case you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve brushed long enough (really dumb feature, for which I dropped the unit one star).</li>
            <li> The actual unit came in a plain brown box, not the retail box you see in the store.</li>
            <li> Of course, that meant I had two different handles charging and two brush heads because one head would not fit on the other.</li>
            <li> the other one was getting harder to charge,  </li>
            <li> Found the unit to be a little underpowered with the motor bogging down over larger tooth surfaces.  </li>
            <li> real complaint so far is that it only comes with one brush head</li>
            <li> As a mechanical engineer with expertise in vibrations I was very skeptical that a simple rotating brush could compete with a sonic one, but I thought it was worth trying something</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush for several weeks and have noticed very little tooth sensitivity as a result.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $20 less, the same pulse and oscillation speed but a slightly shorter battery life and 1 less mode.</li>
            <li> Some electric toothbrushes cause extreme tooth sensitivity, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers, it is a bit noisy (compared to my sonicare)</li>
            <li> I will not ever have any other.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even look at other brands....</li>
            <li> I havee tried a couple of other electric toothbrushes in my life.</li>
            <li> With the cheaper model, when I looked around, things would be blurry due to the amount of vibration in your head -- with this one that doesn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife, on the other hand uses her Sonicare brush for years, and tried the Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I had had an Oral-B for over tens years and was due a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27; ve been using a sonic care for the past 10 years but when it finally quit I decided to try the oral b 4000.  </li>
            <li> and then other complaining beeps that started after I pushed the mode selector button which I thought was the \\&quot;off\\&quot; button.</li>
            <li> is too big and slick for comfort and optimal control</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just too used to normal toothbrushes, but using this thing felt bulky and weird, and I can&#x27;t say I enjoy the feeling of holding a bulky vibrating thing in my hand as I desperately try to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> not sure how this is different from my previous oral-B</li>
            <li> recently had problem with odor in the base on my old one and again on the new one I bought.  </li>
            <li> But apparently the new Sonicare brushes are awful and break every year or so (or so the reviews consistently say).  </li>
            <li> The tooth brush is easy to handel but the extra base piece seems like a waste, we don&#x27;t use it.....  </li>
            <li> The base is actually very tiny, just like the original.  </li>
            <li> But even with this I would still get a little pink no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> I will qualify this by stating that I have not had much previous experience with other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> button is too hard to find and push, it should be bigger...</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be somewhat tough on brushes because I brush extra long and also scrub my retainer.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman, and take a medium size glove, so I may not have the largest hands, but I am certainly average for the targeted audience of this product.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint they mentioned is battery life doesn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time, and the section for storing additional heads is optional, so without that the charger footprint is small.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is designed to last at least 3 months of twice a day usage.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I could wipe the toothbrush down after every use, but that&#x27;s a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in a 220v region and was using this with a step down transformer.</li>
            <li> It cut down the cleaning and polishing time</li>
            <li> Granted, you found out when the battery needed recharging before -- it just died on you, after noticeably slowing down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone serious about day to day cleaning of their teeth will definitely get step up in the cleaning of hard to reach areas &amp; overall whitening.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but it really delivers.</li>
            <li> so I can take it with my on trips 10 days or less.  </li>
            <li> but the toothbrush runs for almost a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Theirs a couple days and less than a year old.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist even noticed my teeth were less stained when visiting her for my bi-annual teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Subject line says it all.  </li>
            <li> (previous model did).</li>
            <li> The power is there and all the brush heads I previously had fits.</li>
            <li> To help you the  brush beeps every 30 seconds and has a slight pause.  </li>
            <li> I have no problem with it but for some odd reason they didn&#x27;t build in the ability to deactivate it.</li>
            <li> I have previously used a Sonicare system ages ago and those cheapie battery-powered Crest Spinbrushes.</li>
            <li> I was shopping for the 4000 model but the 5000 model happened to be on sale for less then the 4000 model.  </li>
            <li> Now I have no way of knowing if the charger blew or if my brush was defective out of the box as I never got to see the charging lights (it was on the charger for less than 5 mins).</li>
            <li> Update on previous review.  </li>
            <li> After slightly less than one year, either the charger or the toothbrush has stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Oral-B electric toothbrushes, my dentist gets a lot less of my money......</li>
            <li> That seems like less than 60 days.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I had to replace my old Oral-B unit with a new one.  </li>
            <li> If you look at your gums in the mirror, they are like little arches coming down around your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The advertised battery performance is not true.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price for the replacement brushes is a little less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You could never clean your teeth as well manually.</li>
            <li> annoying fact is the noise, you would think that oral b &amp; braun would try to improve their technology and design to introduce quieter toothbrushes, no way, it just gets louder with each new oral b toothbrush i buy because the battery drains too quickly and became too inconvenient to use daily</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey, but I guess you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little freaked out</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> But, the intermission to change areas is a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head is a little bulky for my wisdom tooth area.</li>
            <li> although a little bulky)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, three small lighted \\&quot;windows\\&quot; go out, one after the other, as the charge weakens.  </li>
            <li> Makes it a lot less irritating to open something!</li>
            <li> These companies that keep rushing new products out that don&#x27;t last make me sick.  </li>
            <li> This causes the unit to go into sensitive brush mode which is very weak.  </li>
            <li> This causes the unit to go into sensitive brush mode which is very weak.</li>
            <li> We bought a second as it was tough finding</li>
            <li> I had tired the one that comes with the little clock which is the next model up.  </li>
            <li> Everyday use keeps coffee and tea stains at bay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, noisy, and after about 40 days it quit recharging and then flatlined.&lt;br /&gt;In order to return it under the &amp;#34;60 day challenge&amp;#34; I had to listen to about 10 minutes of Oral B ads.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Reviewed both the 7000, and 5000 model and settled with this one since I don&#x27;t need a separate timer that both the 5000/7000 have, which saved a few bucks in doing so.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have a pause button, but it will remember where you are in its brushing cycle if you need to turn it off for a few seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few days after Christmas I sent out an e-mail to my friends asking if anybody needed or wanted to buy the Amazon toothbrush</li>
            <li> , i always use until the battery runs out before i recharge them, regardless, the battery performance will deteriorate after a few months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the reason for that is the round shape of the Oral B head.  </li>
            <li> beware, when delivered completly dead, read instructions, just charge for a few days....</li>
            <li> But I decided to bite the bullet and get this one based on a few recs here and from friends.</li>
            <li> For a few days this item was removed bc of some issues.</li>
            <li> My dentist has told me that I brush way too hard, which was why my gums were beginning to receed and cause other problems.</li>
            <li> I ordered the toothbrush and it came in a plain cardboard box.</li>
            <li> is that it stops brushing if you press down to hard (and also to warn you to move to another dental quandrant).  </li>
            <li> The previous generation, same model number, had a dual voltage charger (worked both in USA 110V and Europe 220V outlets), so I was disappointed to find out that in this product refresh they&#x27;ve changed the charger to work only in the USA.  </li>
            <li> I have a tendency to try and scrub a little too hard</li>
            <li> biggest respite is to my salivary glands which has to now produce very little saliva for my tooth brushing needs,&lt;br /&gt;with</li>
            <li> A few visits ago, my dentist had told me that I was brushing my teeth too hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, we do not love the small toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> I placed a small amount of toothpaste on the tip of the brush as the directions stated and then began brushing.  </li>
            <li> I now know what I have been missing!</li>
            <li> Shipping prompt as usual.</li>
            <li> The timer is annoying to me, it pauses and beeps to indicate when to move to the next quadrant, maybe keeps me honest but it is annoying to pause.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silly to have AC adapters that AREN&#x27;T universal nowadays.</li>
            <li> It can drip, but that usually happens when I am not paying attention and trying to multi-task while brushing.  </li>
            <li> Have used Oral-B electric toothbrush in the past and appreciate the quality and features.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace the Braun/Oral B toothbrush that I have had for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst problem in the world, but I would prefer to have a more definitive \\&quot;end of cycle,\\&quot; warning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but should last years.</li>
            <li> What I like is the small recharging stand and convenient size.  </li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> She told me that I needed to keep up using the toothbrush and to continue to use the mouthwash as it was killing the germs that the other toothbrushes were leaving behind.</li>
            <li> I hate how I have to move the brush so much because the brush is so small.</li>
            <li> Speaking of charging, the charging base of this toothbrush is much too small to provide a stable environment during the charging process.</li>
            <li> It tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> There is also a pressure alarm that lets you know if you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t push too hard on your teeth)</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it tells me when I am brushing too hard, and that it tells me when to switch quadrants.  </li>
            <li> brush head makes it hard to reach molars</li>
            <li> With every bump or hard step around my sink, it went tumbling off.</li>
            <li> It even lets you know if you are pressing to hard.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush also lets you know if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> The picture shows this large base for the charging station.  </li>
            <li> You could get at least 60 brushes (i.e., 30 days if you brush morning &amp; night) on the 2 disposable batteries.  </li>
            <li> However, you can only change the mode when the toothbrush is on, and this is awkward to do since the brush head has to be in your mouth to prevent splattering of the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> but they have a lot of negative reviews for \\&quot;other\\&quot; reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once charged I unplugg it for at least 10 days before it needs recharging.  </li>
            <li> Out of the box, the toothbrush was ready to use in about 24 hours after attaching it to the charging base.</li>
            <li> the base is quite small but heavy enough</li>
            <li> My last electric brush base was taller and had hidden compartments for the brush heads, but it wobbled and shook every time I tried to lift the brush off the charger.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this - according to the reviews the charge is only supposed to last a week - still going after weeks - talk about under promise and over deliver!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the case or the &amp;#34;side car&amp;#34; brush head case (without it, it takes up a very small footprint).</li>
            <li> Before you get used to it, there&#x27;s a little bit of spatter, and it&#x27;s not something you can casually stroll around while you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she is big on onions and this lil bad boy cleans it all up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good travel toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it is probably not good for a vacation of any length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried on occasion when I was unable to take this or the previous 9400 system with me - it was frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Saw this one and decided to give it a go, but it felt like a truck in my mouth, clunky and awkward, not like the other had been.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed it only came with one toothbrush head</li>
            <li> The cleaning heads on this toothbrush, while having a wide variety of choices, they were very difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It got so bad that even though it was showing fully charged, there seemed no real power to it.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that one brush base can be used by multiple people (there are four slots in the tray for four brush heads).</li>
            <li> While the 5000 came with two different types of brushes, the 4000 comes with just one, though the base units are identical, allowing for storage of up to four brushes.</li>
            <li> Poor purchase on my part.</li>
            <li> My dentist really likes it even though it&#x27;s boring to use.  </li>
            <li> The base unit that stores the extra brush heads has a hinged cover, so if you&#x27;re a germaphobe, you don&#x27;t have to worry about any bathroom stuff in the air landing on your brush head!  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I dislike is the ring that builds up on the base stand.  </li>
            <li> I think the auxiliary display that comes with the 5000 product is unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> The charging base can only use under 110V power supply which  brings difficulty to travel around world, an additional transformer is needed.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B toothbrushes all have this extremely annoying feature that they turn off every 30 or 45 seconds (depending on the setting) to tell you to advance to the next row of teeth.</li>
            <li> It even has different modes, not that I use anything but the base one mind you.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time for trips I take without the base.</li>
            <li> The handle on this toothbrush is way too thick which sometimes makes it awkward to maneuver</li>
            <li> unfortunately the battery dies after about a year.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the pressure sensor keeps lighting up, even when the brush is not being touched.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a shame, useless for anyone who travels a lot...</li>
            <li> Boy, were we wrong.  </li>
            <li> Doing so in this position is difficult.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Oral B</li>
            <li> The brush heads are expensive though.</li>
            <li> Oral-B then replied with &amp;#34;bought the wrong model&amp;#34; except of course I did NOT buy the wrong model; I bought what amazon advertised &amp; what was on the rebate form.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I posted a review of this toothbrush under toothbrush replacement brush</li>
            <li> hope I haven&#x27;t made any of this seem complicated because it is not.  </li>
            <li> Silly me</li>
            <li> The representative said that I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> No exceptions,  Stupid dishonest company.</li>
            <li> That drives me crazy, and you can&#x27;t turn that feature off.  </li>
            <li> While brushing, you end up sliding upwards causing a terrible imbalance in weight (feels like brushing with the small end of a baseball bat, while the heaving end hangs out there).  </li>
            <li> Very skeptical I brought the toothbrush home and tried it out.</li>
            <li> This idiotic device is designed to stop for a moment every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> So I had a bad experience about 8 years ago with an electric toothbrush and haven&#x27;t used one since.</li>
            <li> decided on the Oral-B 4000 (with my amazon card rewards and coupon offer at the time of offer; I got this bad boy for an even $50).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels cleaner after brushing with this tooth brush and should solve problem of teeth grooving by brushing with bad technique.</li>
            <li> disappointed in the device, the quality and the service.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I’m disappointed with that part of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that the package arrived without a brush head.</li>
            <li> They really disappointed me with this product.</li>
            <li> That is way too annoying.  </li>
            <li> The tray can also be removed from the charging base if you don&#x27;t want the bulk on your counter.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if others have had this problem, but when I place my toothbrush on the counter, it leaves a film of a toothpaste/water mix where the base of the brush touches the counter.  </li>
            <li> Battery charge indicators flash while charging, which can be annoying if you can see the brush from bedside.  </li>
            <li> Rechargable on its base.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> One annoying thing though</li>
            <li> that is annoying.  </li>
            <li> Stopping to tell me when to switch to another area of my mouth is annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with Amazon for doing this.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t feel like boring monday morning....</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We love the flossing brush!  Heavy duty, gets those teeth clean!</li>
            <li> Does a great job, and has container for travel. Gave it as a gift and the recipient was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I have one of these and really like them. You get the dentist clean feeling each time you brush.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B before P&amp;G bought them out.  That one came with two motors though so my wife and I could have our own base units, so P&amp;G seems to have gotten away with yet another price raise.  However, my first two lasted for almost 15 years!  I hope this holds up the same.  Still made in Germany, so expecting the same quality as the first ones.  Only downfall, is since P&amp;G bought it, the price of the heads has gone up substantially, and don&#x27;t seem to last as long.  Still, I think it saves on dentist work.</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning and polishing--manual toothbrushes don&#x27;t give you nearly as much of a fresh, clean feeling.  The pulse to remind you to move from quadrant to quadrant is helpful to prevent overbrushing.  Haven&#x27;t played around too much with the various modes--to be honest, 4 modes seems to be overkill, but I guess it&#x27;s nice to have options.  I haven&#x27;t used a Sonicare, but I&#x27;d recommend Oral-B.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Great for a family. Easy to put together. Great to use after the trip.&lt;br /&gt;Easy storage. thanks.</li>
            <li> We had an earlier version of the Oral-B which we liked very much, but the charger gave out so we ordered this one.  I love the 30 second timer for brushing quadrants of your teeth; I do top out, top inside, bottom outside, bottom inside and move every 30 seconds when the motor stops for a second or so to notify you it is time to switch.&lt;br /&gt;I think you will discover that even though it has 4 speeds, you will settle on one o the speeds and just leave it there.  I also love the travel box that is included.  We went on a week long vacation and it worked perfectly all week with 2 of the 3 bars of charge still lit.</li>
            <li> So I had a bad experience about 8 years ago with an electric toothbrush and haven&#x27;t used one since. I had been using regular toothbrushes. Then my friend told me to try it again he said that it was awesome. So that night I bought it. I first used and wow, I should have used this right when it came out. It was an amazing feeling. It felt like you just came out of the dentist with a teeth cleaning. It comes with only one head, I wished it came with a replacement. I used the carrying case and it works really well and protects it well when on trips. The battery lasts for a very long time. I used it for about 5 days without charging and it still worked with no problem. So there was no worry about having to bring the charger. Don&#x27;t ever use a manual toothbrush it doesn&#x27;t or will ever clean as well as this thing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Oral B toothbrush.  Good battery life and works great</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this - according to the reviews the charge is only supposed to last a week - still going after weeks - talk about under promise and over deliver! My 3rd Oral B brush and the best yet. The charger on the first one gave out - probably because it was left on charge all the time. The second was the battery declining - still going though!</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush has done an excellent job for what I need. Keeps me from brushing too hard and still getting my teeth cleaner than I am able to with a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B finally died, so I decided to get a new one. Much better than my older model! Makes my teeth sparkle!</li>
            <li> This idiotic device is designed to stop for a moment every 30 seconds.  That drives me crazy, and you can&#x27;t turn that feature off.  Never again! I eventually stopped using it and now only take it with me when I travel. Maybe, if I&#x27;m lucky, I&#x27;ll forget it in a hotel bathroom.</li>
            <li> Great job at brushing teeth. I cannot believe how much cleaner my teeth feel than when I was using a hand brush. Should have invested in this looooong ago. It is a worthwhile investment. If you spend the money on this now, it will help prevent cavities - which cost money... so spend the money now in preventing them.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush on the market IMO. This is my 3rd one over the last 10 years (fam of 4 uses it). My dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> A tremendous cleaning and easy travel case so I can take it with my on trips 10 days or less.  Why compromise on dental hygiene on the road.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was exactly what I wanted.  I had tired the one that comes with the little clock which is the next model up.  There is really no need for the extra clock thing.  It was a little pricey, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I was especially pleased when I took it on a 10 day vacation and the battery lasted the whole time.  I suspect that a few years down the road that won&#x27;t exactly be the case, but that is to be expected.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> great tooth brush.  battery seems to last just fine even on week long vacations.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have been using the Oral-B toothbrush for years. We love the clean, fresh feeling that we can get from an electric toothbrush. No manual toothbrush cleans as well as this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, we do not love the small toothbrush heads.  They are small &amp; apparently are \\&quot;dentist inspired\\&quot; to get a tooth-by-tooth cleaning. I hate how I have to move the brush so much because the brush is so small. We usually buy the brushes that have the small rotating top with a stationary bottom (like these: [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral B Professional Clean Replacement Brush]] We like the bigger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist gave me some specific locations in my mouth that needed extra brushing. After using this brush for 6 months &amp; returning for my next cleaning, I was given a thumbs up for my brushing! This toothbrush really does clean like a professional.</li>
            <li> The darned thing just died, so writing a good review is not possible.  I think it was an okay electric toothbrush while it lasted, but that was only 2 years and I didn&#x27;t even use it every day.</li>
            <li> Wow. I used to use a cheap $30 electric tooth brush, and wondered whether paying $90 would be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was. Brushing is more fun now. It also helps that it signals when 2 minutes are up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did remove one star because you can&#x27;t use it in countries that are 220V. It&#x27;s not a good travel toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Way better than the other major brand.  Battery lasts longer and gets my teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as promised. Great action. My mouth feels clean and energized after brushing. I use Plaxx pre rinse first, then brush. Very effective.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many year.  This was a replacement brush, so I&#x27;m familiar with the brand.  The power and options of this model are great, but the shape is awful.  I am a woman, and take a medium size glove, so I may not have the largest hands, but I am certainly average for the targeted audience of this product.  The major design problem is that the bottom of the handle is much, much wider than the top, and the bottom is also the heaviest part of the handle.  While brushing, you end up sliding upwards causing a terrible imbalance in weight (feels like brushing with the small end of a baseball bat, while the heaving end hangs out there).  Not sure the resultant banging of brush against your teeth is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--You feel like your teeth are getting very clean&lt;br /&gt;--Easier than older models to get to the very back teeth&lt;br /&gt;--Doesn&#x27;t give me chills like the Phillips sonic model does&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--Still has a bit of the chill-inducing vibration of the Phillips&lt;br /&gt;--If your mouth is crowded, it&#x27;s still tough to fully clean your back teeth (but much easier than older models)</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has a timer to gauge my brushing each section.</li>
            <li> Have been using my new toothbrush and Surprising Good cleaning toothbrush.  My teeth feels cleaner after use.  The only concern is the handle which seems large and making it difficult to carry or use for traveling.</li>
            <li> It appeared to be as advertised. It was a gift for others and they seem to like it so far</li>
            <li> I used an electric toothbrush some years ago and loved it.  Saw this one and decided to give it a go, but it felt like a truck in my mouth, clunky and awkward, not like the other had been.  It is probably effective, but i have gum issues and need gentle cleaning.</li>
            <li> Everyday use keeps coffee and tea stains at bay. Leaves a good clean feeling. I don&#x27;t really use the various modes. The default works just fine. I guess I don&#x27;t really need the bells and whistles. I probably should have got the 3000. It&#x27;s $20 less, the same pulse and oscillation speed but a slightly shorter battery life and 1 less mode.</li>
            <li> I returned this unit because it would not take a 100% charge. I have a 3000 that I have had for years and love it so I exchanged this one for the 5000.</li>
            <li> We bought two of these - one for us and one for my mom and her husband to share. My son has already lost the travel case, which I wasn&#x27;t too happy about, but I liked that it had room for a couple of heads and the brush. This is a quality toothbrush that is easy to use, easy to clean, and durable for everyday use by a five-member household. As the mom of three boys, I appreciate the timer that tells them when to switch sides and helps them stay on track with brushing for the recommended amount of time. I also appreciate that one brush base can be used by multiple people (there are four slots in the tray for four brush heads). My oldest son has braces and uses the next step-up model that was given to him by his orthodontist (other than the gadget-y little timer thing, I don&#x27;t see that it has any more features to warrant the extra cost). I also like that Amazon lets you choose frustration-free packaging on items such as these. Makes it a lot less irritating to open something! We also buy our replacement heads on here; I just wish Amazon would regularly have the orthodontics heads available!</li>
            <li> I am not tech savvy, so I was really impressed at the readability of the user manual and the elegant simplicity of product design. Has several different cleaning modes, a red light that alerts you if your brushing pressure is too strong, etc.  Gives a fresh-from-the-dentist polished feel every time.  Great travel case, and long battery charge. So happy with it!</li>
            <li> Had to replace my Triumph9000 after 5 years. This model is very much just like the older one.  i feel that it has more power.  The automatic sensitivity (pressure sensor) option works great when you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;so far very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i took off a star was that the charger is 110v only.  I travel a lot for extended periods so if the charger was 110/220 it would have been amazing.  now i have to buy a 220v charger for when i travel.  it is a shame because all the older model chargers are 110/220v</li>
            <li> unfortunately the battery dies after about a year. Even with careful use and only recharging it when it is close to empty, the battery is the major flaw in this design. We have switched to philips.</li>
            <li> Very nice electric brush that you can buy different heads for depending on what you need. I don&#x27;t use all of the modes on it, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option. The charge on it lasts quite a while as well</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush which has multiple features. The carrying case is very helpful. I personally do not use all the features therefore this electric toothbrush might have been a bit costlier than it needed to be for me, but it definitely works very well.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare for quite some time and decided to switch to Oral B after noticing how much whiter my teeth were after traveling and being away from the Sonicare (using a manual toothbrush). Now I do not have the yellow problem anymore and feel much better about how clean my teeth are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a timer built in and beeps every 30 seconds so you know exactly how long to brush for.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and my only regret is that I did not purchase sooner. My teeth feel like I just left the dentist after a cleaning. One attachment is included and I charged it overnight upon receipt. The cord is rather short so do not expect a 6 foot cord. I understand many newer bathrooms may have accommodations for this but my house is from the 60&#x27;s so this did present a problem. The book states this should last about 2 weeks on 1 charge so I just placed the charger in another room. Not really a big deal but thought I would share. Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Love the way it alerts if I am brushing too hard and that it&#x27;s programmed to brush each section of your mouth. My mouth feels super clean!! Extra brushes are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> This is really a great product. It will surprise you at what a vigorous brushing it delivers. You can brush twice a day and recharge it at only once a week or less. A little expensive, but it really delivers.</li>
            <li> Have just used it once. Have been using Oral-B electric brushes for many years. This one is good as usual, but, maybe it&#x27;s just temporary, my gum was hurt a bit the 1st time I used this one. let&#x27;s see...</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace the one-level-up Model 5000, which arrived with its digital readout unit DOA. I have the impression that this may be functionally the same (or equivalent) brush, simply without the digital readout. While the 5000 came with two different types of brushes, the 4000 comes with just one, though the base units are identical, allowing for storage of up to four brushes. Both the 4000 and the 5000 leave teeth feeling as clean as any professional cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had, and both display a red  light when I brush too hard -- a feature I value greatly.</li>
            <li> I had the previous generation 4000 series and liked it a lot, but the battery was starting to lose it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge. The battery capacity on the new model is a HUGE improvement. They advertise it as 10 days worth of usage and I can confirm that it will last that long. The trade off for this is an extremely long charging time; about 3 days to fully charge.</li>
            <li> It is a Good product, exactly what I expected. I got nothing else to say but this requires 14 words blah blah blah lol</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, noisy, and after about 40 days it quit recharging and then flatlined.&lt;br /&gt;In order to return it under the &amp;#34;60 day challenge&amp;#34; I had to listen to about 10 minutes of Oral B ads.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in the device, the quality and the service.</li>
            <li> As advertized.  And THE best deal, at the time.  I think these were $66 ea.  Could not get any for near this price, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Boys are impressed at what Santa brought them.</li>
            <li> I had an oral b toothbrush before I bought this one, which I liked, but this one is better.  It has a &amp;#34;zone&amp;#34; alarm that goes off every 30 seconds, in the normal brushing mode, to let you know it&#x27;s time to brush in a different quadrant.  It helps keep your brushing &amp;#34;equal&amp;#34;.  And the battery lasts a long time, making it easy to bring on a trip without the charger.  Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> this was a christmas gift and my son loves it it work good and it looks good too. speicallly the case to travel with</li>
            <li> It tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  Tells you to move onto a different area.  It&#x27;s like a dentist is with you!  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it. I agree with an earlier comment about the internal timer. I don&#x27;t necessarily need the reminder to switch areas brushed but probably nice for kids.</li>
            <li> I returned the toothbrush.  I did not care for it at all.  I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt when I brushed and by the time I was finished brushing, the entire handle was running with saliva.</li>
            <li> At this price  the vibration seems a  little excessive,  ergonomics could be better  and they  could&#x27;ve thrown in a  second  brush head.  Yet this  toothbrush does an excellent job  cleaning your teeth.  My mouth feels fresh  and clean every  time.</li>
            <li> I credit the electric toothbrush with being the being the biggest reason my gums no longer bleed. Add flossing into the mix. I only have this for a short time so far. Upgraded when the old one gave out. This one seems like it will do a much better job. And when these batteries give out, they are user-replaceable. The older model had the soldered in.</li>
            <li> Have been using several generations of Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This model is the best so far. It is extremely powerful, gets into every nook and cranny and has a long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Digital display of remaining battery life is also very useful. Charger is also much smaller than on previous models and therefore handy for travel.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on different electric tooth brushes I ordered and received the Oral-B 4000 a few days ago. The package had all the contents advertised in he Amazon description, however the handle does say &amp;#34;Triumph Professional Care&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothbrush with power to give a really good cleaning.  This one fits the bill and actually has three different settings.  It also keeps the charge for at least 10 days, making it ideal for travel.  Comes with a nice travel case, too.</li>
            <li> It did not last very long only about  a year.  Bought another one but a different Brand</li>
            <li> Great product, like it so much more than the Sonacare.  The Pro white head really makes my teeth fells like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. I purchased it in Bestbuy through price match at the Amazon Price. It was easy to set up and even though the charging light didn&#x27;t come on right away but took 10 minutes to show up as mentioned in the directions. The first charge takes sometime but the toothbrush runs for almost a week and a half. It has a pressure sensor based light that will flash if you&#x27;re brushing too hard that&#x27;s on the back of the toothbrush so you can see it in the bathroom mirror. The carrying case is really nice. My box contained only one head, a brush, dock, and covered case for spare heads. Its awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush and found you can get replacement heads at target for this at a discount. Great results!</li>
            <li> This is the product I have been looking for.  It is not too large and is very easy to use.  I use it once a day and am very happy with the Oral-B toothbrush.  I recommend this for anyone looking for a quality rechargable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I waited until the battery on my old Oral-B died. Should have bought a new one sooner. The difference is astounding.</li>
            <li> I GAVE THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT AND HAVE NOT HEARD IT MYSELF SO I CAN ONLY SAY IT WAS NOT RETURNED.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I had to replace my old Oral-B unit with a new one.  They keep making changes to products that are already so good and I find that each time, as in this case, the emphasis is on style and making things even more sleek.  I find the new unit not as comfortable and lacking in some minor details.</li>
            <li> Is that this toothbrush does a very good job at cleaning my teeth and making my whole mouth feel clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old toothbrush was a [[ASIN:B007HPJGU6 Philips Sonicare Elite Limited Edition Toothbrush Includes 2 Handles, 3 Brush Heads and 2 Charger Packs]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare charges faster and lasts longer on a single charge than the Oral-B does. I was really surprised at how long it takes to charge and, subsequently, how fast the battery drained on the Oral-B. With the Sonicare, I got 2 handles and 3 brush heads, as well as the carrying case. The Oral_B includes only 1 handle, 1 brush head, and 1 carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While both are electric toothbrushes, they work very differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the way either one of them gets the job done, you just have to remember not to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; your teeth with these - let the toothbrush do the work like it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my honest opinion, the Sonicare is the better value and the better toothbrush between the two (Oral-B and Sonicare).</li>
            <li> Been using Oral-B/Braun electric brushes for many years. This one does the best job ever. The new style brushes actually do a better job. Tested old/new brushes with old/new brush-heads Just wish there was a setting where it lets you know that the two minutes are up instead of every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Using this toothbrush will make you swear that you just visited the dentist for a professional cleaning.  After charging the Oral-B Precision 4000 overnight it was ready to attack the plaque on my teeth.  The first thing I liked about the toothbrush is how light it is and how well it fit in my hand.  The grip on the handle was very comfortable.  I placed a small amount of toothpaste on the tip of the brush as the directions stated and then began brushing.  The toothbrush has a built in timer that times how long you should brush each quadrant of your mouth.  The timer system logically breaks your mouth into four areas, upper left and right, as well as lower left and right.  The timer beeps when it is time to change to the next area in your mouth.  There is also a pressure alarm that lets you know if you are pressing too hard.  The toothbrush has four modes that allow you to choose from normal, light, deep clean, and polish.  I have been using the brush for several weeks and have noticed very little tooth sensitivity as a result.  Some electric toothbrushes cause extreme tooth sensitivity, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  I highly recommend the Oral-B Precision 4000 for your next electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this tooth brush after seeing it recently when I was at a dental cleaning appointment.  My hygenist highly recommended this particular toothbrush for my specific needs.  I received the new toothbrush a week after my cleaning, and started using it after the 24hour charging time.  My teeth still feel like I just came from having them cleaned--it&#x27;s fabulous!!  I agree with other reviewers, it is a bit noisy (compared to my sonicare) but I am having much better results with this electric toothbrush vs. manual or my old sonicare.  Others have commented on the small head size of the toothbrush, I find it to be perfect for reaching around back teeth etc where a larger tooth brush would not have been able to clean as well.  Overall I am very satisfied and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> brushing my teeth is never the highlight of my day. i&#x27;m just waking up or already tired and ready for bed. it&#x27;s low on the list of ways to spend my time. this makes is a lot easier to get in the required amount of time and know when you can stop.</li>
            <li> This power tooth brush is incredible. It is much more than I expected. My Dentist recommended it. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a competitors brand for over ten years.  recently had problem with odor in the base on my old one and again on the new one I bought.  after several months decided to switch to oral b.  absolutely love it.  I feel it does a better job cleaning your teeth, plus the unit is easy to clean after each brushing.  wish I had changed years ago.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an Oral-B although I have been using Sonicare products for more than 20 years.  Now, I greatly prefer the cleaning action with this toothbrush.  My teeth actually feel cleaner when I&#x27;m finished.  Some reviewers complained this brush was too harsh, but I think the opposite is true.  Since I have diabetes, this brush does more to stimulate blood circulation in my gumline as well.  Give this an A+ recommendation.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my teeth felt polished like when you leave the dentist office!! I also love the 30 mins intervals so that you know when to switch to another quadrant</li>
            <li> I have used a sonicare for 10 + years, thought I would try something different. I ended up returning this because it is so much louder than a sonicare and the timer would not work correctly. I ordered a sonicare healthy white, which replaces a sonicare essence that was still working but so old the handle was getting yellow. I love the sonicare and don&#x27;t like the oral-B. I prefer the vibrating over the rotating bristles</li>
            <li> Absolute best toothbrush! I have sensitive teeth and gums and this is the only sonic/vibrating brush that did not hurt my teeth. It has a lower sensitive setting. Love this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a lightening deal. I didn&#x27;t care for the complete stop the brush did every 30 seconds. The handle is large so it was hard to reach the tight spots in the back.</li>
            <li> This is a whole lot better than the replacement Braun That it replaced. Seems to do a great job and would recomened it to anyong</li>
            <li> leaves my teeth feeling fresh, feeling clean and sooooo much better than a regular toothbrush. I actually look forward to btrushing.</li>
            <li> We had an older model Oral-B then called a Braun.  There are tremendous improvements.  Much faster spin cycles, longer battery life, slimmer design.  When done brushing, the teeth feel like they do after the dentist finishes polishing.  The best part is that is has a timer which times for each quadrant and you don&#x27;t have to mentally count to get an even brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very fine product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and been able to keep a very serious orthodontic problem under control. I always carry it around with me.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush. I will not ever have any other. I have told my friends and family about it.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for parents. Works good. Only complaint they mentioned is battery life doesn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a sonic care and can go two weeks easy w/o charge even after a year. Theirs a couple days and less than a year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself performs well. Just the battery life is the issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive than Sonicare but worth it!  I owned a Sonicare and struggled with it recharging properly.  It did an OK job on my teeth.  After I made the switch to Oral-B, I was pleasantly surprised.  No more recharging headaches and the units circular motion really cleaned my teeth and gums. Oral-B as is 100% better!</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush i used ever and I wood but again too wood tell people too buy it too it keep teeth clean</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B for years and love it. You could never clean your teeth as well manually. My only wish was something to transport it in when I travel. Wrapping it in a zip lock bag was my best choice. It was time to replace and was pleased to find this toothbrush with the hard plastic travel case. Bravo Oral-B.</li>
            <li> very good i love it great price and one of the best oral-b i love it .i love it i love it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush adequately cleans my teeth; however, I don&#x27;t feel it is as good as my first Oral-B 3-D Excel from 15 years ago.  The handle on this toothbrush is way too thick which sometimes makes it awkward to maneuver and it stops periodically to let one know it&#x27;s time to move to the next quadrant.  That is way too annoying.  I know how and when I should continue or move on.  And the battery does not last as long as my first toothbrush which started out maintaining the charge for at least 10 days.  This one holds a charge for about five days. I only purchased a new one because my old one no longer held a charge.  Sigh.</li>
            <li> The time alarm feature is a good way to make sure that you are doing diligence with all of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Excellent electric toothbrush. I like it. It&#x27;s very easy to use and accurate. Different modes of use helps improve brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for years. Bought this one for my husband. We both love them. My battery is starting to have issues after, I&#x27;m guessing, 6 years. I would definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It&#x27;s a little more powerful than my last electric toothbrush (a much older Oral-B model), but not so powerful that it&#x27;s irritating. I love the travel case, and it also has a storage tray for extra brush heads if more than one person uses it. The tray can also be removed from the charging base if you don&#x27;t want the bulk on your counter.  It has a timer so that the brush pauses briefly every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch teeth quadrants. I don&#x27;t typically brush my teeth in quadrants, but it&#x27;s nice to know how much time has passed so I make sure I&#x27;m hitting all areas equally. Sounds crazy, but a dentist once told me that he know that I was left-handed since the teeth on my left side were not as clean (it&#x27;s harder to brush on the same side as the hand you&#x27;re using so you tend to not brush as long on that side).  A variety of brush heads are compatible with the handle, so if you don&#x27;t like the Prowhite Precision head, you can replace it with another.  I definitely recommend this toothbrush and this brand!</li>
            <li> This is a great improvement over previous versions. It is also much better than the Phillips Sonic which it replaced, teeth feel sparklingly clean. I love the various programs and the red warning light that comes on if you press too hard. I have an old Oral - B which I leave in another bathroom so I have options if the master bathroom is in use. Will probably upgrade that to the new version.</li>
            <li> This works great!  I love the different settings and it holds a charge like none other I have used.  It arrived early too.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I find it to be very satisfactory and would recommend it to all. Auto pause encourages proper usage. Variable speed an excellent feature.</li>
            <li> After using a battery operated Oral B toothbrush I,decided on the rechargeable Precision 4000 model.  Reviewed both the 7000, and 5000 model and settled with this one since I don&#x27;t need a separate timer that both the 5000/7000 have, which saved a few bucks in doing so.  The toothbrush works very well, and my teeth feels cleaner over the battery operated, which might be just in my head.  The battery powered Oral B was good for the years I&#x27;ve had one, but this rechargeable felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the battery. If you want to replace one later on, its not a one step process, and would need a few extra tools to replace the included battery, so for most, you will after a few years have to discard it, and buy another toothbrush.  Over all, I am pleased with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Tried it out now for a week, and the battery life is going strong.  That is with brushing at least twice a day and 3 times per day once during the first week of use.  I let it charge the first time for about 24 hours as directed on the manual. Thus far I am pleased with this model.&lt;br /&gt;Again, no need to buy the more expensive 5000/7000 series just for the separate timer that comes with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Its now 15 months old, and still going strong.  Very happy with the product thus far.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best toothbrush. I have been using my old ORAL&lt;br /&gt;B from back in the day and boy I now know what I have been missing!</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B power toothbrush.  The battery in the first one finally gave out so I got this one.  It works fine but the handle is bigger and harder to hang onto than the last one.  The button to choose a different type of brushing is also on the handle and is easily pushed just when brushing in regular mode.  Overall, my biggest complaint is the large handle - it is hard to grip when your hands aren&#x27;t very big.</li>
            <li> I love Oral-B toothbrushes and this is no exception.  However, I don&#x27;t use any of the extra benefits this toothbrush offers over its 3000 version.  The only useful extra to me is the prolonged battery life (10 days vs. 7 days).  There are 4 brush &amp;#34;settings&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t see how they are so different, other than the speeds.  There is a normal 2 minute setting, a prolonged setting that has 45 seconds per side instead of 30, and two other settings that don&#x27;t seem very different from each other.  I really like the carrying case however.  It is a tad big and bulky but it&#x27;s nice to have the toothbrush protected during travels.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re really happy with the toothbrush. The problem is, and I reported it to the company, that even if you dry the brush before you put it back in the little holder, it gets gunky inside for lack of a better term.I just snapped the toothbrush and the charger right out of that unit and through the brush holder away. The company apparently didn&#x27;t understand what I was trying to tell them.</li>
            <li> i like this one ! my teech become quite quite clean !the only disavantage that you cant use the charger world widely !</li>
            <li> Second to a professional dental visit!  My dental hygienist even noticed my teeth were less stained when visiting her for my bi-annual teeth cleaning.  Making her job a bit easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she is big on onions and this lil bad boy cleans it all up.</li>
            <li> I just received this toothbrush.  Unfortunately, the pressure sensor keeps lighting up, even when the brush is not being touched. This causes the unit to go into sensitive brush mode which is very weak.  I called Braun and they want me to send the unit in to be repaired. Most companies would just send out a new unit and have me send the defective one back. I would just return it, but I used the UPC label to get a rebate.  I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as an Xmas gift. The actual unit came in a plain brown box, not the retail box you see in the store. Gave it the impression of a factory refurb. No instructions or info about the product included. Apparently it has no warrantly. Very tacky for a gift. No packing slip in the box either. Reminds me of the cheap stuff you find on ebay.</li>
            <li> Nice design. Cleans well. Lots of modes to choose from. Takes very long to charge though. Overall a great buy at the price i bought during BF</li>
            <li> Quality fabric, true to size and color.  Really nice jacket! I gave it as a gift and he really liked it.</li>
            <li> Really what I expected it to be. Would buy this again if need.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone who wants a cleaner and healthier looking teeth</li>
            <li> Wow, I bought 4 of these for my whole family this Christmas. We all love these and am very happy with his product. Would recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably me but I don&#x27;t like using it.  The brush piece is too short and if it were longer I think it would&lt;br /&gt;be more comfortable for me.  Poor purchase on my part.</li>
            <li> Subject line says it all.  The advertised battery performance is not true.  Maybe I got a dud and need to look into returning it.  However, I have followed the instructions exactly and I can get maybe three days of brushing without needing to charge.  I believe it adversities ten days of brushing twice a day.  It also takes about 36 hours for it to fully charge (indicated when the batter LED’s stop flashing).  I was expecting a full charge overnight.  I’m disappointed with that part of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does do a good job cleaning teeth and the small charging stand is easy to travel with.  Oral-B seems to have the best reviews out there as compared to the Sonicare.  I had a Sonicare for 7 years and it was great.  But apparently the new Sonicare brushes are awful and break every year or so (or so the reviews consistently say).  Time will tell for this Oral-B brush.  Hopefully my research will pay off in the long run.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if others have had this problem, but when I place my toothbrush on the counter, it leaves a film of a toothpaste/water mix where the base of the brush touches the counter.  I could wipe the toothbrush down after every use, but that&#x27;s a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself works very well; the only negative about its performance is that it is quite loud (much louder than my previous Sonicare electric toothbrush).</li>
            <li> This thing cleans your yap like no other. I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now with this. Great price when compared to buying retail. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I felt like my brain was getting vibrated out of my head, but now that I&#x27;m used to it I like it and can definitely tell a difference between using it and our old electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> not sure how this is different from my previous oral-B but man it works great, my teeth feel so clean after brushing and i really like the pressure indicator that lights up red if you press too hard. great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product is a significant improvement over the regular toothbrushes, let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is light.&lt;br /&gt;2. The charging method (where the plug meets the stand) is a completely sealed electrical system, i.e. no water can get in.&lt;br /&gt;3. It &amp;#34;tells&amp;#34; you when you are brushing too hard&lt;br /&gt;4. Its value is well worth the money, both long and short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Out of the box, it took a full day and a half to reach full charge (which I didn&#x27;t really mind to be honest).&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had 1 or 2 cordless toothbrushes before, but this one takes the cake. My dentist has told me that I brush way too hard, which was why my gums were beginning to receed and cause other problems. This toothbrush not only stops when you press too hard, it lights up red and sends a little beeping sound as well - I find this to be a cool feature for both sight and hearing impaired. Though it took some time and thorough research before I decided on this pricey purchase, I&#x27;m glad I did it and my teeth are much better for it. In response to other reviews about vibration - yes it does vibrate a little more than other cordless toothbrushes I have owned - however I quickly got accustomed to it to the point that I no longer notoice it. It easily reaches all those hard to reach areas within my mouth and effectively removes plaque due to its design. After using this product for a month, all plaque has been removed, and there are no signs of it returning. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Over Christmas my mother-in-law gave me this toothbrush. She said that you will never have to buy another toothbrush again. Very skeptical I brought the toothbrush home and tried it out. I have extremely good hygiene habits and even the right toothbrush. But even with this I would still get a little pink no matter what I did. The first time that I used this the pink was not pink, It was RED! I rinsed my mouth with mouthwash and called a friend who is a dental hygienist. I was so upset. She told me that it was because the toothbrush was actually getting under the gum line and was properly cleaning my whole mouth. She told me that I needed to keep up using the toothbrush and to continue to use the mouthwash as it was killing the germs that the other toothbrushes were leaving behind. I took her advice and did what she had said. At the end of 2 weeks there was no red, not even pink! I love this toothbrush. I will not be using any other kind of toothbrush ever again.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  The pressure indicator is very helpful and the timer makes sure every side gets brushed evenly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this than the regular tooth brash!!! I used it 3x a day and battery life is almost a week!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this toothbrush. I&#x27;ve owned and used the Oral-B triumph for many years.. when it died I ordered this one..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I received it and went overseas I realized it doesn&#x27;t support 220 voltage anymore.. (previous model did). I called Oral B and they said they no longer support 220 voltage on any products..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a shame, useless for anyone who travels a lot...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Sonicare toothbrushes but this Oral B does a good job.  My only complaint is that it is loud.</li>
            <li> Its my third machine no cavities in over 20 years....  My son is 15 and never had a cavity...  Well worth it...</li>
            <li> My wife was interested in a electric toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been using one for years, a similar older model Oral-B, so I got this model for her for Xmas.  She has been using it since then, and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> What a great product. This Pro-white brush does an excellent job in keeping your dental visit fresh. I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I got it for Oral B Professional healthy Clean + Precision 4000 Rechargeable tooth brush about two weeks ago, not use it yet, need to confirm that in Singapore need to convert the voltage ? Any one using in SIN can advise ? Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any the delivery very in time.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy but gets the job of brushing your teeth done right.  Also the price is right and cones with a travel case.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Works great leans up well.  I have also dropped it multiple times, and it keeps on ticking!</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is a great product. It works very well and is a great design. I was disappointed it only came with one toothbrush head and it was one for whitening, not designed for regular brushing at all. I had to go out an purchase those separately.</li>
            <li> This thing is 20 times better than brushing with a conventional tooth brush - my teeth are polished smooth after ever brushing!</li>
            <li> I like OralB products and this one is no different. The clean sensation is great after cleaning my teeth and the timing for each side is good. I&#x27;m buying a second one</li>
            <li> Very powerful.  Much better than my old Oral B which I had for 10 years.  Sure makes you teeth feel nice and clean</li>
            <li> I replaced by aging basic oral-b with the 4000. I received a great service life from the oral-b I was retiring of ~10 years and it was simply time to get a new toothbrush and I have not been disappointed. The additional features work well and are useful. The stand is actually also a useful and practical place to store the brush heads and they avoided updating the travel case which is and has been a great design. I recommend this brush and suggest that the additional cost of the 5000 isn&#x27;t worth it for the small difference in features - buy the 4000.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works perfect. After brushing with Oral-B professinal, teeth feels completly clean. I reccomend this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this toothbrush. I think I was so used to my old, slow electric toothbrush that I didn&#x27;t realize it was not doing a good job anymore.  This toothbrush is powerful and my teeth and gums feel thoroughly clean after using it. I thought I would not like the smaller brush head, but it provides better access to tight spaces. I like the 30 second pause to remind you to move on to the next quadrant. I purchased this right after my last dental cleaning about four months ago, and it has kept the inside of my bottom front teeth free from tartar, as if they were cleaned just last week. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This device is so easy and fun, I brush more often than I did with a manual brush. (3X a day vs 2X per day)&lt;br /&gt;And I think it does a better job than an old fashoned brush. (in less time)&lt;br /&gt;I must say this is my first electric brushing system. So, I can&#x27;t compare this to the other popular ones that use sonic.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and It make my smile brighter (I think).&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it&#x27;s very easy to clean also-bonus!</li>
            <li> my old Sonicare crapped out without warning, and after doing reviews, it appeared as many others were having similar issues.  I did not want to grab a replacement that had a planned obsolescence design (or so it would appear to me), so I opted to go with Oral-B as the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is a bit more vigorous, but I have become accustomed to it.  Ive been using it for over a year now, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Brought this because my previous Oral B brush died after more than 10 years! It got so bad that even though it was showing fully charged, there seemed no real power to it. It was as if were caressing, not brushing teeth and gums. So, time for another one and so far, I&#x27;m not disappointed. The power is there and all the brush heads I previously had fits. The other good thing is that it has a small footprint than the previous Triumph package I had. The brushing is vigorous, the way I like it and my mouth feels clean. We&#x27;ll see what happens when I visit the dentist later this week. The travel case is nice too although I don&#x27;t travel as much as I used to. Nice product and reasonable price. Shipping prompt as usual.</li>
            <li> I have owned an Oral B Rechargeable toothbrush before and have looked for another to replace it.  This one was the a good choice.  It has power and keeps a good charge.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B finally died after 10 years.  I couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted in the stores ... and I had some gift cards for Amazon from Christmas; so, badda bing, I ordered this.  I love it.  It tells you when the time is up for each zone in your mouth and is gentle, yet firm for brushing.  I now take off the brush to let the unit air dry overnight so it, too, lasts as long as my original one. This one is a winner.</li>
            <li> Good quality and has been working great.  I removed the tray on the bottom to save bathroom counter space.  Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Oral-B to replace a long used member of the same brand.  My old one served me well and had just reached the point where the charge would not hold and the brush stopped in the middle of use.  I could not complain since I had this one for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new brush is, &amp;#34;hands on&amp;#34; a great improvement over my original one.  It is neat, easy to clean and holds a charge for at least 7 days!  I really enjoy the automatic pause that allows one to move to another section of the mouth and brush for the full amount of time suggested by dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only hope to have this product for a long time as I am really enjoying brushing my teeth with it!</li>
            <li> I had owned a sonic before I purchased this oral B this tooth brush is much better. I like the 3 different settings. I use the sensitive setting. It does a very good job of getting my teeth clean. I would recommend this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> button is too hard to find and push, it should be bigger... otherwise a five star product. Works gr8 on the teeth.</li>
            <li> Dad loved it for a Fathers Day present.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!  Cleans well and stays charged a long time.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than Sonicare.  I wish I had gotten the one with the LED screen because it gives you a smilie face when you&#x27;re done.  But, it still works fine.  And, again, cheaper than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Still don&#x27;t understand how i was living without it before :)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has literally prevented cavities in me. If you have soft teeth, there is no excuse for you not to invest in one. It leaves your teeth with that polished feeling that back in the 90&#x27;s only a trip to the dentist could offer. It also helps your gums stay healthy.</li>
            <li> I did so much research on the perfect toothbrush for my husband, and he loves this one, he has been using it for amost a year and this is the first time in years that the dentist said he was doing a good job and had no cavities.  The only thing he changed was his toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is good, just takes a little longer to changer it. like it, I hope it is useful after a couple of months</li>
            <li> only have it for short time. has been working great. like the timed alarm to change side of teeth to brush. red light appears when brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I like it doing brushing with it daily...&lt;br /&gt;makes me feel little bit advanced than my ancestors who used to brush with manual tooth brush....&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t feel like boring monday morning....&lt;br /&gt;and prepares me mentally for the subsequent mundane daily challenge, by solving them with technology...&lt;br /&gt;The biggest respite is to my salivary glands which has to now produce very little saliva for my tooth brushing needs,&lt;br /&gt;with electric brush the tooth brushing happens more effectively with very little saliva produced,&lt;br /&gt;unlike the manual tooth brush where our salivary glands has to produce large amount of saliva and lot of spitting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a manual brush and floss kind of girl but I&#x27;ve wanted to try an electric toothbrush for some time now and after much debate, decided on the Oral-B 4000 (with my amazon card rewards and coupon offer at the time of offer; I got this bad boy for an even $50).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel like this is a quality brush.  Mine only came with one head; the polishing brush with the cupped rubber center.  I like that the stand allows for multiple brush heads to be stored; a nice option if you&#x27;re sharing.  The only reason why I can&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t feel it gets my teeth any cleaner than a manual brush.  Maybe I&#x27;m not noticing a difference since I already have great teeth/gums?  While I also like the quadrant timer option; I feel like 30-seconds for each quadrant is too fast for me!  I know I can just ignore the pauses/beeps; but I feel like a Pavlov experiment, rushing to complete an entire quadrant before my toothbrush beats me to it  -- I feel like a WINNER when I beat my brush, but am I really winning? :D.  I&#x27;m also struggling a bit with keeping the splatter down to a minimum; but not a big deal, I half expected that to be part of the territory of using an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I general, I guess I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I&#x27;ll continue to use it until the unit dies but I&#x27;ll then go back to a manual.  If your oral health is already really good from just using a manual brush, then an electric toothbrush probably won&#x27;t take things to the next level and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush.  I think this could be a great tool however for those who need that little extra help; some teeth are probably harder to brush with a manual style brush or normal brush shaped head.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I like it. The size is good, both the handle and the brush itself. Some reviewers mentioned it seemed large for small mouths but I have not found that to be a problem.</li>
            <li> My dentist really likes it even though it&#x27;s boring to use.  It&#x27;s got a timer that encourages you to brush your teeth for a full two minutes while vibrating every 30 seconds to signal you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.  I still prefer a manual toothbrush, so I mainly use this one to make sure I get my back teeth clean, then finish up with a regular toothbrush.  It&#x27;s hard to make sure your back teeth and gums get adequate attention with just a manual toothbrush, so I think this is a good little machine to add to your brushing routine, not necessarily replace it.</li>
            <li> I would say I love it because it&#x27;s so much better than my 1000 model I used before (especially love the sensitivity function so you don&#x27;t push too hard on your teeth) but I&#x27;m a little freaked out that item delivered to me may not be new because when you buy this at the store, the toothbrush and all its parts are prepackaged in one hard plastic container. I&#x27;ve seen them for over $100 at the store so I bought it online for $65 but it was delivered in pieces! maybe its refurbished or something. have no idea. so gross that I don&#x27;t know how many people touched it or did what to it. Just didn&#x27;t seem new which is super gross since it&#x27;s a hygiene product for your mouth!</li>
            <li> After brushing with Oral-B professinal, teeth feels completly clean.  No brush cleans better than that.  I reccomend this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite electric toothbrush. It cleans better than any that I have had before and the timer system is perfect. It beeps and pauses at interval and if you have to shut it off it remembers your remaining time.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE. THIS PRODUCT I&#x27;D RECOMMEND TO&lt;br /&gt;FAMILY AND FRIENDS. TRULY THE PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WHOSE PERSONAL HYGIENES ARE&lt;br /&gt;VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.  I t performs as well as the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I first to use the product of Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br /&gt;My tootch change to clean and bright.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
            <li> i should have invested in this a long time ago, its just so much better than using the manual brush. trust me on this especially the teeth in the back.&lt;br /&gt;my only question is how long will it last&lt;br /&gt;i will keep you updated on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nanah</li>
            <li> I really like this little tooth brush. it does an excellent job of clianing your teeth, and it really feels good as well. I hve not had any problems with it as well.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I purchased this to replace a quickly dying Oral-B  Professional toothbrush.  I was afraid this one would be less of a machine, but it&#x27;s more.  The dying one only had two settings: on and off.  This one has multiple settings, my favorite being the feather setting which is slower than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement as my last one actually broke at the head attachment.  This one is great because it has a much more distinctive timer feature.  Works great.</li>
            <li> A very good replacement and improvement to my previously discontinued Oral B Triumph. Battery power is good too.  I do miss the smiling face that I brushed for 2 minutes.  Not worth the extra expense for the 5000 which has the smiling face on a separate screen.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I hoped it would be.  It cleans my teeth like no other electric I have ever used.  I travel often and this toothbrush really holds its charge for weeks.  Very convenient.  Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> Our original Oral-B was over 7 years old.....and still working...... We just decided to get a new one with all the new settings on it. We swear by this unit and recommend it to everyone out there who wants to maintain a healthy set of gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product, with lithium rechargeable battery. Nice design and works very nicely. I bought as a gift and was liked very much</li>
            <li> Love Oral B products.  Replaced my old electric tooth brush after many years.  This model is very nice, several settings and streamlined.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, get this!</li>
            <li> Much less noise than the old Braun 3D model.  Brushing action is very fast.  Easier to hold with a textured grip.  Part of the handle lights up red if you brush too hard, but it seems overly sensitive for the first 10 seconds or so of brushing.  Brush holder cover is open at both ends to help brushes dry, and opens for easy cleaning.  Battery charge indicators flash while charging, which can be annoying if you can see the brush from bedside.  Full charge from empty takes about 22 hours.</li>
            <li> I researched several sonic toothbrushes before deciding on the Oral-B and feel like I made a good choice. Teeth feel like they have just been polished at the dentist office. I like that there is a place to store several brush heads so everyone using the toothbrush has a place to keep their brushes. The timer is annoying to me, it pauses and beeps to indicate when to move to the next quadrant, maybe keeps me honest but it is annoying to pause. Arrived as estimated and displayed.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the soniccare but I&#x27;m happy with this one. Probably would have been satisfied with the 1000 model as I don&#x27;t use any of the additional modes on the 4000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and get the 1000.</li>
            <li> It does great for cleaning &amp; whiteing you teeth, my wife &amp; I love it. It makes your mouth feels really fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Love it. Took a little getting used to. Bigger brush head than my old oral b. really makes teeth feel clean!</li>
            <li> Never spent much time brushing.  About 30 seconds a day.  This unit asks you to brush each side, both upper and lower for 30 seconds for a total of 2 minutes.  To help you the  brush beeps every 30 seconds and has a slight pause.  I am expecting to see an improvement on my next visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush we purchased, we were a little skeptical of how much better it would be. Boy, were we wrong.  My teeth feel so much cleaner then ever before, basically like leaving a dentist office every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a self timer and several settings which are very nice to have.  Also, the head are replaceable and the stand comes with holders for 4 heads.  Very nice for a family.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and doing well.  The holders keep the brushes from bathrooms splash.  Heads come off easy and attach fast for sharing the motor with my wife.  Grip is big and square for better handling.</li>
            <li> I like how it has a built in warning light that lets you know if you are putting too much pressure on the gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It even flashes a red light when I am brushing too hard!</li>
            <li> Before buying I researched and found this brand and model to be rated the best and after using it I completely agree!</li>
            <li> We use it every day and it leaves our teeth feeling cleaner than regular hand-brushing. Have not had a problem with it- runs great after 2 years now. It&#x27;s great that we can use different heads for each family member.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, my latest in a long line, they last almost three years before they start to slow down so very good quality. I love it</li>
            <li> Rechargable on its base.  It also comes with a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;My old electric toothbrush, by the same manufacturer gave up the ghost after 10-12 years.&lt;br /&gt;This one comes with a nifty (but somewhat large) travel case, which holds the handle and a couple of brush heads.  Great idea.&lt;br /&gt;For travel, I had been using a smaller-handled unit, run by 2 AA cells.  You could get at least 60 brushes (i.e., 30 days if you brush morning &amp; night) on the 2 disposable batteries.  Surprisingly, the portable one did not come with a travel case!&lt;br /&gt;Annoyingly, the brush pauses for a half-second every 30 seconds or so, just in case you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve brushed long enough (really dumb feature, for which I dropped the unit one star).</li>
            <li> Above expectations. The build feels solid and I hope that it lasts me a few years. The different settings will give you many options to find the right match.</li>
            <li> I would love this toothbrush if it weren&#x27;t for one thing. It pauses every 30 seconds. There is nothing more annoying to me that working on a good brushing and having to wait as it stops then starts again several times during a brushing. I know some people like this feature. I have no problem with it but for some odd reason they didn&#x27;t build in the ability to deactivate it. Each time it pauses it pauses for longer than the time before. Leading to you having to stop and wait to begin brushing again for several seconds. I absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> This is the number one recommended powered toothbrush.  It is the first rechargeable I have had.  I am very impressed with the results I get with this product.  I highly recommend it!  It has a timer, pressure sensor, and variable settings.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> We have used Braun/Oral B electric toothbrushes pretty much since they first came out, but this is the best we&#x27;ve ever had, by far. We don&#x27;t really care about the zone timer, but the greater brush head speed than the model we had been using previously makes a noticeable difference. Using it feels like having just had a professional teeth cleaning. We&#x27;ve had great dental check-ups for many years; now we expect them to be even better.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush and love it.  Just like the dentist cleaning. Love the built in timer where every 30 seconds the toothbrush lets you know to move to another quadrant.</li>
            <li> When it worked, I enjoyed this, but after only 6 months, it no longer powers on or shows any lights.</li>
            <li> Fuction wise, I think this brush is way better than sonicare. If you are considering this brush, you are probably looking into sonicare as well. There are several problems with this brush though. Charger is not 220v compatible, which majority of the world uses. You can&#x27;t really travel with this brush. The battery is not replaceable. Although if you look online, there are tutorials to replace the battery but it requires soldering and you need to quite electronically handy to do that. I have 2 of these and only charge them when they are completely empty. These use NIMH batteries. They suffer from memory effect and limited around charges cycles.</li>
            <li> Still works great after 2 years of use. I buy the attachments on ebay for cheap</li>
            <li> Best electric toothbrush on the market, IMHO.</li>
            <li> Rather noisy, how does a very good job of cleaning teeth and massaging gums.  Would recommend, however, I felt it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> The purchased arrived in just three days and it was everything I had hoped for in a tooth brush. I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> My old one wore out after almost 10 years of faithful service.  Didn&#x27;t even look at other brands....just bought another of the one I had.  Outstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my old oral b tooth brush that was an older model of the new one for over a decade and it started making so much noise and skipping but the new one has much more power and is just a great product!  I would or should&#x27;ve given it five stars because I would definitely endorse this product!  I also want to add that Amazon saved me almost $50-$80 dollars because I was going to buy it at Walgreens or Walmart but a family member suggested I buy it through you so thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of years now and my dental check ups are quick and flawless.  This brush really keep the tarter away.  Super tooth brush and it can&#x27;t be beat!  A+++</li>
            <li> I have previously used a Sonicare system ages ago and those cheapie battery-powered Crest Spinbrushes. This system seems to do a much better job at cleaning than those. The flip side is that it is incredibly noisy. My husband complains about it every night when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed (he isn&#x27;t around for my morning brushing). So buyer beware- this brush works very well but it is LOUD!</li>
            <li> I havee tried a couple of other electric toothbrushes in my life. Finally I have found one that seems to work better in every way than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. The Oral-B 4000 is easy to use and the toothbrushes spin in a circle giving me a better cleaning of my teeth. It does an excellent job massaging my gums and cleaning my teeth and, unlike some electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used, I don&#x27;t like the toothbrush is going to vibrate out of my hands while I\\&quot;m brushing my teeth. The one thing I do not know is now long the brushes will last before having to buy new replacement brushes, but that is a minor issue as this is a really quality product that does the job better than a couple of other electric toothbrushes that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Oral B 4000 for 24 hours.  The charging lights are still blinking.  Surely this thing doesn&#x27;t need to recharge for so long.  Right?</li>
            <li> I owned the Oral-B Vitality electric toothbrush before -- which appears to now also be sold under the name &#x27;Precision 1000.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is a big improvement over the Vitality/Precision 1000 -- of course, it&#x27;s also a lot more expensive.  You DO get what you pay for, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the cheaper model to be VERY strong in the vibration, but certainly no better at cleaning.  This model, the 4000, seems to do a much better job of cleaning your teeth, but without the head-jarring strong vibration of the cheaper model.  It is much more comfortable to use and way quieter.  With the cheaper model, I couldn&#x27;t hear the television, with this one I can.  With the cheaper model, when I looked around, things would be blurry due to the amount of vibration in your head -- with this one that doesn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, this model feels better built, solid, a bit heavier (in a good way), and has a nice ergonomic grip.  It has a similar stand/charger to the older models (so you could use the old charger if for any reason you needed to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one also comes with a travel case, which is nice if you take your electric toothbrush on vacation (I don&#x27;t).  This model also has a base unit that you can snap on (I don&#x27;t because I live alone) that holds 4 additional brush heads, which is nice if more than one of you use the toothbrush.  The base unit that stores the extra brush heads has a hinged cover, so if you&#x27;re a germaphobe, you don&#x27;t have to worry about any bathroom stuff in the air landing on your brush head!  (Of course, the head on the brush is fair game...)  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so I can&#x27;t believe I am saying this, but if I were you, I&#x27;d spend the extra money and get the Precision 4000 instead of the 1000 (or another similar $50 brush).  You really do get what you pay for, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li> I used Sonicare Essence for several years before switching to Oral-B.  I like Oral-B netter and think it provides better cleaning than Sonicare.  I also prefer the design of Oral-B because Sonicare Essence tended to gunk up if I did not disassemble it and washed its insides after every brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preferred Oral-B brush head is Dual Action, but smaller heads provide very good cleaning and are easy to maneuver in the mouth.  The brush and replacement heads are a bit pricey, but occasionally Amazon has good deals and coupons for brush heads.</li>
            <li> Feels a little weird to start with, but once I got used to it, I liked this quite a bit. I&#x27;m still not 100 percent sold on trusting a vibrating brush instead of my own effort, but I&#x27;m warming up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several brush selections are available to choose from, and I use the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; setting and usually the regular brushing head, with the flossers. The brushing cycle is two minutes, and gives you a red light if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deep-cleaning setting I haven&#x27;t really used, but I have used the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; setting. It&#x27;s a lighter feeling on the teeth, and avoids some of the irritation that sensitive teeth might feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a pause button, but it will remember where you are in its brushing cycle if you need to turn it off for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should brush your teeth before you get dressed! Before you get used to it, there&#x27;s a little bit of spatter, and it&#x27;s not something you can casually stroll around while you&#x27;re using. Just be careful, but it does take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a checkup since I&#x27;ve started using this, and while I won&#x27;t give it all the credit, the dentist said my gums and mouth looked great.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this for a while before I reviewed it &amp; I can honestly say that it is a very good electric toothbrush. The battery stays charged for quite a while &amp; it&#x27;s quite powerful. I&#x27;m very happy with its performance &amp; would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My dentist (bless his pointed head) tried to sell me the (same) tooth brush for $250.  Are you kidding?  No brush is worth $250.  But this brush is definately worth what I paid here on Amazon. My teeth are invigorated every morning and evening.  Does and proforms exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Pluses:  Feel of brush in the hand, stain removal, indicator lights for battery level&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:  Controls for Brushing Modes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a replacement for an earlier Oral-B model I had used for several years.  I like the design and the feel of the brush in my hand, and after using for only about a week in the Deep Clean mode I have noticed big, positive changes in removal of stains on my teeth.  However, you can only change the mode when the toothbrush is on, and this is awkward to do since the brush head has to be in your mouth to prevent splattering of the toothpaste.  Doing so in this position is difficult.  As a work-around, since the toothbrush maintains the setting for 30 seconds after it is turned off, I turn it on and then immediately turn off.  I then hurry to put the toothpaste on the brush so I can insert it in my mouth and turn on before the 30 seconds expires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this brush has four modes (regular, deep cleaning, sensitive and whitening), and it is thicker than the previous model so feels better in my hand.  I also like that it uses the same brush heads as my previous model since I already had a supply of them.  My old charger burned out when I tried to use it with a transformer in a former country, so I&#x27;m also happy that the new charger will also charge my older brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read the information about the Pressure Sensor as the brush will automatically change to the sensitive mode if it detects you are applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Oral-B 4000. My teeth feel cleaner and are noticeably whiter than with my former Sonic toothbrush. It has a red light that indicates that you are using too much pressure, which is good if you have problems with gum recession from hard brushing.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 in 2006.  I used it up until recently, when I switched to this 4000 model.  Honestly there was nothing wrong with the 9400.  Despite being 6 years old, it was still faithfully working every day with out issues.  My only issue was that the charge was starting to fluctuate if taken on trips or something where it would spend day or two off the charger.  This is no big deal, especially considering how much life this battery continued to have for so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushing from the Oral-B professional electric toothbrushes continue to amaze me.  If you are looking for a better white color to your teeth, then try this.  Take this system paired with a pro white head &amp; whitening tooth paste; it gets amazing results.  There also other heads for flossing features, sensitive gums, etc.  Each brush head they make addresses different issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally after using this system, I could not imagine returning to a standard tooth brush.  I&#x27;ve tried on occasion when I was unable to take this or the previous 9400 system with me - it was frustrating.  Once you get used to the clean teeth feeling you get from this brush, standard toothbrushes seem to fall very flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone serious about day to day cleaning of their teeth will definitely get step up in the cleaning of hard to reach areas &amp; overall whitening.</li>
            <li> While I like the rotating bristles, I find the functions more difficult to operate and it&#x27;s also messier that the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Only replaced my old Oral B electric because it fell into a messy situation that could not be cleaned properly without extreme measures. Really glad this happened.  I love the clean, clean feeling of this rechargeable. Nice and compact, especially for one person.  Holder for multiple brushes look a little flimsy. Travel holder is a hoot. Never thought to take my electric brush on vacation. Now, nice and easy. I think this is a major improvement over my old, now defunct model. . .</li>
            <li> I was so excited that all the extra features came with the brush such as the travel case and extra brush holder. This is a great electric toothbrush and the timing feature really helps!</li>
            <li> Very good action, teeth feel nearly professionally cleaned 6 weeks after my dental visit.  I do not use any of the optional settings, and I have only tried the brush head that came with it.  Charge lasts a long time, and the section for storing additional heads is optional, so without that the charger footprint is small.  It is somewhat noisy but is very effective.</li>
            <li> Great price on a rechargeable toothbrush.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Oral B</li>
            <li> A good replacement to my previous one except it has no LCD display screen on this model. The notification of when you reach the 30 or 45 seconds interval is not as smooth as my previous model as it stop completely instead of just pulsing the brush head and let you keep brushing instead of stop and wait it to complete it notification cycle.</li>
            <li> For this price, I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product. It makes me feel better to know that my teeth are getting a better clean than with conventional toothbrushes. I highly recommend buying one.</li>
            <li> We really like Oral-B and thanks to Costco we have pretty much a lifetime investment in brush heads!  Our old Professional 3000 finally stopped holding the charge so it was time for replacement.  I really liked the sensitive and whitening modes on this model and appreciate the beep every 30 seconds for timing.  Another handy indicator is battery life as our old brush had a habit of running out after my wife had used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the carry case</li>
            <li> I ordered the toothbrush and it came in a plain cardboard box. I needed, and wanted, it to be in the Oral-B box.&lt;br /&gt;Number 1 it was a gift and #2 I had a Rebate and could not send it in because there was no UPC code to cut out to send with the form.  I had a chat, on-line, with Sumar Jit regarding this matter and explained in full my problem.  He was very nice and got my replacement sent to me right away. I got it on 12/20/12 and it was the exact same cardboard box.  I had to go to the store and buy the Oral-B in the manufactures box to give it as a Christmas present....and am lucky I found it. A few days after Christmas I sent out an e-mail to my friends asking if anybody needed or wanted to buy the Amazon toothbrush and I sold it for cost.....no tax. So I had to buy more for the toothbrush plus lost out on the tax but I was greatful to have sold it and didn&#x27;t have to fool with trying to send it back again.  I was very disappointed with Amazon for doing this. Why was it in a cardboard box since I bought it as NEW?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy about using electrical toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We have had this electric toothbrush for over a year now.  It was a significant upgrade over our previous Braun electric toothbrush.  It has produced significantly better results as verified by my dental hygienist.  I recommend it without question.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I try this - I must admit I was a bit skeptic - but I truly enjoy it.  Makes my teeth feel just like I came from the dentist.  Helping to clear up the gingivitis  looking forward to my next dental visit. :0)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has helped us brush longer with the nice timer. We love it.  The brush heads are expensive though. I got mine on eBay from Canada.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from the Oral-B Vitality, and this is significantly better than the previous product.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans better and actually tells me when to switch quadrants. The battery life is very good, too, compared to the Vitality.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are definitely left feeling clean after using this. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel case is nice - holds the toothbrush and two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the charger is not universal. Very cheap decision on Oral-B&#x27;s part. It&#x27;s silly to have AC adapters that AREN&#x27;T universal nowadays.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that the package arrived without a brush head. So far, I haven&#x27;t received any replies on this matter after giving feedback.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an older unit that had heavy use and needed to be retired.&lt;br /&gt;I like oral-b products and will continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my college aged son for Christmas.  He needed something that would be fast and effecient.  This cleans his teeth better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great price on a great dental product.  My older Oral-B Triumph brush has lasted for years ; this one looks and operates&lt;br /&gt;every bit as good with updated feathures and should be a solid investment in great dental care.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B electric toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning teeth. But oh-my-goodness, it is so loud! I had been using an Oral-B Sonic complete that cleaned just as well and was so much quieter, but it&#x27;s no longer available. I&#x27;ve use other oscillating head brushes by Oral-B, but none made the loud buzzing noise (louder than the tone I use on my alarm clock) that&#x27;s quite bothersome in the early morning.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job of cleaning my teeth without being too harsh. Has an automatic shut off and warning light if you press too hard. My teeth feel clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works as great as advertised (as did the older 2 oral Bs I owned).  It has several settings, as advertised.  My favorite is the variable speed that gradually changes speed from slow to fast &amp; back to slow.  My dentist says the spinning heads are better at cleaning than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for writing this review is to warn about the Mail-in Rebate scam, which seems to be common among many manufacturers.  You buy a product expecting to get $15 back and they find some flimsy excuse not to give you the money.  I had JCPenney refuse to refund a mail-in rebate last year, then Quaker State oil last month, and now Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- In my case amazon advertised &amp;#34;$15 rebate&amp;#34; to buy this brush.  Which I did.  Oral-B then replied with &amp;#34;bought the wrong model&amp;#34; except of course I did NOT buy the wrong model; I bought what amazon advertised &amp; what was on the rebate form.  I think companies do this stuff on purpose to sucketrcustomers into buying product, but with the intent to deny the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably never buy another Oral-B product.&lt;br /&gt;And yes they deserve the 1 star review.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product, I filled-out the paperwork properly, and I should have a $15 refund in my hand.  No exceptions,  Stupid dishonest company.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used oral b electric toothbrush since mid 1990s?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve always bought the best available model, which happen to be the most expensive of the range too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the speed of the toothbrushes had increased (with each new design) in the past but became stagnant for the last few years by now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as much as i&#x27;m ready to say they brush well, i&#x27;ve to say the quality has not improve much over all these years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rechargeable battery is a problem, they cannot hold the charge long after some use, whether you give it your best care or not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every toothbrush i own, i always use until the battery runs out before i recharge them, regardless, the battery performance will deteriorate after a few months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another annoying fact is the noise, you would think that oral b &amp; braun would try to improve their technology and design to introduce quieter toothbrushes, no way, it just gets louder with each new oral b toothbrush i buy because the battery drains too quickly and became too inconvenient to use daily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my latest purchase is 4000 with the red light alert if user pressed too hard when brushing, this toothbrush is so loud that it can wake the whole house&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it may well be the last oral b braun i buy because the last one that went dead, it broke down in less than 12 months, which is a big let down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i only bought my latest 4000 because i need a quick replacement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the future, more likely to get a normal disposable battery operated toothbrush and not a rechargeable battery type because it is not worth the price any more</li>
            <li> I used an electric toothbrush a long time ago when they first came out, but the heads wore down so quickly, that I finally went back to the old standard.  The Oral B comes with one toothbrush head (although the stand has space for more), and I was a bit worried that it wouldn&#x27;t last.  I received my order August 16, 2012 and used the product that evening.  Although, I was immediately impressed with the cleaning, I delayed posting a review to see how the brush held up.  I&#x27;m happy to report that it is still like new.  I consider myself to be somewhat tough on brushes because I brush extra long and also scrub my retainer.  This one is standing up to my abuse.  I also like the beep that lets me know to change sides.  This way I&#x27;m brushing my entire mouth equally well.  My teeth feel great and compared to a standard brush, my retainer is much cleaner and smoother.  I have to admit that I laughed at another review that noted it made her/him drool.  I must concur.  I thought it was just me, but I guess others suffer from the same problem lol.  It can drip, but that usually happens when I am not paying attention and trying to multi-task while brushing.  The only thing that I dislike is the ring that builds up on the base stand.  Even though I rinse and wipe the entire electric toothbrush off after every use, residue must drain out when not in use.  I&#x27;m a nut about it remaining pristine, so this might not be a big deal for other shoppers.  I do understand this happen with the majority of reusable electric toothbrushes.  Overall, I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I thought I wouldn&#x27;t love this toothbrush as much as my Sonicare, but I was wrong.  My teeth feel just as clean (if not more so) using the Oral-B electric toothbrush than the Sonicare (of course that is not a true measured scientific observation).  But, I can say for sure that the Oral-B is less messy than my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few issues, (not so much problems), that I have with this toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t like that it stops for a split second to prompt you to brush the next dental quadrant.  The first time I used this, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions, yes, I know, I know.  Anyway, I thought it was just telling me that I was brushing too hard, because it would typically stop during the time the red light was flashing.  But, apparently the red light flashes a lot for me.  My dentist has already told me that I brush my teeth with too much pressure, that&#x27;s why I bought a Sonicare in the first place.  So, the flashing red light is actually nice to remind you that you are pressing too hard.  But, the intermission to change areas is a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The toothbrush head is a little bulky for my wisdom tooth area. I have a small mouth and when that is paired with all of your adult teeth in the back, the red flashing light on the Oral-B goes crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product, definitely!  Do I wish Oral-B would not have the reminder to change dental quadrants, yes!  If you can over-look that 1 thing, you will love this tooth-brush!</li>
            <li> fast shipping, works great</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush and would purchase another one when needed.</li>
            <li> I drink lots of tea and coffee and suffer staining between quarterly professional cleanings. This has removed stains which otherwise would have been present till I see my hygienist in a month!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. I upgraded from an Oral-B vitality ($25) and was a bit dubious about how different two electric toothbrushes could be. I really love how it stalls every 30 seconds to let you know when the time is up for each quadrant, and there is a light that lets you know when you are applying too much pressure. I haven&#x27;t used the case or the &amp;#34;side car&amp;#34; brush head case (without it, it takes up a very small footprint). My teeth definitely feel cleaner (like dentist office clean), so I think this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was more than worth it.  I used to have a sonicare, but my mouth feels much cleaner after using this product.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has great power and does a good job but I had to return the first one because it stopped recharging. Second one came without a problem and so far so good...</li>
            <li> This works great! It does everything i need, its the same motor as the next version so no need to spend more money. I think this one is the perfect relation between quality and cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazing, please buy it!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moS9HZLJRH7PKR]]This was my first and will be my last Oral B product. The pressure sensor keeps lighting up, even when the brush is not being touched. This causes the unit to go into sensitive brush mode which is very weak. Not even trying to call B customer service because I know the answer, they will want me to send the unit to be repaired. The cost of S&amp;H is same as the product!&lt;br /&gt;They have to change the statement from \\&quot;Visual Pressure Indicator lights up when you&#x27;re brushing too hard\\&quot; to \\&quot;Visual Pressure Indicator lights up all the time\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Just over 60 days for \\&quot;Money Back Guarantees\\&quot;! Disappointed!!!!!</li>
            <li> It does everything as described.  Very happy with it.  Holds an amazing long charge.  I&#x27;ve taken 10 day vacations without the charger.  Can&#x27;t really say anything that wasn&#x27;t already said in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Great quality, love the case for brushes, cleans well.  Have used Oral-B electric toothbrush in the past and appreciate the quality and features.</li>
            <li> Well, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used an electric toothbrush, but I can&#x27;t honestly say that I like it.  Maybe I&#x27;m just too used to normal toothbrushes, but using this thing felt bulky and weird, and I can&#x27;t say I enjoy the feeling of holding a bulky vibrating thing in my hand as I desperately try to brush my teeth.  Of course, that&#x27;s all personal preference, so what you really want to know is if the toothbrush performs well for an electric toothbrush.  As far as I can tell, it does!  The charge seems to last a good long while, the heads spin like their supposed to while they clean, and I did indeed feel like it cleaned my mouth very well.  One annoying thing though that I know is supposed to be a feature is that it stops brushing if you press down to hard (and also to warn you to move to another dental quandrant).  I know that the whole \\&quot;stopping when you press down too hard\\&quot; is supposed to be a safety feature, but having my toothbrush quit intermittently like that is annoying.  Anyway, if you really like electric toothbrushes then you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this one; as for me, I think I&#x27;m going to go back to my old regular toothbrush.  It&#x27;s nothing against this product, I think I just don&#x27;t like electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I give this high ratings, every time I use this I feel like I was just at the dentist having my teeth cleaned. I have used Oral-B for several years, the old one was starting to not hold a charge and it was a great excuse to upgrade to a new one. I like the carrying case, just toss it in my backpack and bring it to work.</li>
            <li> I bought the Oral B Smart 4000 series to replace my Sonic E series I bought in 2006 it still works, but I threw it away today, because I got tired of cleaning the gunk from the inside of handle, but it was a great brush and I am satisfied with my dental results after using it for the past 7 years, it never stopped working, I just hope that the new one the ( Oral B) lasts as long. I noticed the Oral B brush is quite large and i had a little challenge maneuvering with it I think I may get used to it, it seemed bulky compared to the sonic, I think there are smaller brushes available if I need to change though. I will post future info,</li>
            <li> Like the product.  I think the auxiliary display that comes with the 5000 product is unnecessary.  I was shopping for the 4000 model but the 5000 model happened to be on sale for less then the 4000 model.  I have had both Oral-B and Sonicare products.  I think Sonicare is better if you have braces, but if you don&#x27;t have braces, the Oral-B product is better.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance. I have used those type of tooth brushes for at least twinty years going back to early models and all of them performed well for me.  Every time I visit the dentist they tell me your teeth are in excellent condition and very healthy and clean. They told me no need to visit the dentist every six months. Thanks to this type of tooth brushes. Brilliant product!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and was what my dentist recommended I use. Thank you. I did request hassle free packaging and got retail but that is OK.</li>
            <li> makes my teeth and mouth feel squeeky clean.  Erased the brown spot.  Recommend to all.&lt;br /&gt;Best brushing I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought Oral-B Rechargeable electric toothbrushes around 20 years ago. Mine is still going strong, but the wife&#x27;s got dropped a few too many times -- it died, and couldn&#x27;t be revived.&lt;br /&gt; We didn&#x27;t even consider another brand as a replacement, since the Oral-B had given such excellent service and performance over so many years. And we turned to Amazon as our source, based on several years of satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Our order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. All the items and attachments fit together perfectly, and the handy Charger/Storage Case holds 4 Brush Heads (Only 1 included). The large blue Travel Case holds everything neatly and tucks easily into a shaving kit or makeup case.&lt;br /&gt; An improvement I noticed over our previous Oral-B models is that the new Charger uses 16% less electricity to get the same long-length power cycle (about 7 days @ 2 Minutes x 2wice a day).&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature of the Oral-B is the selection of different types of Interchangeable Brush Heads -- Also available at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt; There are several electric toothbrushes on the market. Our experience with the Oral-B brand and Amazon make this a very highly-recommended product !!</li>
            <li> Like it, although it takes longer than expected to recharge and I&#x27;d like the battery to last longer between recharges I like the electric toothbrush.  Suggest with the next redesign that it does not stop between the brushing periods, a slight pause would be sufficient.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I bought it on the recommendation of my dental hygienist.  When I went in recently for my six-month cleaning, she said that she could really tell an improvement in plaque removal.</li>
            <li> I like the device. It feels like the brushes in my dentist&#x27;s office. It&#x27;s not like the Sonicare I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; brush. I would have preferred the regular brush.</li>
            <li> We liked it so much we bought two of them.  The tooth brush is easy to handel but the extra base piece seems like a waste, we don&#x27;t use it.....  The controls take a little getting used to, probably more setting than you really need.</li>
            <li> i purchased this toothbrush a year ago and loved it.  my mother tried it and wanted it so i bought a brand new one for her and a different toothbrush came in.  same model and everything but the look is very different.  hopefully the the new one is as good as the older but same one.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I start using an electronic toothbrush again. I remember liking oral-b way back in the day when electronic toothbrushes came out and now I can&#x27;t remember why I stopped using it. Love it and my teeth feel very clean. Hopefully my dentist will see the difference in my next visit :)</li>
            <li> I went through a pretty extensive review of electric toothbrushes and basically got down to Oral-B vs Sonicare. I&#x27;m glad I went with Oral-B. It has a few different settings of apparently different pressures but they&#x27;re really not that different...it&#x27;s still brushing your teeth (we do use it on &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; for our 3 year old).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a definite pulse at the end of each 30 second timeframe to devote to each quadrant of teeth; you won&#x27;t miss it. I&#x27;m not sure why people complain that it doesn&#x27;t completely stop after two minutes: do you really not know when to stop brushing? what if you want to keep brushing? Just push the button and it&#x27;s off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B has a wide variety of brush heads available and we have several so that multiple people can use the base. Since it gets used about 6 times per day we need to recharge it roughly once a week (the red battery light flashes). My only gripe is that it takes nearly an entire day to get back to full charge but at least you can still use it in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage case for brush heads is nice to keep them covered and can be cleaned easily. The main benefit for me is the pressure sensor that keeps me from brushing too hard (a clearly visible red light in the handle near the neck that you can see while brushing).</li>
            <li> like it , gets teeth very clean , don&#x27;t forget to floss also , save a fortune on your teeth</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but battery life seems shorter than my previous Oral-B Pro, and it takes longer to recharge.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was using it twice a day, and about the tenth time the top of the brush head just felt off in my mouth, it felt like a broken tooth. Definitely gave me a scare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not find the right replacement for the brush top on Amazon, because other people have the same problems with their tooth brush too.</li>
            <li> A much better way to brush. Feels cleaner after brushing with this tooth brush and should solve problem of teeth grooving by brushing with bad technique. I believe he hype.</li>
            <li> Very good -- I will always stay with this brand.</li>
            <li> I have always been a manual toothbrush user, and this is my first experience with an electric toothbrush.  I found it to operate quite easily and felt it did a good job on cleaning my teeth.  (Not as good as the dentist, but close).  My wife, on the other hand uses her Sonicare brush for years, and tried the Oral-B toothbrush.  She says it did a good job but was not as powerful as her Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will be happy with this brush for years to come.</li>
            <li> Found the unit to be a little underpowered with the motor bogging down over larger tooth surfaces.  Battery does not last as long.  Of course, you&#x27;re supposed to be putting the unit of the charger stand each time after use.  Unfortunately, the induction charger doesn&#x27;t do a good job securing the unit so it topples over easily and hence my reluctance to put it on the stand in a tight fitting bathroom.  Otherwise, it does what it does.  Haven&#x27;t looked into the brush replacement costs but this is something to also be aware of.  Overall, the unit could be better by either having a longer lasting battery and/or a better built stand.</li>
            <li> Is there really a difference between all the different models of electric toothbrushes from the major brands? My dentist told me to just get whatever is on sale because they all work great. I haven&#x27;t tried enough models to test his theory, but I can say that this one does work great. It is easy to use, holds its charge pretty well, and cleans my teeth well enough that my dentist is always complementing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you change the heads regularly because they do wear out and stop cleaning after a couple of months. Different people like different styles of heads and Oral-B makes a bunch of different styles that are compatible with this machine, so try a different one next time and you may prefer that.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is definitely quieter than an Oral B and the pulsating action of Sonicare feels like a massage for your teeth... however I don&#x27;t mind that Oral B is a little louder because it&#x27;s more important for me to have a good clean.  So in my opinion, Oral B takes the prize over Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums bled more frequently using the Sonicare than I have experienced with Oral B.  I think the reason for that is the round shape of the Oral B head.  If you look at your gums in the mirror, they are like little arches coming down around your teeth.  A round head is much better to clean between your gum arches then the rectangular head of the Sonicare which can tear your gums more easily. The Oral B round head is a much easier to navigate around delicate gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Sonicare you still have to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; your teeth, with Oral B, because it&#x27;s oscillating, you basically have to just move it across your teeth and it does the job for you.  I also think an oscillating head is going to clean better because it&#x27;s constantly pulling/throwing plaque downwards rather than from side to side such as a pulsating Sonicare would accomplish.  The smaller head of Oral B also makes it easier to clean behind my back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After brushing with the Oral B 4000 my teeth feel clean and better than they have for a long time.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased and would recommend Oral B over Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommend this model for me.  I had had an Oral-B for over tens years and was due a replacement.  My periodontist  was selling a competing brand at over twice the cost.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend and he has really enjoyed this toothbrush.  He stated it makes his teeth feel more like he has just been&lt;br /&gt;to the dentist clean!  Great gift idea!</li>
            <li> it really gets my teeth super clean; it was a little messy at first, but that was because I was new at it.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, with several different options for cleaning teeth and gums,for which purpose you can choose from different toothbrushes. You don&#x27;t need to apply any pressure because it works smoothly on its own (a red light goes on if you are pressing too much).It also has a timer to let you know how long you need to clean every portion of your mouth. I love the way my mouth feels clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Charge lasts a good bit&lt;br /&gt;Teeth feel very very clean after use.  It would be even better if it came with more extra heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; ve been using a sonic care for the past 10 years but when it finally quit I decided to try the oral b 4000.  It does a much better job of removing plaque than the sonic care.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my girlfriend.  She loves using it compared to regular brush.  It holds a charge well, and is powerful but will not let you apply too much pressure or it will pause temporarily.</li>
            <li> I used toothbrush before, and this is a new experience for me. I need some time to get use to it but this oral-b professional 4000 is really a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I only got a polishing brush head in the Frustration-Free package, I need to buy more. The charging base can only use under 110V power supply which  brings difficulty to travel around world, an additional transformer is needed.</li>
            <li> The unit works as advertised, was shipped promptly and was well packed.  We&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it functions just fine. The travel kit, unlike earlier models, included room for a couple of brush heads.  Overall, we&#x27;re very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace the Braun/Oral B toothbrush that I have had for the past 15 years. After a ton of research I settled on the 4000. I am very impressed! To say there is a difference is an understatement. I have seen other people complain that there is not a digital screen and other gripes. People, you are buying a toothbrush!! I could tell a difference the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush.  It works well, leaves my teeth feeling very clean and smooth.  I have been having much easier trips to the dentist since switching over to this toothbrush.  It is a great price point, durable, and the replacement heads are easy to come by.  I would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade their existing toothbrush or electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have not used an electric in decades but decided I needed better brushing. This feels good in the mouth and hand, certainly doing a better job than I did by hand. I like the 30 second beeps to enforce the right regimen. The manual does not tell you to fully discharge the unit twice a year, as it does on the OralB website; this is certainly necessary for a non-Li battery. My first charge only lasted a week, but that should improve after a couple of cycles. Nevertheless, it is probably not good for a vacation of any length. But, this is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This toothbrush is awesome!  I can already feel a difference in my teeth and gums.  I like the fact that it tells me when I am brushing too hard, and that it tells me when to switch quadrants.  The toothbrush seems to be well made, but time will tell how long it lasts.  I am very pleased with this toothbrush, I would recommend this toothbrush to my friends, and I will purchase a brush from OralB again.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I posted a review of this toothbrush under toothbrush replacement brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are clean when I&#x27;m finished using this electric toothbrush but it&#x27;s a little too powerful... it makes my eyeballs vibrate!</li>
            <li> I got this set but never got to try it out. I am in a 220v region and was using this with a step down transformer. Unfortunately, the power lines went down in a freak accident and burnt up most of my connected gadgets. Now I have no way of knowing if the charger blew or if my brush was defective out of the box as I never got to see the charging lights (it was on the charger for less than 5 mins). After searching for replacement chargers, finally found it here (http://www.theessentials.com/jump.jsp?path&#x3D;1,3,371,419,1023&amp;itemID&#x3D;1824&amp;itemType&#x3D;PRODUCT&amp;iProductID&#x3D;1824).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posting this just so if anybody ends up needing the charger. Btw, I&#x27;m too far away from the states to bother with warrant/ replacements.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would highly reccommend to anyone. Exceeded my and my wofes expectations. Definately better than other products that we have purchased.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. This is a replacement order for one that was old and no longer worked. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to brush my teeth the way I want, and when I feel that I&#x27;m not done with one row I&#x27;d like to continue until I feel done. The Oral-B toothbrushes all have this extremely annoying feature that they turn off every 30 or 45 seconds (depending on the setting) to tell you to advance to the next row of teeth. A blinking light would make much more sense.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because of the price, but am pleasantly pleased with my purchase. The overall feeling of clean is much better than my regular vitality model.</li>
            <li> I bought the Oral B electric tooth brush and really love it . When my son needed one, I bought three for the family. That should be my stamp of approval.</li>
            <li> I purchased my husband and I these for Christmas. What an amazing job it does cleaning!  I had my regular 6 month dentist appointment last week and my dentist actually thanked me for doing such a great job taking care of my teeth! He, thanked me! I used to have stains around my retainer and those have completely gone.</li>
            <li> I used my old oral b for years and it still worked. I decided to upgrade to this model and I am vompletely hsppy thay I did. Great value and from my previous experience I look forward to years of service.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush i have ever used! My teeth feel like i gave been to the Dentist. For a professional cleaning every time i brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral-B for over 10 years and it finally died.  I replaced it with the 4000 because it was the cheapest of their models that included a sensitive setting.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it stops for about 1 second every so often to prompt you to move to another part of the mouth.  I don&#x27;t need that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily the best toothbrush. I have ever owned.  I particularly like the timer function that advises you of brushing length of time.  What else can you say about a toothbrush? Good quality, works good.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast. Packaging was perfect. Everything was very clean. This toothbrush is excellent to clean teeth. Absolutely wonderful to rotate around gum line getting out what manual brushing cannot. The Oral-B also can use different brush heads. I do not use this for whitening my teeth. I use this to have healthy teeth and gums. I use the floss action brush head for my back teeth about twice a week.  I use the Precision Clean brush head about 3 times a week. I use the Sensitive Gum brush head every day.</li>
            <li> I have had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for about 10 years. It&#x27;s awesome. The motor on the old one finally gave up it&#x27;s last hoorah and I had to get a replacement. There are so many options and fancy doodads on some of these it was hard to know which was the right one to choose.  I was going for a straightforward electric toothbrush. I already know I don&#x27;t like the sonic ones, they bug me.  I was VERY HAPPY with this toothbrush. It even has different modes, not that I use anything but the base one mind you.  It works great, just as awesome as my original. The picture shows this large base for the charging station.  Don&#x27;t be alarmed, that&#x27;s optional.  The base is actually very tiny, just like the original.  The optional piece that sticks out to the side is just something to hold the brush heads if you choose, which I do not.  So the actual charging station is barely bigger than the toothbrush itself, which is perfect as it fits into the same spot my old toothbrush went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I love this new toothbrush.  It works perfectly with zero issues. I even like the new brush head it came with, it&#x27;s different than my old one. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothbrush head.  It has a soft rubber piece in the middle which leaves my teeth feeling super clean. I like it, I may actually order more of those style replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that I didn&#x27;t purchase my Oral-B 4000 from Amazon because the local warehouse stores have a better price and you get TWO complete units (toothbrushes and chargers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Amazon, they got you beat on this product.  Amazon&#x27;s price for the replacement brushes is a little less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However; my love for this product led me to leave a review here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember about 15 years ago when the Sonic toothbrushes came to market.  Everyone raved about them, including my dentist.  I tried one at the time and was never that thrilled with its performance vs a manual tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have tried a few battery operated toothbrushes (both Oral-B and other brands), and while I felt they did a little better than manual, I never liked the way they made my entire skull vibrate.  Yes, my teeth where cleaner but who cares when they feel like they are about to fall out due to the tremendous vibration.  Kind of like riding a Harley without actually getting on a motorcycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months ago; I was shopping at the local warehouse club, looking for that 10 gallon bottle of ketchup when I happened to come across the Oral-B 4000.  At that time, it was an impulse buy.  But one that would change my attitude towards electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration is a lot less intense than the current battery operated toothbrushes and the clean feeling left is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last visit to the dentist (whom I have seen for over 30 years) was fabulous and he even mentioned that my teeth had never looked so well kept.  It cut down the cleaning and polishing time immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the different types of brushes which Oral-B has for this toothbrush as well.  My wife prefers the smaller round sensitive brush while I like the Dual Clean brush which is more like a traditional toothbrush but really gets my gumlines clean.  Our daughter uses the Ortho brush as she has braces and really enjoys it as well.enjoys it as well.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush of all time, this product is very well made. The recharging system is awesome. it takes a day, but there are no metal contacts to worry about getting corroded. Somehow the base charges the handle through a plastic contact, very easy to use, and works great. My teeth have never been cleaner, thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought this set to replace a older version that finally died after 10 years.  This set is better at cleaning (floss action heads) and MUCH easier to keep clean than the earlier version.  Its a good product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just what my teeth shouted, \\&quot;Wow, what happened?\\&quot; after their first brushing with the new Professional Braun Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;This Oral-B electric replaces both of my old, yet still functioning, Oral-B&#x27;s in the cabinet above the bathroom sink. At the recommendation of a dental hygienist about 6 years ago I began using the \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot; ($10 at Walmart) and, as she predicted, the signs of early gum disease disappeared. But using the Vitality every day proved too strong for the teeth and gums to tolerate, even though I followed the instructions of no more than 2 minutes brushing per time. So, I bought another, gentler acting, Oral-B called Vitality \\&quot;Sonic.\\&quot; It has a longer, softer brush head that swished the teeth and gums like an electric feather. As a remover of plaque the \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; proved ineffective. Of course, that meant I had two different handles charging and two brush heads because one head would not fit on the other. Until this new Professional, highly attractive, all-purpose Braun moved into  the cabinet, I admit there are times when I&#x27;ve returned to the old fashioned, hand-powered brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new and improved Oral-B Professional model really does seem to do all the things a good dental hygienist does when cleaning teeth except provide a visual exam and x-rays. Although there are six available brush heads designed for specific needs, mine came packaged with the all-purpose \\&quot;Precision Clean\\&quot; brush head. Uniquely designed to cup each tooth while at the same time, the longer bristles get in between the teeth similar to flossing. Other available brush heads are meant for deeper flossing/plaque removal, one head has a \\&quot;power tip\\&quot; for people with braces, crowns, or bridges, a Pro-whitening head, and a head for sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;This Profession Precision 4000 has everything I need now in all with the basic brush on a single rechargeable handle. I will no longer need two electric handles and an old stand-by manual toothbrush. The charge holds for ten days which makes it convenient for taking on short trips. It beeps to me while brushing to remind me to change to another quarter of the mouth. For the Oral-B folks the mouth is divided into quadrants as illustrated in the well-written and diagramed instruction booklet. Every 30 seconds it beeps to remind me to move to a different quadrant of the mouth. Not only should I not spend more then 30 seconds brushing in one section unless doing an occasional 45 second deep cleaning, I should not press too hard when brushing. If that happens a beep and red flashing light gives a warning. The brush head is designed to last at least 3 months of twice a day usage. If the bristles splay or wear too much before three months, that is a sign of using too much pressure. The brush does all the work, really. And so does the handle which has a button where four different possible modes can be chosen. They are: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening or polishing. The brush always starts at the \\&quot;daily clean\\&quot; mode and is programmed to run through its 30 second beeping routine. To switch to any of the others just press the selecting button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the instruction booklet is a good idea. I admit that I skipped the operations part after I read how to charge it the first time. It seemed to take a long time, but the green light finally went off and that meant I could brush!  So, naturally, I skipped the \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; instructions and just went at it. There was so much going on with the 30 second beeps and then other complaining beeps that started after I pushed the mode selector button which I thought was the \\&quot;off\\&quot; button. First time I used this tooth bush I thought I would never get done because I couldn&#x27;t find the \\&quot;Off\\&quot; button. FYI: it is the same as the round \\&quot;On\\&quot; button.&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions and save yourself a lot of electrical anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B people recommend brushing twice a day and so does my dentist; and never after meals. That&#x27;s right, brushing right after eating is a common cause of tooth decay. It&#x27;s a good practice, if you can, to rinse and swish with water--that&#x27;s sufficient. The ideal times to brush are upon rising and before bed. And, for me at least, the ideal time to have a series of little beeps informing me of when to brush where is when I am still half asleep. The \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; gets 5 stars for product design alone. And... oh, did I mention that in the 6 years of using the Oral-B brushes, I&#x27;ve had no signs of gum disease and no new cavities.tist; and never after meals.

            <li> The Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is AMAZING!! Mu teeth have never felt so clean! And the clean feeling lasts for hours!&lt;br /&gt;I love the pause in the motion that alerts you to move to a different quadrant of teeth. I also really like being able to choose what I want the brush to do, be it daily clean, deep clean, sensitive or whitening.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush head even has a wear indicator so you know exactly when to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;This fantastic toothbrush has found a permanent place in my home!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this brush on my gums much more than my Sonicare.  It rotates at 4 speeds instead of just vibrating.  The silicon cup within the brush holds paste very well and my teeth feel polished afterwards just like after a dentist visit.  I appreciate the travel container and brush head organizer, I do not use them yet but I am glad to have them if the need arrises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the shape of the handle and the icons that show the level selected.  I do wish you could select and then activate because it starts at the default setting every time and you have to re-select your level, which I do looking in the mirror since paste would fly everywhere if I took it out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After back to back pregnancies I am trying to get my gums back in shape, the feather setting is very good for this.  Who knew pregnancy hormones reeked havoc on your gums?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad to have this and use it exclusively now, my Sonicare is collecting dust.</li>
            <li> This new Oral-B cleans so much better than my 10-year-old one. I am most pleased with how my teeth feel when I finish brushing.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever!!  Easily reaches hard to get to areas and helps remove plaque. I would certainly recommend this toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;to others.</li>
            <li> Replaced our old Oral B and could not believe the difference.  Feels like you just left the dentist after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Cant believe I waited this long to get this. Works awesome !!! Multiple settings for regular brushing, whitening, etc. I bought one for my wife and daughter also. We love it. Charging station works great.</li>
            <li> This TB is getting a it too smart for it&#x27;s own good. Stopping to tell me when to switch to another area of my mouth is annoying. I can make that decision, thank you...</li>
            <li> This is the greatest tooth brush..absolutely fantastic. I think it cleans my teeth better than any other tooth brush, ever!!</li>
            <li> Love the design and functionality of this electric tooth brush. I prefer the round tooth brush head and that I can buy brush heads for sensitive teeth. I really like the 3 modes of brushing that one can choose from.  The charge lasts a long time for trips I take without the base. The only thing I do not like is the 2 minute signal that you are finished. It would be so much better if it was a more distinct sound. Other than that I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent fast shipping so close to the holiday season. Product works very well cleans my teeth better, they felt almost polished after the first use . Very happy with this purchase had for a month now.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Sonicare that finally gave up after years of use. I chose the Oral-B based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, online reviews, and claims that it is the most dentist recommended electric toothbrush. As a mechanical engineer with expertise in vibrations I was very skeptical that a simple rotating brush could compete with a sonic one, but I thought it was worth trying something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Better than a manual toothbrush for surface of teeth&lt;br /&gt;-Nice travel case (although a little bulky)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Bulky&lt;br /&gt;-Handle is too big and slick for comfort and optimal control&lt;br /&gt;-Not *much* better than a manual toothbrush in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;-Large brush head makes it hard to reach molars&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for gums, below the gum line or in between teeth&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t leave any more of a clean feeling than a regular manual toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is nothing special and nowhere near as effective as a quality sonic-style brush for overall oral and gum health. Not worth it. Spend a couple more bucks and get a sonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning it and purchasing a Sonicare which I know is an awesome product. My dental hygienist agrees with my assessment, so I guess I should have just asked her first! She also said the DentistRx Intelisonic was just as good and designed by the same person as the Sonicare, but I did not bother to confirm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no affiliation or interests in Phillips or Sonicare, or any toothbrush/manufacturer for that matter.</li>
            <li> beware, when delivered completly dead, read instructions, just charge for a few days....the product is outstanding works just as discribed.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH UNTIL I FORGOT IT ON A TRIP AND&lt;br /&gt;HAD TO PURCHASE A REPLACEMENT.  READ THE RATINGS AND DECIDED TO UPGRADE MYSELF&lt;br /&gt;TO PROFESSIONAL AND SO GLAD I DID.  THE BRUSH THAT COMES WITH IT IS FABULOUS AND&lt;br /&gt;THE HANDLE IS LONGER, PLUS A CARRYING CASE SO NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING&lt;br /&gt;GETTING BENT.  WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  It works great and makes my teeth feel very clean.  Much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Omg. The best Toothbrush ever . I always using Oral-B Toothbrushes for many Years now. My Teeth was never so clean and my Dentist is happy.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an older model, and find several improvements. The choice of 30 or 45 second time periods for length of brushing is very handy, since generally I prefer a longer brushing time. And the increased number of oscillations gives a better, clean feel. The head is small, which I like because you can do a good job without holding the jaw wide open for too long. My dentist always says I&#x27;m one of his star patients! One tiny quibble. . .the case for holding brush heads seemed superfluous and took up a lot of space so I got rid of it. . .now the base is quite small but heavy enough so it doesn&#x27;t get knocked over. It&#x27;s a lot to pay, but my last Oral-B lasted a very long time, 5+ years, so in the long run it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The brush action is so much faster.  It floats over the teeth and they feel really clean afterward.  The red light alerts you to not press so hard so that you use proper brush pressure</li>
            <li> The previous generation, same model number, had a dual voltage charger (worked both in USA 110V and Europe 220V outlets), so I was disappointed to find out that in this product refresh they&#x27;ve changed the charger to work only in the USA.  Now this has become a far less convenient toothbrush for travel.  They also changed the toothbrush handle plug format so you cannot use the old charger with the new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, the product is good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I have one of my own, and have been using it for about 3 years with no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral B is famous for its quality and effectiveness. I recommend it highly to those looking for a good oral hygiene; this is definitely the right tool.</li>
            <li> I really love this toothbrush!  I like that there is storage space for additional brushes.  It&#x27;s wonderful to have a beeper at the 30 second mark for each quandrant....you can even change the timer setting to go longer for a longer tooth brushing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is able to accommodate several different types of Oral-B toothbrush heads, which is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for about a month now and I can honestly say that I am impressed with how much cleaner my mouth and teeth feel! My dentist had told me I should buy an electric toothbrush and suggested the Oral-B, but I decided to go with a [[ASIN:B0014AI4VM Spinbrush Pro Recharge Battery Powered Toothbrush]] because of cost. After using the Oral-B, I realize that there truly is a difference in performance, and wished I had followed the dentist&#x27;s suggestion from the beginning. Yup - it&#x27;s that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush comes with a head (mine came with a ProWhite brush head), charging base that stores your heads, the handle and a carrying/travel case. Out of the box, the toothbrush was ready to use in about 24 hours after attaching it to the charging base. It has a variety of settings: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive and whitening. It has a timer that beeps to let you know that you&#x27;ve brushed long enough and to move on to the next quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use a variety of heads with this brush: [[ASIN:B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Brush Head (4 ct.)]], [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]], [[ASIN:B0002KHTG6 Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]], [[ASIN:B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]][[ASIN:B000O8QCB4 Oral-B Power Tip Replacement Brush Head, 1 count]], [[ASIN:B003YVMW0I Crest Oral b Ortho Refill]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the performance of the ProWhite Precision 4000 and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a thorough cleaning machine.  If you&#x27;re a regular user of an electric toothbrush this particular model might not be that hard for you to get used to.  I, however, am new to electric toothbrushes and the force with which the brush hit my teeth and gums was kind of jolting at first.  The manual tells you that some bleeding may occur in the beginning.  That was true for me.  I had to learn how to gently apply it.  It definitely cleans well.  My teeth feel the way they feel after a visit to my dentist.  I recommend it.  But like I said in the beginning: for newbies to electric toothbrushes this might be a jolting experience.</li>
            <li> Update on previous review.  After slightly less than one year, either the charger or the toothbrush has stopped working.  These companies that keep rushing new products out that don&#x27;t last make me sick.  Make one model, make it good and reliable and last a long time, and you&#x27;d dominate the market full of horrible manufacturing quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;Poor customer service - Screwed on the rebate like everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It drives me nuts when I&#x27;m trying to buy a product and it turns out the product is good but they have a lot of negative reviews for \\&quot;other\\&quot; reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those angry reviews that has nothing to do with the actual product but more the shopping experience with this manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent everything in for the rebate, being as utterly careful as possible since they have a reputation for ripping people off. They sent me back a scan of exactly what I sent in which totally meets the requirements, and they do not ask for anything specific, just reject my rebate application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I CAN&#x27;T STAND customer service attitudes that are this pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE STAR - NEVER BUY an Oral B product.  Wow.</li>
            <li> For those of you who use a conventional toothbrush, I can&#x27;t recommend highly enough getting an electric one.  Yes, it costs quite a bit up front, but the ability to brush smoothly and in areas you normally can&#x27;t reach easily makes the line of Oral B / Braun electric toothbrushes worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Triumph for a couple years and wanted to try this new model to see if it&#x27;s better.  The product kit includes a plastic blue carrying case for the actual brush and the stand now has an attachment tray where you can store your extra brush heads.  I vote thumbs up on the blue case, as that will help during travel.  The case attached to the stand is useful but also means the unit takes up more space on your bathroom sink/counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a \\&quot;Precision Clean\\&quot; brush head by default, and I don&#x27;t like it as much as the ProWhite brush head, which is very similar to the one I use on my Triumph.  The brushing action is smooth, and if you brush too hard, the unit has a flashing red light on it and emits a beep.  These enhancements are nice, but don&#x27;t add too much value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 4 brushing settings: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive and whitening/polishing.  There are icons for each setting, but I don&#x27;t like how they face away from you when you begin brushing.  It&#x27;d be better if you could toggle between each setting without having to turn the brush around to see the settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I recommend the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean + ProWhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush; but to be honest, it&#x27;s not that much of an upgrade from the Oral B Triumph.  You should see what the price points of each are and go with the cheaper of the two.  You&#x27;re getting essentially the same value.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this toothbrush tells you when you are applying too much force.  I have a tendency to try and scrub a little too hard and I notice the flashing red light when I do so.  I am still not always noticing the timing beeps, so if I don&#x27;t pay attention I end up brushing too long.  It&#x27;s not the worst problem in the world, but I would prefer to have a more definitive \\&quot;end of cycle,\\&quot; warning.  Otherwise, this brush cleans great, seems to keep a good charge and is ergonomically comfortable.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but should last years.</li>
            <li> I had an old version of an oral b / Braun toothbrush that I loved. I bought this toothbrush for my mother and she loved it so much that I asked for it for my birthday. Both my mom and husband bought me one and I almost kept both because I like it so much. I love the different modes you can choose and the built in quadrant timer. It will alert you to move on to the next set of teeth. You can also select 30 seconds per quadrant or 45 ( I think it is). There is also a feather light mode and a diamond polishing mode. You can use so many different brush heads with this brush too unlike my previous model. Some reviewers said it is too loud, but I almost feel that is a given for a brush that does all the things this does. The noise did not bother me at all and I brush my teeth in the bathroom next to where my children sleep and it can&#x27;t be too loud because it has never woken them up. My teeth feel super clean and fresh after using this brush. I also love the stand on this one, previous models had the toothbrush storage toward the back of where the handle charges. This model has a separate holder to the side that can be kept separately from the handle charger or be attached. Love this brush and would buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> The product itself is nice but, as mentioned elsewhere, beware of Oral-B/amazon.com rebates, at least in this particular case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sends this electric toothbrush using a product packaging called \\&quot;Amazon Frustration-Free\\&quot;. This packaging is reduced as compared with the traditional packaging and is different in terms of UPC barcode: there is only one barcode on a sticker on the outside of the cardboard shipping box.  There is no other UPC anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B rebate form states that \\&quot;If you selected \\&quot;FrustrationFree Shipping\\&quot; [note that we don&#x27;t really have a choice], cut out and mail the original UPC barcode from your shipping box\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I mailed it, not only did the Oral-B rebate service center reply once that I had not included it but after I tried and explained the \\&quot;FrustrationFree\\&quot; packaging thing they replied that \\&quot;the UPC(s) submitted with your submission are not valid for this offer\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two months and two letters I am about to give up but please stop calling it \\&quot;FrustrationFree\\&quot;, then.  And don&#x27;t count on this type of rebate.</li>
            <li> My son like it very much. He told me it is very good. Sensitive brush is terrific. I would like to recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love my new tooth brush. I have used a Oral-B tooth brush for many years!!! Great clean!!!!&lt;br /&gt;a a a</li>
            <li> This is better than any electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tried!  It came with the Prowhite toothbrush head.  In the center of the bristles, there is a small rubbery disc that spins, much like the device a dental hygenist uses to polish teeth.  It works far better than the Sonicare Elite, which I am now sending over the rainbow.  The Elite uses sound vibration and was good toothbrush, but the Oral-B is a great toothbrush!  My teeth feel almost like they&#x27;ve just been cleaned in the dentist&#x27;s office.  Nothing has ever come this close!</li>
            <li> I have been an Oral B user for many years, so when my old one died, I replaced it with a newer model.  No complaints, but I really have to concentrate on listening for the beeps to know when to move to another area of my mouth.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Made in Germany Oral-B is the Mercedes of Electric Tooth Brushes! What more can I say? I had a Sonic Care that crapped out after 1 year of use!</li>
            <li> I deffinitely am very happy with this electric toothbrush.  It does a great job in cleaning my teeth and has 3 different settings to choose from and the attached brush head case definitely helps out in keeping my toothbrush heads protected from dust and curious cats.  Although, the cost of this brush is a bit expensive, I hope to get a few good years out of this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for years!!!! I love it. I dropped in in the wall in the basement shower and couldn&#x27;t get it out ... Lol. So, I ordered a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They updated the look, but everything works the same. It&#x27;s great. I love it.</li>
            <li> Because I had hand surgery I needed an electric toothbrush I could use with the non-operated hand.  It works great, and I caught on immediately.</li>
            <li> Replaced the same (but older) version (&amp;#34;Triumph Professional&amp;#34;) and as always, was very happy with this Oral-B product.  Eversince I&#x27;ve been using these Oral-B electric toothbrushes, my dentist gets a lot less of my money......</li>
            <li> Perfect design.  Great for the busy on-the-go professional. Brush head size is optimal for thorough cleaning.  Leaves the competition in the dust.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the same product as what is pictured here, but so be it. What really frosts my jaw with this toothbrush is that I only get 5 or 6 brushings out of it before the battery runs out of gas and needs to be recharged. I bought this product because Braun is supposed to be a highly acclaimed German engineering &amp; manufacturing company. They really disappointed me with this product.</li>
            <li> I had abandoned electric toothbrushes after trying two and experiencing nerve pain (which I get when I have sinus issues in the Winter) and receding gums (which a part of me wonders if electric toothbrushes cause). Then I tried this toothbrush and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. I feel ZERO pain, ZERO reverberation, and am once again experiencing super-clean teeth.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B toothbrush worked great and I was very happy with the quality if my teeth after using it! However, I had to give it four stars because of 3 things I didn&#x27;t like. #1. This toothbrush does NOT run on batteries and MUST be recharged in order to use. I preferred my Spinbrush Pro over this toothbrush for that reason alone. #2. Speaking of charging, the charging base of this toothbrush is much too small to provide a stable environment during the charging process. With every bump or hard step around my sink, it went tumbling off. #3. The cleaning heads on this toothbrush, while having a wide variety of choices, they were very difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this item if you travel a lot (make sure you bring a back up if you do) and I have it four stars because of its cleaning power which really was better than my Spinbrush pro.</li>
            <li> I think it is a lot of money for a toothbrush but the feeling after brushing/ cleaning is great. worth the investment</li>
            <li> Wow! I was very hesitant to spend a lot of money on a toothbrush -- I typically stick to disposable brushes and even the disposable cheapie electric tootbrushes (like Crest Spinbrush). But I decided to bite the bullet and get this one based on a few recs here and from friends. LOVE IT!! My teeth always feel like I just came from the dentist. And I love the timer so I know I&#x27;m brushing for two minutes. I&#x27;m not yet convinced that the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; feature actually whitens, but that&#x27;s no big deal. I&#x27;m 1000% thrilled with this toothbrush and will never use a manual brush again.</li>
            <li> The contents listed in the description did not match what was in the box.  Only one brush head was in the box and the brush holder was missing.  I bought this as a gift for Christmas for my fiancé because she had been asking for one for a long time,  and I was rather bummed to have her open it and not everything was in the box.  She loves the toothbrush so I gave it 3 stars, but I&#x27;m not going to bother returning it. Go to the store and buy the retail packaging if you want this product.</li>
            <li> I only recieved the blue case. Not the toothbruse or anyhthing else. The box arrived opened. I sent box back with return label and never recieved my refund. I have yet to hear back from anyone. Unsure why this happened. For a few days this item was removed bc of some issues. Which gave me hope I was going to recieve my money back but then it was being sold again and I never heard anything.</li>
            <li> Much better than the one that we had that broke down after many years of service, will probably buy another one for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for years. This toothbrush seems to be a very good one! The head is a good size and it has good movement. It has a very nice grip so it is comfortable and easy to hold. The batteries seem to last many days on a charge so no need to worry about packing a the charger for a short vacation or business trip.  It also has a built in timing indicator so you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing. A well designed product.</li>
            <li> About three years ago, my periodontist (whom I&#x27;ve been seeing 3-4 times annually for the past 25 years) was very insistent that I purchase the earlier version of this OralB/Braun toothbrush because he said it was such a powerful brush for maintaining good, healthy dental hygiene.  And so I bought two, one with the cleaning brush similar to the one offered here, and the second with a proxy brush for in-between-teeth cleaning.  And so, with twice/day brushing, I&#x27;ve kept almost all 28 teeth in my aging mouth -- and the prospect of keeping them for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve sampled this new and advanced version of the same brush and I am very, very impressed.  Its design is handsome and perfectly fitted to the hand, more comfortable to hold for those minutes twice a day spent brushing. Its new feature of varied speeds/pressures brushing are a nice addition.  But its lighted index for recharging is my favorite new addition.  Granted, you found out when the battery needed recharging before -- it just died on you, after noticeably slowing down. Now, three small lighted \\&quot;windows\\&quot; go out, one after the other, as the charge weakens.  And right above these \\&quot;windows\\&quot; are three small indicators of the kind of brushing you chose (the fourth choice being all three unlit) -- the speeds and pressures mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I haven&#x27;t made any of this seem complicated because it is not.  It is an absolutely up-to-the-minute way to keep your teeth and mouth clean and, maybe even, free of cavities and other unwanted dental miseries.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, and while I&#x27;m still adjusting to the novelty and slight bulkiness of it, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head&#x27;s a little smaller than I thought it would be and it takes some getting used to handling it, but it&#x27;s working out pretty well so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head does a good job scrubbing my teeth clean, though as cautioned it did cause some initial bleeding of the gums, but that passed in a couple of days.  It even beeps to remind you when it&#x27;s time to switch to brushing a different area of your teeth!  Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real complaint so far is that it only comes with one brush head so the replacements are all on you.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a good item!</li>
            <li> Pleased with the Oral B product itself. I have ordered the same brush in the past and had no problems receiving the refund until the Amazon frustration free shipping.  Even though it states on the rebate form that frustration free shipping UPC is honored, it apparently is not by Oral-B.  I resubmitted the form along with a letter explaining the frustration free shipping label and received another letter from Oral-B, stating that the UPC is not valid.&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the previous comment that this is indeed NOT Frustration Free Shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I replaced my old Oral-B that I had had for about 8 years and this one is even better! I really like the lights that indicated how &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; the battery is. I only need to charge the toothbrush about every 2 weeks. I&#x27;m guessing I will have this Oral-B for at lease 10 years! :-)</li>
            <li> I will qualify this by stating that I have not had much previous experience with other electric toothbrushes. Having said that, I LOVE this product. I had the Oral-B Precision 5000 prior to this, and used it for nearly 2 years before losing it on a trip. I replaced that one with this one and the experience is the same. Tip: I exclusively use the floss-action head, versus the whitening head or others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush is effective. What I like is the small recharging stand and convenient size.  What I don&#x27;t like is the continual beeping to alert me to move to a different &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of my mouth (the brush even hesitates to allow time to move it).  Overall I would probably buy it again, the other brand I have purchased seem to only last about a year.</li>
            <li> this newer toothbrush operates more efficiently and seems stronger than the one it replaced.  I believe this to be the best toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I have traveled with it and it has held its charge for over 10 days.  It works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Got a newer model.  the other one was getting harder to charge,  these are great if you care about your teeth,  you&#x27;ll spit stuff out from yesterday with these things,  Love mine!</li>
            <li> The product has been in use only several days, so review is not possible at this time.  Appears to operate as stated.</li>
            <li> I decided to change to the Oral-B after my Sonicare brush broke.  This seems to give a much better cleaning and has some features the Sonicare didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The 4000 is a great product.  Once charged I unplugg it for at least 10 days before it needs recharging.  It signals when it is time to recharge.  I love the timer in 30 second intervals that lets you know when to move to the next area to brush (can be set to 45 seconds also).  It even lets you know if you are pressing to hard.  This is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush last fall and  liked it so much I bought one for each of my kids for Christmas</li>
            <li> We were replacing an older Oral-B version.  We like the 30 second timing reminder and the fact that you can put the brush holder in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush, Oral-B does it well. We have bought 2 of these one for each of us (easier than sharing &amp; just swapping the heads for the time being). No complaints, and my wife just went for a 6month checkup and was told how great she had been brushing, her teeth, gums, everything was looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for a replacement of another brand of tooth brush.  This thing cleans like the dentist and another member of the family has been using one for over 6 years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  Would recommend the 40K pulsations over the 20K, seems to make teeth cleaner and gums stronger.  Definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> Does a better job than the previous brand. Much better!  My mouth seems cleaner.  The proof will come when I visit my dentist.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT! You can switch heads for different focus areas. Definately leaves a clean feeling when using this brush. Should of thrown out my tooth brush out a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush</li>
            <li> We bought the toothbrush 6months ago and the charger stopped working after 3months.  We bought a second as it was tough finding just the charger and the second charger stopped working after 1 month.  Truly a rip off.  Beware before buying.</li>
            <li> I like the new angled brush.  It is more comfortable than the old straight one. I recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine my teeth feeling cleaner without this toothbrush. I look forward to the sensation of perfectly cleaned teeth and think my oral hygiene just got bumped up a few notches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for a long time--probably ten years or more. Prior to that, though, I had an Oral-B electronic toothbrush. So when I saw this Healthy Clean + ProWhite model was available, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ll tailor my review to how it compares to the Sonicare I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, I&#x27;d say the Oral-B is a sharper looking toothbrush. (If anyone cares about such things.) It is two-toned and just looks real professional. The charge took all of 24 hours, and initially I didn&#x27;t know if it was really charging or not, because the charge light was so dim. (It gets more noticeable as the charging process continues.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the use of the toothbrush, it is a good deal louder than the Sonicare. It has a heavier, more-like-power-equipment sound when compared to the Sonicare&#x27;s soft hum. I also was a bit startled by the red light that occasionally came on from the back of the brush. Had to look that feature up! Turns out it is to help prevent you from using too much pressure on your teeth. (My Sonicare doesn&#x27;t have anything like that.) I think that&#x27;s probably a useful feature, since I&#x27;ve heard too much pressure hurts the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be just perception, but I feel the Oral-B leaves my teeth feeling cleaner. They just feel smoother to me. Maybe that says the Oral-B motion is making up for some laziness on my part that the Sonicare did not. Not sure. But they do feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall a good toothbrush. A little loud, lots of surprising bells and whistles, but it does do what a toothbrush should do. Clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> Very happpy with this electric toothbrush. Oral-B makes great products. The last one I had lasted me for 10 years. The best feature I like about this toothbrush is the red light that comes on when you are brushing too hard. A few visits ago, my dentist had told me that I was brushing my teeth too hard. This feature of the toothbrush was exactly the solution to what the dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> The brush works well, as expected for an Oral-B.  The battery charge holds nicely.  The carrying case is a nice extra.  My favorite part of this is very simple - the base stays steady.  My last electric brush base was taller and had hidden compartments for the brush heads, but it wobbled and shook every time I tried to lift the brush off the charger.  This one takes up a bit more countertop real estate, but I much prefer it.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an electric toothbrush. Despite my initial skepticism, I am completely impressed. Much better results than with a traditional toothbrush. My teeth look and feel better. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long admired the quality of the Oral-B brand but I never personally tried any of their products until I got the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean rechargeable toothbrush. And OH...MY...GOSH! Where has this toothbrush been my entire life. While I was certainly no stranger to electric toothbrushes, I had no idea just how crappy those other ones were until I used this for the first time. It was like I was sitting in the dentist chair (without the pain, of course) and getting a professional cleaning. But it was in my own bathroom with a pleasant massage and buffing up of my teeth and gums. WOWSA! And this thing is not only powerful but super-smart--every 30 seconds it stops to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing. I generally get through 2-3 stops during my brushing time. But it will run for three minutes straight if you decide you want to brush for that long. And the toothbrush literally does all the work for you and will flash lights on the back side of your brush if you start trying to move the bristles back and forth in the mouth. I&#x27;ve learned to just glide the thing around in my mouth and watch the magic happen from a REAL toothbrush that is hands down the BEST one I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> Quite frankly, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since I have never used an electric toothbrush or even had one in the house. After 70 years using a regular toothbrush, I find it noisy, efficient, mechanical, challenging and hopefully worth the money if it helps me keep my teeth.  I will adapt.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is OK; I purchased the replaceable battery-powered toothbrush also to compare.  If you like having an extra cord cluttering up your bathroom and hogging up an electrical outlet, then go for the rechargeable.  Just don&#x27;t plan on returning it.  \\&quot;Use this toothbrush for 60 days and we guarantee that you ... will notice a difference. If you are not 100% satisfied, return handle, refills and charging unit with original cash receipt postmarked within 60 days of purchase to receive a full refund (full details inside pack)\\&quot;  Silly me, I thought that would be easy enough.  Fortunately, I kept all documentation, including a copy of the pertinent information in the instruction booklet.  Day of purchase: July 29, 2012.  Date received by Oral-B Braun Division, South Boston, MA, per booklet instructions:  August 27, 2012.  That seems like less than 60 days.  So far, so good.  \\&quot;Allow 6-8 weeks.\\&quot;  After eight weeks, I called.  No telephone numbers available, so I called Customer Support.  No, they said, you need to call the promotions line.  It&#x27;s in Michigan.  They had no record of my return.  And they asked why I returned it to Massachusetts.  Because the instructions stated.  The representative said that I was wrong.  I had to send him copies of all my documentation, including the part where the address was Massachusetts.  They received this information on October 30, 2012.  Finally, after another phone call and three weeks, and over 12 weeks from their initial receipt, I received not a check for the refund, but a debit card.  To receive any sort of credit, I had to buy something else.  What a scam.  The idea being that you won&#x27;t use all the money on the card.  That&#x27;s not a refund.  No where does the literature state that you will not receive a full refund.  So, even though I&#x27;m happy with the battery-powered toothbrush, I cannot recommend the rechargeable.  And the battery-powered one will stand up or go into a drawer if you prefer it out of sight.  I think that the rechargeable is no better than the battery-powered one as far as cleaning one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> It works great and cleans my teeth and gums, the best tooth brush that I have owned and I would purchase this  tooth brush again.</li>
            <li> Beware of the voltage!! It only supports 110-130VAC instead of global voltage supply range 110-240V, so it may not be a good option for travelling to other countries! And I found there is a new version which actually supports global voltage range and with addditional LCD display. So do NOT buy this item at Amazon, go somewhere else where you can buy newer version!!</li>
            <li> I visit the hygienist 4 times per year. Normally there is enough plaque and tartar to keep her busy with the feared Cavitron for several minutes. This past visit, after using my new Oral B 4000 for about a month, she remarked that my teeth were extremely clean and free of the usual coatings. She did some brief scaling by hand, polished my teeth as she alway does and I was out of her chair in no time. She asked me what I had done differently this time and I told her I was using my new 4000. My old Oral B was about 12 years old and finally gave up the ghost, I am certain that succeeding cleanings will be as easy and painless. I do not like that the Oral B stops every 30 seconds to warn me to \change quadrant. The tones would be enough</li>
            <li> Used Sonicares for years but the Oral B is better. Really like the aggressive action of the brush and the great choice of head designs there are. I got one for my wife too.</li>
            <li> so far so good...I can certainly tell a difference in the way my teeth feel.  I really like the timer on it.</li>
            <li> I like having the various speeds and brush head options.  It cleans well.  The handle is a bit large/long for my rather small hands, but is certainly manageable.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this toothbrush.  It lasts quite awhile on one charge. You can change the battery in it.  I have not had  to do this yet.  It gives you clues as to how long you have brushed. (two minutes is the norm)  I bought mine over a year ago.  Still happy with it.  This toothbrush also lets you know if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush. I have had others but this really does a very thorough job. I noticed the difference in shine, whiteness and cleanliness of my teeth after the first use</li>
            <li> This Oral-B electric toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning one&#x27;s teeth.  They say it oscillates and pulsates something like a zillion times a minute, which it may well do, though the user can&#x27;t tell.  Some reviews say that it is &amp;#34;too big&amp;#34; for the mouth, but I don&#x27;t get that comment, as the removable brush is the same as for other Oral-B elec. toothbrushes, no matter how wide the handle is, and that is what goes into your mouth.  Having said that, I would add that I would prefer a more slender handle.  Guess it&#x27;s that big so that batteries will fit into it.  That means the travel case is quite large, too.  Putting it in a plastic bag instead would save room in your carry-on.  The recharging dock separates from the extra-brush holder and is quite small, thus easy to pack along with the brush, so you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about batteries unless you are traveling where you can&#x27;t plug it in (other countries?).  I think that it is NOT the same model that the leaflet that came with it describes, as it does not beep to signal when you are supposed to change quadrants in your mouth.  Instead it stops for a moment and then starts right up again.  Maybe that is better than being beeped at, but I would prefer having instructions that apply to the appliance I received.  Box not the original, but rather an Amazon special, so no picture on it to check the model.</li>
            <li> I wore out an older Oral-B electric tooth brush which I thought did a great job, but the new model is even better.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain about on the new Oral-B tooth brush.</li>
