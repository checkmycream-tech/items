            <li>Great item for in between hair colorings</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, this product is great for in between touch ups.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for using between salon hair color appointments.  </li>
            <li>Great, convenient cover-up of the gray hair in eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>and she instructed me to get the light brown which was a perfect match.  </li>
            <li>Just like I wanted, this is like a good mascara wand and applies the product well.  </li>
            <li>In theory, it sounds like a good idea.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I discovered Greyfree!</li>
            <li>Great coverage and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>My hair is light brown with highlights and I ordered the light brown and its perfect!  </li>
            <li>great product quick shipping</li>
            <li>Dreamlook Greyfree blends perfectly giving a wonderfully natural look.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This product is effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and I am soooo glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments when I use this on my eyebrows and it stays until I wash it off.</li>
            <li>You would be better off to use a waterproof mascara on your hair, then it wouldn&#x27;t come off on your hands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for what is meant to be.</li>
            <li>It is more of a paint than a stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think I am probably about 40-50% gray now, but don&#x27;t plan to find out for sure.</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase the blond and see if it turns out a light brown!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect product to touch up gray or white beards.</li>
            <li>I wish it were waterproof but other than that it&#x27;s perfect!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I needed a quick fix for the grey grow out on the part line for an upcoming wedding and this worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>My beard is light brown</li>
            <li>Great price for something that will last a while.  </li>
            <li>I got the brown and if applied lightly it blends in with my changing coloring.</li>
            <li>Whatever color you pick for your hair, it will blend in with your original hair color.</li>
            <li>am editing my post to say that although this product goes on decently, and the color is okay (could be darker because I got light brown after people said to go lighter), after it dries it has a smell.  </li>
            <li>Its much easier to use then a pencil and blends in much better.</li>
            <li>Other than that I think it does a great job.</li>
            <li>and I would make sure it was dry on your hair before pulling a top over your head.</li>
            <li>I purchased light brown but it is more of a dark brown.</li>
            <li>Covers the grey quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I saved my old tube and brush that I&#x27;m using instead of the brush that came in the tube.</li>
            <li>Very sticky and clumpy feeling.</li>
            <li>product works very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than the original ones causing the contents to splatter when the brush is removed from the tube.  </li>
            <li>The brush end of the applicator is wide for easy applying.</li>
            <li>If you wish a darker color then reapply a few more times.</li>
            <li>Once you have the method down, it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>, I have noticed that I have been getting grey just above my temple more frequently.  </li>
            <li>I can go at least two more weeks between colorings when I use this product to cover the new grays at the root.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone that wants to keep the grey roots from showing.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and is used after blow dry on dry hair.</li>
            <li>It helps if you hold the hair down on the part line and then use the brush quickly as it tends to stick to the hair.  </li>
            <li>It really does cover the grey spots that you might have here and there.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased it at Beauty World before, and it always seemed like it had plenty, even a little too much at first.  </li>

            <li> I have white hair and mostly grey eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with pale skin in the winter (nice and tan in the summer, even with sun block and a wide brim hat) and my eyebrows are so thin that they just about don&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> touch up emergencies when you are into the 5th week or so of grow out and just need to cover up that grey part.  </li>
            <li> Not a natural look.</li>
            <li> Even if I barely touched the hair it locked on tight.</li>
            <li> Both bottles I bought seemed rather dry.</li>
            <li> I guess I can give it one more chance since it isn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> but It gets white if I let it grow out a little.</li>
            <li> Although the color is darker than I expected, I like the wand applicator and the ease of application.  </li>
            <li> If I put it on after I style my hair, it maked my hair wet</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I start getting a white stripe down my part in about 5 wks or less.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other people can smell it, but it smells funky, like corn starch powder.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used other cover-up products for around the edges of his hair, his brows, and his mustache.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s going to feel a bit tacky as it dries as a couple of other reviewers have noted.</li>
            <li> It goes on very wet also.</li>
            <li> I have my hair professionally dyed and highlighted approximately every 3 month however</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful because it can get a little messy.</li>
            <li> This product helps me not look ridiculous for that last week before my appt.</li>
            <li> I discovered this nifty little product at my hairdresser&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact I already sent the name and link to a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or sticky</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product because you are NOT able to return it.  </li>
            <li> when you put this in your hair it has a sticky, tacky feel and gave my hair a dull and matte finish and texture.  </li>
            <li> Although I like this product very much, I&#x27;m afraid it does not have enough of it in the tube.  </li>
            <li> I go to the salon every six weeks because my roots need a touch up badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  </li>
            <li> Just terrible.</li>
            <li> The color was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This product is effective and easy to use.  Just ordered my second tube.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and so easy to use.  I have my hair professionally dyed and highlighted approximately every 3 month however, I have noticed that I have been getting grey just above my temple more frequently.  So in an effort to save myself from resorting to have my entire hair done sooner I decided to give this product a try and I am soooo glad I did.  My hair is light brown with highlights and I ordered the light brown and its perfect!  I would def. recommend this product to everyone.  As a matter of fact I already sent the name and link to a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> I tried out colors in the store but they were out of this color. I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before, but on the advice of my hair stylist thought I would give it a try.  She only mentioned to get one that has a mascara wand as this one did.  I needed a quick fix for the grey grow out on the part line for an upcoming wedding and this worked perfectly.  I have blonde/brown hair and she instructed me to get the light brown which was a perfect match.  It helps if you hold the hair down on the part line and then use the brush quickly as it tends to stick to the hair.  Once you have the method down, it is easy to apply.  I will always keep one of these on hand for those last minute touch up emergencies when you are into the 5th week or so of grow out and just need to cover up that grey part.  5 stars!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the feel of my hair afterwards. Very sticky and clumpy feeling. Very obvious. Not a natural look. Would rather use a boxed touch up kit.</li>
            <li> Although the color is darker than I expected, I like the wand applicator and the ease of application.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments when I use this on my eyebrows and it stays until I wash it off.</li>
            <li> great product quick shipping</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  I thought it was a temporary dye, it is not.  It is like a mascara.  If I put it on after I style my hair, it maked my hair wet and then the style is gone, because I have wavy hair.  If I put it on before I style my hair, when I brushed my hair, it came off.  If I run my fingers thru my hair, after it dries, I looked like I had charcoal on my fingers.  You would be better off to use a waterproof mascara on your hair, then it wouldn&#x27;t come off on your hands.  Just terrible.</li>
            <li> Rated it 3 stars because the brush size is different.  It&#x27;s bigger than the original ones causing the contents to splatter when the brush is removed from the tube.  Luckily, I saved my old tube and brush that I&#x27;m using instead of the brush that came in the tube.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t last. You have to keep constantly doing touchups. It&#x27;s okay for what is meant to be. But not a long-lasting fix</li>
            <li> Just like I wanted, this is like a good mascara wand and applies the product well.  It is more of a paint than a stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am editing my post to say that although this product goes on decently, and the color is okay (could be darker because I got light brown after people said to go lighter), after it dries it has a smell.  I don&#x27;t know if other people can smell it, but it smells funky, like corn starch powder.  I&#x27;m disappointed that I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> My husband has used other cover-up products for around the edges of his hair, his brows, and his mustache. Dreamlook Greyfree blends perfectly giving a wonderfully natural look.</li>
            <li> have ordered this product before.  product works very well.  my husband is very happy with purchase.  will order product again.</li>
            <li> I discovered this nifty little product at my hairdresser&#x27;s. I use it all the time between visits to the hair salon. Its easy to apply and works perfectly. I am so glad that I discovered Greyfree!</li>
            <li> Great item for in between hair colorings</li>
            <li> The product is what it is and does what it says it will do.  If you struggle with the \\&quot;complexity\\&quot; of a mascara wand this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this product is great for in between touch ups. I can go at least two more weeks between colorings when I use this product to cover the new grays at the root.  Of course it&#x27;s going to feel a bit tacky as it dries as a couple of other reviewers have noted. The product DOES have to bond to the hair.</li>
            <li> this is my second order of this product because it works well.  only wish they sold it in bigger containers.</li>
            <li> Covers the grey quick and easy. I wish it were waterproof but other than that it&#x27;s perfect!  Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I go to the salon every six weeks because my roots need a touch up badly. I think I am probably about 40-50% gray now, but don&#x27;t plan to find out for sure. I start getting a white stripe down my part in about 5 wks or less. This product helps me not look ridiculous for that last week before my appt. It does just enough not to draw attention to my grays. You do have to be careful because it can get a little messy. I seem to get it all over my hands and I would make sure it was dry on your hair before pulling a top over your head. Other than that I think it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I purchased light brown but it is more of a dark brown. It goes on very wet also. I am going to purchase the blond and see if it turns out a light brown! I guess I can give it one more chance since it isn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for using between salon hair color appointments.  I highly recommend this product for anyone that wants to keep the grey roots from showing.  It is easy to use, and is used after blow dry on dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product to touch up gray or white beards. My beard is light brown but It gets white if I let it grow out a little. Well I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this is by far the best. I will be ordering this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> when you put this in your hair it has a sticky, tacky feel and gave my hair a dull and matte finish and texture.  The color was terrible. I could not use it.  I do not recommend this product because you are NOT able to return it.  They will only accept returns if it&#x27;s defective and they ship you a replacement.  I am throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with pale skin in the winter (nice and tan in the summer, even with sun block and a wide brim hat) and my eyebrows are so thin that they just about don&#x27;t show. So I use this to darken them enough to give me some color.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. In theory, it sounds like a good idea. BUT, the minute it touched my hair and I tried to apply it, my hair stuck to the wand and pulled out the hair. Even if I barely touched the hair it locked on tight. A mascara type wand does not work.</li>
            <li> Great price for something that will last a while.  Great coverage and easy to apply.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or sticky</li>
            <li> I have white hair and mostly grey eyebrows. I use this product on my eyebrows and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Although I like this product very much, I&#x27;m afraid it does not have enough of it in the tube.  I have purchased it at Beauty World before, and it always seemed like it had plenty, even a little too much at first.  Both bottles I bought seemed rather dry.</li>
            <li> It really does cover the grey spots that you might have here and there.  Whatever color you pick for your hair, it will blend in with your original hair color.</li>
            <li> Even use this for my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my eyebrows. Its much easier to use then a pencil and blends in much better. The brush end of the applicator is wide for easy applying. I got the brown and if applied lightly it blends in with my changing coloring. If you wish a darker color then reapply a few more times. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for in between hair coloring.</li>
            <li> Great, convenient cover-up of the gray hair in eyebrows.</li>
