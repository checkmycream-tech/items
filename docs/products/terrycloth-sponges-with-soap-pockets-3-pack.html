    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>I liked the terrycloth sponges but would recommend it being wider.</li>
            <li>These are great and they do exactly what they say.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have anywhere in my tub to hang it, so I stored it on top of a washcloth instead of hanging it by its cord.</li>
            <li>There is no way that you can reach most of your body with the cords provided.</li>
            <li>Any wash cloth is better.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of it  holding the bar of soap, or pieces of soap for me</li>
            <li>It is good for smaller pieces of soap and is handy.  </li>
            <li>For the price its the best you can find, and i have looked around and tried a few types.</li>
            <li>I just dont understand why nobody makes the one&#x27;s available in Europe.</li>
            <li>Really want something of a thinner quality that I can add soap to easily.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to find this product, as I thought is would be a great to use up small pieces of soap.  </li>
            <li>Trying to use up a large coffee can full of leftover soap pieces.</li>
            <li>These soap carriers are quite useful but they really need much longer cords.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a much thinner bag.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>My initial impression quickly worsened.</li>
            <li>I would prefer them to not have the foam padding that runs down one side; but they are fine.</li>
            <li>I love not struggling with soap fragments or small pieces.</li>
            <li>If I would have put more than two small bars of soap in the pouch maybe they would have stayed in during use.</li>
            <li>I thought Terrycloth would be more like dishtowel thick</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more bath towel thick.</li>
            <li>A couple of weeks later I picked it up and found it was full of black mildew on the bottom,</li>
            <li>This material is very thick making it take longer (and more water usage) to lather.</li>
            <li>Surely Ivory soap is not that caustic.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;d wrung out the sponge inside the soap bag, apparently it retained enough moisture to foster growth of the mildew.</li>

            <li> The sponge does not hold its shape, but compresses down into something that is difficult to hold.</li>

            <li> I was initially disappointed when I first received these. I thought they had a drawstring, but it&#x27;s just a cord to hang them up with. So it can&#x27;t be used with soap pieces the way a bag with a drawstring can.     My initial impression quickly worsened. The terry cloth these are made of is poor quality. I used one of the bags with a bar of Ivory soap in it. The next day I found out that half the loops of the terry were gone -- just dissolved somehow. Surely Ivory soap is not that caustic. I&#x27;ve never had a regular terry cloth washcloth disintegrate like that.     I was disgusted and didn&#x27;t use the bag for a couple of weeks. I didn&#x27;t have anywhere in my tub to hang it, so I stored it on top of a washcloth instead of hanging it by its cord. A couple of weeks later I picked it up and found it was full of black mildew on the bottom, despite that my bathtub doesn&#x27;t have that black mildew except in a few places between the tiles that were too stubborn to get clean. Even though I&#x27;d wrung out the sponge inside the soap bag, apparently it retained enough moisture to foster growth of the mildew. Bad design. At that point I threw the thing in the trash. I&#x27;ve never seen such a lame soap bag in my life.</li>
            <li> I like this item but not sewn properly I had to repair myself</li>
            <li> The problem with the soap pocket is that the soap keeps falling out.  There is no string from the soap falling out.  It is quite worthless.  Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I was looking for a much thinner bag. This material is very thick making it take longer (and more water usage) to lather. I thought Terrycloth would be more like dishtowel thick but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more bath towel thick.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I hate waisting anything so I figured there was a lot of soap going in the garbage. These are great and they do exactly what they say. My only con of this item is the slot is small, therefore if you collect a few pieces it gets a little bulky but all in all for the price and the fact that you get 3 of them I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> These soap carriers are quite useful but they really need much longer cords.  There is no way that you can reach most of your body with the cords provided.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work. I put soap inside one and the sponge never soaked it up. It was a miserable excuse for a bath sponge.</li>
            <li> Any wash cloth is better. Too small &amp; seems like product for a child.</li>
            <li> It is good for smaller pieces of soap and is handy.  Not as big as a regular washrag and so not as convenient.</li>
            <li> Works great. Trying to use up a large coffee can full of leftover soap pieces. Great price.</li>
            <li> I got these to hold soap slivers, but they don&#x27;t hold any thing. I tried cutting the so called sponge out. Well it is not a sponge but some kink of Styrofoam. Just something else to fill up your garbage can.</li>
            <li> For the price its the best you can find, and i have looked around and tried a few types. I just dont understand why nobody makes the one&#x27;s available in Europe.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to find this product, as I thought is would be a great to use up small pieces of soap.  However, not much soap escapes the holder.  The sponge does not hold its shape, but compresses down into something that is difficult to hold.</li>

            <li> I love the idea of it  holding the bar of soap, or pieces of soap for me it&#x27;s all about not droping it in the shower and trying to  retrieve the soap.&lt;br /&gt;But the loop that you hold on to often tears very soon after a few times of use.</li>
            <li> These are kind of awkward, the soap is too insulated by the foam padding. But they do lather up soon enough. I would prefer them to not have the foam padding that runs down one side; but they are fine. I love not struggling with soap fragments or small pieces.</li>
            <li> These let me use the soap all the way to the end of the bar without the waste</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to save on soap since I always end up with chips of soap that I can do nothing with. Now, I use the little sponges and they work wonders in the shower! I think this is something that will work well for years to come!</li>
            <li> they were not good, soap did not come thru like expected.  Waste of $5</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it much. If I would have put more than two small bars of soap in the pouch maybe they would have stayed in during use.</li>
