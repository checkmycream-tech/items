    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>very good to seal cuticles and strengthen</li>
            <li>This one is great.  </li>
            <li>This is a good treatment for your hair.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>The best result is to also use hot rollers after I style my hair.</li>
            <li>but now I can deal with it more effectively.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I just didn&#x27;t love this product.  </li>
            <li>Phyto makes a tub conditioner that is SOO much better.  </li>
            <li>I think Pantene provides more repair and silky smoothness than this.  </li>
            <li>It reinforces the smoothness, gives body and even though it falls, it still looks better than it used to.</li>
            <li>I use this every day and found it worked much better than the cheaper hyaluronic acid conditioner, Episilk.</li>
            <li>i lke the pump, make it easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to give it more time to see if it&#x27;s actually worth the effort</li>
            <li>i love that phytokeratine conditionner, my hair were soft and  easy to detangle after using that product!</li>
            <li>This is a very good conditioner that will not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>so I have some good hair days, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>I did not know what to expect; however, after leaving the conditioning on for a period of time, and rinsing out, my hair was very soft and better manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too much humidity for my fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I do think that the effect of this is better than when I was using drugstore shampoos and conditioners, but I just don&#x27;t love it as much as other salon products.</li>
            <li>Really rich and thicky and REALLY repairs hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and most conditioners are too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact the product last even after you wash your hair.  </li>
            <li>I was curious to try this because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about this brand.  </li>
            <li>No phenomenal results but good product.</li>
            <li>Gave a generic results, but ended very quickly.</li>
            <li>attracts moisture into my hair, which is starting now to look more normal.</li>
            <li>hair is medium texture, black female, and it was certainly a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it was when I got home that the product really payed</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is high; however, the product certainly worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love phyto products in general and i would definitely buy again</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>Used to live in the northeast</li>
            <li>Due to hormonal imbalance the ends look fried to a crisp despite frequent trims and much conditioning.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy and the fragrance is light.</li>
            <li>This was really below the standard that I had for Phyto.  </li>
            <li>but I only use it once a week now and it seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought of my hair as being more on the coarse side but lately by cutting it more often, finding the right hair products, and washing/styling less frequently it&#x27;s been feeling and looking the healthiest it has in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone who want instant soft, manageable hair.</li>
            <li>Such a shame because this made my hair sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and this conditioner seems to weigh it down a little -</li>
            <li>It is a little bit heavy for my fine hair.</li>

            <li> I was curious to try this because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about this brand.  For context, I have thick, shoulder length hair that is naturally dirty blonde, but that I color treat (highlight, tone, base bump) to be a lighter shade of strawberry blonde.  I&#x27;ve always thought of my hair as being more on the coarse side but lately by cutting it more often, finding the right hair products, and washing/styling less frequently it&#x27;s been feeling and looking the healthiest it has in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I just didn&#x27;t love this product.  I find my hair feels softer and looks shinier with the products I&#x27;m already using ([[ASIN:B00HX2JGDU Davines Oi Shampoo 9.46oz &amp; Conditioner 8.45oz DUO]] and [[ASIN:B007XN2NMK DevaCurl Combo No-Poo Cleanser + One Condition Conditioner (12 oz Duo) 2 Piece Set]].  For some reason using this Phyto Keratine Reparative Conditioning Treatment for Unisex, 5.07 Ounce my hair didn&#x27;t feel as soft and had a rather dull look to it.  I do think that the effect of this is better than when I was using drugstore shampoos and conditioners, but I just don&#x27;t love it as much as other salon products.</li>
            <li> This had no effect on my hair what so ever. I will stick to my Argan oil. I think conditioning should provide a difference.</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect; however, after leaving the conditioning on for a period of time, and rinsing out, my hair was very soft and better manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium texture, black female, and it was certainly a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is high; however, the product certainly worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who want instant soft, manageable hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy and the fragrance is light. A little bit goes along way!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has done wonders for my hair. Only takes a little bit and leaves it shiny and manageable without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This is a very good conditioner that will not weigh your hair down. And you only have to leave it on for one minute.</li>
            <li> Gave a generic results, but ended very quickly.Doesn&#x27;t worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a protein based conditioner and my hair looooves protein. Unfortunately I see they are discontinuing this conditioner so I am stocking up. Such a shame because this made my hair sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> Phyto makes a tub conditioner that is SOO much better.  Really rich and thicky and REALLY repairs hair.  This was really below the standard that I had for Phyto.  I think Pantene provides more repair and silky smoothness than this.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Item came in a previously opened box, but it seemed like it was intact. Love phyto products in general and i would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and this conditioner seems to weigh it down a little - but I only use it once a week now and it seems to work really well.  I&#x27;ll need to give it more time to see if it&#x27;s actually worth the effort</li>
            <li> This is a good treatment for your hair. It is not harmful and it helps your hair increase strength. Yea...</li>
            <li> I go to Paris every summer and my hair ALWAYS looks horrible while I&#x27;m there. Too much humidity for my fine color treated hair. It makes it blow up, lose all smoothness. I live in Arizona so I have some good hair days, especially in the winter. Used to live in the northeast so there is nowhere I have lived or visited that I don&#x27;t have issues with my lousy hair. I thought I might try something bought locally while in Paris...they MUST be used to dealing with this problem. I bought the phytokeratine shampoo and conditioner. But it was when I got home that the product really payed off.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Kerastase serum on wet hair but I think when it runs out I&#x27;ll try the Phyto version. The best result is to also use hot rollers after I style my hair. It reinforces the smoothness, gives body and even though it falls, it still looks better than it used to. Maybe now I&#x27;ll stop moaning about my lousy hair. I can&#x27;t change what grows out of my head but now I can deal with it more effectively.</li>
            <li> i love that phytokeratine conditionner, my hair were soft and  easy to detangle after using that product! i lke the pump, make it easy to use</li>
            <li> A little pricey.  Works well, but not better than lower-priced product.  It is a little bit heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fragile, sparse post menopausal hair. Due to hormonal imbalance the ends look fried to a crisp despite frequent trims and much conditioning. This IS expensive so I gave it 4 stars, but a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hyaluronic acid in this product attracts moisture into my hair, which is starting now to look more normal. I use this just on the fried ends - mix a small amt with water in my palm and apply to the ends after shampooing, leaving it in all day. I use this every day and found it worked much better than the cheaper hyaluronic acid conditioner, Episilk.</li>
            <li> very good to seal cuticles and strengthen</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and most conditioners are too heavy.  This one is great.  I put a little on and finish cleaning my body and then rinse.  My comb glides through my wet hair.  Super</li>
            <li> Good. No phenomenal results but good product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact the product last even after you wash your hair.  For optimal use for damaged hair, dont rinse product but leave in for an hour or so then rinse out.  you will find your it repairs your hair past the next couple of hair washings.</li>
