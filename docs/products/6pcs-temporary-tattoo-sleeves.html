            <li> [[VIDEOID:66b6405555f7642f688e6b343f34aeba]] üé¨ Video Review üé¨&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‚úèÔ∏è Plus Bonus Top 5 Beau Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;If I had 30 seconds to chat with someone who is considering purchasing this, I would share these top 5 things from my own experience of the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1‚É£ Looks real if your skin color is the same as these. Note: Works best for Caucasian type skins.&lt;br /&gt;2‚É£ Fooled quite a few people from a far.&lt;br /&gt;3‚É£ Not for people with big arms. If you&#x27;re skinny, these will work.&lt;br /&gt;4‚É£ Cheaply priced. Note: They&#x27;re super-thin nylon type material.  Put them on carefully or you might rip them.&lt;br /&gt;5‚É£ Excellent variety of designs.  Note: there&#x27;s one design where there&#x27;s some nudity (not the one I show in the video... it&#x27;s another one showing a nun with no shirt on. Everything&#x27;s showing! Just keep this in mind if you&#x27;re getting this for a kid.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful! Note the company sent me this product to demonstrate on video and offer my personal opinion. I don&#x27;t work for them, nor am I paid anything that might sway my personal opinion of this product&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;üìç Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?&lt;br /&gt;üëç Yes, absolutely.</li>
            <li> They were great- wore as part of a tattoo artist outfit!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this its pretty lo not too short and looks pretty realistic and covers the sun.</li>

            <li> great but could be longer and thicker</li>
