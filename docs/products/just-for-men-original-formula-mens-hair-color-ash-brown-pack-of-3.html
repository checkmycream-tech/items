            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair product.</li>
            <li>very nice product.  </li>
            <li>It is the best color for my hair and complexion - light brown hair, very fair skin.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that is no longer available.</li>
            <li>Ideally, I&#x27;d have to use this product every two weeks to stay on top of the gray.  </li>
            <li>perfect color for light brown hair</li>
            <li>Excelent seller, good product.&lt;br /&gt;Tannks</li>
            <li>Good price for the package.</li>
            <li>This was a good option for us.</li>
            <li>Good company to deal with.</li>
            <li>So glad we can still purchase this wonderful product online, as most stores no longer seem to carry it.</li>
            <li>Really good product and nice price</li>
            <li>Very happy customer right here and even more happy that I got to try it for free through smiley360.com!!</li>
            <li>Very handsome, nice jacket.</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and now I feel confident and super happy to be seen in pictures!!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best hair color system for my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair color for guys is a niche market at best, so it doesn&#x27;t make any real sense to discontinue a product (as this company does).</li>
            <li>For this kind of price you can&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>Easy to purchase!  </li>
            <li>The solution that came out of the applicator bottle was very, light brown in color ....</li>
            <li>So glad to see 3 pack offered through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Problem is that within a week, I see gray strands popping up on the sides and top of my head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I looked on Amazon for this.</li>
            <li>After years of buying the four or so choices in the local stores I looked here and found many more choices and this color matches my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>Ash brown is a perfect color for a natural light brown look.  </li>
            <li>It was a change for the better (IMO).</li>
            <li>Yes, you have to time it, but you get more product</li>
            <li>Great natural color, that lasts.</li>
            <li>practicle and fairly priced and works very well.</li>
            <li>This is a good color - the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; in the brown helps make the color look more realistic than the medium or light brown colors.  </li>
            <li>I am happy it didn&#x27;t change my hair color into red like most hair products do.</li>
            <li>I think it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>what else can I say,it works just fine</li>
            <li>I used to not feel comfortable taking pictures before I used just for men</li>
            <li>I bought it on Amazon since it&#x27;s no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>It did wonderful hiding the grey hair and even better making it look natural!</li>
            <li>We were both so excited.  </li>
            <li>he had a full head of light brown hair.</li>
            <li>After having tried Just for Men once, and loved it, my next order included 3 packs (cheaper that way).</li>
            <li>Much more gentle than &amp;#34;Auto Stop&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li>The new stuff doesn&#x27;t look too appealing and it&#x27;s pricey.  </li>
            <li>His hair was naturally light brown, but from reading reviews, it appeared that hair colors would turn out much darker.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more natural I guess</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>However, all the rest were very positive</li>
            <li>It darkens to the right color.  </li>
            <li>I use it right after getting my haircut and it lasts about a month.</li>
            <li>Right Color.</li>
            <li>However,the quality depends on choosing the right color for your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful to Amazon for culling the remaining supply of this particular product and to make it available.</li>
            <li>(I have very large hands).</li>
            <li>This product is great and we were not able to find it in retail stores in the amounts we use.</li>
            <li>Also, there are large gloves that fit reasonably well</li>
            <li>The new formula had more of a generic, men&#x27;s cologne smell to it - not too strong</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve been happy with the product but have seen several &amp;#34;formula changes&amp;#34; over that time.</li>
            <li>It looks like a normal light brown until under direct light say in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>This was hard to find and it looks like it will work great.</li>
            <li>This is a great color - I have a hard time finding it in stores.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for stocking this!</li>
            <li>When I first met my husband he looked likee</li>
            <li>Ash brown is very popular and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I discovered that when under direct light from a lamp he was more 50-50 grey and brown.</li>
            <li>Most blond and light brown shampoo-in hair colors will start to turn orange or red on some people&#x27;s hair after several days, so I have been a long time user of this shade since it blends in some &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; color making my hair look more</li>
            <li>The light brown color is too dark and any blond color is too light.</li>
            <li>I paid more than usual because it was available.  </li>
            <li>The glove size is way too large for my hands.  </li>
            <li>I realize guys with large hands like the glove size.  </li>
            <li>The most recent batch I received came from Amazon (not one of their partners) and may have been yet another new formula.</li>
            <li>I use this product (bought locally) and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Does a goog job of covering and concealing the white/gray hair very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for carrying all of them.</li>
            <li>Fast forward 18 years</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think much of it and proceeded to mix up a batch.</li>
            <li>in that it darkens later in the process but never had the solution be so light in color at the start.</li>
            <li>This shade of \\&quot;Just for Men\\&quot; really fills the bill.</li>
            <li>Finally, thanks to Amazon, we have a reliable and affordable supply of men&#x27;s dye</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They are all good for a few days, but within a week or two the results are always the same.   </li>
            <li>Heard they were discontinuing this particular color.  </li>
            <li>It is a true medium ash brown that doesn&#x27;t look coppery either right after dyeing, or after a few washes.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look artificially dark, extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>Other colors are readily available.  </li>
            <li>This product is far better than any of the expensive women&#x27;s hair color products I&#x27;ve used; it actually covers the very gray, or rather white, hair which no other product has done, and with such great coverage, it really works in about 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li>My husband uses this about once every two months or so and even though he complained at first when I suggested he try it, I notice now that he&#x27;s perfectly fine using it.</li>
            <li>(I ran out of auto stop and had to open 2nd package for full coverage).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be fine if the dyed hair simply went gradually back to gray, but no such luck.</li>
            <li>the appropriate color can be hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I tried to find it locally (in our huge city), and on vacation (in big chain stores in various towns), and never had any luck.</li>
            <li>My husband has greyed prematurely, and was frequently being asked if he was our son&#x27;s grandfather.  </li>
            <li>It looks so natural.  </li>
            <li>He loves the natural effect.</li>
            <li>Lasts several weeks without much fading.</li>
            <li>I have a professional apply mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right color for someone who doesn&#x27;t want a huge difference in appearance, bur rather just a little slight graying.  </li>
            <li>It does its job quickly (10 minutes) and my hair later doesn&#x27;t fall out like other products.</li>
            <li>And each time in between i waited several weeks to grow out the previous copper before i planted a new Just For Men in order to grow a fresh crop of orange.  </li>
            <li>It hides just enough gray to make me not look so old!</li>
            <li>Make sure and shake the mixed solution hard for five minutes or you will not get it mixed well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stink so bad and 5 minutes is great.  </li>
            <li>I use a shampoo that is formulated for color treated hair, but even still, the color just doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near what they say it should.</li>
            <li>To me Ash Brown is the only color that doesn&#x27;t look fake on me, and when I couldn&#x27;t get it locally anymore in my own town</li>
            <li>We first tried a dark blonde, and after 4-5 days, the color was fine, but it appeared very fake looking and had a orange-ish tint the first several days.  </li>
            <li>all the others were to dark and did not look natural,i would highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> I use a shampoo that is formulated for color treated hair, but even still, the color just doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near what they say it should.</li>
            <li> To me Ash Brown is the only color that doesn&#x27;t look fake on me, and when I couldn&#x27;t get it locally anymore in my own town</li>
            <li> We first tried a dark blonde, and after 4-5 days, the color was fine, but it appeared very fake looking and had a orange-ish tint the first several days.  </li>
            <li> all the others were to dark and did not look natural,i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it would probably cover all the grey if left in longer!</li>
            <li> took some of the red out but leaves some of the grey in.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t leave it on long enough, it will not get the job done.</li>
            <li> Works well and has natural finished look - plastic gloves supplied by manufacturer are worthless, so get your own.</li>
            <li> ,I will keep using as long as they make it</li>
            <li> Plenty of product even for long hair.</li>
            <li> Ladies products include very small gloves, which, if you&#x27;re a man or a woman with large hands, are really rather ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the other colors because it turns my hair Red.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t have crazy coppery colors.</li>
            <li> none of them carry the ash brown - at least none of the stores near me.  </li>
            <li> so it works for me as I expected.</li>
            <li> I shook the mixture as the instructions indicated and jumped in the shower a few minutes later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even harder if you&#x27;re looking for an easy-to-use men&#x27;s dye.</li>
            <li> I have checked several drug stores in our area and they think it&#x27;s not available anymore.</li>
            <li> (they have all the other colors)</li>
            <li> other change I noticed was a change in the fragrance of the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually cheaper through Amazon or one of their partners (vs. any local drug stores).</li>
            <li> I have used ash brown for years and ash brown is hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if I use medium brown, dark brown, darkest brown, ash brown... Orange, orange, orange are the results.</li>
            <li> I use this color (Ash) for my dark brown/black hair.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the glove size.  </li>
            <li> If you leave it on too long,it&#x27;s too dark and</li>
            <li> Oh, and the Auto-Stop doesn&#x27;t work because it doesn&#x27;t make an allowance for previously colored hair.</li>
            <li> Use the brown tone twice and it will make your hair almost black.</li>
            <li> again not like in previous applications where it was noticeably darker.</li>
            <li> says he doesn&#x27;t feel like a fake he just shaving off the total grey</li>
            <li> I  hope it doesn&#x27;t go missing</li>
            <li> I applied the solution anyway and after a few minutes, the solution did darken.</li>
            <li> This seller may have outdated, expired boxes since it just simply dos not color a sh!t.  </li>
            <li> My husband now looks 10 years younger without having that fake orange color the 1st few days.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy 6 two packs to get a lower shipping rate.  </li>
            <li> not sure if I liike that</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed the color base (in the smaller bottle) looked different in that it wasn&#x27;t as brown as I recalled it being.</li>
            <li> Sorry to hear that - probably end up going grey</li>
            <li> It did, however, had a hard time covering my gray.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the Ash Brown shade is hard to find in the stores in my area or it is out of stock when I need it..</li>
            <li> Boy, is it hard to find a brown dye without reddish undertones or overtones.</li>

            <li> Difficult to Impossible to find at a retail store.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores, either because they don&#x27;t stock it or because it flies off the shelves.</li>

            <li> This was hard to find and it looks like it will work great.</li>
            <li> Works well and has natural finished look - plastic gloves supplied by manufacturer are worthless, so get your own.</li>
            <li> I am happy it didn&#x27;t change my hair color into red like most hair products do. It did, however, had a hard time covering my gray. Next time I will keep it on longer than the instructions sugest.</li>
            <li> For this kind of price you can&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> practicle and fairly priced and works very well. Does a goog job of covering and concealing the white/gray hair very well.</li>
            <li> Ash brown the appropriate color can be hard to find.  This works great.  Doesn&#x27;t stink so bad and 5 minutes is great.  Just remember guys, use something to stop you from getting dye marks on your skin, and shave the neck hair that is gray!  Nothing worse than seeing some guy who dyes his hair and the has lots of gray neck hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now tried several Just For Men colors. They are all good for a few days, but within a week or two the results are always the same.   Copper!   It&#x27;d be fine if the dyed hair simply went gradually back to gray, but no such luck. As the color fades, orange is left in its place. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I use medium brown, dark brown, darkest brown, ash brown... Orange, orange, orange are the results. And each time in between i waited several weeks to grow out the previous copper before i planted a new Just For Men in order to grow a fresh crop of orange.  Haven&#x27;t you seen men with copper hair color and wonder why they would dye their hair that color! It&#x27;s not them, it&#x27;s the product!   This review is for all the men who slink away thinking it must be something wrong with them or how they applied the product. No, no, and no. Should be our response. This product is not the answer for us.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine why this stuff is so pricey.</li>
            <li> Very happy w this brand of hair coloring! I used to not feel comfortable taking pictures before I used just for men and now I feel confident and super happy to be seen in pictures!! It did wonderful hiding the grey hair and even better making it look natural! U can&#x27;t tell I colored my hair at all! Very happy customer right here and even more happy that I got to try it for free through smiley360.com!!</li>
            <li> This review is specifically for the Ash Brown color. It is the best color for my hair and complexion - light brown hair, very fair skin. I am saddened that I am unable to find it in stores anymore. The light brown color is too dark and any blond color is too light. Thank you, Amazon, for stocking it. Please don&#x27;t stop!</li>
            <li> Really good product and nice price</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that is no longer available. What&#x27;s a man to do?</li>
            <li> Sometimes the Ash Brown shade is hard to find in the stores in my area or it is out of stock when I need it..So glad to see 3 pack offered through Amazon. I use the product on regular basis and so it works for me as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great color - I have a hard time finding it in stores.  Only CVS seems to have the Ash Brown.  Walgreens, Rite Aide, Target, Safeway -- none of them carry the ash brown - at least none of the stores near me.  The price on Amazon was about $1 cheaper per box than what CVS&#x27;s regular price is.  This is a good color - the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; in the brown helps make the color look more realistic than the medium or light brown colors.  Problem is that within a week, I see gray strands popping up on the sides and top of my head. Ideally, I&#x27;d have to use this product every two weeks to stay on top of the gray.  I use a shampoo that is formulated for color treated hair, but even still, the color just doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near what they say it should.</li>
            <li> I use this color (Ash) for my dark brown/black hair.  I can&#x27;t use the other colors because it turns my hair Red.  You just leave this in for 20 minutes.  It darkens to the right color.  You can call Just for Men and confirm this..they are the ones who told me this if I have the red color issue.</li>
            <li> This product is far better than any of the expensive women&#x27;s hair color products I&#x27;ve used; it actually covers the very gray, or rather white, hair which no other product has done, and with such great coverage, it really works in about 5-10 minutes (I leave the product on the sides of of my head where the hair is the whitest). Also, there are large gloves that fit reasonably well (I have very large hands). Ladies products include very small gloves, which, if you&#x27;re a man or a woman with large hands, are really rather ridiculous. After having tried Just for Men once, and loved it, my next order included 3 packs (cheaper that way).</li>
            <li> Why did they stop making this product?  I think it worked just fine. I went around and bought-up what I could find in the stores.  I have been ordering it online since they stopped stocking in the stores.  The new stuff doesn&#x27;t look too appealing and it&#x27;s pricey.  Once I run out of the product, I quess I will just let my hair turn gray.  I prefer to do it than buy the reformulated stuff in the store.</li>
            <li> I have used ash brown for years and ash brown is hard to find locally.  Other colors are readily available.  I usually buy 6 two packs to get a lower shipping rate.  My only complaint is the glove size.  The glove size is way too large for my hands.  I realize guys with large hands like the glove size.  Maybe a smaller size glove could be suplied also?</li>
            <li> So glad we can still purchase this wonderful product online, as most stores no longer seem to carry it.</li>
            <li> Heard they were discontinuing this particular color.  Sorry to hear that - probably end up going grey</li>
            <li> To me Ash Brown is the only color that doesn&#x27;t look fake on me, and when I couldn&#x27;t get it locally anymore in my own town (they have all the other colors) I found it on Amazon.  Thanks for stocking this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I looked on Amazon for this. After years of buying the four or so choices in the local stores I looked here and found many more choices and this color matches my hair perfectly. I didn&#x27;t even know they made all these different colors. Thanks to Amazon for carrying all of them. I use this about once a month. I use it right after getting my haircut and it lasts about a month. Make sure and shake the mixed solution hard for five minutes or you will not get it mixed well. Also, I leave mine on for ten minutes and that seems to last longer than just leaving it on five. Great product and easy to use. It hides just enough gray to make me not look so old!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best hair color system for my hair. It does its job quickly (10 minutes) and my hair later doesn&#x27;t fall out like other products.</li>
            <li> The is the only brown-toned hair color for men that doesn&#x27;t give my hair red highlights. I hope, I hope they never discontinue it. Are you listening Just for Men? Oh, and the Auto-Stop doesn&#x27;t work because it doesn&#x27;t make an allowance for previously colored hair. Use the brown tone twice and it will make your hair almost black.</li>
            <li> My husband has greyed prematurely, and was frequently being asked if he was our son&#x27;s grandfather.  :(  He decided to try coloring his hair.  His hair was naturally light brown, but from reading reviews, it appeared that hair colors would turn out much darker.  We first tried a dark blonde, and after 4-5 days, the color was fine, but it appeared very fake looking and had a orange-ish tint the first several days.  I read the reviews on this one, but there was one that said it turned their hair orange.  However, all the rest were very positive so we gave it a try.  I have to say that this one was perfect!!  It didn&#x27;t look fake at all and it doesn&#x27;t have an orange tint at all to it.  It looks so natural.  The directions do say that this is for men with mostly grey hair, but ash brown was their natural color before going grey, which totally applies to my husband&#x27;s hair color.  We were both so excited.  My husband now looks 10 years younger without having that fake orange color the 1st few days.  Excellent product...I just wish they sold this in stores.</li>
            <li> When I first met my husband he looked likee he had a full head of light brown hair. I discovered that when under direct light from a lamp he was more 50-50 grey and brown. Fast forward 18 years, this dye seems to do the same thing. How I don&#x27;t know. It looks like a normal light brown until under direct light say in the bathroom. He loves the natural effect. says he doesn&#x27;t feel like a fake he just shaving off the total grey look.&lt;br /&gt;He only leaves it in 4 minutes it would probably cover all the grey if left in longer!</li>
            <li> perfect color for light brown hair all the others were to dark and did not look natural,i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great natural color, that lasts.</li>
            <li> I like the color what else can I say,it works just fine,I will keep using as long as they make it</li>
            <li> If anyone plans to use it leave on for 20 to 30 minutes. Start with the front then the sideburns...finally the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li> Works well. Right Color.</li>
            <li> Ash brown is a perfect color for a natural light brown look.  Doesn&#x27;t look artificially dark, extremely easy to use. Will take 10 or 15 years off your look. Can&#x27;t recommend it more highly. Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Excelent seller, good product.&lt;br /&gt;Tannks</li>
            <li> Best color I&#x27;ve found.  I bought it on Amazon since it&#x27;s no longer available in stores.  I  hope it doesn&#x27;t go missing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of JFM #20 Ash Brown for several years. Overall, I&#x27;ve been happy with the product but have seen several &amp;#34;formula changes&amp;#34; over that time. The most recent batch I received came from Amazon (not one of their partners) and may have been yet another new formula. I will explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the shrink-wrapped, 3-pack I received and saw a notation on the packaging that this formula was somehow improved with a &amp;#34;no drip&amp;#34; feature. Didn&#x27;t think much of it and proceeded to mix up a batch. I immediately noticed the color base (in the smaller bottle) looked different in that it wasn&#x27;t as brown as I recalled it being. I proceeded to mix anyway. It looked a bit creamy/white in color. I shook the mixture as the instructions indicated and jumped in the shower a few minutes later. The solution that came out of the applicator bottle was very, light brown in color .... again not like in previous applications where it was noticeably darker. I applied the solution anyway and after a few minutes, the solution did darken. They elude to the darkening in the instructions ....in that it darkens later in the process but never had the solution be so light in color at the start. Could have been a fluke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other change I noticed was a change in the fragrance of the product. It was a change for the better (IMO). I hated they smell of the previous formula .... but it would fade after the next hair washing. The new formula had more of a generic, men&#x27;s cologne smell to it - not too strong though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;ve used the product for about 10 years now and have been very happy with it. I find that I have to apply every 2-3 weeks though, else gray starts to peek through and becomes noticeable. With every passing week, the brown starts to transition to a red&#x27;ish color. The product is a bit pricey. It&#x27;s usually cheaper through Amazon or one of their partners (vs. any local drug stores).</li>
            <li> Boy, is it hard to find a brown dye without reddish undertones or overtones. It&#x27;s even harder if you&#x27;re looking for an easy-to-use men&#x27;s dye. This shade of \\&quot;Just for Men\\&quot; really fills the bill. It is a true medium ash brown that doesn&#x27;t look coppery either right after dyeing, or after a few washes. And let me tell you, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores, either because they don&#x27;t stock it or because it flies off the shelves. I tried to find it locally (in our huge city), and on vacation (in big chain stores in various towns), and never had any luck. Finally, thanks to Amazon, we have a reliable and affordable supply of men&#x27;s dye that&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t have crazy coppery colors.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hair stylist recommended this product and color to just take the edge off his white/gray hair.  It&#x27;s the right color for someone who doesn&#x27;t want a huge difference in appearance, bur rather just a little slight graying.  My husband uses this about once every two months or so and even though he complained at first when I suggested he try it, I notice now that he&#x27;s perfectly fine using it.</li>
            <li> Good price for the package.</li>
            <li> This product is great and we were not able to find it in retail stores in the amounts we use. This was a good option for us.</li>
            <li> Item as desribed. Good company to deal with. Will buy from again. A+++</li>
            <li> Most blond and light brown shampoo-in hair colors will start to turn orange or red on some people&#x27;s hair after several days, so I have been a long time user of this shade since it blends in some &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; color making my hair look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;But if you like it, get it here, because WalMart doesn&#x27;t carry this shade, and WalGreen&#x27;s has quit carrying it in my locations.</li>
            <li> I wanted to return this product to the seller however it is consider non-returnable. The color does not work at all. I use this product (bought locally) and it worked fine. This seller may have outdated, expired boxes since it just simply dos not color a sh!t.  Very angry for being stupid and not  thinking that since they are not in stores, it must be  a reason!</li>
            <li> Very handsome, nice jacket.</li>
            <li> I received just one package of 3 boxes. I paid for two packages. I was overcharged.</li>
            <li> because for years I&#x27;ve been using Just for Men&amp;#34;  ash brown that was lighter iand allowed some of the gray to show. I have checked several drug stores in our area and they think it&#x27;s not available anymore.</li>
            <li> Great!!, Best Color to Blend with Brown Hair.  I have used now for several years.  Difficult to Impossible to find at a retail store.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this color is being eliminated from normal production</li>
            <li> I purchased on line because local stores no longer stocked the color.  I paid more than usual because it was available.  I am guessing that Just For Men is discontinuing the color.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; company doesn&#x27;t have the slightest idea of what the concept of &amp;#34;expanding market share&amp;#34; means. Hair color for guys is a niche market at best, so it doesn&#x27;t make any real sense to discontinue a product (as this company does). I&#x27;m grateful to Amazon for culling the remaining supply of this particular product and to make it available.</li>
            <li> took some of the red out but leaves some of the grey in.  not sure if I liike that but it&#x27;s more natural I guess</li>
            <li> I get it on time always and it is just what I need Thank you Jaime Bronsztein</li>
            <li> Works great.  Covers a white spot with no problem.  Lasts several weeks without much fading.</li>
            <li> Great. Thanks. God bless.</li>
            <li> color has been discontinued</li>
            <li> Great product. Much more gentle than &amp;#34;Auto Stop&amp;#34; color. Yes, you have to time it, but you get more product (I ran out of auto stop and had to open 2nd package for full coverage). Plenty of product even for long hair.</li>
            <li> very nice product.  could not find it locally</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product. However,the quality depends on choosing the right color for your hair. Ash brown is very popular and hard to find in stores. Your quality also depends on the application. If you leave it on too long,it&#x27;s too dark and if you don&#x27;t leave it on long enough, it will not get the job done. I have a professional apply mine. It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Easy to purchase!  Eliminates the hassle of shopping.</li>
            <li> Fades to brassy within a couple of weeks.</li>
    </ol>
