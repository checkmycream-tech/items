            <li>I love the way this works to help with my post gastric bypass gas.  </li>
            <li>I am cursed with the most virulent farts.  </li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be so sure it will solve the problem.</li>
            <li>it does what they advertise, i am a fully satisfy costumer and i keep buying more from them</li>
            <li>but unfortunately most stuff doesn&#x27;t work wheatgrass</li>
            <li>It took her 3 months to get it out of her system and now she is healthy again.  </li>
            <li>Better than nothing at all.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I tried it, it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in the smell of my gas.</li>
            <li>I love these but more important anyone I&#x27;m with appreciates them proably more than me.</li>
            <li>So far I think they this is a great product to have in every family.</li>
            <li>Producte Tastes good, real banana candy like.</li>
            <li>Tried other products Devrom works the best</li>
            <li>Quick shipment too!</li>
            <li>my guests regardless of their age, wealth, beauty or stature get to enjoy and experience during holidays gatherings.</li>
            <li>*the very purpose* of the product !!!</li>
            <li>It does &#x27;exactly&#x27; what it&#x27;s supposed to -- deodorizes your \\&quot;emissions.\\&quot;  :)    </li>
            <li>We have used this many times and it really does help !</li>
            <li>All I can provide is anecdotal evidence, but I (and my girlfriend) most certainly notice a difference between the quantity and odor of my flatulence when I am taking Devrom.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not a bad deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an obscure product right now, but so much more effective than Beano, Gas-x, etc.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any other side effects.</li>
            <li>If I forget to take them, they will quickly remind me and it works fast!!</li>
            <li>The whole point of this product is that you can let go of some gas without fear of creating a bio-hazard, but I find myself wondering whether I am truly within my odor free window if I need to let one go during a meeting.  </li>
            <li>If i had took it the way they direct you to i think that it would have been working better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should give them 4 or 5 stars, but they don&#x27;t completely eliminate odor 100% of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works fine for normal gas, but anything extremely potent (fueled by protein shakes or eggs) can penetrate straight through the Devrom, much to the dismay of myself and my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>and it really smells!</li>
            <li>I can think of all kinds of situations where this would help people:    - Getting married tomorrow?</li>
            <li>After all, who wants to smell something foul when you don&#x27;t have to?!  </li>
            <li>Each body is different, so some people need more doses than others.</li>
            <li>Eight weeks ago I had to stop most of my regular medications in preparation for foot surgery.</li>
            <li>When I had my first colonoscopy 2 years ago, my blood prep work showed I have no lactose enzyme in my body</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I think Devrom should not be used regularly either, just to be safe.</li>
            <li>Initially she swallowed them whole, but when she started chewing them they seemed to work better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t COMPLETELY get rid of ALL odors, but it does help tremendously.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say for certain that the Devrom cured me but in the 20+ years I&#x27;ve been stinky</li>
            <li>I noticed the tablets breaking up into a fine yellow powder and getting everywhere.</li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing that it claims it wil help.</li>
            <li>and I still have very smelly gas....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a gastric bypass and was really hoping it would make a difference</li>
            <li>Digestive Advantage&#x27;s IBS product normalized my bowel movements -- a real miracle -- but really didn&#x27;t do anything for my gas.  </li>
            <li>I had &#x27;really&#x27; smelly gas.  </li>
            <li>These pills work very well, but be prepared-</li>
            <li>How much business do you think you&#x27;ll get?</li>
            <li>I have had gastric bypass, and flatulence and the odor of flatulence is a REAL problem.</li>
            <li>In time, this problem became very severe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various products but this one WINS!</li>
            <li>The other over the counter products aren&#x27;t strong enough, effective enough.</li>
            <li>Also, I thought the price was high considering that the dose is two - four pills 4X per day, so they go fast.  </li>
            <li>She developed tremors, had trouble walking, experienced short term memory problems and confusion.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t taken it since and realise that I&#x27;m completely normal and cured and can&#x27;t remember experiencing much flatulence since then.</li>
            <li>i would rather purchase the tablet it is not bad but next time will consider the tablet.</li>
            <li>however, please remember that no one gas and stool is without older.  </li>
            <li>(High sulfur and methane content is what causes the smell, BTW.)  </li>
            <li>it works just a little better then over the counter products</li>
            <li>After having bariatric surgery, a couple of years ago, my husband still suffered with gas and odor, a common condition after having any kind of abdominal surgery.    </li>
            <li>(I have a normal digestive system still)</li>
            <li>took two a day on most days for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I will warn, however, that they can turn your stools darker than they might normally appear.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product - again, when it&#x27;s taken frequently, it WORKS!  </li>
            <li>You can try to crush the tablet, but he takes it easily when hidden in his food.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re very surprised to not have heard of this product before since it does work so well.  </li>
            <li>is completely odorless too!  </li>
            <li>Worth a try if you have problems, but not sure if it&#x27;s worth $20 a month.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and extremely well.</li>
            <li>My daughter took this product for 6 months and developed toxic poisoning as a result.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate the problem at all.  </li>
            <li>ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am determined to keep using it until i find something more natural because at least it is reducing the eggie farts of days gone by.</li>
            <li>I have farted during socially sensitive situations thinking that I would be odor free only to find out that the active ingredients had not yet made their way to the portion of my intestines which were producing the death gas.  </li>
            <li>less than the full dose.</li>
            <li>Writing this review is embarrassing, but not half as embarrassing as passing gas that smells</li>
            <li>This product is great when you know you&#x27;re visiting family or friends and you don&#x27;t want to worry about leaving the bathroom with an unpleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>If this happens to you, I would stop for a few days (three) just to make sure that it&#x27;s actually the pills causing it and not an upper GI bleed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any major problems, just death gas.</li>
            <li>DEVROM (when taken frequently enough) gets rid of the smell COMPLETELY.  </li>
            <li>Apparently they work for some people but not others.  </li>
            <li>For occasional use when it is vital to have odor control, it&#x27;s worth the money, but not for regular everyday use.</li>
            <li>Will complete this bottle before making final decision as to its actual effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li>I had RNY gastric bypass surgery two years ago, hence the occasional need for some relief from flatulence odor, particularly when I am going to be in public a long time, like on airplanes or at social events.  </li>
            <li>Other side effects that I noticed is our stools are darker than normal but nothing to be alarmed about.</li>

            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate the problem at all.  </li>
            <li> ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am determined to keep using it until i find something more natural because at least it is reducing the eggie farts of days gone by.</li>
            <li> I have farted during socially sensitive situations thinking that I would be odor free only to find out that the active ingredients had not yet made their way to the portion of my intestines which were producing the death gas.  </li>
            <li> less than the full dose.</li>
            <li> Writing this review is embarrassing, but not half as embarrassing as passing gas that smells</li>
            <li> This product is great when you know you&#x27;re visiting family or friends and you don&#x27;t want to worry about leaving the bathroom with an unpleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> If this happens to you, I would stop for a few days (three) just to make sure that it&#x27;s actually the pills causing it and not an upper GI bleed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any major problems, just death gas.</li>
            <li> DEVROM (when taken frequently enough) gets rid of the smell COMPLETELY.  </li>
            <li> Apparently they work for some people but not others.  </li>
            <li> For occasional use when it is vital to have odor control, it&#x27;s worth the money, but not for regular everyday use.</li>
            <li> Will complete this bottle before making final decision as to its actual effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> I had RNY gastric bypass surgery two years ago, hence the occasional need for some relief from flatulence odor, particularly when I am going to be in public a long time, like on airplanes or at social events.  </li>
            <li> Other side effects that I noticed is our stools are darker than normal but nothing to be alarmed about.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem to be far less.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this to people with excessive flatulence who are going to be in socially sensitive situations continuously and can also continuously keep the dosing up.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I noticed my stools were dryer and darker and some reduction in gas odour and frequency, though not completely.</li>
            <li> This must be a requirement when you happen to be with others who are unknown to you especially when you are in the beginning of a relationship.</li>
            <li> , I have taken multiple courses of antibiotics, I can&#x27;t take cultures and probiotics due to mould allergies, and nothing else in my life has changed.</li>
            <li> Anyone with digestive problems that cause unpleasant gas will be able to stop worrying about offending others.  </li>
            <li> is going to cause trouble, and it generally alleviates quite a bit of the issue.</li>
            <li> My husband has an illeostomy (his colon is removed so his small intestine excrement goes directly into a bag) and it can smell very foul (worse than baby poo).  </li>
            <li> now many foods gas me up bad.  </li>
            <li> works great, even on the horrible gas I have&lt;</li>
            <li> If you carry the bottle around with you, be careful.</li>
            <li> My only problem is the cost if you have to take it everyday.</li>
            <li> I take 6 per day and can say that it is partially effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works as I expected it to work.</li>
            <li> There were a few times it worked for me, but I had to take several for that to happen.</li>
            <li> may work for other people not me</li>
            <li> Other members of my family have started taking it as well.</li>
            <li> Please beware that it will make your stool dark.</li>
            <li> I had my gastric bypass in 2001 - and to this day if I am not careful of what I eat, it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> The flavor is a bit odd, but it is not too hard to chew properly.</li>
            <li> High Protein diets cause extra unpleasant gassiness --</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> so bad people ask me if I&#x27;m all right.</li>
            <li> It makes things far less unpleasant for me and those around me.</li>
            <li> I usually take two before a meal that I know</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Australia and they don&#x27;t sell Devrom or any equivalents here, but after suffering from the worst hydrogen sulfide and methane based gas for more than 20 years, I went googling.</li>
            <li> Now, I drink lemon juice a lot -- usually just added to lemonade -- and that cuts the gas a lot.  </li>
            <li> Also, I need to take two tablets before meals for it to work, and it usually takes some time for effect.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they work, or not.</li>
            <li> This makes it hard to work in small areas.</li>
            <li> Hard to blame it on the dog if he is not around...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to remember taking 4 times a day every day</li>
            <li> you must plan ahead so that you have them &#x27;on board&#x27; at least 48 hours before you need them to work.  </li>
            <li> So sorry it is not sold in other countries as I have to replenish supplies when visiting the US.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not for anyone experinencing heavy gas, bariatric patients for example, this product does work!!</li>
            <li> I was concerned about unpleasant smells while in public.  </li>
            <li> Realize what a serious business / customer service practice this represents?</li>
            <li> Our 7 yr old Wheaton Terrier suffers from gas and bad breath, no matter what food we try.</li>
            <li> I initially got this pill because my pit has HORRIBLE gas.</li>
            <li> Neither did their Gas Therapy product, unfortunately.      </li>
            <li> And who pays for all the angst of angry customers whose credit cards are charged with the wrong product?</li>
            <li> She has a complicated health history (including difficult to manage diabetes) and has not suffered any side effects from devrom.</li>
            <li> Before finding  this product, the egg white protein caused terrible sulfuric-odored gas.</li>
            <li> but if I take 8 tablets a day the unpleasant odor is greatly decreased.</li>
            <li> Too bad companies that state their products work can&#x27;t be fined for not telling the truth.</li>
            <li> Too bad I had to pay $20 to find out they do nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I have had bad gas all my life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i did not notice any bad side effects&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering soon</li>
            <li> the Devrom did not work for the gas smell :(  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my dad to try to reduce the odor of his horrible gas.</li>
            <li> Now I can get my protein in by using the egg whites but without the horrible gas.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item is good it relieves some of the odor from Gas and stool however, please remember that no one gas and stool is without older.  Please beware that it will make your stool dark.</li>
            <li> I initially got this pill because my pit has HORRIBLE gas. He farts like a grow a$$ man I swear! I also started taking them just to make sure they work. I give my pit one tablet a day and I take one every night. So now when I hear him pass gas there&#x27;s no stench that follows, not to mention I am literally odorless now! I can honestly say my *ish doesn&#x27;t stink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have reported as a side effect is a black-ish tongue/spit but what I noticed is if I just swallow the pill instead of chewing it I don&#x27;t have that problem. Other side effects that I noticed is our stools are darker than normal but nothing to be alarmed about.</li>
            <li> I am three years post-bariatric surgery. This product works relatively well. It doesn&#x27;t COMPLETELY get rid of ALL odors, but it does help tremendously. In all fairness though, I have never taken the maximum dose. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> So they sent the cps instead of the chewable. I&#x27;m trying them anyway. These work for maybe 50% of people from what I am told. The chewable did not work for me so maybe the cap will.</li>
            <li> Our 7 yr old Wheaton Terrier suffers from gas and bad breath, no matter what food we try. A friend recommended we try Devrom and after I checked it out, (vet supply stores also carry it) I have to say, amazing. We no longer have to leave the room when our dog smiles in his sleep. You can try to crush the tablet, but he takes it easily when hidden in his food.</li>
            <li> I had my gastric bypass in 2001 - and to this day if I am not careful of what I eat, it&#x27;s not good. This makes it hard to work in small areas. Deverom is perfect. It removes all smells if taken correctly and reduces gas (which I don&#x27;t think they claim, but it is a nice add on). I will forever be seeking to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete waste of money. Too bad companies that state their products work can&#x27;t be fined for not telling the truth. This does absolutely nothing that it claims it wil help. A complete waste of money. Don&#x27;t be fooled as i was.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was told by my Doctor that it would help eliminate the smell from excess gas being I am a Gastric Bypass patient I now have A LOT of embarrassing gas and it really smells! Well I have taken these pills now for almost a month and I still have very smelly gas....they do not work! Don&#x27;t waste your money on them.</li>
            <li> I have Death Gas. I don&#x27;t know why. I eat well, exercise, take probiotics, and drink plenty of water. I&#x27;ve been to GI doctors and nutritionists. I&#x27;ve tried an elimination diet to find food triggers. Everything about my digestion is great except for the smells it makes.    Writing this review is embarrassing, but not half as embarrassing as passing gas that smells so bad people ask me if I&#x27;m all right. I started taking two of these every morning, and the smell was immediately gone. Nothing. I don&#x27;t know why more people don&#x27;t take this; I want to give it out like breath mints. I can think of all kinds of situations where this would help people:    - Getting married tomorrow? Devrom.  - Road Trip? Devrom.  - Third Date? Devrom.  - RVing? Devrom.  - Job Interview? Devrom.    Somebody give them some marketing- this should be sold in grocery stores.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I had gastric bypass surgery and now many foods gas me up bad.  This takes the odor out of the gas so it is not as embarrassing.</li>
            <li> After having bariatric surgery, a couple of years ago, my husband still suffered with gas and odor, a common condition after having any kind of abdominal surgery.    After seeing his nutritionist and having her recommend Devrom, we tried it and it works. Two to three tablets once or twice a day and the odor associated with the flatulence is gone.      This, in my opinion, is the best product for people who have had bariatric surgery, etc. The other over the counter products aren&#x27;t strong enough, effective enough.</li>
            <li> My husband has an illeostomy (his colon is removed so his small intestine excrement goes directly into a bag) and it can smell very foul (worse than baby poo).  DEVROM (when taken frequently enough) gets rid of the smell COMPLETELY.  I was so impressed, I started taking it and my excrement and gas (I have a normal digestive system still) is completely odorless too!  We&#x27;re very surprised to not have heard of this product before since it does work so well.  After all, who wants to smell something foul when you don&#x27;t have to?!  HIGHLY recommend this product - again, when it&#x27;s taken frequently, it WORKS!  Each body is different, so some people need more doses than others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for about a month with no noticible difference. I&#x27;ve had a gastric bypass and was really hoping it would make a difference but the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is the color of my stool is darker but the smell is the same.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> All I can provide is anecdotal evidence, but I (and my girlfriend) most certainly notice a difference between the quantity and odor of my flatulence when I am taking Devrom. I usually take two before a meal that I know is going to cause trouble, and it generally alleviates quite a bit of the issue. I hope it works as well for you as it does for me.     If you carry the bottle around with you, be careful. I noticed the tablets breaking up into a fine yellow powder and getting everywhere. Maybe better to keep it in your desk...</li>
            <li> I still pass a lot of gas but if I take 8 tablets a day the unpleasant odor is greatly decreased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Australia and they don&#x27;t sell Devrom or any equivalents here, but after suffering from the worst hydrogen sulfide and methane based gas for more than 20 years, I went googling. I ordered some Devrom to be shipped here after reading some great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took two a day on most days for a few weeks. I noticed my stools were dryer and darker and some reduction in gas odour and frequency, though not completely. Eight weeks ago I had to stop most of my regular medications in preparation for foot surgery. I haven&#x27;t taken it since and realise that I&#x27;m completely normal and cured and can&#x27;t remember experiencing much flatulence since then. Even after eating Indian curries, there is no smell. Before I would have to sequester myself for 24 hours whenever I ate anything containing onion or garlic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for certain that the Devrom cured me but in the 20+ years I&#x27;ve been stinky, I have taken multiple courses of antibiotics, I can&#x27;t take cultures and probiotics due to mould allergies, and nothing else in my life has changed.</li>
            <li> This is great but you have to take it regularly. It doesn&#x27;t cure but it help a lot. My only problem is the cost if you have to take it everyday.</li>
            <li> Apparently they work for some people but not others.  Too bad I had to pay $20 to find out they do nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t praise this product highly enough.  It does &#x27;exactly&#x27; what it&#x27;s supposed to -- deodorizes your \\&quot;emissions.\\&quot;  :)    Digestive Advantage&#x27;s IBS product normalized my bowel movements -- a real miracle -- but really didn&#x27;t do anything for my gas.  Neither did their Gas Therapy product, unfortunately.      Now, I drink lemon juice a lot -- usually just added to lemonade -- and that cuts the gas a lot.  Helps to create an acid environment in the stomach.      For the remaining gas, I take DEVROM.  I had &#x27;really&#x27; smelly gas.  (High sulfur and methane content is what causes the smell, BTW.)  Devrom successfully eliminates that.  If you have a problem with odor from flatulence, you have to check this product out.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had bad gas all my life.  When I had my first colonoscopy 2 years ago, my blood prep work showed I have no lactose enzyme in my body so it doesn&#x27;t matter what I eat, my gas will have you slain!  Then I ran across Devrom, read and researched then bought.  I take 6 per day and can say that it is partially effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on what I eat, it will work or not.  My gas can still smell after beans, eggs, fruit, and cheese.  A different smell, yet a smell just the same.  It still smells like a metallic fart from someones ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am determined to keep using it until i find something more natural because at least it is reducing the eggie farts of days gone by.</li>
            <li> The mistake that i made is to buy the chewing which i believe is a preference. If i had took it the way they direct you to i think that it would have been working better. To be honest i miss and skip a lot. i would rather purchase the tablet it is not bad but next time will consider the tablet.</li>
            <li> As a patient who had a great deal of colon surgery I was concerned about unpleasant smells while in public.  This product is a god send for me and has allowed me to go shopping, out to eat, movies, etc. with cofidence!  I feel part of my community now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so grateful for manufacturer of this product for they have provided peace of mind to great number of ielostomy patients.</li>
            <li> These pills seem to work for what they say. I noticed no smell after using the product. I will warn, however, that they can turn your stools darker than they might normally appear. If this happens to you, I would stop for a few days (three) just to make sure that it&#x27;s actually the pills causing it and not an upper GI bleed. If it is the pills, you can keep taking them. I haven&#x27;t experienced any other side effects.</li>
            <li> I had RNY gastric bypass surgery two years ago, hence the occasional need for some relief from flatulence odor, particularly when I am going to be in public a long time, like on airplanes or at social events.  These pills work very well, but be prepared- you must plan ahead so that you have them &#x27;on board&#x27; at least 48 hours before you need them to work.  Also, I thought the price was high considering that the dose is two - four pills 4X per day, so they go fast.  For occasional use when it is vital to have odor control, it&#x27;s worth the money, but not for regular everyday use.</li>
            <li> Devrom is a great product for anyone that suffer from smelly flatulance. Two pills, chewed, is all you will need.</li>
            <li> bought these for my mom who has a colostomy.  they work great when she takes them.  she doesn&#x27;t like the taste of them though.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and find it amazing. So sorry it is not sold in other countries as I have to replenish supplies when visiting the US.</li>
            <li> I had gastric bypass and took Devrom for quite some time.  It works great!! I did notice though, that if I took a Ranitidine tablet for heartburn,(nothing to do with the Devrom) the Devrom did not work for the gas smell :(  The two must interact in some way. However, I would definitely recommend this product because it is Awesome...It&#x27;s like a miracle.</li>
            <li> I love the way this works to help with my post gastric bypass gas.  It works as I expected it to work.</li>
            <li> Producte Tastes good, real banana candy like. No funky after taste and works well eenough and I would purchase this product ago.</li>
            <li> I am cursed with the most virulent farts.  In Mary Roach&#x27;s book, &amp;#34;Gulp,&amp;#34; she recommended Devrom for this problem. It works!  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> So far I think they this is a great product to have in every family. I will buy again soon.</li>
            <li> This is just what I ordered, doesn&#x27;t work unless you take every day.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;http://www.google.com/url?sa&#x3D;t&amp;rct&#x3D;j&amp;q&#x3D;Devrom+tablets+cost+price+purchase+order+recommended&amp;source&#x3D;web&amp;cd&#x3D;2&amp;ved&#x3D;0CC8QFjAB&amp;url&#x3D;http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDevrom-09-0748-DEVROM%25C2%25AE-Internal-Deoderant%2Fdp%2FB0045WG1P2&amp;ei&#x3D;SnEjU9C2KOro0gGUvYGYBw&amp;usg&#x3D;AFQjCNHDtkrvBjDrxDQvVpehR6mp_y9ZLw&amp;sig2&#x3D;v8C-9fxBVX0fF_OBKElEhQ&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The misspelled word describes *the very purpose* of the product !!! Realize what a serious business / customer service practice this represents? What if someone is searching for &amp;#34;Devrom&amp;#34; but your website misspells it by JUST ONE LETTER so your selling site instead says &amp;#34;Devron&amp;#34;. How much business do you think you&#x27;ll get? And who pays for all the angst of angry customers whose credit cards are charged with the wrong product?</li>
            <li> I have had gastric bypass, and flatulence and the odor of flatulence is a REAL problem. I have taken these pills, but I swear I can&#x27;t tell if they work or not. It seems sometimes that they do, and then, suddenly, I am peeling paint again.</li>
            <li> Tried other products Devrom works the best</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my dad to try to reduce the odor of his horrible gas. It did change the smell, but it was no improvement.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. I need to take 4 pills a day. My stinkers are now just winders. ha, ha.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for GB patients - I wouldn&#x27;t be without it! If youhaven&#x27;t tried it I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The tablets took care of the problem my wife was having would recommend them to anyone with a like problem.</li>
            <li> works great, even on the horrible gas I have&lt;br /&gt;i did not notice any bad side effects&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering soon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been popping two of these three times a day for a week now... less than the full dose. I can fart with impunity. They&#x27;ve been rendered harmless. Plus I don&#x27;t drive my wife and daughter out of the house when I have to use the bathroom. I actually checked to see if the company is traded on the stock exchange. It&#x27;s such an obscure product right now, but so much more effective than Beano, Gas-x, etc. Initially, I assumed the tagline, &amp;#34;Internal Deodorant,&amp;#34; was an exaggeration. It&#x27;s not. It sums Devrom up perfectly.</li>
            <li> Item shipped on time. Also, I need to take two tablets before meals for it to work, and it usually takes some time for effect.</li>
            <li> I bought devrom for my mom who had gastric bypass about 5 years ago.  Although she has lost the weight and feels great she was suffering from a lot of gas and gas pain. She started taking devrom about 5 months ago and feels she has improved about 98%, she&#x27;d give 4.5 stars if she could. She takes 8 pills a day to keep things under control and recommends them to anyone post gastric bypass suffering from this problem. Initially she swallowed them whole, but when she started chewing them they seemed to work better. She has a complicated health history (including difficult to manage diabetes) and has not suffered any side effects from devrom.</li>
            <li> I had bariatric-bypass surgery in 2010. In time, this problem became very severe. I tried every otc made and nothing worked. During a visit to my doctor, devrom was suggested. I ordered a supply on line. Even after using the entire bottle, it had zero effect on me. I never received a refund, and discontinued use. Don&#x27;t be so sure it will solve the problem.</li>
            <li> it works just a little better then over the counter products</li>
            <li> Read abt this product from Mary Roach&#x27;s Gulp. I take one in the AM and one in PM. Works quickly and extremely well. My husband is happy, as am I.</li>
            <li> Works fine for normal gas, but anything extremely potent (fueled by protein shakes or eggs) can penetrate straight through the Devrom, much to the dismay of myself and my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they work, or not. Have only remembered to take them intermittently.</li>
            <li> It gives you about a 2-3 hour window of odor free flatulence which begins approximately 2-3 hours after you take it.  The whole point of this product is that you can let go of some gas without fear of creating a bio-hazard, but I find myself wondering whether I am truly within my odor free window if I need to let one go during a meeting.  I have farted during socially sensitive situations thinking that I would be odor free only to find out that the active ingredients had not yet made their way to the portion of my intestines which were producing the death gas.  I would only recommend this to people with excessive flatulence who are going to be in socially sensitive situations continuously and can also continuously keep the dosing up.</li>
            <li> High Protein diets cause extra unpleasant gassiness -- This doesn&#x27;t eliminate the gas but you don&#x27;t have to worry about clearing a room. Hard to blame it on the dog if he is not around...</li>
            <li> it does what they advertise, i am a fully satisfy costumer and i keep buying more from them i will not go anywhere else for these kind of pills</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this works with taking the smell out of gas/flatulence and also found that body odor isn&#x27;t as noticable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not suffering from any disease, nor have I had gastric bypass surgery.  I read about Devrom in book &amp;#34;Gulp&amp;#34;, by Mary Roach and thought it might help deal with the gas from a high-fiber diet.  While it definitely decreases the smell, it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it entirely.  Worth a try if you have problems, but not sure if it&#x27;s worth $20 a month.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should give them 4 or 5 stars, but they don&#x27;t completely eliminate odor 100% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to be far less. I have&#x27;t run anyone in my family out of the room since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;They are chewable and pleasant tasting.&lt;br /&gt;If you use one a day there&#x27;s over 3 months supply in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s not a bad deal.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to reorder.</li>
            <li> This must be a requirement when you happen to be with others who are unknown to you especially when you are in the beginning of a relationship. Why it is not getting the recognition it truly deserves is beyond me... These are the best freebies my guests regardless of their age, wealth, beauty or stature get to enjoy and experience during holidays gatherings.</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful addition to our vitamin regimen.  We will continue to use it faithfully.  The cost was the lowest that we found online.</li>
            <li> worked maybe oneday for me but unfortunately most stuff doesn&#x27;t work wheatgrass seems to work best may work for other people not me</li>
            <li> My daughter took this product for 6 months and developed toxic poisoning as a result.  She developed tremors, had trouble walking, experienced short term memory problems and confusion.  Doctors thought it was a brain tumor or ALS.  Finally diagnosed by Harvard hospital doctors as experiencing toxic poisoning by bismuth which is the ingredient in Devrom.  It took her 3 months to get it out of her system and now she is healthy again.  This medicine needs to include warnings.</li>
            <li> I had gastric bypass, and this item is something I simply can&#x27;t go without. It makes things far less unpleasant for me and those around me. Other members of my family have started taking it as well. The flavor is a bit odd, but it is not too hard to chew properly.</li>
            <li> I drink liquid egg whites for protein. Before finding  this product, the egg white protein caused terrible sulfuric-odored gas. Now I can get my protein in by using the egg whites but without the horrible gas. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any major problems, just death gas. I tried taking two in the morning and after every meal, even tried increasing the dosage, used it for over seven days, and to no avail. You had one job Devrom.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not for anyone experinencing heavy gas, bariatric patients for example, this product does work!! It cuts the methane smell to almost 0. I love these but more important anyone I&#x27;m with appreciates them proably more than me. If I forget to take them, they will quickly remind me and it works fast!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.It was of no help.</li>
            <li> It has not had the desired effect. Will complete this bottle before making final decision as to its actual effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> these are a lifesaver for me</li>
            <li> it works great at helping to stop diarrhea. We have used this many times and it really does help !</li>
            <li> I bought these for my grandson.  My daughter in-law says they are excellent, and they work just the way the advertising promises they will.</li>
            <li> Maybe 25% reduced smell. It does work, but incomprable to charcoal (2 tablets at a time for occasional use) in effeicacy. I think Devrom should not be used regularly either, just to be safe.</li>
            <li> This product is great when you know you&#x27;re visiting family or friends and you don&#x27;t want to worry about leaving the bathroom with an unpleasant aroma. I&#x27;ve tried various products but this one WINS!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize such helpful treatments existed. Anyone with digestive problems that cause unpleasant gas will be able to stop worrying about offending others.  Quick shipment too!</li>
            <li> I think these tablets are somewhat helpful if taken to maximun dosage every day but it&#x27;s hard to remember taking 4 times a day every day and it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate the problem at all.  Better than nothing at all.</li>
            <li> There were a few times it worked for me, but I had to take several for that to happen. Taking 2-4 in a day didn&#x27;t work. I have a food intolerance and a bacterial problem in my intestines. Most of the time I tried it, it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in the smell of my gas.</li>
            <li> They do not work for Gastric Bypass patients.</li>
