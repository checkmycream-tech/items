            <li>great product feels great on the scalp</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s agreat product for moisturizing the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for aiding in growth and conditioning the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>The brush also is not that great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I TRIED THIS BECAUSE OF MY THINNING HAIR, AND THERE WERE SOME GOOD REVIEWS.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>It seems like a good idea, but it did not give me the results i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Very healthy for the scalp.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m sure it works just as good as it says.</li>
            <li>I was able to scrub my head very gently with awesome results.</li>
            <li>It mixes very easy with baking soda using the end of the brush that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light pine sol smell</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow instructions ;0)...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>When I go in beauty supply stores women ask what I use to keep my hair so healthy</li>
            <li>I LOST MORE HAIR</li>
            <li>I was really anticipating great results from this products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you have baking soda</li>
            <li>I love how it smells</li>
            <li>and I love the texture, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>It just dries out your scalp and makes it itchy, which creates more flakes.</li>
            <li>The whole product line is really good, and works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the texture of the formula, I think this cleans the scalp very well and washes out good too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wash off the mixing cup and scoop and when you rub the clean plastic it feels very clean - not too squeaky clean, but not at all oily.  </li>
            <li>Works best when you use it with other recommended products as part of Organic Roots&#x27; hair re-growth program.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Organic Root Stimulator&#x27;s products, but this one didn&#x27;t do it for me.     </li>
            <li>and I see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>My scalp felt 100% better after the first treatment.  </li>
            <li>I pride mine on being clean</li>
            <li>Works well to get my scalp clean</li>
            <li>, when applied properly (I suggest having someone else apply the scrub, its applied similar to a relaxer, and you want it applied correctly for best results).</li>
            <li>it is super ...</li>
            <li>2 years later, I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product keep my scalp aerated, healthy, dandruff and scab free, it also helped my hair grow tremendously.</li>
            <li>These products are worth the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disgusting right?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It filled in the area and now I have totally new growth.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this was to clean and hydrate my scalp.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re experiencing hair loss and are using a scalp serum and do not see results then first use a scalp scrub follow the direction accordingly and wash, then use the scalp serum</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with CCCA aka hot comb alopecia.</li>
            <li>I have issues with my scalp and dandruff and psoriasis on the top of my head, this has made a big difference.</li>
            <li>&amp; I already see positive results</li>
            <li>Great product - very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Very inconvinient to apply and didn&#x27;t give me any noticible results.</li>
            <li>I used it before and my hair grew s much.</li>
            <li>my hair is falling too much</li>
            <li>I thought it was just a ready to apply cream.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really notice a change in my hair growth.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really assist in my hair growth and now I have to find an alternative for my edges.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because this really cleanses the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I also use the whole line of products.</li>
            <li>This has really improved my scalp.</li>
            <li>When the top of my head started thinning due to stress, I began using this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it does make my scalp feel extra clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product every week for around a month, (mainly around my edges)</li>
            <li>came highly recommended by a family member who has used this product for two years.</li>
            <li>I used the organic root stimulator scalp scrub in combination with my new regimen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still seeing less hair fall, but again, my scalp feels kind of dry.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this I will admit I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because afterwards my scalp was very dry and even flaked a little</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to be able to tell the results, but will re-review later with results.</li>
            <li>Next time I may try adding a little natural oil (castor oil or olive oil) to the mix or just doing a hot oil treatment after to get the moisture back into my scalp, but so far I&#x27;m glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from Relaxed to Natural</li>
            <li>I will try loreal professional scalp scurb product.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised, even though I knew that it would work.    </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  </li>
            <li>My hair is totally natural and i am always looking for products that will continue to stimulate the scalp &amp; encourage growth.</li>
            <li>Then I washed with the Uplifting shampoo (again using the scalp brush lightly) and finished the the mizani conditioner again but leaving it in for a few minutes this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used other products which worked  of this brand which have worked very very well.  </li>
            <li>It looks like a thick, light brown hair grease</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed with this purchase since every other ORS product I&#x27;ve bought has been wonderful for my hair.</li>
            <li>and my I had light spots in my hair due to the scarf being so tight.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I rinsed with water first, then with a little [[ASIN:</li>

            <li> I have a very dry scalp and up until I purchased this product not much worked for me.</li>
            <li> I started of by using head and shoulders then moisturizing my scalp and laying off blow dryers, but that only helped a little bit.  </li>
            <li> For some unknown reason, my hair started breaking off, I had a little bit left over, and used it.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times, maybe it had some effect by providing oils and minerals to my scalp</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps someone else b/c I had spent hundreds on other products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> A long time ago I used this product in conjunction with other ORS products because I had a bald spot that came from a too tight weave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling with excessive hair shedding and dry, tight, tender, scalp for the last 3 or so years.  </li>
            <li> There are other things that you can do to stimulate your scalp instead of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell when I have only used it 3 times.</li>
            <li> too harsh for my hair which is soft also to us with baking soda making it harsher not good for me</li>
            <li> and I noticed significantly less hair fall.  </li>
            <li> and I have less dandruff.</li>
            <li> BUT it felt less tight and tender</li>
            <li> I randomly went to a new hairstylist who suggested I buy the scrub AND the temple balm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, the little hair I had on the affected areas came off&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you $$.</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> I hated scratching my head in public because people have the tendency to stereotype dreadlocks as dirty.</li>
            <li> so I was desperate to remedy my problem.  </li>
            <li> WAS HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> Anyone with CCCA try it, worst comes to worst</li>

            <li> Very inconvinient to apply and didn&#x27;t give me any noticible results.</li>
            <li> great product feels great on the scalp</li>
            <li> Very messy. worked until I ran out of product</li>
            <li> Great product - very hard to find in stores. I&#x27;ve only had it for roughly 1 month &amp; I already see positive results w/my scalp. Works best when you use it with other recommended products as part of Organic Roots&#x27; hair re-growth program. Be sure to follow instructions ;0)...Prompt delivery from Amazon seller too! Looking forward to future purchases ;0) !!!!</li>
            <li> When the top of my head started thinning due to stress, I began using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It filled in the area and now I have totally new growth. I now use this once a month. I recommend it weekly to start. It has a sulfur component which aids in hair growth.</li>
            <li> A long time ago I used this product in conjunction with other ORS products because I had a bald spot that came from a too tight weave. I used this and it along with the other products nurtured my scalp and hair back. Would use again if needed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I used it before and my hair grew s much. Then stopped using for a while and now years later I am back using it again. I am transitioning from Relaxed to Natural and my I had light spots in my hair due to the scarf being so tight. My hair has grown since using this product. I also use the uplifting shampoo and the protein conditioner from the same line. They all work well together.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a bothersome scalp condition known as folliculitis as well as \\&quot;growing dandruff\\&quot;. When I had an outbreak, itchy bumps pop up in my scalp and sometimes crust over, forming scabs. The topical solution they prescribed me is not covered by my insurance so I would have to spend $90 out of pocket every 2 weeks to purchase it. Looking for a cheaper alternative, I came across Organic Root Stimulator at a beauty supply store and decided to try it. 2 years later, I&#x27;m very glad I did. Not only does this product keep my scalp aerated, healthy, dandruff and scab free, it also helped my hair grow tremendously. My hair went from just below chin length to the middle of my back. I get compliments everywhere I go on the length and health of my hair, even from the hairdresser who trims it every six weeks. When I go in beauty supply stores women ask what I use to keep my hair so healthy and I immediately point them to the Organic Root Stimulator section.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this scalp scrub I was developing a case of dandruff that was embarrassingly itchy.  I hated scratching my head in public because people have the tendency to stereotype dreadlocks as dirty. I pride mine on being clean so I was desperate to remedy my problem.  I started of by using head and shoulders then moisturizing my scalp and laying off blow dryers, but that only helped a little bit.  I used the organic root stimulator scalp scrub in combination with my new regimen.  My scalp felt 100% better after the first treatment.  I now plan to use this product once a month because I&#x27;ve heard it stimulates hair growth too from the women at my local beauty products store.  I had to buy it here because they were SOLD OUT.  I&#x27;ve always sworn by organic root stimulator products.  This one delivers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namaste![...]</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m sure it works just as good as it says.</li>
            <li> my hair is falling too much,I will stop using this product.I will try loreal professional scalp scurb product.The hair brush and the mixing cup is uesful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, so I knew that it would work.  For some unknown reason, my hair started breaking off, I had a little bit left over, and used it. It stopped the breakage immediately.  I was really surprised, even though I knew that it would work.    The whole product line is really good, and works.</li>
            <li> i used religiously but there was no improvement on my hair in a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub to try to make my scalp healthier but it did not work for me. I did not see any changes on my hair or scalp. I only used it a few times, maybe it had some effect by providing oils and minerals to my scalp but I did not feel a difference so i stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this produce twice and it does make my scalp feel extra clean. I think its helping restore hair growth as well.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS BECAUSE OF MY THINNING HAIR, AND THERE WERE SOME GOOD REVIEWS.&lt;br /&gt;THIS WAS HORRIBLE!  TOOK FOREVER TO GET ON THE SCALP, USING THE SCALP BRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;I HAD TO WAS MY HAIR 8 TIMES TO GET IT OUT OF MY HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I LOST MORE HAIR TRYING TO GET THIS STUFF OUT!</li>
            <li> came highly recommended by a family member who has used this product for two years. I am  seeing results after just two weeks.  Have used other products which worked  of this brand which have worked very very well.  My hair is totally natural and i am always looking for products that will continue to stimulate the scalp &amp; encourage growth.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I didn&#x27;t know it had to be mixed with baking soda, left on for 15-20 minutes,and covered with a cap etc, but I&#x27;ve managed to work through the process. I thought it was just a ready to apply cream. I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to be able to tell the results, but will re-review later with results. Jacqueline</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s agreat product for moisturizing the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for aiding in growth and conditioning the hair and scalp. Kudos.</li>
            <li> I was really anticipating great results from this products.&lt;br /&gt;However, this product burned my scalp terribly.&lt;br /&gt;I was peeling big flakes (i.e. the burned scalp).&lt;br /&gt;Disgusting right?  That is how I felt when I saw those flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the little hair I had on the affected areas came off&lt;br /&gt;with the flakes.  Yes, I used the product as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;I did not overuse the product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything that I noticed</li>
            <li> Good Product.If you&#x27;re experiencing hair loss and are using a scalp serum and do not see results then first use a scalp scrub follow the direction accordingly and wash, then use the scalp serum and you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry scalp and up until I purchased this product not much worked for me. I was able to scrub my head very gently with awesome results. I would definitely buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have baking soda</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product every week for around a month, (mainly around my edges) and I didn&#x27;t really notice a change in my hair growth. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Organic Root Stimulator&#x27;s products, but this one didn&#x27;t do it for me.     I love how it smells and I love the texture, but that&#x27;s about it. It didn&#x27;t really assist in my hair growth and now I have to find an alternative for my edges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling with excessive hair shedding and dry, tight, tender, scalp for the last 3 or so years.  I have AA relaxed hair and decided to give this a try.  The consistency of the product in the jar (before adding baking soda) is like honey but not sticky.  It looks like a thick, light brown hair grease but it&#x27;s not as greasy.  It mixes very easy with baking soda using the end of the brush that comes with it.  It has a very light pine sol smell but it didn&#x27;t bother me and the smell washes out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the texture of the formula, I think this cleans the scalp very well and washes out good too.  It&#x27;s very easy to wash off the mixing cup and scoop and when you rub the clean plastic it feels very clean - not too squeaky clean, but not at all oily.  The first time I used this I will admit I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because afterwards my scalp was very dry and even flaked a little BUT it felt less tight and tender and I noticed significantly less hair fall.  The second time I used it, I rinsed with water first, then with a little [[ASIN:B001FXUKDI Mizani Scalp Care Conditioner 8.5oz]] using [[ASIN:B0028R4SRO Shampoo Scalp Massage Brush Century #100 * Made in USA * (1 Blue Brush)]].  Then I washed with the Uplifting shampoo (again using the scalp brush lightly) and finished the the mizani conditioner again but leaving it in for a few minutes this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still seeing less hair fall, but again, my scalp feels kind of dry.  I think it&#x27;s because this really cleanses the scalp.  Next time I may try adding a little natural oil (castor oil or olive oil) to the mix or just doing a hot oil treatment after to get the moisture back into my scalp, but so far I&#x27;m glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> Got rid of the itch In my head and promoted growth.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. It just dries out your scalp and makes it itchy, which creates more flakes. I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> The scalp scrub worked well</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product. it did start to fill in balding spots .  I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Works well to get my scalp clean and I have less dandruff. I also use the whole line of products.</li>
            <li> too harsh for my hair which is soft also to us with baking soda making it harsher not good for me</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in this product</li>
            <li> Jury is still out on this one. It&#x27;s hard to tell when I have only used it 3 times. I will continue to use the product hopefully will see results in 8 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you $$. There are other things that you can do to stimulate your scalp instead of this product. Do your research before purchasing. The brush also is not that great. My hair got caught up in the bristles and it pulled out a lot. I&#x27;m disappointed with this purchase since every other ORS product I&#x27;ve bought has been wonderful for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with CCCA aka hot comb alopecia. I had thinning and balding throughout 60% of my head. I&#x27;m 27 BTW. I was told my hair would NEVER grow back. I was given scalp shots and told to apply an ointment once a day. I randomly went to a new hairstylist who suggested I buy the scrub AND the temple balm. I brought the scrub and they used it during my visit. I ALSO used the temple balm daily. Two weeks later went I went back, she said your hair is growing back. Its been weeks later and I see a huge difference. These products are worth the price and they do work, when applied properly (I suggest having someone else apply the scrub, its applied similar to a relaxer, and you want it applied correctly for best results). Anyone with CCCA try it, worst comes to worst you lose $20. I hope this review helps someone else b/c I had spent hundreds on other products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it once every two weeks. Very healthy for the scalp. Increases circulation and hair growth 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> Still using it but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This has really improved my scalp. I have issues with my scalp and dandruff and psoriasis on the top of my head, this has made a big difference. You mix it with baking soda. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I havnt been using the product regularly. However I have not seen any difference in the amount of dandruff.  The main reason I bought this was to clean and hydrate my scalp.  It seems like a good idea, but it did not give me the results i was looking for.  I will continue to use it and if there are any changes I will offer an update.</li>
            <li> ILOVE  this product!!!!!!!!  it is super ... my hair and scalp feel sooooo good.&lt;br /&gt;i would buy this product again, and i have shared this with my bff.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!</li>
