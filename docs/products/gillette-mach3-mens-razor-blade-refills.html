            <li>The Mach3 are good, but I hear the Turbo are better.</li>
            <li>The shavers are perfect and the real thing.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied, good quality product.</li>
            <li>but I really liked the razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the ones with 4 blades are better, I guess, but these work great.</li>
            <li>Nice buy</li>
            <li>If I was to judge these blades on there own</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have a stockpile.</li>
            <li>Have always liked the shave closeness.</li>
            <li>It is always nice to have a supply of razors on hand.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>the product is excellent and the response by the seller is quite fast and effective, I recommend one hundred percent</li>
            <li>great razors, price is great, repeat delivery is awesome, no more running out of razors.</li>
            <li>Great replacement razor blades, clean close shave.  </li>
            <li>Even though the price is way too high for this product, it does not take away from it being one of the best products done by Gillette...</li>
            <li>Normally I just purchase razor blades at Walmart or Sam&#x27;s Club, but this time I found the best price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good as always, fast delivery to your door at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Consistently good and easy to shave with.</li>
            <li>They are excellent close shaving blades and last a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to uninstall and install on my razor.  </li>
            <li>Good price for razors, they seemed to work just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Work very good, just wish they did not cost so much.</li>
            <li>I am getting a consistently good and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>They cut nice, and I am glad I could save money by purchasing these online.  </li>
            <li>Still the best I have so far used.</li>
            <li>guess you just gotta shell out if you want to be beautiful ;-)</li>
            <li>I have used many razor blades over the years, but have experienced no closer or more comfortable shaves than those provided by the Gillette MACH3 Cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, these were a good deal with an Amazon coupon available at the time.</li>
            <li>Very happy this far with these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much needs to be said for these - they provide a quality shave and with Amazon providing the best price, it was an easy sell.</li>
            <li>Comes good packed and seems original.</li>
            <li>they work FINE!</li>
            <li>Perhaps my beard has become more course.  </li>
            <li>Yep they are razor blades for cheap!</li>
            <li>I will have to pay more attention.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love Mach 3.</li>
            <li>Price is better than shopping at the grocery store that i go to and</li>
            <li>For the money you won&#x27;t find better detachable razors</li>
            <li>This is my favorite blade for shaving my face and head bald.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 for many many years.  </li>
            <li>Who needs more than three blades?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer using them because I think the Dollar Shave Club is a better value.  </li>
            <li>Love the price, better that Costco.  </li>
            <li>love the price here versus even WalMart &amp; Target.</li>
            <li>Amazon could do better.</li>
            <li>Love the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>I love these razors.</li>
            <li>Subscribed to them through Amazon and get a better price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>It was ok</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>My wife better not do that with my razor.</li>
            <li>These are priced much, much better than what I find at Wal-mart.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>Better than going to the store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, upon close inspection of the blades themselves, they seem authentic-</li>
            <li>In such a counterfeit-saturated market, I think it would be best to stick to the letter of your product description.</li>
            <li>Will continue  to use these blades until Gillette developments a better blade</li>
            <li>A month or so ago I decided why not buy these through a reputable site like amazon to save some money?</li>
            <li>I learned to make sure it had a blister sustainable pack.</li>
            <li>use this for most of my shaving life.</li>
            <li>I paid $3.75 more.</li>
            <li>As always, the over the top selling point for these is that they are a fraction of the price one would pay at a retail store.</li>
            <li>Perfect and very low price</li>
            <li>for fusion and proglide i love them/</li>
            <li>Better than most others out there, and they don&#x27;t blow your budget.</li>
            <li>we love the price and the cartridges are great1</li>
            <li>I know it is not you ,whey cost more all over.</li>
            <li>Most things work as advertised</li>
            <li>These are the real thing and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>If I can find a better outlet, I will pursue it.</li>
            <li>We love the convenience and price.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember how many came in this</li>
            <li>are so many counterfeit ones out there</li>
            <li>I love these razors and have been using them for years.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t repeat the experience with mach3 though, unless I find more &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; surprise cartridges lying around.</li>
            <li>I know most people just pick them up at the store, but in this case, we were ordering anyway</li>
            <li>great  price for that much  </li>
            <li>Most are in the &#x27;for months&#x27; category.  </li>
            <li>Good economical package.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get to feel them any more.</li>
            <li>Better control.</li>
            <li>With the excenge rate i can get better deals somewhere also.</li>
            <li>but the blades are so much better.</li>
            <li>Cheap way to get them!</li>
            <li>Razors are authentic Gillette Mach 3 blades.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure</li>
            <li>I replaced with same product from drugstore and got a perfect shave again from blades I could use with confidence.  </li>
            <li>delivered as promised delivery was good I am happy I don&#x27;t know what else to say about such a review.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Gillette Sensors for years and thought I would try Gillette&#x27;s latest marketing innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I switched handles (we have many Gillette handles from years of buying) and still had the issue.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been getting a month or more out of each).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mach 3 blades for many years.</li>
            <li>just costs more.</li>
            <li>that after all the money someone spends with a company that they would be more helpful.</li>
            <li>Easier and Better than purchasing at store</li>
            <li>I use these and love them.</li>
            <li>Still satisfied with order.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should change my blades more often, but I use these for over a month before changing.</li>
            <li>These simply are the best blades on the market.</li>
            <li>a much better buy</li>
            <li>so what more can you say... if you love Mach3 you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>These razors are the best, enough said.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most mark-up items I&#x27;ve ever seem on Amazon</li>
            <li>I love these blades.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and quality indicate these are authentic Gillette blades.</li>
            <li>love the mach3 razors, however the price makes me want to check out dollar shave club.</li>
            <li>if I went through these more often, I&#x27;d complain more, but I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Mach 3 is still my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>Love these razor heads.</li>
            <li>Each one lasts about 15 days or more and the shave is close but not too close.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure)</li>
            <li>perform as I expect for many years now&lt;br /&gt;too</li>
            <li>My favorite for shaving</li>
            <li>More if you don&#x27;t need to shave all that</li>
            <li>In my opinion, having 5 or more blades is an overkill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had more ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Great Price -  Fast Delivery</li>
            <li>/&gt;These razor blades couldn&#x27;t hold an edge for more than four shaves.  </li>
            <li>Better than newer Proglide.</li>
            <li>Love the brand will buy again</li>
            <li>Better price than the stores.</li>
            <li>I have been using these blades for over 10 years and love them.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love em and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>I believe many have found this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again...don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that a gliding razor is a better shave.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with Mach3 blades for many years.  </li>
            <li>I am sure shoplifting keeps brick and mortar stores from even stocking multi-packs with this many razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these blades for many years.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t you love paying $3-$4 per cartridge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try the newest mach and see if thats any better.</li>
            <li>I started using Gillette Mach3 blades many years ago.  </li>
            <li>The best part about these blades is how the backs are completely open.  </li>
            <li>The Subscribe &amp; Save Program used to be much better than it is now.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to shop around.</li>
            <li>Would have had to pay ton more in the store.</li>
            <li>Authentic product and work well with my Mach 3</li>
            <li>We love the Mach3 around here.</li>
            <li>Have not found a better blade to get the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve encountered disposable cheapies that felt like they were designed to tear each whiskers out to the root, so I feel like I&#x27;m acquainted with bad-out-of-box razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth with no cuts, if you do get cuts you&#x27;re not doing it right, lol.</li>
            <li>perfect clean shave for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a nice pack and seems original..</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I think they are good ;-)</li>
            <li>Prices are pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Yes, they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked, then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good razors.</li>
            <li>Good product, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>These were a pretty good price with the discount that was offered.</li>
            <li>Great value for money considering where I live in the Caribbean</li>
            <li>I like them better than the Venus refills because they are more slender and accurate for a close shave on my legs, armpits and bikini line.</li>
            <li>He loves the smooth glide and I love the smooth price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The old Mach 3 &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;No need to change a good thing!</li>
            <li>In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Tried and true, the razors are the best I&#x27;ve found and Amazon has them at a great price.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27; tried many other razors at the store since these seem to be the best deal for the amount of blades.  </li>
            <li>I bought a bunch of these off ebay recently which (though they looked very good)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase and will certainly be ordering more.</li>
            <li>With the current economic problems and costs rising faster than salaries we are all looking for a good deal, and at the price this item was offered it was a very good deal.</li>
            <li>Yes, the fusion glide much better but that does not mean a superior shave.</li>
            <li>And if you sign up for the timed shipping ( I use every six months, as I use one blade every two weeks, plus a couple for travel), you get free shipping AND a better price than at the store.</li>
            <li>, I appreciate the free blade, Razors N More, but</li>
            <li>So glad these are available without the razor.  </li>
            <li>Nice to get so many at such a good price.</li>
            <li>I love this price, free shipping, and not having to remember to pick these up at the store.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Schick Hydro 3 and was careful to get it from the Schick Store on Amazon as well as my blades along with my Prime shipping and am very happy with my decision.  </li>
            <li>If my viewpoint changes, I will update this post, but for now, a nice product, great price, and when I ordered the set of 15, the total was over $25 which gave me the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Lots of hype on other blades but these work the best for me and my face.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good buy!</li>
            <li>This price (subscribe &amp; save, with 4 other products for a 20% discount) is the best!</li>
            <li>I looked at other online stores and this was the best price for these blades at approx.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, if you&#x27;re willing to do everything right and pay close attention for 10 minutes, you can get a great shave with the cheapest razors available.</li>
            <li>The seller sent the items very quickly.</li>
            <li>These systems have their blades spaced appropriately apart to prevent buildup and allow me to clean the blades when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>shaving almost daily for 30+ years now and tried most brands cartridge or disposable.&lt;br /&gt;atra was a great blade</li>
            <li>I love how easy these blades are to clean.  </li>
            <li>Being able to receive items in larger volume and delivered to my door is great.</li>
            <li>easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li>With 3 blades does the job very quick.</li>
            <li>I get more clean shaves from 1 cartridge</li>
            <li>I still use this older style blade and this is a fair price on a subscrbe and save situation.</li>
            <li>I know there are newer, fancier razors out there, but if this works fine</li>
            <li>They seem to work fine though</li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH AMAZON HAS THE BEST PRICE, GILLETTE COULD CHARGE LESS IN MY OPINION.</li>
            <li>and they are fine.</li>
            <li>These cartridges work just fine.  </li>
            <li>These work fine for my Mach 3 handle.</li>
            <li>These blades from Amazon work fine and</li>
            <li>They seem fine to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>these blades are more than adequate for any shaving needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)3 blades per head is more than adequate for quality shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Something is up with the huge discount.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s well established that drying the blades will HUGELY extend the life of the cartridge.</li>
            <li>Fit the razor as they are meant to.</li>
            <li>Hope the coupon is available when I need to refill.</li>
            <li>They are genuine.  </li>
            <li>Genuine product.  </li>
            <li>A great deal overall</li>
            <li>THE ACTUAL QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS GREAT.  </li>
            <li>For my money, the Schick Quattro and the Gillette Mach3 are the only two systems that I&#x27;m perfectly happy with using.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortably buying them there, as I&#x27;d worry about getting third-party blades, rather than geniune OEM blades.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortably buying them there, as I&#x27;d worry about getting third-party blades, rather than geniune OEM blades.</li>
            <li>Specifying that they did not feel like a genuine Gillette product.  </li>
            <li>For myself, the 15 count package is enough for well over a year of shaves, so it&#x27;s great to be one and done.</li>
            <li>I have this on auto-order and invariably I find 1 or 2 blades the pivot locks into one position and will not pivot freely again.  </li>
            <li>These regular mach3 works best foe me better than the sensitive version.</li>
            <li>They were genuine.  </li>
            <li>and when we added this product to our cart on Amazon, we got the free shipping</li>
            <li>Cheap disposables have a tendency to get clogged up causing you to cut your self easier.</li>
            <li>Comfortable shave beyond belief.</li>
            <li>So smooth.</li>
            <li>, my razors arrived and they were indeed genuine Gillette razor blades.</li>
            <li>I purchased another order from Amazon and again recieved genuine Gillette razor blades.</li>
            <li>Price on this deal was fantastic, over 25 % below store prices</li>
            <li>15 of them would last me almost a year which is great.</li>
            <li>Add in free SuperSaver or Prime shipping</li>
            <li>they were the genuine item too...</li>
            <li>My warning light go off.</li>
            <li>It worked like a charm and my head is smooth.</li>
            <li>These ain&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>Free shipping for prime members.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat Amazon for the price, real genuine products delivered fast.</li>
            <li>Same as in the store for a great price.</li>
            <li>The Mach3 creates a smooth shave for both men and women</li>
            <li>They are genuine Gillette Mach 3 blades and my face feels as smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>Leave my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>They are really cheap.</li>
            <li>I feel these were of some cheap china imatation or they just are not of the quality they used to be.</li>
            <li>Truly a smooth close shave for men and women alike.</li>
            <li>Cheap blades?</li>
            <li>They shave perfectly comfortably.  </li>
            <li>For the price these were the perfect gift for a friend with a heavy beard growth.</li>
            <li>Bought a package from CVS and the mach 3 baades were far superior.</li>
            <li>This cartridge is looking good so far.</li>
            <li>great price and fast, fast shipment</li>
            <li>Shaves aren&#x27;t as good as my current favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth and fast transation.</li>
            <li>These are great blades, gives a clean shave and if my stubble is long I don&#x27;t find that the blade gets clogged up so easily like the 4 or 5 blade razors.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re authentic Gillette blades, they were available at a very reasonable price, and I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store for them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend ordering here for cost effective reasons.</li>
            <li>Regardless of how many new products Gillette puts out this will always be my favorite.</li>
            <li>Glad they are still making this model without any of the battery operated funny business these days.</li>
            <li>excellent quality as usual from gillette</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still buying these year after year instead of upgrading to the latest and greatest and more expensive.</li>
            <li>The best price on the net of many vendors from various sites.  </li>
            <li>This is not the original it seems.</li>
            <li>These arrived in factory sealed original un tampered container.</li>
            <li>Came in original package.</li>
            <li>The Fusion blades work well if not a tad better but don&#x27;t justify the higher price.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re face is worth it though!</li>
            <li>I purchased my first package from CVS off the shelf and fell in love with the blades and razor, thought I&#x27;d never use another razor.</li>
            <li>Well packaged and definately original products.</li>
            <li>but thanks to Amazon very good return policy, I will have my money back by returning the cartridges.</li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to locate it on Amazom because it&#x27;s always cheaper to buy in larger quantities.</li>
            <li>good blades that last a while and provide a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved these since they were available back in the day</li>
            <li>On the bright side, I&#x27;m very fashionable now because I don&#x27;t like to shave so much.  </li>
            <li>The MACH 3 system gives you a clean shave every time.</li>
            <li>Special Sale - 5 Boxes of</li>
            <li>These give me a good clean shave and they last quite a while.</li>
            <li>Great, close shave with minimal cuts.</li>
            <li>Also good for several shaves.</li>
            <li>these last a good while.</li>
            <li>So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So</li>
            <li>Good shave and the sharpness seems to last</li>
            <li>Solid razors at a good price ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>of use: Different and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>Still $1.50 per blade would be SWEET hint hint.</li>
            <li>good product and its same as mentioned</li>
            <li>and it ships free if you dont mind the wait, worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the only razor my boyfriend uses and it does a good job getting a close shave.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll learn how to use a straight razor :)</li>
            <li>Maybe a straight blade is better and cleaner, maybe not I&#x27;ve never tried it, but I can&#x27;t shave with anything else.  </li>
            <li>Amazon makes the whole buying experience worthwhile .</li>
            <li>The 3 is the sweet spot.</li>
            <li>Plus cool name, eh?  </li>
            <li>They do last a good while.</li>
            <li>If they are &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or such the are damned good fakes.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>The blades provide a great shave, and purchasing replacement blades is worthwhile -- as long as the blade holder continues to hold the new blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dollar shave club for a few months and their best razor doesn&#x27;t cut as close and smooth as the classic mach3.</li>
            <li>Love my gillet mach 3 razor and needed more heads, will be buying more in the future, they work very well.</li>
            <li>got these due to great price with subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The razors are sharp and work great.  </li>
            <li>Great savings compared to other retailers</li>
            <li>Amazon has helped me save a lot of money on other products, and this is another great example of ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure if it was the blades or the new Gillette model!  </li>
            <li>As always, these blades are super.  </li>
            <li>I love them mostly because of the very low skin irritation level I experience with them.</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower, quickly and with no mirror and use no aftershave and</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the geniuses at Amazon had responded quickly to my Polly Purebred call for help and delivered this product--</li>
            <li>but the hairs get caught up too quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular razor head for many years.  </li>
            <li>More than 3 blades is a waste of money and not as good a shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Closest shave on this planet, like silk baby!&lt;br /&gt;excellent blades, cost and experience for precision quick shavers..</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve worked better than anything since I was 16 years old and Glliette sent me a razor for free.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This was quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is great, my favorite for my delicate skin</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>trick is this: the alcohol quickly dries out any moisture.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Well, these are mighty fine razor blades and still at a decent price.</li>
            <li>A real lubricating strip, the little &#x27;fins&#x27; at the bottom of the blades resume their original shape after being pressed, the blades are in good alignment, are clean, and have what seems to be dots on them indicative of authentic Gillette manufacturing.  </li>
            <li>Next to Gillette&#x27;s stainless, adjustable razor of old, this is the best and easiest shave ever!  </li>
            <li>These are the same blades that you can get at most any supermarket or pharmacy, but it&#x27;s far and away the best price that I&#x27;ve seen (this last thing may change by the time that you read the review).</li>
            <li>received brand new cartridge and am satisfied with the purchase....</li>
            <li>We always use a little hair conditioner on the skin and then the Mach3, with great results.  </li>
            <li>This blad is perfect and I think it gives me a sharper shave and easier for those tough spots.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for quite a few years and have always been happy with them.</li>
            <li>It is smooth against your skin and cuts very close.</li>
            <li>I had so much confidence in Gillette and purchased this 15 count pack but to realize this is of cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I still think razors cost too much, but these are about as cheap as I can find around.</li>
            <li>fresh Mach 3 blades--just the day before.  </li>
            <li>It looked good and shaved like I expected.</li>
            <li>Always by this product and never disappointing I just like this product.</li>
            <li>I get about 3 weeks to a month&#x27;s use out of every one of these, which means for a 15 count box I get about a year&#x27;s worth of shaving.  </li>
            <li>, then I rinse that off, apply shaving cream, and then shave away creating fun patterns and designs, or just taking it all off depending on my mood.</li>
            <li>I am assuming its a conscious decision from P&amp;G (owner of Gillette) to make more money out of cartridges by reducing the quality and longevity of the blade.</li>
            <li>Good price for a blade that seems to be getting harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Works good as expected from Gillette Cartridges.</li>
            <li>I had memories of decades worth of</li>
            <li>I liked that I got an extra discount for subscribing &amp; saving.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the arm, just hold the razor directly in my fingers, which I like better.</li>
            <li>I checked amazon for the fun of it and found that even with shipping, I saved $7 on razors by having them delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>By far Gillette is my favorite brand when we talk about shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>but honestly I was buying these from you last year for $19...seriously, who would pay this price?!</li>
            <li>I have been using Mach 3 Plus blades for years and until I ordered these I had forgotten that regular Mach 3&#x27;s are just as good at a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I expected, delivered quickly, and at a reasonably good cost.</li>
            <li>It was nice to get it right the second try.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products such as the Fusion 5 blades, the girl Gillette razors, and others yet still found the Mach 3 razors to be the best.</li>
            <li>Great price and quantity that is not easily found in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with these blades and much better priced than CVS or other drug stores.</li>
            <li>Wondered about if these were as good as the ones I bought at wal mart or some other store and reading some of the reviews made me suspicious but I have been using these for a while and no problem at all.</li>
            <li>t the right time.</li>
            <li>Water rinses right through.  </li>
            <li>Everyone appreciates a gift that saves them money, right?</li>
            <li>No searching the stores, right at my finger tips..</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with the blades is the top and bottom Aloe Vera lining which quickly falls off.</li>
            <li>The first shave with these razors is excellent and nearly identical to shaves I remember from the past.</li>
            <li>The razors, as usual are great.</li>
            <li>These blades provide a smooth, consistent shave that rarely nicks or cuts you no matter how new the blade.</li>
            <li>PURE JUNK!  </li>
            <li>super fast and excellemt</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how good they are, they&#x27;re half the price anywhere you go.  </li>
            <li>15 cartridges for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and hubby gets a nice clean, close shave with little likelihood of nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>, these Mach 3 blades are great and fit both my Mach 3 and my Mach 3 Turbo handles (which are the same, except the color of the Turbo grip is black, which as we all know makes it faster somehow).  </li>
            <li>Was a great price due to a special offer and the same quality you expect</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to sound like a commercial, but I get a clean shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>The most recent purchase has firmed up my opinion that these razors have either worsened over the years, my face has changed somehow, or perhaps it is</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok razors anyway, but they struggle with thicker facial hair.</li>
            <li>This is the not the first time I&#x27;ve ordered Mach3 from Amazon but what I received was a first for me.</li>
            <li>When you first get your package all goes well.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The shave is pretty indistinguishable between the two.</li>
            <li>I like the lower price mach3 over the higher priced fusion blades.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described/pictured.  </li>
            <li>Out of that package, the first one broke at the hinge rendering it unusable.</li>
            <li>first observation is that what I received was NOT one 15-count blister \\&quot;sustainable\\&quot;-pack of blades as advertised, but rather, two 8-piece cardboard packs.</li>
            <li>and I do them first.</li>
            <li>And I change my blades on the first of the month every month.</li>
            <li>And I change my blades on the first of the month every month.</li>
            <li>sure you only buy your blades from amazon, don&#x27;t get ripped up&lt;br</li>
            <li>The counterfeit blades have an aqua blue strip at the top of the razor, which is gone after one shave.</li>
            <li>I really like them!</li>
            <li>They hurt on first use.  </li>
            <li>First, I don&#x27;t often review anything.  </li>
            <li>I can say they hold up better than the cheaper three blade system that I had ordered recently.</li>
            <li>Surreal.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use one blade for several weeks with these.....</li>
            <li>you know exactly what you are buying.</li>
            <li>Make sure you but ONLY the blister pack of shavers.</li>
            <li>likes it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>These are my husbands favorite razors, after 4 months of Dollar Shave Club, I agreed we could go back to buying these.</li>
            <li>The last batch I received was just okay.</li>
            <li>I had this on auto order and then the price changed pretty dramatically.</li>
            <li>I do wish that these were cheaper, currently they cost about 2.30-2.50 per cartridge depending on how many you buy at once.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>Product as described and a much better deal than purchasing locally.</li>
            <li>They do work much better than the generic two blade versions.  </li>
            <li>For the first time I ordered these blades online.</li>
            <li>Oh, well I&#x27;ll remember the brand names better next year when I have to reorder.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well with instrument.</li>
            <li>With the price of shaving products climbing ever higher you will like this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>From my experience getting a head with more blades doesn&#x27;t improve the overall shaving</li>
            <li>Price is much better here than locally.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find them for him in a big pack as these.</li>
            <li>This is only for the true Gillette Mach 3 blades and not any cheap knock offs (all, buy ones that say they are from Gillette and not Mach3</li>
            <li>Overall, love the performance of the blades.  </li>
            <li>for the pricing, the last time I purchased these from Amazon, it was a much better deal.  </li>
            <li>People who are hesitant, I figure make one purchase and if they are poor quality, you haven&#x27;t lost too much, if they turn out to be good, all the better.</li>
            <li>The new blade was duller and pulled more than the blade that had been on my razor for nearly a month.  </li>
            <li>everything else  was just right thanks</li>
            <li>The price at Amazon is right and the delivery with Prime is fast.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re new, arrived quickly, and saved some money.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and were new.</li>
            <li>used an old REAL cartridge, with about 20 shaves on it and it still cut better than one of these new  (chineese</li>
            <li>I really find that the Fusion cause more ingrown hairs and overall issues after the fact.</li>
            <li>With proper care, one cartridge will give one several good shaves...</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as it was described and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Years ago when they first introduced these the blades lasted much longer.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that there is a long winded way to express the utility of the MACH3 cartridges,&lt;br /&gt;suffice</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The thing is once I find something I like , I pretty much stick with it.</li>
            <li>BTW, if you know someone who uses these or similar expensive blades, they make an awesome and very useful gift idea or stocking stuffer at Christmas time.</li>
            <li>These cartridges certainly give some good shaves, but they cost a small fortune.</li>
            <li>authentic blades are high quality and should last 5 weeks or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get many uses out of each blade which offsets the initial high price.</li>
            <li>That style allows the cut hairs to easily get pushed or wash out of the back without clogging the blades.  </li>
            <li>I wish Gillette would make the large multi-packs for all of their razor blades.</li>
            <li>I certainly would reorder without hesitation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike the many different razors I have used in the past, these Mach3 cartridges give me an amazing, close shave without nicking me all over.</li>
            <li>Works well for me to dry shave every morning although I have gone 3 days and if careful you can still get a great shave</li>
            <li>Quickly swapping the blades, I appreciated the thoughtfulness of how Gillette had put the blades into a clear plastic safety case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Originally I thought my first blade was simply just defective, but that is the case for all the blades in the package as I have tried 7 of them</li>
            <li>, the cost is  very high.</li>
            <li>Large number of blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>As long as you use these as normal blades, they will work just fine!</li>
            <li>I have a very coarse beard, so these cartridges usually provide me with a good clean shave for between 3 and 5 uses.</li>
            <li>That being said the razors themselves are fairly good but it does get dull faster.</li>
            <li>Razors were very sharp and provided a clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Give me my razor with some real moves, some real satisfaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well -- as advertised.</li>
            <li>I like the mach3 maybe not as much as fusion but at a much cheaper cost.</li>
            <li>They just work really well.</li>
            <li>but this reliable gold standard leaves my face baby smooth and without any razor rash.</li>
            <li>Appears to be the real thing.</li>
            <li>so I do the whole prep with homemade shaving oils on my girly bits as a pre-conditioner while I shower</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are the real thing</li>
            <li>I get a much cleaner, closer, shave with the safety razor than I ever did with cartridges at a fraction of the price, with no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason they don&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t genuine gillette mach 3 blades which is obvious by the gel strip.</li>
            <li>and since we are over 10 miles from the closest store, the savings really does add up.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get irritated but lubricant gel fades too fast.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t give nearly as smooth a shave as the Gillette cartridges I get locally.</li>
            <li>These razors are packaged from the factory in very sturdy, sealed packaging.  </li>
            <li>These seem to be the real thing and function well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>I can get 8-10 shaves per cartridge, depending upon how much beard has grown.</li>
            <li>Prices for blades have gotten way beyond reasonable.  </li>
            <li>So much so that retailers often lock them up like jewelry or watches.  </li>
            <li>I am looking for a reasonably priced alternative to the Mach 3 Turbo as well.</li>
            <li>However, these shavers are the real deal.</li>
            <li>Delivered in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>My husband wants me to buy from a brick and mortar, but will give Amazon another try.</li>
            <li>I save so much money buying these.</li>
            <li>But this seems like the real thing to me.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>do not believe these are real Gillette Mach3 blades.</li>
            <li>They give a smooth, close, nick-free shave without any irritation, and the blades don&#x27;t rust when left in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>The price on Prime really cut the cost on this item, without the hassle of looking around for them.</li>
            <li>I had really wanted the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades.  </li>
            <li>Thinking about replacing my razor with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I just think these blades are really over priced.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than Costco and Bjs.</li>
            <li>They cost too damned much to accept that.  </li>
            <li>and really I don&#x27;t care:</li>
            <li>this is the real thing</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s really a testament to the quality of the modern electric shaver than a criticism of the efficacy of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivered fast and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than in store.  </li>
            <li>cant do with out these and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It is time they get some real competition.  </li>
            <li>It is how your face does after that really matters.</li>
            <li>Much faster with this style blade.  </li>
            <li>you really need the 5th blade on the Fusion?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I suspect some of the folks who are claiming these are fake are reviewing an item bought from a different seller or are trying to draw attention away from this great price to direct traffic to their own items.  </li>
            <li>mach3 fans, do yourself a favor: buy a shaving brush (even a cheap  $8 drug store one), a soap puck ($1 for Williams mug soap, or more for fancier brands), learn how to work up a thick lather from youtube videos.</li>
            <li>After 5 blades, it still takes longer than a Sensor, with far more strokes and, only on occasion, can give me as close a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Close in places:  </li>
            <li>Seem kind of dull.not the same as the ones bought locally.</li>
            <li>I saw a set of 8 going for over $20 at the local Big Box, so a nice value here and would definately buy again.</li>
            <li>the first few times I use a blade, because I can easily chop some skin off my skull!</li>
            <li>sure Gillette and the other blade makers are hoping the whole world doesn&#x27;t catch onto this.</li>
            <li>They stay sharp for many many shaves and even when they are dull they still pull through on a clean shave.</li>
            <li>But overall this product is exactly as described and sure saves you money over buying the smaller packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mach3 Turbo is what I normally buy, what a difference!</li>
            <li>many slices on my face &amp; the blades don&#x27;t stay sharp for long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any reason for me to pay more for any other blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t better or cheaper blades, but I&#x27;m not aware of any.</li>
            <li>and they are only good for one below average</li>
            <li>Seriously this is a good deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These Mach 3 cartridges really do an excellent job although I will say that I bought mine in a local brick and mortar store; therefore it&#x27;s hard for me to comment about the mixed reviews that have been posted for this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gillette Mach3 Cartridges 15 Count Package Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, French Vanilla Creme, 5 Pound  French Vanilla Creme, 5 Pound</li>
            <li>My skin can be pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>These blades last a full month for me</li>
            <li>I dont normally buy things like this from Amazon, but these were much cheaper than in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very smooth, no nicks or cuts and last for 3-4 weeks per blade with daily use.</li>
            <li>i have tried all others ,  their 3 blade system works better  than any other !</li>
            <li>Arrived as expected, quality and cost are pretty much at par with wholesale stores, so no cost benefit here, but the convenience factor at no cost makes the order worthy</li>
            <li>My shave was smooth and nick free and the blades stayed sharp for several shaves.</li>
            <li>These are the real deal, made by Gillette, brand new in the package.</li>
            <li>will most likely go back to the store</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been quite happy because I have thick facial hair.</li>
            <li>main reason for giving this product 5 stars is because Amazon is the cheapest place to buy them, and they work well.</li>
            <li>I actually switched my razor to match my husband&#x27;s because it&#x27;s such a better deal...almost $2.00 cheaper per cartridge.</li>
            <li>Plus I think Gillette is over charging for these and taking advantage of lack of decent competition in blade technology.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product as advertised that was offered at a decent price; not counterfeit or reconditioned as some of the reviews</li>
            <li>They seem to last an extraordinary length of time between replacement, which helps justify the cost.  </li>
            <li>Still, a decent value.</li>
            <li>The blades hold up decently.</li>
            <li>These will still give a decent shave without nicks after 3 weeks, so I can&#x27;t complain about the quality.</li>
            <li>It looked like it would be convenient at a good price although this review process is a real pain in the behind.</li>
            <li>Vendor highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The blade is comparable to a high end disposable blade and does not cut at about 10% the effectiveness of the in store Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li>IF you haven&#x27;t given these a shot, I highly recommend doing so.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend buying this product on  line</li>
            <li>The cost is so high that some guys stopped shaving each day, to stretch the cost.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a few options, but you can pick them up very cheap at any</li>
            <li>They are large and the Sensors are far easier to put on and take</li>
            <li>After reading about so many counterfeits out there, I was a little nervous about this purchase.</li>
            <li>I find the razor light and maneuverable, and the blades stay sharp a long time, though I have a relatively light beard.  </li>
            <li>These are authentic, just maybe a little dated, but like I said, no problems.  </li>
            <li>have a very thick beard that has always been a good product test for shaving system and this one passed for being what it claimed to be.  </li>
            <li>I feel as though I clean and dry the razors well.</li>
            <li>That being said, these were great for 15 years if a bit expensive.</li>
            <li>dry them or place razor in a cup or stand at least(keep them clean</li>
            <li>The blades hold up pretty well as long as you don&#x27;t abuse them ie run them under hot water etc.  </li>
            <li>They work ok but are not a genuine Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>only extremely rarely I suffer from minor cuts or develop mild rashes.</li>
            <li>The mach3 was almost as comfortable as the old fashioned DE blades, and it gave a shave that was even closer than a single pass with my DE razor.  </li>
            <li>We have ordered blades from a different website that were knock-offs and didn&#x27;t shave well at all and broke right away.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smooth on my skin, don&#x27;t cut me and leaves my face (and other parts...)</li>
            <li>These are almost as cheap as the &amp;#34;compatibles&amp;#34; that can be bought at other sites.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t get a new razor so it is cheaper to buy them in 15 count paks...</li>
            <li>Product is brand new and unopened.  </li>
            <li>opened the package and popped a new blade on my handle.</li>
            <li>No longer do I have to worry about when to pick up new blades.  </li>
            <li>Needed a color match with my new buffalo horn handle.</li>
            <li>After three uses, I have to throw them out and use a new razor so that I don&#x27;t cut my legs.</li>
            <li>after all they were new razor blades</li>
            <li>I decided I needed a new look and shaved my head</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every year a new &#x27; wonder razor &#x27; comes out and you are suppose to throw the old&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>don&amp;#34;t even look new.</li>
            <li>With these you can feel the tugging, even with a brand new one.  </li>
            <li>I found this to be the most economical way to purchase and they give a close shave without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>The Schick is better than the Mach 3 even when the Mach is a good quality and is less expensive all the time.  </li>
            <li>My husband have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I mistakenly assumed that the price would stay  the same as when I first went on this plan.</li>
            <li>A male friend told me about these blades when they first came out on the market years ago.</li>
            <li>So, no ordinary razor blade is just going to shave this face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact opposite experience of shaving with a sander, but</li>
            <li>I have used Mach 3 razors for the last 10-15 years, and I know what the first shave feels like.  </li>
            <li>The razors that I received from amazon were exactly as described only cheaper than in a retail store.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After spending something like $45 on Mach 3 blades at the department store some weeks back, in order to have a few months supply, I decided to try one of these blade extenders that supposedly allows you to get a whole lot more shaves out of razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first 10 razors I used in this package held up relatively well.</li>
            <li>These things are great and give me the closest shave with the least cuts out of any other razor.</li>
            <li>I ha d purchased this before from dealers in the community but found that they charged too much for this product; this was something that I used everyday and therefore wanted to see if I could find a better price for it on the open market.  </li>
            <li>Always consistent quality and the blades last.</li>
            <li>If you have concerns about the quality of the cartridges you&#x27;ll get you can always try them first by getting them at a local store before buying them on this website.</li>
            <li>Usually my husband shaves every day ex. weekend and a cartridge lasts about 3 or more weeks.</li>
            <li>It turns out the secret with a comfortable shave has more to do with properly lathering your face than it has to do with the type of razor.  </li>
            <li>so I figured that if I received fakes I would just return them as returns are pretty simple with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Same exact blades that I am used to.</li>
            <li>So get this hot item while you still have facial hair.</li>
            <li>I tried the subscription blades from the slick dude with the humorous videos, but they were sub-par.  </li>
            <li>These may be exactly what you need, but there is never a guarantee because everyone&#x27;s face and body are different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe they&#x27;re not as fine, spacing between blades is wider, don&#x27;t last as long as the exact same make and model you get at the store.  </li>
            <li>The Mach3 blades that I usually purchase at the pharmacy are super smooth through several uses (face, legs, etc).</li>
            <li>Real close shave, only issue is price is high</li>
            <li>REGRETS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the cartridges come in a plastic pack where you can literally discard old razor and rearm you razor without having to even touch the new blades.</li>
            <li>I decided to order a new set from the Amazon.com seller and these have worked flawlessly so far.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love the way these blades last and a half the price.</li>
            <li>One blade would hardly last 2 shaves comfortably, maybe its meant for single usage.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because I just can never get over the high price of these blades. o_O</li>
            <li>I swear they make these blades more dull every year so that you have to keep buying them.....</li>
            <li>I see these guys as Adventure in a Clear Plastic Case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>I see these guys as Adventure in a Clear Plastic Case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>After my body shave, I add soap to a soft toothbrush and gently scrub my blades from the front and the back.</li>
            <li>you the fine bare shave you desire for less.</li>
            <li>is clear is</li>
            <li>Clearly counterfeit.</li>
            <li>I had no problems receiving the &#x27;real deal&#x27; as some people had said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking through and considering an electric shaver recently</li>
            <li>The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>the Razorpit, I am at least getting about 3 times as many shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li>This is a daily use product, and this package of 15 is for the whole year.</li>
            <li>One test I haven&#x27;t actually tried is shaving with them, but at the moment, I&#x27;m convinced they&#x27;re the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and anything over four blades shreds my neck.</li>
            <li>how frequently I have to go over areas.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell they are legit, and provide the type of shave I&#x27;ve come to expect from a Mach3 razor.</li>
            <li>What else is there to say, but smooth cheeks for a few months to come.</li>
            <li>Got me hooked when I was young.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal product and not some Chinese knock off brand.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Too much of a color clash with gray - which is the only color I can find in stores.</li>
            <li>So far it was just 1 out of 15.</li>
            <li>Identical to blades from the store, as far as I can tell, but cheaper.</li>
            <li>so far no problems with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 26 Mar 13, still using blades from this order.  </li>
            <li>With the Fusion (5) blades didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; as much.  </li>
            <li>shaving is a chore, I had a beard for over 26 years before the wife said it made me look old.</li>
            <li>I look old</li>
            <li>These are the real product that you&#x27;ll find at various stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cheaper disposables last for much longer than that.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell though, the blades I received are the legit Gillette product.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin, however, tells me these blades are a couple frog hairs</li>
            <li>Buy these razors and then attach them to the vibrating sensitive razor.</li>
            <li>In the &amp;#34;good old days&amp;#34; I changed blades every week.</li>
            <li>This multi-pack offers a discounted price.  </li>
            <li>I was an old Gillette Sensor user and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference after switching.  </li>
            <li>Using the old style Sensor blades, all the cut hair gets stuck in the blades until you wash it out.  </li>
            <li>This is all my husband will use on his sensitive face.</li>
            <li>I bought a nice razor and brush and now spend approximately 55 cents a week on razor blades.</li>
            <li>Better yet the last order was considerably less in price!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do anything special to it when I am done except rinse it off in the Hot water out of the tap, tap it on it&#x27;s side to shake off the loose water, and lay it down.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is genuine and is as sharp as the ones I used to buy before from big box store.</li>
            <li>Buying highly discounted razors really worries me that I might get a bad blade and cut my face, but these have turned out good for me.</li>
            <li>The most recent price point was unbelievably affordable.</li>
            <li>I tried some of the higher end Gillette as well and that stuff is also pretty ordinary (nowhere close to Mach 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get a smooth baby&#x27;s behind shave the first 5 times you use them.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is the high price per blade.</li>
            <li>For me, the cartridge&#x27;s high cost is it&#x27;s only drawback</li>
            <li>The blades probably last half the time that the Turbo blades do and aren&#x27;t as smooth of a shave.</li>
            <li>while a little expensive, they do a very good job</li>
            <li>One has to wonder why these blades as so expensive, but as they are we just have to look elsewhere for more reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>These blades last a couple weeks each, so they aren&#x27;t all that expensive for good shaves with no missed whiskers.</li>
            <li>These razor blades are not sharp.  </li>
            <li>aside, this product is not fake or imitation.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but well worth the money for the durability and performance.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and want to shave fast and blind while getting a decent shave without cutting yourself, these are the best value.</li>
            <li>Great product at no so bad of a price through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I will explore return options, but I wanted to ensure the rest of the general public does not waste their money or fall for this scam.</li>
            <li>They are the real deal and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews commented that these blades were either old, rusted easily or of low quality.</li>
            <li>and thought I&#x27;d somehow put the old blade back on.  </li>
            <li>Dug the old blade out of the rash and put it back on.and</li>
            <li>I only wish that they would BRING BACK THE ADJUSTABLE STAINLESS DOUBLE EDGE RAZOR!</li>
            <li>As mentioned, these are terrific (long-lasting) blades when I have purchased directly through a pharmacy.</li>
            <li>have no regrets with my purchase.</li>
            <li>These are the only razors my husband will use on his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have large number of beard, then that could far less.</li>
            <li>These do a good job at a reasonable price; at least as the price compares to razor blades nowadays; they are ridiculous!</li>
            <li>Even a new blade is coarse and can hardly last for 1 shave.</li>
            <li>The subject line expresses my feelings... plus on more than one occasion the rotating head has fallen off after a few uses.</li>
            <li>The real ones have a white strip with a thin blue stripe at the top, and the blue stripe fades away after several shaves.</li>
            <li>price was right for me, and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face.</li>
            <li>This is exactly as advertised and priced so much less.</li>
            <li>Quickly, I splashed warm water on my face, and the guy in the mirror was still just as ugly, but with a wet face.  </li>
            <li>There is a recent (meaning about a year old) article in the Forbes magazine mentioning that Gillette finally relented and revealed the life expectancy of a blade.</li>
            <li>They last just as long as normal store bought blades.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and exactly the same as you find at retailers only lower priced.  </li>
            <li>Disappointed not as good as some new lady disposable that I got.</li>
            <li>The blades work pretty well for the first couple shaves, but they start to get noticeably worse after only a week and become unusable after two.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty heavy beard</li>
            <li>Further, if these were fake, Amazon would make it very easy to return them.  </li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this Chineese bootleg item!&lt;br /&gt;You are better off spending the extra money on the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The plastic is gray, while the real ones are black.</li>
            <li>Less than they are at a giant large quantity store.</li>
            <li>I recently tried going back to a &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; single blade safety razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the military and have to be clean shaven for work, but usually grow out scruff on the weekend.</li>
            <li>We really like the little moisturizing pads above the blade set.  </li>
            <li>He says that his &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; (he does shave daily, but calls it a beard anyway) is tough to get a smooth shave on.  </li>
            <li>The blades did not seem to be super sharp and wore out after a few shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> guess you just gotta shell out if you want to be beautiful ;-)</li>
            <li> I have used many razor blades over the years, but have experienced no closer or more comfortable shaves than those provided by the Gillette MACH3 Cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, these were a good deal with an Amazon coupon available at the time.</li>
            <li> Very happy this far with these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not much needs to be said for these - they provide a quality shave and with Amazon providing the best price, it was an easy sell.</li>
            <li> Comes good packed and seems original.</li>
            <li> they work FINE!</li>
            <li> Perhaps my beard has become more course.  </li>
            <li> Yep they are razor blades for cheap!</li>
            <li> I will have to pay more attention.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Price is better than shopping at the grocery store that i go to and</li>
            <li> For the money you won&#x27;t find better detachable razors</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blade for shaving my face and head bald.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 for many many years.  </li>
            <li> Who needs more than three blades?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer using them because I think the Dollar Shave Club is a better value.  </li>
            <li> Love the price, better that Costco.  </li>
            <li> love the price here versus even WalMart &amp; Target.</li>
            <li> Amazon could do better.</li>
            <li> Love the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I love these razors.</li>
            <li> Subscribed to them through Amazon and get a better price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It was ok</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> My wife better not do that with my razor.</li>
            <li> These are priced much, much better than what I find at Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> Better than going to the store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, upon close inspection of the blades themselves, they seem authentic-</li>
            <li> In such a counterfeit-saturated market, I think it would be best to stick to the letter of your product description.</li>
            <li> Will continue  to use these blades until Gillette developments a better blade</li>
            <li> A month or so ago I decided why not buy these through a reputable site like amazon to save some money?</li>
            <li> I learned to make sure it had a blister sustainable pack.</li>
            <li> use this for most of my shaving life.</li>
            <li> I paid $3.75 more.</li>
            <li> As always, the over the top selling point for these is that they are a fraction of the price one would pay at a retail store.</li>
            <li> Perfect and very low price</li>
            <li> for fusion and proglide i love them/</li>
            <li> Better than most others out there, and they don&#x27;t blow your budget.</li>
            <li> we love the price and the cartridges are great1</li>
            <li> I know it is not you ,whey cost more all over.</li>
            <li> Most things work as advertised</li>
            <li> These are the real thing and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> If I can find a better outlet, I will pursue it.</li>
            <li> We love the convenience and price.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how many came in this</li>
            <li> are so many counterfeit ones out there</li>
            <li> I love these razors and have been using them for years.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t repeat the experience with mach3 though, unless I find more &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; surprise cartridges lying around.</li>
            <li> I know most people just pick them up at the store, but in this case, we were ordering anyway</li>
            <li> great  price for that much  </li>
            <li> Most are in the &#x27;for months&#x27; category.  </li>
            <li> Good economical package.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get to feel them any more.</li>
            <li> Better control.</li>
            <li> With the excenge rate i can get better deals somewhere also.</li>
            <li> but the blades are so much better.</li>
            <li> Cheap way to get them!</li>
            <li> Razors are authentic Gillette Mach 3 blades.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure</li>
            <li> I replaced with same product from drugstore and got a perfect shave again from blades I could use with confidence.  </li>
            <li> delivered as promised delivery was good I am happy I don&#x27;t know what else to say about such a review.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette Sensors for years and thought I would try Gillette&#x27;s latest marketing innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched handles (we have many Gillette handles from years of buying) and still had the issue.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been getting a month or more out of each).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mach 3 blades for many years.</li>
            <li> just costs more.</li>
            <li> that after all the money someone spends with a company that they would be more helpful.</li>
            <li> Easier and Better than purchasing at store</li>
            <li> I use these and love them.</li>
            <li> Still satisfied with order.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should change my blades more often, but I use these for over a month before changing.</li>
            <li> These simply are the best blades on the market.</li>
            <li> a much better buy</li>
            <li> so what more can you say... if you love Mach3 you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These razors are the best, enough said.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most mark-up items I&#x27;ve ever seem on Amazon</li>
            <li> I love these blades.  </li>
            <li> The packaging and quality indicate these are authentic Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> love the mach3 razors, however the price makes me want to check out dollar shave club.</li>
            <li> if I went through these more often, I&#x27;d complain more, but I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Mach 3 is still my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Love these razor heads.</li>
            <li> Each one lasts about 15 days or more and the shave is close but not too close.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure)</li>
            <li> perform as I expect for many years now&lt;br /&gt;too</li>
            <li> My favorite for shaving</li>
            <li> More if you don&#x27;t need to shave all that</li>
            <li> In my opinion, having 5 or more blades is an overkill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had more ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Great Price -  Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> /&gt;These razor blades couldn&#x27;t hold an edge for more than four shaves.  </li>
            <li> Better than newer Proglide.</li>
            <li> Love the brand will buy again</li>
            <li> Better price than the stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for over 10 years and love them.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Love em and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I believe many have found this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again...don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that a gliding razor is a better shave.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Mach3 blades for many years.  </li>
            <li> I am sure shoplifting keeps brick and mortar stores from even stocking multi-packs with this many razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for many years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you love paying $3-$4 per cartridge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try the newest mach and see if thats any better.</li>
            <li> I started using Gillette Mach3 blades many years ago.  </li>
            <li> The best part about these blades is how the backs are completely open.  </li>
            <li> The Subscribe &amp; Save Program used to be much better than it is now.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to shop around.</li>
            <li> Would have had to pay ton more in the store.</li>
            <li> Authentic product and work well with my Mach 3</li>
            <li> We love the Mach3 around here.</li>
            <li> Have not found a better blade to get the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve encountered disposable cheapies that felt like they were designed to tear each whiskers out to the root, so I feel like I&#x27;m acquainted with bad-out-of-box razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smooth with no cuts, if you do get cuts you&#x27;re not doing it right, lol.</li>
            <li> perfect clean shave for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Comes in a nice pack and seems original..</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I think they are good ;-)</li>
            <li> Prices are pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Yes, they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked, then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good razors.</li>
            <li> Good product, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> These were a pretty good price with the discount that was offered.</li>
            <li> Great value for money considering where I live in the Caribbean</li>
            <li> I like them better than the Venus refills because they are more slender and accurate for a close shave on my legs, armpits and bikini line.</li>
            <li> He loves the smooth glide and I love the smooth price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The old Mach 3 &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;No need to change a good thing!</li>
            <li> In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Tried and true, the razors are the best I&#x27;ve found and Amazon has them at a great price.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27; tried many other razors at the store since these seem to be the best deal for the amount of blades.  </li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these off ebay recently which (though they looked very good)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase and will certainly be ordering more.</li>
            <li> With the current economic problems and costs rising faster than salaries we are all looking for a good deal, and at the price this item was offered it was a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Yes, the fusion glide much better but that does not mean a superior shave.</li>
            <li> And if you sign up for the timed shipping ( I use every six months, as I use one blade every two weeks, plus a couple for travel), you get free shipping AND a better price than at the store.</li>
            <li> , I appreciate the free blade, Razors N More, but</li>
            <li> So glad these are available without the razor.  </li>
            <li> Nice to get so many at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this price, free shipping, and not having to remember to pick these up at the store.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Schick Hydro 3 and was careful to get it from the Schick Store on Amazon as well as my blades along with my Prime shipping and am very happy with my decision.  </li>
            <li> If my viewpoint changes, I will update this post, but for now, a nice product, great price, and when I ordered the set of 15, the total was over $25 which gave me the free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Lots of hype on other blades but these work the best for me and my face.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good buy!</li>
            <li> This price (subscribe &amp; save, with 4 other products for a 20% discount) is the best!</li>
            <li> I looked at other online stores and this was the best price for these blades at approx.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, if you&#x27;re willing to do everything right and pay close attention for 10 minutes, you can get a great shave with the cheapest razors available.</li>
            <li> The seller sent the items very quickly.</li>
            <li> These systems have their blades spaced appropriately apart to prevent buildup and allow me to clean the blades when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> shaving almost daily for 30+ years now and tried most brands cartridge or disposable.&lt;br /&gt;atra was a great blade</li>
            <li> I love how easy these blades are to clean.  </li>
            <li> Being able to receive items in larger volume and delivered to my door is great.</li>
            <li> easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li> With 3 blades does the job very quick.</li>
            <li> I get more clean shaves from 1 cartridge</li>
            <li> I still use this older style blade and this is a fair price on a subscrbe and save situation.</li>
            <li> I know there are newer, fancier razors out there, but if this works fine</li>
            <li> They seem to work fine though</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH AMAZON HAS THE BEST PRICE, GILLETTE COULD CHARGE LESS IN MY OPINION.</li>
            <li> and they are fine.</li>
            <li> These cartridges work just fine.  </li>
            <li> These work fine for my Mach 3 handle.</li>
            <li> These blades from Amazon work fine and</li>
            <li> They seem fine to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these blades are more than adequate for any shaving needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)3 blades per head is more than adequate for quality shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Something is up with the huge discount.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s well established that drying the blades will HUGELY extend the life of the cartridge.</li>
            <li> Fit the razor as they are meant to.</li>
            <li> Hope the coupon is available when I need to refill.</li>
            <li> They are genuine.  </li>
            <li> Genuine product.  </li>
            <li> A great deal overall</li>
            <li> THE ACTUAL QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS GREAT.  </li>
            <li> For my money, the Schick Quattro and the Gillette Mach3 are the only two systems that I&#x27;m perfectly happy with using.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortably buying them there, as I&#x27;d worry about getting third-party blades, rather than geniune OEM blades.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortably buying them there, as I&#x27;d worry about getting third-party blades, rather than geniune OEM blades.</li>
            <li> Specifying that they did not feel like a genuine Gillette product.  </li>
            <li> For myself, the 15 count package is enough for well over a year of shaves, so it&#x27;s great to be one and done.</li>
            <li> I have this on auto-order and invariably I find 1 or 2 blades the pivot locks into one position and will not pivot freely again.  </li>
            <li> These regular mach3 works best foe me better than the sensitive version.</li>
            <li> They were genuine.  </li>
            <li> and when we added this product to our cart on Amazon, we got the free shipping</li>
            <li> Cheap disposables have a tendency to get clogged up causing you to cut your self easier.</li>
            <li> Comfortable shave beyond belief.</li>
            <li> So smooth.</li>
            <li> , my razors arrived and they were indeed genuine Gillette razor blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased another order from Amazon and again recieved genuine Gillette razor blades.</li>
            <li> Price on this deal was fantastic, over 25 % below store prices</li>
            <li> 15 of them would last me almost a year which is great.</li>
            <li> Add in free SuperSaver or Prime shipping</li>
            <li> they were the genuine item too...</li>
            <li> My warning light go off.</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm and my head is smooth.</li>
            <li> These ain&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> Free shipping for prime members.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat Amazon for the price, real genuine products delivered fast.</li>
            <li> Same as in the store for a great price.</li>
            <li> The Mach3 creates a smooth shave for both men and women</li>
            <li> They are genuine Gillette Mach 3 blades and my face feels as smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> They are really cheap.</li>
            <li> I feel these were of some cheap china imatation or they just are not of the quality they used to be.</li>
            <li> Truly a smooth close shave for men and women alike.</li>
            <li> Cheap blades?</li>
            <li> They shave perfectly comfortably.  </li>
            <li> For the price these were the perfect gift for a friend with a heavy beard growth.</li>
            <li> Bought a package from CVS and the mach 3 baades were far superior.</li>
            <li> This cartridge is looking good so far.</li>
            <li> great price and fast, fast shipment</li>
            <li> Shaves aren&#x27;t as good as my current favorite.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth and fast transation.</li>
            <li> These are great blades, gives a clean shave and if my stubble is long I don&#x27;t find that the blade gets clogged up so easily like the 4 or 5 blade razors.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re authentic Gillette blades, they were available at a very reasonable price, and I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store for them.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend ordering here for cost effective reasons.</li>
            <li> Regardless of how many new products Gillette puts out this will always be my favorite.</li>
            <li> Glad they are still making this model without any of the battery operated funny business these days.</li>
            <li> excellent quality as usual from gillette</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still buying these year after year instead of upgrading to the latest and greatest and more expensive.</li>
            <li> The best price on the net of many vendors from various sites.  </li>
            <li> This is not the original it seems.</li>
            <li> These arrived in factory sealed original un tampered container.</li>
            <li> Came in original package.</li>
            <li> The Fusion blades work well if not a tad better but don&#x27;t justify the higher price.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re face is worth it though!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first package from CVS off the shelf and fell in love with the blades and razor, thought I&#x27;d never use another razor.</li>
            <li> Well packaged and definately original products.</li>
            <li> but thanks to Amazon very good return policy, I will have my money back by returning the cartridges.</li>
            <li> It was nice to be able to locate it on Amazom because it&#x27;s always cheaper to buy in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> good blades that last a while and provide a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved these since they were available back in the day</li>
            <li> On the bright side, I&#x27;m very fashionable now because I don&#x27;t like to shave so much.  </li>
            <li> The MACH 3 system gives you a clean shave every time.</li>
            <li> Special Sale - 5 Boxes of</li>
            <li> These give me a good clean shave and they last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Great, close shave with minimal cuts.</li>
            <li> Also good for several shaves.</li>
            <li> these last a good while.</li>
            <li> So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So</li>
            <li> Good shave and the sharpness seems to last</li>
            <li> Solid razors at a good price ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> of use: Different and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> Still $1.50 per blade would be SWEET hint hint.</li>
            <li> good product and its same as mentioned</li>
            <li> and it ships free if you dont mind the wait, worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor my boyfriend uses and it does a good job getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll learn how to use a straight razor :)</li>
            <li> Maybe a straight blade is better and cleaner, maybe not I&#x27;ve never tried it, but I can&#x27;t shave with anything else.  </li>
            <li> Amazon makes the whole buying experience worthwhile .</li>
            <li> The 3 is the sweet spot.</li>
            <li> Plus cool name, eh?  </li>
            <li> They do last a good while.</li>
            <li> If they are &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or such the are damned good fakes.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> The blades provide a great shave, and purchasing replacement blades is worthwhile -- as long as the blade holder continues to hold the new blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dollar shave club for a few months and their best razor doesn&#x27;t cut as close and smooth as the classic mach3.</li>
            <li> Love my gillet mach 3 razor and needed more heads, will be buying more in the future, they work very well.</li>
            <li> got these due to great price with subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The razors are sharp and work great.  </li>
            <li> Great savings compared to other retailers</li>
            <li> Amazon has helped me save a lot of money on other products, and this is another great example of ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure if it was the blades or the new Gillette model!  </li>
            <li> As always, these blades are super.  </li>
            <li> I love them mostly because of the very low skin irritation level I experience with them.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower, quickly and with no mirror and use no aftershave and</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the geniuses at Amazon had responded quickly to my Polly Purebred call for help and delivered this product--</li>
            <li> but the hairs get caught up too quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular razor head for many years.  </li>
            <li> More than 3 blades is a waste of money and not as good a shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Closest shave on this planet, like silk baby!&lt;br /&gt;excellent blades, cost and experience for precision quick shavers..</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve worked better than anything since I was 16 years old and Glliette sent me a razor for free.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This was quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is great, my favorite for my delicate skin</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> trick is this: the alcohol quickly dries out any moisture.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Well, these are mighty fine razor blades and still at a decent price.</li>
            <li> A real lubricating strip, the little &#x27;fins&#x27; at the bottom of the blades resume their original shape after being pressed, the blades are in good alignment, are clean, and have what seems to be dots on them indicative of authentic Gillette manufacturing.  </li>
            <li> Next to Gillette&#x27;s stainless, adjustable razor of old, this is the best and easiest shave ever!  </li>
            <li> These are the same blades that you can get at most any supermarket or pharmacy, but it&#x27;s far and away the best price that I&#x27;ve seen (this last thing may change by the time that you read the review).</li>
            <li> received brand new cartridge and am satisfied with the purchase....</li>
            <li> We always use a little hair conditioner on the skin and then the Mach3, with great results.  </li>
            <li> This blad is perfect and I think it gives me a sharper shave and easier for those tough spots.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for quite a few years and have always been happy with them.</li>
            <li> It is smooth against your skin and cuts very close.</li>
            <li> I had so much confidence in Gillette and purchased this 15 count pack but to realize this is of cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I still think razors cost too much, but these are about as cheap as I can find around.</li>
            <li> fresh Mach 3 blades--just the day before.  </li>
            <li> It looked good and shaved like I expected.</li>
            <li> Always by this product and never disappointing I just like this product.</li>
            <li> I get about 3 weeks to a month&#x27;s use out of every one of these, which means for a 15 count box I get about a year&#x27;s worth of shaving.  </li>
            <li> , then I rinse that off, apply shaving cream, and then shave away creating fun patterns and designs, or just taking it all off depending on my mood.</li>
            <li> I am assuming its a conscious decision from P&amp;G (owner of Gillette) to make more money out of cartridges by reducing the quality and longevity of the blade.</li>
            <li> Good price for a blade that seems to be getting harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Works good as expected from Gillette Cartridges.</li>
            <li> I had memories of decades worth of</li>
            <li> I liked that I got an extra discount for subscribing &amp; saving.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the arm, just hold the razor directly in my fingers, which I like better.</li>
            <li> I checked amazon for the fun of it and found that even with shipping, I saved $7 on razors by having them delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> By far Gillette is my favorite brand when we talk about shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> but honestly I was buying these from you last year for $19...seriously, who would pay this price?!</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach 3 Plus blades for years and until I ordered these I had forgotten that regular Mach 3&#x27;s are just as good at a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected, delivered quickly, and at a reasonably good cost.</li>
            <li> It was nice to get it right the second try.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products such as the Fusion 5 blades, the girl Gillette razors, and others yet still found the Mach 3 razors to be the best.</li>
            <li> Great price and quantity that is not easily found in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with these blades and much better priced than CVS or other drug stores.</li>
            <li> Wondered about if these were as good as the ones I bought at wal mart or some other store and reading some of the reviews made me suspicious but I have been using these for a while and no problem at all.</li>
            <li> t the right time.</li>
            <li> Water rinses right through.  </li>
            <li> Everyone appreciates a gift that saves them money, right?</li>
            <li> No searching the stores, right at my finger tips..</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with the blades is the top and bottom Aloe Vera lining which quickly falls off.</li>
            <li> The first shave with these razors is excellent and nearly identical to shaves I remember from the past.</li>
            <li> The razors, as usual are great.</li>
            <li> These blades provide a smooth, consistent shave that rarely nicks or cuts you no matter how new the blade.</li>
            <li> PURE JUNK!  </li>
            <li> super fast and excellemt</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how good they are, they&#x27;re half the price anywhere you go.  </li>
            <li> 15 cartridges for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and hubby gets a nice clean, close shave with little likelihood of nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> , these Mach 3 blades are great and fit both my Mach 3 and my Mach 3 Turbo handles (which are the same, except the color of the Turbo grip is black, which as we all know makes it faster somehow).  </li>
            <li> Was a great price due to a special offer and the same quality you expect</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound like a commercial, but I get a clean shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> The most recent purchase has firmed up my opinion that these razors have either worsened over the years, my face has changed somehow, or perhaps it is</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok razors anyway, but they struggle with thicker facial hair.</li>
            <li> This is the not the first time I&#x27;ve ordered Mach3 from Amazon but what I received was a first for me.</li>
            <li> When you first get your package all goes well.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The shave is pretty indistinguishable between the two.</li>
            <li> I like the lower price mach3 over the higher priced fusion blades.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described/pictured.  </li>
            <li> Out of that package, the first one broke at the hinge rendering it unusable.</li>
            <li> first observation is that what I received was NOT one 15-count blister \\&quot;sustainable\\&quot;-pack of blades as advertised, but rather, two 8-piece cardboard packs.</li>
            <li> and I do them first.</li>
            <li> And I change my blades on the first of the month every month.</li>
            <li> And I change my blades on the first of the month every month.</li>
            <li> sure you only buy your blades from amazon, don&#x27;t get ripped up&lt;br</li>
            <li> The counterfeit blades have an aqua blue strip at the top of the razor, which is gone after one shave.</li>
            <li> I really like them!</li>
            <li> They hurt on first use.  </li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t often review anything.  </li>
            <li> I can say they hold up better than the cheaper three blade system that I had ordered recently.</li>
            <li> Surreal.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use one blade for several weeks with these.....</li>
            <li> you know exactly what you are buying.</li>
            <li> Make sure you but ONLY the blister pack of shavers.</li>
            <li> likes it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> These are my husbands favorite razors, after 4 months of Dollar Shave Club, I agreed we could go back to buying these.</li>
            <li> The last batch I received was just okay.</li>
            <li> I had this on auto order and then the price changed pretty dramatically.</li>
            <li> I do wish that these were cheaper, currently they cost about 2.30-2.50 per cartridge depending on how many you buy at once.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> Product as described and a much better deal than purchasing locally.</li>
            <li> They do work much better than the generic two blade versions.  </li>
            <li> For the first time I ordered these blades online.</li>
            <li> Oh, well I&#x27;ll remember the brand names better next year when I have to reorder.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well with instrument.</li>
            <li> With the price of shaving products climbing ever higher you will like this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> From my experience getting a head with more blades doesn&#x27;t improve the overall shaving</li>
            <li> Price is much better here than locally.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find them for him in a big pack as these.</li>
            <li> This is only for the true Gillette Mach 3 blades and not any cheap knock offs (all, buy ones that say they are from Gillette and not Mach3</li>
            <li> Overall, love the performance of the blades.  </li>
            <li> for the pricing, the last time I purchased these from Amazon, it was a much better deal.  </li>
            <li> People who are hesitant, I figure make one purchase and if they are poor quality, you haven&#x27;t lost too much, if they turn out to be good, all the better.</li>
            <li> The new blade was duller and pulled more than the blade that had been on my razor for nearly a month.  </li>
            <li> everything else  was just right thanks</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon is right and the delivery with Prime is fast.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re new, arrived quickly, and saved some money.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and were new.</li>
            <li> used an old REAL cartridge, with about 20 shaves on it and it still cut better than one of these new  (chineese</li>
            <li> I really find that the Fusion cause more ingrown hairs and overall issues after the fact.</li>
            <li> With proper care, one cartridge will give one several good shaves...</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as it was described and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Years ago when they first introduced these the blades lasted much longer.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that there is a long winded way to express the utility of the MACH3 cartridges,&lt;br /&gt;suffice</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The thing is once I find something I like , I pretty much stick with it.</li>
            <li> BTW, if you know someone who uses these or similar expensive blades, they make an awesome and very useful gift idea or stocking stuffer at Christmas time.</li>
            <li> These cartridges certainly give some good shaves, but they cost a small fortune.</li>
            <li> authentic blades are high quality and should last 5 weeks or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get many uses out of each blade which offsets the initial high price.</li>
            <li> That style allows the cut hairs to easily get pushed or wash out of the back without clogging the blades.  </li>
            <li> I wish Gillette would make the large multi-packs for all of their razor blades.</li>
            <li> I certainly would reorder without hesitation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike the many different razors I have used in the past, these Mach3 cartridges give me an amazing, close shave without nicking me all over.</li>
            <li> Works well for me to dry shave every morning although I have gone 3 days and if careful you can still get a great shave</li>
            <li> Quickly swapping the blades, I appreciated the thoughtfulness of how Gillette had put the blades into a clear plastic safety case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Originally I thought my first blade was simply just defective, but that is the case for all the blades in the package as I have tried 7 of them</li>
            <li> , the cost is  very high.</li>
            <li> Large number of blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> As long as you use these as normal blades, they will work just fine!</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse beard, so these cartridges usually provide me with a good clean shave for between 3 and 5 uses.</li>
            <li> That being said the razors themselves are fairly good but it does get dull faster.</li>
            <li> Razors were very sharp and provided a clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Give me my razor with some real moves, some real satisfaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well -- as advertised.</li>
            <li> I like the mach3 maybe not as much as fusion but at a much cheaper cost.</li>
            <li> They just work really well.</li>
            <li> but this reliable gold standard leaves my face baby smooth and without any razor rash.</li>
            <li> Appears to be the real thing.</li>
            <li> so I do the whole prep with homemade shaving oils on my girly bits as a pre-conditioner while I shower</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the real thing</li>
            <li> I get a much cleaner, closer, shave with the safety razor than I ever did with cartridges at a fraction of the price, with no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason they don&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t genuine gillette mach 3 blades which is obvious by the gel strip.</li>
            <li> and since we are over 10 miles from the closest store, the savings really does add up.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get irritated but lubricant gel fades too fast.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t give nearly as smooth a shave as the Gillette cartridges I get locally.</li>
            <li> These razors are packaged from the factory in very sturdy, sealed packaging.  </li>
            <li> These seem to be the real thing and function well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I can get 8-10 shaves per cartridge, depending upon how much beard has grown.</li>
            <li> Prices for blades have gotten way beyond reasonable.  </li>
            <li> So much so that retailers often lock them up like jewelry or watches.  </li>
            <li> I am looking for a reasonably priced alternative to the Mach 3 Turbo as well.</li>
            <li> However, these shavers are the real deal.</li>
            <li> Delivered in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> My husband wants me to buy from a brick and mortar, but will give Amazon another try.</li>
            <li> I save so much money buying these.</li>
            <li> But this seems like the real thing to me.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> do not believe these are real Gillette Mach3 blades.</li>
            <li> They give a smooth, close, nick-free shave without any irritation, and the blades don&#x27;t rust when left in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> The price on Prime really cut the cost on this item, without the hassle of looking around for them.</li>
            <li> I had really wanted the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades.  </li>
            <li> Thinking about replacing my razor with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I just think these blades are really over priced.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than Costco and Bjs.</li>
            <li> They cost too damned much to accept that.  </li>
            <li> and really I don&#x27;t care:</li>
            <li> this is the real thing</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s really a testament to the quality of the modern electric shaver than a criticism of the efficacy of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivered fast and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than in store.  </li>
            <li> cant do with out these and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is time they get some real competition.  </li>
            <li> It is how your face does after that really matters.</li>
            <li> Much faster with this style blade.  </li>
            <li> you really need the 5th blade on the Fusion?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I suspect some of the folks who are claiming these are fake are reviewing an item bought from a different seller or are trying to draw attention away from this great price to direct traffic to their own items.  </li>
            <li> mach3 fans, do yourself a favor: buy a shaving brush (even a cheap  $8 drug store one), a soap puck ($1 for Williams mug soap, or more for fancier brands), learn how to work up a thick lather from youtube videos.</li>
            <li> After 5 blades, it still takes longer than a Sensor, with far more strokes and, only on occasion, can give me as close a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Close in places:  </li>
            <li> Seem kind of dull.not the same as the ones bought locally.</li>
            <li> I saw a set of 8 going for over $20 at the local Big Box, so a nice value here and would definately buy again.</li>
            <li> the first few times I use a blade, because I can easily chop some skin off my skull!</li>
            <li> sure Gillette and the other blade makers are hoping the whole world doesn&#x27;t catch onto this.</li>
            <li> They stay sharp for many many shaves and even when they are dull they still pull through on a clean shave.</li>
            <li> But overall this product is exactly as described and sure saves you money over buying the smaller packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mach3 Turbo is what I normally buy, what a difference!</li>
            <li> many slices on my face &amp; the blades don&#x27;t stay sharp for long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any reason for me to pay more for any other blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t better or cheaper blades, but I&#x27;m not aware of any.</li>
            <li> and they are only good for one below average</li>
            <li> Seriously this is a good deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These Mach 3 cartridges really do an excellent job although I will say that I bought mine in a local brick and mortar store; therefore it&#x27;s hard for me to comment about the mixed reviews that have been posted for this product.&lt;br</li>

            <li> These blades last a full month for me</li>
            <li> I dont normally buy things like this from Amazon, but these were much cheaper than in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very smooth, no nicks or cuts and last for 3-4 weeks per blade with daily use.</li>
            <li> i have tried all others ,  their 3 blade system works better  than any other !</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, quality and cost are pretty much at par with wholesale stores, so no cost benefit here, but the convenience factor at no cost makes the order worthy</li>
            <li> My shave was smooth and nick free and the blades stayed sharp for several shaves.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal, made by Gillette, brand new in the package.</li>
            <li> will most likely go back to the store</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been quite happy because I have thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> main reason for giving this product 5 stars is because Amazon is the cheapest place to buy them, and they work well.</li>
            <li> I actually switched my razor to match my husband&#x27;s because it&#x27;s such a better deal...almost $2.00 cheaper per cartridge.</li>
            <li> Plus I think Gillette is over charging for these and taking advantage of lack of decent competition in blade technology.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product as advertised that was offered at a decent price; not counterfeit or reconditioned as some of the reviews</li>
            <li> They seem to last an extraordinary length of time between replacement, which helps justify the cost.  </li>
            <li> Still, a decent value.</li>
            <li> The blades hold up decently.</li>
            <li> These will still give a decent shave without nicks after 3 weeks, so I can&#x27;t complain about the quality.</li>
            <li> It looked like it would be convenient at a good price although this review process is a real pain in the behind.</li>
            <li> Vendor highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The blade is comparable to a high end disposable blade and does not cut at about 10% the effectiveness of the in store Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li> IF you haven&#x27;t given these a shot, I highly recommend doing so.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend buying this product on  line</li>
            <li> The cost is so high that some guys stopped shaving each day, to stretch the cost.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a few options, but you can pick them up very cheap at any</li>
            <li> They are large and the Sensors are far easier to put on and take</li>
            <li> After reading about so many counterfeits out there, I was a little nervous about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I find the razor light and maneuverable, and the blades stay sharp a long time, though I have a relatively light beard.  </li>
            <li> These are authentic, just maybe a little dated, but like I said, no problems.  </li>
            <li> have a very thick beard that has always been a good product test for shaving system and this one passed for being what it claimed to be.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though I clean and dry the razors well.</li>
            <li> That being said, these were great for 15 years if a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> dry them or place razor in a cup or stand at least(keep them clean</li>
            <li> The blades hold up pretty well as long as you don&#x27;t abuse them ie run them under hot water etc.  </li>
            <li> They work ok but are not a genuine Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> only extremely rarely I suffer from minor cuts or develop mild rashes.</li>
            <li> The mach3 was almost as comfortable as the old fashioned DE blades, and it gave a shave that was even closer than a single pass with my DE razor.  </li>
            <li> We have ordered blades from a different website that were knock-offs and didn&#x27;t shave well at all and broke right away.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smooth on my skin, don&#x27;t cut me and leaves my face (and other parts...)</li>
            <li> These are almost as cheap as the &amp;#34;compatibles&amp;#34; that can be bought at other sites.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t get a new razor so it is cheaper to buy them in 15 count paks...</li>
            <li> Product is brand new and unopened.  </li>
            <li> opened the package and popped a new blade on my handle.</li>
            <li> No longer do I have to worry about when to pick up new blades.  </li>
            <li> Needed a color match with my new buffalo horn handle.</li>
            <li> After three uses, I have to throw them out and use a new razor so that I don&#x27;t cut my legs.</li>
            <li> after all they were new razor blades</li>
            <li> I decided I needed a new look and shaved my head</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every year a new &#x27; wonder razor &#x27; comes out and you are suppose to throw the old&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li> don&amp;#34;t even look new.</li>
            <li> With these you can feel the tugging, even with a brand new one.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be the most economical way to purchase and they give a close shave without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> The Schick is better than the Mach 3 even when the Mach is a good quality and is less expensive all the time.  </li>
            <li> My husband have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I mistakenly assumed that the price would stay  the same as when I first went on this plan.</li>
            <li> A male friend told me about these blades when they first came out on the market years ago.</li>
            <li> So, no ordinary razor blade is just going to shave this face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact opposite experience of shaving with a sander, but</li>
            <li> I have used Mach 3 razors for the last 10-15 years, and I know what the first shave feels like.  </li>
            <li> The razors that I received from amazon were exactly as described only cheaper than in a retail store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After spending something like $45 on Mach 3 blades at the department store some weeks back, in order to have a few months supply, I decided to try one of these blade extenders that supposedly allows you to get a whole lot more shaves out of razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first 10 razors I used in this package held up relatively well.</li>
            <li> These things are great and give me the closest shave with the least cuts out of any other razor.</li>
            <li> I ha d purchased this before from dealers in the community but found that they charged too much for this product; this was something that I used everyday and therefore wanted to see if I could find a better price for it on the open market.  </li>
            <li> Always consistent quality and the blades last.</li>
            <li> If you have concerns about the quality of the cartridges you&#x27;ll get you can always try them first by getting them at a local store before buying them on this website.</li>
            <li> Usually my husband shaves every day ex. weekend and a cartridge lasts about 3 or more weeks.</li>
            <li> It turns out the secret with a comfortable shave has more to do with properly lathering your face than it has to do with the type of razor.  </li>
            <li> so I figured that if I received fakes I would just return them as returns are pretty simple with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Same exact blades that I am used to.</li>
            <li> So get this hot item while you still have facial hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the subscription blades from the slick dude with the humorous videos, but they were sub-par.  </li>
            <li> These may be exactly what you need, but there is never a guarantee because everyone&#x27;s face and body are different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe they&#x27;re not as fine, spacing between blades is wider, don&#x27;t last as long as the exact same make and model you get at the store.  </li>
            <li> The Mach3 blades that I usually purchase at the pharmacy are super smooth through several uses (face, legs, etc).</li>
            <li> Real close shave, only issue is price is high</li>
            <li> REGRETS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the cartridges come in a plastic pack where you can literally discard old razor and rearm you razor without having to even touch the new blades.</li>
            <li> I decided to order a new set from the Amazon.com seller and these have worked flawlessly so far.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I love the way these blades last and a half the price.</li>
            <li> One blade would hardly last 2 shaves comfortably, maybe its meant for single usage.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because I just can never get over the high price of these blades. o_O</li>
            <li> I swear they make these blades more dull every year so that you have to keep buying them.....</li>
            <li> I see these guys as Adventure in a Clear Plastic Case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> I see these guys as Adventure in a Clear Plastic Case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> After my body shave, I add soap to a soft toothbrush and gently scrub my blades from the front and the back.</li>
            <li> you the fine bare shave you desire for less.</li>
            <li> is clear is</li>
            <li> Clearly counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I had no problems receiving the &#x27;real deal&#x27; as some people had said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking through and considering an electric shaver recently</li>
            <li> The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> the Razorpit, I am at least getting about 3 times as many shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li> This is a daily use product, and this package of 15 is for the whole year.</li>
            <li> One test I haven&#x27;t actually tried is shaving with them, but at the moment, I&#x27;m convinced they&#x27;re the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and anything over four blades shreds my neck.</li>
            <li> how frequently I have to go over areas.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell they are legit, and provide the type of shave I&#x27;ve come to expect from a Mach3 razor.</li>
            <li> What else is there to say, but smooth cheeks for a few months to come.</li>
            <li> Got me hooked when I was young.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal product and not some Chinese knock off brand.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Too much of a color clash with gray - which is the only color I can find in stores.</li>
            <li> So far it was just 1 out of 15.</li>
            <li> Identical to blades from the store, as far as I can tell, but cheaper.</li>
            <li> so far no problems with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 26 Mar 13, still using blades from this order.  </li>
            <li> With the Fusion (5) blades didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; as much.  </li>
            <li> shaving is a chore, I had a beard for over 26 years before the wife said it made me look old.</li>
            <li> I look old</li>
            <li> These are the real product that you&#x27;ll find at various stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cheaper disposables last for much longer than that.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell though, the blades I received are the legit Gillette product.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin, however, tells me these blades are a couple frog hairs</li>
            <li> Buy these razors and then attach them to the vibrating sensitive razor.</li>
            <li> In the &amp;#34;good old days&amp;#34; I changed blades every week.</li>
            <li> This multi-pack offers a discounted price.  </li>
            <li> I was an old Gillette Sensor user and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference after switching.  </li>
            <li> Using the old style Sensor blades, all the cut hair gets stuck in the blades until you wash it out.  </li>
            <li> This is all my husband will use on his sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I bought a nice razor and brush and now spend approximately 55 cents a week on razor blades.</li>
            <li> Better yet the last order was considerably less in price!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do anything special to it when I am done except rinse it off in the Hot water out of the tap, tap it on it&#x27;s side to shake off the loose water, and lay it down.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is genuine and is as sharp as the ones I used to buy before from big box store.</li>
            <li> Buying highly discounted razors really worries me that I might get a bad blade and cut my face, but these have turned out good for me.</li>
            <li> The most recent price point was unbelievably affordable.</li>
            <li> I tried some of the higher end Gillette as well and that stuff is also pretty ordinary (nowhere close to Mach 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get a smooth baby&#x27;s behind shave the first 5 times you use them.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the high price per blade.</li>
            <li> For me, the cartridge&#x27;s high cost is it&#x27;s only drawback</li>
            <li> The blades probably last half the time that the Turbo blades do and aren&#x27;t as smooth of a shave.</li>
            <li> while a little expensive, they do a very good job</li>
            <li> One has to wonder why these blades as so expensive, but as they are we just have to look elsewhere for more reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> These blades last a couple weeks each, so they aren&#x27;t all that expensive for good shaves with no missed whiskers.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are not sharp.  </li>
            <li> aside, this product is not fake or imitation.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but well worth the money for the durability and performance.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and want to shave fast and blind while getting a decent shave without cutting yourself, these are the best value.</li>
            <li> Great product at no so bad of a price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will explore return options, but I wanted to ensure the rest of the general public does not waste their money or fall for this scam.</li>
            <li> They are the real deal and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews commented that these blades were either old, rusted easily or of low quality.</li>
            <li> and thought I&#x27;d somehow put the old blade back on.  </li>
            <li> Dug the old blade out of the rash and put it back on.and</li>
            <li> I only wish that they would BRING BACK THE ADJUSTABLE STAINLESS DOUBLE EDGE RAZOR!</li>
            <li> As mentioned, these are terrific (long-lasting) blades when I have purchased directly through a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> have no regrets with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors my husband will use on his sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have large number of beard, then that could far less.</li>
            <li> These do a good job at a reasonable price; at least as the price compares to razor blades nowadays; they are ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Even a new blade is coarse and can hardly last for 1 shave.</li>
            <li> The subject line expresses my feelings... plus on more than one occasion the rotating head has fallen off after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The real ones have a white strip with a thin blue stripe at the top, and the blue stripe fades away after several shaves.</li>
            <li> price was right for me, and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as advertised and priced so much less.</li>
            <li> Quickly, I splashed warm water on my face, and the guy in the mirror was still just as ugly, but with a wet face.  </li>
            <li> There is a recent (meaning about a year old) article in the Forbes magazine mentioning that Gillette finally relented and revealed the life expectancy of a blade.</li>
            <li> They last just as long as normal store bought blades.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and exactly the same as you find at retailers only lower priced.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed not as good as some new lady disposable that I got.</li>
            <li> The blades work pretty well for the first couple shaves, but they start to get noticeably worse after only a week and become unusable after two.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty heavy beard</li>
            <li> Further, if these were fake, Amazon would make it very easy to return them.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this Chineese bootleg item!&lt;br /&gt;You are better off spending the extra money on the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The plastic is gray, while the real ones are black.</li>
            <li> Less than they are at a giant large quantity store.</li>
            <li> I recently tried going back to a &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; single blade safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military and have to be clean shaven for work, but usually grow out scruff on the weekend.</li>
            <li> We really like the little moisturizing pads above the blade set.  </li>
            <li> He says that his &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; (he does shave daily, but calls it a beard anyway) is tough to get a smooth shave on.  </li>
            <li> The blades did not seem to be super sharp and wore out after a few shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never minded the high in store price point because of how sharp the blades are and how long they last.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have had no issues when purchasing directly via Amazon, so I will try that route next time</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try the Mach 3 and see if I could get decent low-attention shaving without the financial or literal blood-letting, and, so far at least, these are doing the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They usually last through a few shaves, but the overall cost is fairly high.</li>
            <li> For more than 15 years I&#x27;ve used to use Gillette brand trusting its quality, but not this time, the moment I began to use, I could tell the difference, very poor quality (blade)</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to purchase these razor blades as it appears that many people are receiving counterfeit products that were dull and useless.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is so tough, it could be used to clean the barrel of a cannon.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely not recommend these to anyone; the savings certainly was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Now with the small discount of 5%, it really isn&#x27;t much cheaper than your local store, especially since you can get coupons for these once in a while.  </li>
            <li> these blades are not lasting as long as what i was used to, the lubricating strip is gone by the second or third shave.</li>
            <li> Shipping is a little high, but in the end you still save some money.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to order these because of the bad reviews, but once good ones started coming in I decided to take a chance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30-something year old black female who only uses razors to shave my underarms, legs, and girly bits.</li>
            <li> Further to my review below, I would like to note that I purchased these blades from an external source on Amazon (not directly through Amazon).</li>
            <li> Either way, I recently went back to the Mach 3 after using the Fusion Pro glides for a long time.</li>
            <li> He has tried several different types of razors, even several different kinds that are similar to the Gillette Mach3, and hasn&#x27;t cared for any of those other brands.  </li>
            <li> Why do these small pieces of metal and plastic cost so much</li>
            <li> One thing I have noticed, They don&#x27;t last as long as they used to.  </li>
            <li> Delivered promptly and will last a long time</li>
            <li> I shave once or twice per week, which means I am often shaving extra long stubble.</li>
            <li> neither do they last as long, but for the price it is acceptable.</li>
            <li> They work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> They last about as long as store bought I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> Each razor lasts a long time so this package will last me over 6 months.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Mach 3 thinking that they may not last as long, but would provide a cheaper per shave cost.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Razors with 5 blades were too expensive and also got gunked up very quickly by the variety of products I used.</li>
            <li> Then rinse and dry well and put away in a drawer until next time.</li>
            <li> First off the package seems legit and fine but the razors seem awfully clunky and my shave was not as smooth as it usually is with these blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used single blade, double blade and four-blade razors, and I&#x27;ve even tried the headblade, but nothing i&#x27;ve used before shaves without clogging and lasts nearly as long as the Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first with all the negative reviews claiming a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered directly from Amazon and the product I received was not fake (as far as I can tell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands and types of razors and blades and have found that I always go back to the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> With dollar shave club, Harry&#x27;s and other competition, these razors are too expensive and need to be more competitively priced.</li>
            <li> As always, they deliver a close shave with little to no irritation even for sensitive skin (I can often get ingrown</li>
            <li> Dry them off with a towel between uses and each blade will last you a very long time</li>
            <li> saving a few bucks on amazon.com should be weighed against the clear inferior quality of what they sell.</li>
            <li> so I am sticking with the Mach 3 for a long while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for long.</li>
            <li> They have not developed any rust.</li>
            <li> They have not developed any rust.</li>
            <li> (If they have been out that long)  </li>
            <li> We have used MACH 3 for a long time.</li>
            <li> will keep getting them as long as the price remains</li>
            <li> i have used these razors for years and will continue to as long as they are in production.</li>
            <li> These are the razors I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I have to be extra careful</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach 3 from quite a long time but never had this complain.</li>
            <li> My Mach 3 order arrived earlier that expected, in tact with no problems.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close as you like, and can handle the rough stuff with ease(I usually only shave once a week).</li>
            <li> Soft skin + thick, coarse facial hair means spending a lot on blades.</li>
            <li> These blades work very well on my thick beard.  </li>
            <li> And buying them through Amazon saved me about half the cost that the major drug chains charge.</li>
            <li> right after Gilette released Fusion pro glide which doesnt mean anything!</li>
            <li> I just never understand how a persons hair can dull a steel blade so quickly after a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> These make me less hairy and last for a lot longer than standard razors.  </li>
            <li> Mach3 might not provide the shave of the &amp;#34;Fusion&amp;#34; system,&amp;#34; but I can barely justify the cost of these; much less the higher-end ones.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> As other guys have stated when reviewing this cartridge for shaving by Gillette, I also have a thick beard that comes in fast!</li>
            <li> The only negative I could mention is they are more expensive than I would like for something that just removes facial and head hair, but isn&#x27;t everything nowadays.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as the last ones i bought in the store....</li>
            <li> At first I thought maybe I was mistaken, but by the time my second blade didn&#x27;t get me through my second shave, I knew something was wrong.</li>
            <li> I went ahead a purchased this product on Amazon because it beat other prices on different sites.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ll stick with them as long as they are made!</li>
            <li> Double blades give me razor burn and rashes due to</li>
            <li> I have added this amendment after going back and reading insightful comments from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> The companies will practically give you the shavors and one blade, but then if you want to buy replacements, you have to just hand them your wallet and hope they leave you with enough money to take the bus home to your cardboard box in the abandoned alley because you cannot afford a nicer home due to all the money you spend on razor blades.</li>
            <li> Can buy these in any store at this price, they last longer the any other brand we know</li>
            <li> This stupid race to keep adding more blades to razors is getting old.</li>
            <li> I can even dry shave with it in the afternoon</li>
            <li> These have green above and blue below.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different blades over the years and have settled on these for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> But for me they clog way less than Fusion ones and last a long time.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the blades I&#x27;ve bought in store previously.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the issue was in the past with people getting counterfeit blades seems to have been fixed.</li>
            <li> I dont know what it is, seems like this razor wont last me a month like my typical razors do.</li>
            <li> For the price, a pack of these blades can last me over a year and cost me less than a couple of bucks each month.</li>
            <li> For the price, a pack of these blades can last me over a year and cost me less than a couple of bucks each month.</li>
            <li> When i read the reviews before buying, I was not sure to buy it or not as many users reported of being getting fake items previosuly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Both my boyfriend and I have already gone through half of the package and they are single-use only!</li>
            <li> I usually use a blade for 5 to 10 shaves to get the most out of it because they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Even if these are true Gillette razors (debatable), they may be very outdated.</li>
            <li> I found these seem to shave closer and last a little longer than its competitors.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to big stores, this product was a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> This was about the same price or a little cheaper than buying from Walmart.  </li>
            <li> The blades were dull, some of the blue strips were already partially white, and I found that with both packs I bought.</li>
            <li> These are Gillette razors and unless you live under a rock or are a hippy with a ridiculous ankle length beard you know</li>
            <li> I got more for my monies, My boyfriend need some badly and this blaze came</li>
            <li> wet the blade under the stream of water and began to shave.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll settle for waiting a day or so and coming back again for another round of shaving pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even changing the blade every few shaves did not make a big difference.</li>
            <li> What you would expect at the store MINUS the pain in the but to get because they are a hi-theft item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First and foremost are not real.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately not much on the shelf to choose from.</li>
            <li> be careful.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> They are a bit expensive, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This is about half as long as I can get the Turbo to go.</li>
            <li> As anyone who uses a MACH3 knows, their real blades last a really long time...even for poor shmucks like me with thick beards.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now on blade 5 and believe I can make a decent assessment of them versus Sensors, for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: Poor, they started out dragging and they still drag.</li>
            <li> Soft and subtle on the skin- does a neat job</li>
            <li> People who claim these are a less quality blade are confusing me as they are the same blades as you would get in a store, however for the ;price you get 3 cartridges (5 blades each) for about the same cost as 1 cartridge at a store.</li>
            <li> Has always liked that razor and was disappointed when we had trouble finding refills.</li>
            <li> The sharp blades were like Star Trek Borg--resistance was futile.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not as sharp as I used to feel.</li>
            <li> You probably know that thier pretty friggin expensive as well.</li>
            <li> wish some of the other sellers would ship to hawaii because then i could get these alot cheaper.</li>
            <li> With this regimen, my blades have remained sharp.</li>
            <li> With this regimen, my blades have remained sharp.</li>
            <li> I use these for work and not sure if these are actually Mac 3 razors .there</li>
            <li> I would go with some other knock off that is cheaper.</li>
            <li> are pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Sharp and gives the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li> However, the Mach 3 gave me an uncomfortable shave even on first use of the blade.  </li>
            <li> My face feels it.&lt;br /&gt;Speed of shave: At first it was taking me twice the time to get a mediocre shave.</li>
            <li> sharp and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strip works well for 2 shaves, but then is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I talked to other guys and they all agreed.  </li>
            <li> Then I needed some more and purchased here and was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> These were a lot cheaper than what I usually pay for them at my local stores.</li>
            <li> Was a little concerned when I ordered this, based on reviews of other similar products where purchasers said they were not genuine Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but women&#x27;s razors will keep you from cutting up your face and the best part is, women like stubble!</li>
            <li> The razor blades last longer with the Gillette Mach3 and his &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t get dull as quickly as other products did.</li>
            <li> These are dull after one use only, tearing at our skin and  across our skin!</li>
            <li> I mean... the only other option is to quit shaving, and grow a Grizzly Adams style beard.</li>
            <li> If I dare use it a third time, the shave is uncomfortable and barely manages to finish the job.</li>
            <li> I did try to contact the seller with no success.</li>
            <li> Go with the mach 3 turbo, not worth the savings</li>
            <li> In my opinion, some of the negative reviews raise issues that aren&#x27;t technically possible.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> But seemed not worth the proccess of returning it.</li>
            <li> They either seem to be an old product with lost sharpness or something else.. not particularly happy..</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed any poor quality so far.  </li>
            <li> But like Underdog without his Super Energy Pill, I noticed that my razor was completely dull and powerless.  </li>
            <li> The razor blades are very sharp and each blade will last me at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> , my hairs were cut down like trees being mowed down by lumberjack clearcutters on meth.  </li>
            <li> Buying them in these bulk packages helps to get the cost of shaving down.</li>
            <li> Quality has gone down</li>
            <li> I guess the key is that these blades don&#x27;t lose their efficacy after a few shaves because they go dull, but because they accumulate gunk.  </li>
            <li> Not valid where prohibited by law.ame, except the color of the Turbo grip is black, which as we all know makes it faster somehow).  </li>
            <li> Cut the price in half, and five stars becomes a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> Typically by the time this happens it is time to change the blade anyways.</li>
            <li> The outside packaging on the fakes was quite convincing but the one or two shaves you get are horrible.</li>
            <li> Just like at the store but a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Roughly half the price as what is sold in stores.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is less then wholesale story and saves you a trip out to the store</li>
            <li> previous review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave about every day and one blade is beyound using after about a week to a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Get a slight discount for buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> ,,,just at considerably less money because you are buying them &amp;#34;in bulk&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Besides, they cost much less than the fusion pro glides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> From time to time I may get one less shave, but for the price?  </li>
            <li> Buy the pink razor no more - this will solve all of your hair removal woes.</li>
            <li> They are getting harder to find in the stores, when they do carry them they are usually out of stock.</li>
            <li> Knock offs are not worth it for my husbands heavy beard.</li>
            <li> There is no way that these are legit Gillette MACH3 cartridges as they go dull after a single shave.  </li>
            <li> came in a cardboard box and were extremely dull --- every single one of them.</li>
            <li> I have burn scars (2nd degree) and makes it hard to shave,but with these i shave with no hassle at all!</li>
            <li> These blades are expensive but they last long.</li>
            <li> And produce less waste.</li>
            <li> I could probably go a little longer without doing so, but given my regimen</li>
            <li> I could probably go a little longer without doing so, but given my regimen</li>
            <li> Always trying to find a way to save even a little.</li>
            <li> Not sure what some other posters were talking about.</li>
            <li> Not a original product .</li>
            <li> but they are a little snug</li>
            <li> A fifteen pack lasts me a little longer than a year.  </li>
            <li> These are those little pads used to swab an area of skin (for example if you have to give yourself insulin injections.)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it and was so mad that I didn&#x27;t return them after the first shave.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li> Poor, they are simply to big to get into tight</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: If you have a tough beard, I&#x27;d recommend you buy a few and be prepared to bail and go back to whatever you were using.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are not genuine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few of them to test out</li>
            <li> They do well but are never cheap.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and the safety razor was causing me issues I have not seen since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> These are just delivered to my door every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The model was green</li>
            <li> still ordered it as I was have few Amazon gift card to finish up.</li>
            <li> Now I shave my head with them everyday.</li>
            <li> These are a low end, poor quality replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing strip works well but for no longer than a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I had a concern buying this item when I read quite a few reviews here saying that this item is a knock off.</li>
            <li> It took two months, a pint of blood, and hopefully non-permanent facial scarring to get tired of that way to save money.</li>
            <li> These leave me stubbly after a few hours and irritate the corners of my mouth.</li>
            <li> So now we buy in bulk to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than at the military base! :-)</li>
            <li> More than 3 blades irritates my skin, and I usually nick myself terribly with single blade &amp;#34;bic&amp;#34; type disposables, so for me these are heaven.</li>
            <li> Just wish they were not so expensive, I get 3 shaves out of each blade and some blades from the same package don&#x27;t seem as sharp as the others..</li>
            <li> The shaving scum goes through to the other side.  </li>
            <li> Feels like the blades are bending rather than maintaining a stiff edge.</li>
            <li> The head doesn&#x27;t move up and down as they should makes you have to waste at least 3-5 out of the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> Items are less expensive than the local marketplace.</li>
            <li> I received these about a week ago and have been using them for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I am disabled and I take care of my Father who is also disabled, at age 90!</li>
            <li> Lately the quality is down the drain.</li>
            <li> I was a little worry when I read about fake blades in the reviews, but this is a second time that I purchased from Amazon</li>
            <li> The next one&#x27;s blades were all misaligned and managed to cut up my skin badly, so I couldn&#x27;t use that one anymore, and the next 3 aloe strips came out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the packaging is the least frustrating to open</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was a little slow, so if you order, be proactive and be prepared for a \\&quot;rabbinical beard\\&quot; until they arrive...</li>
            <li> Too bad really,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why we would change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that there is even a difference.</li>
            <li> Can we return these, I am not sure.</li>
            <li> Jury is out not sure i will re-order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What is the mystery I am not sure</li>
            <li> I usually shave twice a week and a cartridge lasts me about 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the expensive price.  </li>
            <li> Shave a few bucks off of your razor needs!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update-Since disposable razor cartridges have gotten so ridiculously expensive, I have switched to a double edged safety razor.</li>
            <li> I am not sure where Amazon gets these blades.</li>
            <li> Walmart is usually out of this item in the fifteen pack</li>
            <li> Amazon Prime value and rapid delivery spoil me as usual.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get razor burn or cuts, so I&#x27;m not sure why I should change them.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the Mach 3 Turbo blades but these were</li>
            <li> When I finally run out of blades, I may buy these again just because of the absurd prices at retailers.</li>
            <li> usually use a top-end Norelco electric shaver.</li>
            <li> There is not much more I can say about the product.</li>
            <li> Then--gently wipe a small alcohol &amp;#34;prep pad&amp;#34; on the blades.</li>
            <li> There are several reviews below that allege they are fake.  </li>
            <li> the past</li>
            <li> Very few nicks.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve never experienced skin irritation like I have with some of the other blades.</li>
            <li> I have never received such dull useless blades.</li>
            <li> My husband complained that they get dull and cause pain after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> not real happy.....</li>
            <li> They are not very good.</li>
            <li> I shave my head basically every day, and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task.</li>
            <li> Just wish they were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> and I never have to shave with a dull blade again.</li>
            <li> That is hard to do with just any razor.</li>
            <li> This makes it hard to shave</li>
            <li> A couple shaves with these razors and they are dull.</li>
            <li> Now they get dull after a week or 10 days.  </li>
            <li> Dull and abrasive.</li>
            <li> the Mach3 became hard to find.</li>
            <li> They become incredibly dull after 1 use.</li>
            <li> We have been using these for a decade at least.</li>
            <li> I have been using turbos for quite some time and a blade lasted me a moth at the least with 2</li>
            <li> , I expect 4 shaves at the least from these.</li>
            <li> marketing P&amp;G. At least I won&#x27;t be paying $$ for junk</li>
            <li> A year of shaving with mach3 is at least $200.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone could spoof or fake it.  </li>
            <li> I was too late to return these blades</li>
            <li> I ignored the negative reviews and paid for it with my blood.  </li>
            <li> In the end, its the company that loses the money.</li>
            <li> I have been drying my blades after every use as a result of advice from a tightwad on the radio, and I get at least two weeks from each blade.  </li>
            <li> All about common sense).</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and one of this guys lasts me a month.</li>
            <li> Gillette has forgotten it&#x27;s customer and arrogantly thinks it can charge what it wants and sell crap to prove it.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to impugn the seller&#x27;s character since I&#x27;m really not sure!</li>
            <li> Like some other users I feel something&#x27;s wrong with these cartridges.</li>
            <li> I was a bit wary of buying these because of other reviews indicating that they had received knockoffs.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend these Mach3 Base cartridges for shaving by Gillette.</li>
            <li> Seriously what else does anyone need to know?</li>
            <li> Do you seriously think they could afford to buy these razor blades.</li>
            <li> These have gotten so expensive in the grocery stores much less the Walmarts of the world.  </li>

            <li> These razors are of not good quality and I will never be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but too expensive!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they are fake or something</li>
            <li> Sadly I have to shave my face every morning, but I can usually get 10-12 uses before needing to change cartridges.</li>
            <li> Bought both the Mach 3 and Mach 3 Turbo blades here within the last six months and was sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have a tough beard.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I purchased a six months supply from this seller and am now stuck with a bunch of blades which hardly shave.</li>
            <li> After reading some bad reviews concerning counterfeit Gillette blades, I took care to inspect these carefully upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Poor quality .</li>
            <li> But if you insist on using MACH3, at least ditch the NASTY and useless foam cans, and use a real shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Worse blade I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these were counterfeit, used/recycled/resold, or just decreased quality from the factory</li>

            <li> These are fake...</li>

            <li> Why are they so expensive???</li>
            <li> These razors are so damn expensive.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately anyone can make a review for a product or vender at this site so criticisms can come from anywhere, including competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these razors-</li>
            <li> These things are outrageously expensive, but cheaper than the ones with 35-or-some-odd blades that they try and sell to everyone now.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know this about disposable razor blades, I&#x27;m sorry to be the one to inform</li>
            <li> Needless to say, if they were Mach3 razors, they were in the scrap or reject pile.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the blades sharpness..</li>
            <li> Why do you think all hobos have such insane beards?</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I tried cheaper alternatives and they just didn&#x27;t give me as close of a shave.</li>
            <li> I still dont get why shaving has to be so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Getting too expensive for something you throw away.</li>
            <li> These are definitely fake, OR they are the blades Gillette throws in the rejection bin as they come off the line because they didn&#x27;t pass some quality inspection.  </li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> On the expensive side</li>
            <li> Fake?</li>
            <li> Horribly expensive.</li>
            <li> They were obviously fake.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;Too bad for me, the alternatives are not great..........</li>
            <li> These are crazy expensive too for what your getting</li>
            <li> I have ordered Mach 3 blades from Ebay in the past and received horrible razors packaged in what looked like official packaging but made out of cardboard instead of the plastic that the retail ones come one.</li>
            <li> These have become very very expensive..</li>
            <li> Gillette/P&amp;G (really bad) vs schick which felt marginally better.&lt;br /&gt;I am considering moving to electrical ones.</li>

            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Iâm disappointed with this item.</li>
            <li> I received a branded Gilette container that looked just like the picture and had 3 plastic containers (which snap into my razor base) with 5 razor blades in each container.</li>
            <li> This can end up scraping your face when shaving, which is quite annoying.</li>
            <li> If you put off buying these because you hate forking over the money, just bite the bullet and buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> This performance is very bad.</li>
            <li> as compared with my stock Gillette bought from Costco year ago; very disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These cartridges are not genuine. After using one cartridge for once cannot be used second time.&lt;br /&gt;Very poor quality. I will file a claim for this.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  They are razor blades.  One thing I have noticed, They don&#x27;t last as long as they used to.  Perhaps my beard has become more course.  But I have a theory that they are making an inferior product compared to what they produced about a  year ago.  Why do these small pieces of metal and plastic cost so much</li>
            <li> My husband uses these, so I bought them. He likes these cartridges. that&#x27;s why I think they are good ;-)</li>
            <li> As always, these blades are super.  I&#x27;ve shaved since 1942 and Gillette has always excelled until the &#x27;&#x27;five blade&#x27;&#x27; razor.  Too much of a good thing, should&#x27;ve stopped a t three.</li>
            <li> Great price for the quantity</li>
            <li> Yep they are razor blades for cheap!</li>
            <li> Great value for money considering where I live in the Caribbean, the cost is  very high. Delivered promptly and will last a long time</li>
            <li> excellent packaging/ fast service/ as advertised/  great price!!</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job. We have been using these for a decade at least. My husband always used them and we just found it easier to have one type of razor and blades rather than his and hers. Works equally well for both of us (we each have our own but share the stash of blades.)  I know there are newer, fancier razors out there, but if this works fine I&#x27;m not sure why we would change.</li>
            <li> I had been on the fence about whether these blades were indeed excellent. The most recent purchase has firmed up my opinion that these razors have either worsened over the years, my face has changed somehow, or perhaps it is the product(s) I use to shave. I shave once or twice per week, which means I am often shaving extra long stubble. My beard sparsely grows, but there is plenty to shave off. The first shave with these razors is excellent and nearly identical to shaves I remember from the past. The second shave leaves razor burn and sometimes streaks of blood. If I dare use it a third time, the shave is uncomfortable and barely manages to finish the job. I feel as though I clean and dry the razors well. I&#x27;d say no different than I used to. I have noticed that I can no longer strop the blade on my forearm without the lubricating strip breaking apart onto my arm. Perhaps that is evidence of recent changes to the product. I used to use these razors several times before throwing them out, which sometimes meant four to five weeks. The most recent price point was unbelievably affordable. That is probably the reason for the four stars. Not taking price into account, the product alone might receive a generous three-star rating.</li>
            <li> What can one say about shaving cartridges. Only that Gillette makes the best and this is a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> The blades provide a great shave, and purchasing replacement blades is worthwhile -- as long as the blade holder continues to hold the new blades.</li>

            <li> My head hasn&#x27;t bled since I bought them.</li>
            <li> Just what he needed at a good price!</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent buy and at 1/4th the cost at any store or online sites.  My family loves the product and recommend this product as a great buy.  I even subscribed so the product  is delivered without having to go and order it.  The product just comes when I decide how often.  This is a wonderful program which recommend to all who use products and not have to go and order it over and over!!  A must buy with an awesome program to make it easier to get the best at a good cost :)</li>
            <li> I mistakenly assumed that the price would stay  the same as when I first went on this plan. I will have to pay more attention.</li>
            <li> A male friend told me about these blades when they first came out on the market years ago. I&#x27;ve never purchased them on amazon, only at a grocery store or drug store. I will never use another type of blade because of the smoothness of the shave. I use them for my legs and underarms. I also use a very good moisturizing shaving gel with it.</li>
            <li> For more than 15 years I&#x27;ve used to use Gillette brand trusting its quality, but not this time, the moment I began to use, I could tell the difference, very poor quality (blade) as compared with my stock Gillette bought from Costco year ago; very disappointed!! but thanks to Amazon very good return policy, I will have my money back by returning the cartridges.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and love it.  Good shave with no skin irritation.  Also good for several shaves.</li>
            <li> Gillette is so good this is one reason it will always be number one in my household.&lt;br /&gt;Each and every time I use this product I say thank you Gillette I will always be a Gillette&lt;br /&gt;User.For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.R L C</li>
            <li> Fit the razor as they are meant to.</li>
            <li> I received these about a week ago and have been using them for the past few years.  I had no problems receiving the &#x27;real deal&#x27; as some people had said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking through and considering an electric shaver recently, I decided to stick with my go-to blades and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  As always, they deliver a close shave with little to no irritation even for sensitive skin (I can often get ingrown hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much needs to be said for these - they provide a quality shave and with Amazon providing the best price, it was an easy sell.</li>
            <li> these last a good while. while a little expensive, they do a very good job</li>
            <li> The seller sent the items very quickly. The only doubt I have is that all the blades I&#x27;ve bought have blue aloe above and below the blades. These have green above and blue below. I&#x27;ve heard there are copies of the blades going around. Could this be the case? They seem to work fine though and I don&#x27;t want to impugn the seller&#x27;s character since I&#x27;m really not sure!</li>
            <li> I love Mach 3. Have tried others with inferior results. I love them mostly because of the very low skin irritation level I experience with them. I shave in the shower, quickly and with no mirror and use no aftershave and only extremely rarely I suffer from minor cuts or develop mild rashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for quite a few years and have always been happy with them. I got a good price here too.</li>
            <li> This is a 15 pack of Mach3 blades. I&#x27;m a fan of Mach-3 despite the fact that some razors may have up to 10(?) blades these days. I don&#x27;t want to sound like a commercial, but I get a clean shave without irritation. Good bang for the buck here.</li>
            <li> Price is better than shopping at the grocery store that i go to and blades are as described. These blades are expensive but they last long.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and a great price</li>
            <li> I have hair that is so tough, it could be used to clean the barrel of a cannon.  In fact, when I had a beard and short hair, the guys nick-named me bore brush.  So, no ordinary razor blade is just going to shave this face.  Oh, I&#x27;ve used those 5-bladed razors; you know the kind--with the big heads and even bigger marketing budgets.  But like an Internet whore, they&#x27;re all promise and no satisfaction.  Give me my razor with some real moves, some real satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stared into the mirror.  Some ugly mug stared back at me.  Quickly, I splashed warm water on my face, and the guy in the mirror was still just as ugly, but with a wet face.  A bit of shaving cream, and it was time to transform that ugly guy into the superhero everyone loves.  But like Underdog without his Super Energy Pill, I noticed that my razor was completely dull and powerless.  Thankfully, the geniuses at Amazon had responded quickly to my Polly Purebred call for help and delivered this product--fresh Mach 3 blades--just the day before.  Quickly swapping the blades, I appreciated the thoughtfulness of how Gillette had put the blades into a clear plastic safety case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet the blade under the stream of water and began to shave.  Stroke after stroke, my hairs were cut down like trees being mowed down by lumberjack clearcutters on meth.  The sharp blades were like Star Trek Borg--resistance was futile.  No hair could stand against them.  And yet, miraculously, the blades never broke the surface of my skin.  It&#x27;s the exact opposite experience of shaving with a sander, but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing the lather off my face, I gazed into the mirror and saw some baby-faced superhero staring back.  I almost wished I could grow my beard again, just so I could shave it off.  But I&#x27;ll settle for waiting a day or so and coming back again for another round of shaving pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, these Mach 3 blades are great and fit both my Mach 3 and my Mach 3 Turbo handles (which are the same, except the color of the Turbo grip is black, which as we all know makes it faster somehow).  Some people see these as replacement razor cartridges.  I see these guys as Adventure in a Clear Plastic Case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary.  Batteries not included.  Not valid where prohibited by law.ame, except the color of the Turbo grip is black, which as we all know makes it faster somehow).  Some people see these as replacement razor cartridges.

            <li> Good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> Great for my razor.. and marriage.  Glad they are still making this model without any of the battery operated funny business these days.</li>
            <li> For the money you won&#x27;t find better detachable razors</li>
            <li> These are counterfeit. I have used Mach 3 razors for the last 10-15 years, and I know what the first shave feels like.  They&#x27;re ok razors anyway, but they struggle with thicker facial hair. Trust me on this...buy the razors from your local store. These are fake...</li>
            <li> excellent quality as usual from gillette</li>
            <li> Well, these are mighty fine razor blades and still at a decent price. Less than they are at a giant large quantity store. I did just buy a electric razor but these blades will still be a part of my life. I hope Amazon keeps carrying them forever.</li>
            <li> My partner uses these blades now for years...won&#x27;t get a new razor so it is cheaper to buy them in 15 count paks...they work FINE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pack of razor cartridges...what can I say? It is smooth against your skin and cuts very close. I have been using a Mach 3 for several years now, and have seen no reason to jump up to 4 or 5 blades.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times with no problems.  Items are less expensive than the local marketplace.</li>
            <li> It works very well -- as advertised. The only downside is the high price per blade. Cut the price in half, and five stars becomes a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> These actually work just as well and last longer than the more expensive Gillette Fusion razors.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blade for shaving my face and head bald. I prefer this over the Gillette with 4 blades. Those cut great but the hairs get caught up too quickly. This blad is perfect and I think it gives me a sharper shave and easier for those tough spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 for many many years.  Great product fair price. Who needs more than three blades?</li>
            <li> I have used Mach3 cartridges for about 15 years.  I&#x27;m no longer using them because I think the Dollar Shave Club is a better value.  That being said, these were great for 15 years if a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Great shave and price</li>
            <li> Great on face and balls!</li>
            <li> Have had best success with these and mach3 turbo cartridges.  Love the price, better that Costco.  Hope the coupon is available when I need to refill.</li>
            <li> Saw this deal on an online deal website, I must admit it&#x27;s a really good value for the price! Def. recommended to all friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular razor head for many years.  The razors that I received from amazon were exactly as described only cheaper than in a retail store.  Razors were very sharp and provided a clean smooth shave.  I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to order for years to come.</li>
            <li> my husband &amp; I use this razor!. works great! love the price here versus even WalMart &amp; Target. can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
            <li> Razor blades. What can you say? They shave.</li>
            <li> Check out the video  So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So this is my opinion comparing years of using the Gillette razors vs Dollar Shave Club mid range 4x razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]  Click Here Check this out video review</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as the last ones i bought in the store....not real happy.....will most likely go back to the store</li>
            <li> I had so much confidence in Gillette and purchased this 15 count pack but to realize this is of cheap quality. I did try to contact the seller with no success. Amazon could do better.</li>
            <li> Love the Mach 3. Still the best razor I&#x27;ve used. More than 3 blades is a waste of money and not as good a shave.</li>
            <li> This is the not the first time I&#x27;ve ordered Mach3 from Amazon but what I received was a first for me. Nonaligned razors that fell to pieces after the second shave.  When you first get your package all goes well.  Check out your razor after your second shave.  PURE JUNK!  I will happily return this crap to Amazon with one resounding question.  Why????</li>
            <li> Perfect......plus Got a coupon of $6 at amazon......</li>
            <li> Good price for razors, they seemed to work just fine for me.</li>
            <li> These were a gift but I guess they are what she needed</li>
            <li> I love these razors. My boyfriend and I both use them! They attach to my Venus razor perfectly! I like them better than the Venus refills because they are more slender and accurate for a close shave on my legs, armpits and bikini line. So here&#x27;s a girl&#x27;s perspective! Great Razors!!!!</li>
            <li> The price for these is excellent.  I&#x27;d only suggest that they change the packaging product to be in a significantly smaller box (a 3ft box for these was way too big).</li>
            <li> If I can get them cheaper here than the grocery store, then I buy them from here.  They are genuine.  Buying highly discounted razors really worries me that I might get a bad blade and cut my face, but these have turned out good for me.</li>
            <li> Quality Mach3 razors in a bundled price... you can&#x27;t beat it! Compare prices yourselves. Walmart, Target doesn&#x27;t come close. Will buy again when the times comes to replenish.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach3 for years and have purchased blades in diverse stores and countries. I have never received such dull useless blades. Unfortunately I purchased a six months supply from this seller and am now stuck with a bunch of blades which hardly shave.</li>
            <li> My husband is happy with these, so I&#x27;m ecstatic!!</li>
            <li> Received the product very fast and in perfect shape.  The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely order this again and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Tried and true, the razors are the best I&#x27;ve found and Amazon has them at a great price.</li>
            <li> We have ordered blades from a different website that were knock-offs and didn&#x27;t shave well at all and broke right away.  These blades are true Mach 3 Blades and we&#x27;re happy we found a good seller.  You can be assured that you are buying a quality, authentic blade for a good price.</li>
            <li> For some reason my wife believes it does not cut as well as what we buy at Walgreens?????</li>
            <li> These appear to be a counterfeit item.  I&#x27;m wondering if Amazon will vouch for their authenticity.  I&#x27;m canceling my monthly subscription.  THe packaging is very similar to store bought, but not identical.  I think it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the batch, but these razors dont work nearly as well as normal Mach 3. I&#x27;ve gone through a few of them to test out and they are terrible. Bought a package from CVS and the mach 3 baades were far superior. I will trash the ones from amazon</li>
            <li> Gillette Mach3 Cartridges are what you expect, i just like the price and not needing to go to the store for them</li>
            <li> Orwell predicted that the expense of these facial accessories would become a symbol of the individual&#x27;s fatigue with societal over-compliance. No wonder beards are so popular these days.</li>
            <li> I would say these are of lower quality than what I am used to from Gillette. One blade would hardly last 2 shaves comfortably, maybe its meant for single usage.</li>
            <li> Not me!  They do well but are never cheap.  I have a custom blade holder so I am sticking with the Mach 3 for a long while.</li>
            <li> I like the mach3 maybe not as much as fusion but at a much cheaper cost. I&#x27;m not sure that there is even a difference. The shave is pretty indistinguishable between the two. I like the lower price mach3 over the higher priced fusion blades.</li>
            <li> perfect clean shave for sensitive skin.  We will only use these razors. Subscribed to them through Amazon and get a better price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> First off the package seems legit and fine but the razors seem awfully clunky and my shave was not as smooth as it usually is with these blades. Wondering if its in my head from reading the reviews or it is the blades. I dont know what it is, seems like this razor wont last me a month like my typical razors do. Can we return these, I am not sure. Jury is out not sure i will re-order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second shave was a struggle, if i want disposable razors i wont pay the premium. I have been using turbos for quite some time and a blade lasted me a moth at the least with 2 shaves a week maybe, I expect 4 shaves at the least from these. There is something up with these blades, not the same quality as store bought or something else. What is the mystery I am not sure but I wont be re-buying from amazon even the different branded blades.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described/pictured.  I received a branded Gilette container that looked just like the picture and had 3 plastic containers (which snap into my razor base) with 5 razor blades in each container.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as good as it use to be.</li>
            <li> I recently tried going back to a &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; single blade safety razor. It was ok but the blades were not the quality I recalled from  my earlier years. Even changing the blade every few shaves did not make a big difference. So I went back to the Mach3 and i I am getting a consistently good and comfortable shave. I have a heavy beard and the safety razor was causing me issues I have not seen since I was a teenager. Better yet the last order was considerably less in price!</li>
            <li> Just like the ones I get at Costco.  These are just delivered to my door every few weeks.  Saves money and I never have to shave with a dull blade again.</li>
            <li> Like some other users I feel something&#x27;s wrong with these cartridges. I have been using Mach3 for years with no problem and I&#x27;ve been quite happy because I have thick facial hair. But these cartridges do not shave close enough and they harm my skin! The blades are not as sharp as I used to feel. I am not sure if they are fake or something but I will not buy them here again.</li>
            <li> Please note that there are blade savers you can buy that can extend the life of razor blades considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one I use is Razorpit.  There is also one called Everblade that supposedly also works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending something like $45 on Mach 3 blades at the department store some weeks back, in order to have a few months supply, I decided to try one of these blade extenders that supposedly allows you to get a whole lot more shaves out of razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Razorpit, I am at least getting about 3 times as many shaves per blade.  Some people have said they get like 100-200 shaves per blade.  I guess the key is that these blades don&#x27;t lose their efficacy after a few shaves because they go dull, but because they accumulate gunk.  The blade saver products allow you to remove the gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure Gillette and the other blade makers are hoping the whole world doesn&#x27;t catch onto this.</li>
            <li> these blades, unlike the ones i get at the brick and mortar, rip up my face as if they were already used for several weeks before i used it.</li>
            <li> Works good.  Genuine product.  I would give it five stars, but for the price I think 4 stars is warranted.  I found these seem to shave closer and last a little longer than its competitors.  I have and would buy again.</li>
            <li> The first 10 razors I used in this package held up relatively well. The last 5, that&#x27;s a very very different story. Out of that package, the first one broke at the hinge rendering it unusable. The next one&#x27;s blades were all misaligned and managed to cut up my skin badly, so I couldn&#x27;t use that one anymore, and the next 3 aloe strips came out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for, and saving a few bucks on amazon.com should be weighed against the clear inferior quality of what they sell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still buying these year after year instead of upgrading to the latest and greatest and more expensive. They just work really well.</li>
            <li> Yeah, there are cartridges out there with 4 or 5 blades (where will it end? 17 blades?! ) but this reliable gold standard leaves my face baby smooth and without any razor rash. My skin has never looked better. And if you sign up for the timed shipping ( I use every six months, as I use one blade every two weeks, plus a couple for travel), you get free shipping AND a better price than at the store. A great deal overall</li>
            <li> These are Gillette razors and unless you live under a rock or are a hippy with a ridiculous ankle length beard you know these are the best blades money can buy. You probably know that thier pretty friggin expensive as well. I bought these with a $6 off Amazon coupons so they were an amazing deal. Very happy with these blades. Don&#x27;t skimp on your face, buy the best.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a subscription. I still think razors cost too much, but these are about as cheap as I can find around.</li>
            <li> The razorblades themselves are excellent performers.  This is the best value for ordering them and the packaging is the least frustrating to open I&#x27;ve ever seen - thank goodness.</li>
            <li> Gillette MACH3 Cartridges, 15 count blister pack received immediately after purchase.  Vendor highly recommended. The best price on the net of many vendors from various sites.  Beat out Costco &amp; Sam&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razor head replacements at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with them. Have been using these blades for about 5 years, purchases at sam&#x27;s and the px. The blades from amazon give a good shave</li>
            <li> I found this to be the most economical way to purchase and they give a close shave without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> They are razor blades.  They cut my beard.  Hooray.  Let&#x27;s see now.  They can also be used to cut hair off a lady&#x27;s legs.  My wife better not do that with my razor.</li>
            <li> Great razors at a fraction of the cost. Same quality as you would get at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> not very good bargain but not too bad, I need it and I know it&#x27;s good one I&#x27;ve been using it for long.</li>
            <li> These are priced much, much better than what I find at Wal-mart. For that I am happy.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
            <li> Razors are always over-priced. Amazon has the best price that I could find. Appears to be the real thing. I do not think it is a knock off.</li>
            <li> THE ACTUAL QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS GREAT.  NICE CLOSE SHAVE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.  THE PRICE IS NOT SO GREAT.  ALTHOUGH AMAZON HAS THE BEST PRICE, GILLETTE COULD CHARGE LESS IN MY OPINION.</li>
            <li> After reading about so many counterfeits out there, I was a little nervous about this purchase. However, after I received it, I opened it and inspected one of the cartridges and subsequently used it next in my shaving rotation. It looked good and shaved like I expected. I usually shave twice a week and a cartridge lasts me about 3-4 weeks. This cartridge is looking good so far.</li>
            <li> I feel cheated...and scammed.  Shame on you Amazon.  There is no way that these are legit Gillette MACH3 cartridges as they go dull after a single shave.  As anyone who uses a MACH3 knows, their real blades last a really long time...even for poor shmucks like me with thick beards.  At first I thought maybe I was mistaken, but by the time my second blade didn&#x27;t get me through my second shave, I knew something was wrong.</li>
            <li> I am a value shopper so I price everything out from stores and compare it to online.  I have found this to be cheaper online.  Product is brand new and unopened.  My husband have very sensitive skin and this has been the best shaver that we have found.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for shaving. Always by this product and never disappointing I just like this product. Recommended 10 to buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and does the job with precision.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows about Mach3 razors.  I think they are the best on the market.  The only drawback is the expensive price.  You get what you pay for and Amazon has one of the best prices available on these razor blades.</li>
            <li> I love purchasing blades in bulk because they are so expensive at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> This is a daily use product, and this package of 15 is for the whole year. I recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li> Razor blades are extremely expensive. The cheapest place to buy this brand of razor blades is Amazon, by selecting the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; option. They end up being the cheapest cost per blade when compared to Sams, Costco, HEB, Kroger, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Mach 3 line for 8 years solid. The only issue I have with the blades is the top and bottom Aloe Vera lining which quickly falls off. This can end up scraping your face when shaving, which is quite annoying. Typically by the time this happens it is time to change the blade anyways. However, I have recently heard you can sharpen the blades by dragging them across a pair of jeans, which I have yet to try - the stripping of the protective aloe vera layer might be an issue if this method of sharpening does in fact work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for giving this product 5 stars is because Amazon is the cheapest place to buy them, and they work well. I have tried other products such as the Fusion 5 blades, the girl Gillette razors, and others yet still found the Mach 3 razors to be the best.</li>
            <li> wish some of the other sellers would ship to hawaii because then i could get these alot cheaper. but with that said these are still a great price and the cheapest ive seen around here</li>
            <li> These are great blades, gives a clean shave and if my stubble is long I don&#x27;t find that the blade gets clogged up so easily like the 4 or 5 blade razors.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this a good deal</li>
            <li> What you would expect at the store MINUS the pain in the but to get because they are a hi-theft item.</li>
            <li> They  are the same as you buy in the store .after one shaving you have to change it</li>
            <li> These blades give me the best shave without getting nicked.</li>
            <li> Good as always, fast delivery to your door at a great price.  What more could you want? Better than going to the store.</li>
            <li> After reading some bad reviews concerning counterfeit Gillette blades, I took care to inspect these carefully upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first observation is that what I received was NOT one 15-count blister \\&quot;sustainable\\&quot;-pack of blades as advertised, but rather, two 8-piece cardboard packs. I know I get an extra blade out of the deal, but based on what was advertised, and what various sources suggested, this discrepancy made me immediately suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, upon close inspection of the blades themselves, they seem authentic- A real lubricating strip, the little &#x27;fins&#x27; at the bottom of the blades resume their original shape after being pressed, the blades are in good alignment, are clean, and have what seems to be dots on them indicative of authentic Gillette manufacturing.  Even the boxes have evidence of being machine-glued, and not hand-glued. One test I haven&#x27;t actually tried is shaving with them, but at the moment, I&#x27;m convinced they&#x27;re the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I appreciate the free blade, Razors N More, but please- In such a counterfeit-saturated market, I think it would be best to stick to the letter of your product description.</li>
            <li> I order razors heads from amazon.com because it&#x27;s so mcuh cheaper than buying in stores even with a manufacture coupon</li>
            <li> Great blades, better than five blade cartridges and at a lower cost. Will continue  to use these blades until Gillette developments a better blade and they haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have only purchased the Gillette Mach 3 since 2000. I never minded the high in store price point because of how sharp the blades are and how long they last. A month or so ago I decided why not buy these through a reputable site like amazon to save some money? I bought a package of 15 and I can&#x27;t say how dissapointed I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost are not real. The blade is comparable to a high end disposable blade and does not cut at about 10% the effectiveness of the in store Mach 3 blades. I have not had one good shave since buying these. Originally I thought my first blade was simply just defective, but that is the case for all the blades in the package as I have tried 7 of them and they are only good for one below average shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I buy these from Amazon. I will explore return options, but I wanted to ensure the rest of the general public does not waste their money or fall for this scam. My advice is spend the extra money in store.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product online before I bought it. I learned to make sure it had a blister sustainable pack. I went ahead a purchased this product on Amazon because it beat other prices on different sites. I will buy again. Great price!! It feels awesome against your skin.</li>
            <li> Well, what can be said abvout razor blades?  They&#x27;re sharp and exactly the same as you find at retailers only lower priced.  This is not a life changing thing, just a good deal.</li>
            <li> use this for most of my shaving life.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need 17 blades on your razor to get a good shave. I have sensitive skin and anything over four blades shreds my neck. I&#x27;ve been using these for a decade and i&#x27;ll stick with them as long as they are made!</li>
            <li> I could have got a pack of 20 blades @ sams for 2.00 each. I paid $3.75 more. You should give me $3.75 credit for this information</li>
            <li> great price and fast, fast shipment</li>
            <li> I get about 3 weeks to a month&#x27;s use out of every one of these, which means for a 15 count box I get about a year&#x27;s worth of shaving.  These things are great and give me the closest shave with the least cuts out of any other razor.</li>
            <li> I have to take a moment to review a product that just works well. I&#x27;m a 30-something year old black female who only uses razors to shave my underarms, legs, and girly bits. I shave my legs twice per week, my underarms once per week, and my girly (front and underside) once per week. My skin can be pretty sensitive so I do the whole prep with homemade shaving oils on my girly bits as a pre-conditioner while I shower, then I rinse that off, apply shaving cream, and then shave away creating fun patterns and designs, or just taking it all off depending on my mood. As you can imagine, this process can create quite a buildup on razors, so I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect cost-effective blades. I&#x27;ve tried razors from both Schick and Gillette that had 2, 3, 4, and 5 blades with mixed results. Double blades give me razor burn and rashes due to how frequently I have to go over areas. Razors with 5 blades were too expensive and also got gunked up very quickly by the variety of products I used. Arguably, I could have probably avoided using products, but with the  blades so close together, I fear that I still would have had issues anyhow. Anyhow, 3 and 4 blade razors have ended up being the only ones I could use without problems. These systems have their blades spaced appropriately apart to prevent buildup and allow me to clean the blades when I&#x27;m done. They also remove almost all of my hair with one swipe, and they don&#x27;t cut or irritate my skin. For my money, the Schick Quattro and the Gillette Mach3 are the only two systems that I&#x27;m perfectly happy with using. I don&#x27;t need batteries or anything fancy to get my shave on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my underarms and legs, I just use shaving cream and a razor- and I do them first. Then, on my girly bits, I use the pre-conditioning oils, then a wash, followed by shaving cream and a razor. After my body shave, I add soap to a soft toothbrush and gently scrub my blades from the front and the back. Then rinse and dry well and put away in a drawer until next time. With this regimen, my blades have remained sharp. They have not developed any rust. And I change my blades on the first of the month every month. I could probably go a little longer without doing so, but given my regimen, I feel that it&#x27;s safer to do it this way. For the price, a pack of these blades can last me over a year and cost me less than a couple of bucks each month. Not a bad deal. I have no complaints about these  blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some on ebay that seem a little questionable. I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortably buying them there, as I&#x27;d worry about getting third-party blades, rather than geniune OEM blades. But the ones I received here on Amazon were genuine Gillette blades and excellent quality. I will definitely purchase these again.wer until next time.

            <li> Some reviews commented that these blades were either old, rusted easily or of low quality. Specifying that they did not feel like a genuine Gillette product.  I&#x27;ve had these for over 6 months and am very pleased with their quality and sharpness. As far as I can tell they are legit, and provide the type of shave I&#x27;ve come to expect from a Mach3 razor. As always, the over the top selling point for these is that they are a fraction of the price one would pay at a retail store. For myself, the 15 count package is enough for well over a year of shaves, so it&#x27;s great to be one and done.</li>
            <li> Perfect and very low price</li>
            <li> This is a very good article, the perfect shopping experience</li>
            <li> We have taken advantage of subscribe and save with the Gillette blades.  We get them shipped every two months and hubby gets a nice clean, close shave with little likelihood of nicks or cuts.  He loves the smooth glide and I love the smooth price!</li>
            <li> It is easy to load and gives a great close shave. I can even dry shave with it in the afternoon if I start to get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. That is hard to do with just any razor.</li>
            <li> Lots of hype on other blades but these work the best for me and my face.  Always a good shave and I don&#x27;t cut myself when shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor and blades. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy them through Amazon Prime than to buy them at the store!</li>
            <li> Quality control seems to be lacking.  I have this on auto-order and invariably I find 1 or 2 blades the pivot locks into one position and will not pivot freely again.  This makes it hard to shave</li>
            <li> Shave a few bucks off of your razor needs! What else is there to say, but smooth cheeks for a few months to come.</li>
            <li> Gilette Mach3 is the best razor out there.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Fusion 5 but still prefer Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;There was a model that used to vibrate back in 2005 but I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. The model was green</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy from amazon but rather from brick and mortar (wal mart etc). I have used Mach 3 for ever and loved the quality. Lately the quality is down the drain. I couldn&#x27;t believe the low quality on my recent purchase. I am assuming its a conscious decision from P&amp;G (owner of Gillette) to make more money out of cartridges by reducing the quality and longevity of the blade. I tried some of the higher end Gillette as well and that stuff is also pretty ordinary (nowhere close to Mach 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately not much on the shelf to choose from. Gillette/P&amp;G (really bad) vs schick which felt marginally better.&lt;br /&gt;I am considering moving to electrical ones. Hopefully they have good quality blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job on marketing P&amp;G. At least I won&#x27;t be paying $$ for junk</li>
            <li> In comparison to big stores, this product was a little cheaper.  Always trying to find a way to save even a little.</li>
            <li> These always work out great</li>
            <li> shaving almost daily for 30+ years now and tried most brands cartridge or disposable.&lt;br /&gt;atra was a great blade my worst experience the schick intuition plus.&lt;br /&gt;any of the mens mach3 blades a mug, brush and shaving soap is all you will need&lt;br /&gt;for what may be one of life&#x27;s finest pleasures...&lt;br /&gt;Closest shave on this planet, like silk baby!&lt;br /&gt;excellent blades, cost and experience for precision quick shavers..&lt;br /&gt;no man could ever beat our timing and terrain girls&lt;br /&gt;make sure you only buy your blades from amazon, don&#x27;t get ripped up&lt;br /&gt;with bootleg blades around here.&lt;br /&gt;blow dry them or place razor in a cup or stand at least(keep them clean/dry)for blade life.&lt;br /&gt;no goosebumps or forget about it, turn up the heat please.&lt;br /&gt;as for fusion and proglide i love them/but they are costly and mach3 will&lt;br /&gt;give you the fine bare shave you desire for less.</li>
            <li> good value, better than buying them in the store.</li>
            <li> These regular mach3 works best foe me better than the sensitive version.</li>
            <li> only blade we use. I hope they never retire this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought a package of Mach 3s at Wal Mart last month and they were counterfeit. The plastic is gray, while the real ones are black. The counterfeit blades have an aqua blue strip at the top of the razor, which is gone after one shave. The real ones have a white strip with a thin blue stripe at the top, and the blue stripe fades away after several shaves. On the counterfeit blades, the blue plastic at the bottom of the blade is brighter blue. The outside packaging on the fakes was quite convincing but the one or two shaves you get are horrible. I suggest you, like me, check these details wherever you buy razor blades while you still have the receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the real thing but they are still way too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-Since disposable razor cartridges have gotten so ridiculously expensive, I have switched to a double edged safety razor. I bought a nice razor and brush and now spend approximately 55 cents a week on razor blades. I get a much cleaner, closer, shave with the safety razor than I ever did with cartridges at a fraction of the price, with no skin irritation. I will never go back to cartridges.</li>
            <li> close shave,s work,s great.</li>
            <li> When i read the reviews before buying, I was not sure to buy it or not as many users reported of being getting fake items previosuly.&lt;br /&gt;I still ordered it as I was have few Amazon gift card to finish up. Comes in a nice pack and seems original.. Works good</li>
            <li> Excellent product.and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not sure what some other posters were talking about. These are the real deal, made by Gillette, brand new in the package. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These blades do the job as required.  Better than most others out there, and they don&#x27;t blow your budget.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as it was described and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> we love the price and the cartridges are great1</li>
            <li> Work very good, just wish they did not cost so much. I know it is not you ,whey cost more all over.</li>
            <li> Best price for these razors that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> These blades are excellent!  The same that you would buy in any store at a lower price. Shipping is a little high, but in the end you still save some money.</li>
            <li> I have used Mach3 razor blades probably for 20 years.  (If they have been out that long)  They give a nice, close shave with out nicks.  They are very easy to uninstall and install on my razor.  I really like them!</li>
            <li> Great deal  love these slot cheaper than could buy in store thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Good deal what else is there to say.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like?  They&#x27;re authentic Gillette blades, they were available at a very reasonable price, and I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store for them.  The Prime shipping option pays off again.</li>
            <li> SHAVING IS A RIP OFF.</li>
            <li> delivered as discribed</li>
            <li> These razor blades are not sharp.  They hurt on first use.  We have been using Gillette for years, and these blades are not of the same quality.  There&#x27;s a reason they don&#x27;t cost much.  We will never buy these again.</li>
            <li> Was a great price due to a special offer and the same quality you expect</li>
            <li> Do not expect the quality of razors that you would buy in your local drugstore. Even if these are true Gillette razors (debatable), they may be very outdated. The back of the packaging says copyright 2001. A couple shaves with these razors and they are dull. Should&#x27;ve just gone to the store...</li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t often review anything.  Most things work as advertised and I&#x27;ve not had any big issues.  This is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package and popped a new blade on my handle. and thought I&#x27;d somehow put the old blade back on.  The new blade was duller and pulled more than the blade that had been on my razor for nearly a month.  I tried.  Dug the old blade out of the rash and put it back on.and it was sharper.  Went to Target to get another 5-pack of blades and they are fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands and types of razors and blades and have found that I always go back to the Mach 3. Yes, they are a bit pricey, but I have found that a package of 15 lasts me about a year since I only replace them about every 4-5 shaves.</li>
            <li> Mach 3&#x27;s are the way to go! I had a concern with my order and the vendor cleared it up immediately. These are the real thing and it&#x27;s a great price. It&#x27;s a vendor you can trust.</li>
            <li> I knew of the product before i ordered it from you. I ha d purchased this before from dealers in the community but found that they charged too much for this product; this was something that I used everyday and therefore wanted to see if I could find a better price for it on the open market.  Obviously, this was found via your website.  If I can find a better outlet, I will pursue it.</li>
            <li> The best razors around and have held up over time.  Awesome price for a bulk package.  Have trusted the brand for years.</li>
            <li> I bought these Mach 3 cartridges and don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t shave as the ones I buy locally neither do they last as long, but for the price it is acceptable.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product!</li>
            <li> My husband loves Gillette and so do I! I sneak and use his razor when he&#x27;s not around instead of mine lol.</li>
            <li> Have used these for several years. They work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Always consistent quality and the blades last.</li>
            <li> I still use this older style blade and this is a fair price on a subscrbe and save situation.</li>
            <li> A+++ the best.  Years ago when they first introduced these the blades lasted much longer.  Now they get dull after a week or 10 days.  Maybe they changed the quality of steel?  Who knows.  You get a smooth baby&#x27;s behind shave the first 5 times you use them.  I bought a 36 pack.  They were genuine.  I would repeat.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the price is outstanding.  No longer do I have to worry about when to pick up new blades.  The subscription system is wonderful.  Every two months they notify us that they will be sending out the next shipment.  If the blades aren&#x27;t needed, we just request they skip this shipment.  We love the convenience and price.  Plus there are no shipping fees associated with the subscription.</li>
            <li> I bought these during shave season for me with last mid spring until the beginning of the fall, I didn&#x27;t use all 15.  The blades hold up pretty well as long as you don&#x27;t abuse them ie run them under hot water etc.  I can say they hold up better than the cheaper three blade system that I had ordered recently.</li>
            <li> These blades last a full month for me and I could probably use them longer then that.  Good shave and the sharpness seems to last</li>
            <li> I got a Mach 3 for my 18th b-day and have been using them ever since. Good marketing on their part. Got me hooked when I was young. Ive moved on from just shaving my face with them. Now I shave my head with them everyday. Smooth with no cuts, if you do get cuts you&#x27;re not doing it right, lol.</li>
            <li> I got more for my monies, My boyfriend need some badly and this blaze came t the right time. He was very happy</li>
            <li> Poor quality . Not a original product . Fake reviews in Amazon</li>
            <li> These are great razors that I have been using for a while now.  They cut nice, and I am glad I could save money by purchasing these online.  Overall, a good buy!</li>
            <li> What can I say?  They&#x27;re smooth on my skin, don&#x27;t cut me and leaves my face (and other parts...) nice and smoothe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was a little slow, so if you order, be proactive and be prepared for a \\&quot;rabbinical beard\\&quot; until they arrive...</li>
            <li> These are a low end, poor quality replacement heads. Even a new blade is coarse and can hardly last for 1 shave. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> Got it a great price and love Mach 3. Buying on sale is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Mach3 might not provide the shave of the &amp;#34;Fusion&amp;#34; system,&amp;#34; but I can barely justify the cost of these; much less the higher-end ones.  I have a very coarse beard, so these cartridges usually provide me with a good clean shave for between 3 and 5 uses.</li>
            <li> Regardless of how many new products Gillette puts out this will always be my favorite.</li>
            <li> As other guys have stated when reviewing this cartridge for shaving by Gillette, I also have a thick beard that comes in fast! (After just three days I begin to look as if I&#x27;ve been stranded on a desert island!) These Mach 3 cartridges really do an excellent job although I will say that I bought mine in a local brick and mortar store; therefore it&#x27;s hard for me to comment about the mixed reviews that have been posted for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the many different razors I have used in the past, these Mach3 cartridges give me an amazing, close shave without nicking me all over. I also like how the lubricating strip changes color to white so I can instantly tell that it&#x27;s time to change the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these Mach3 Base cartridges for shaving by Gillette. If you have concerns about the quality of the cartridges you&#x27;ll get you can always try them first by getting them at a local store before buying them on this website.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably \\&quot;shame on me\\&quot; for not realizing it but there are a LOT fewer cartridges in here than I realized. I&#x27;m used to spending the same amount of money at Costco for a pack of 5 or 6 sets of cartridges.... I can&#x27;t remember how many came in this but I want to say it was only 2. I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use these for work and not sure if these are actually Mac 3 razors .there are so many counterfeit ones out there and these I have so concern.</li>
            <li> These blades provide a smooth, consistent shave that rarely nicks or cuts you no matter how new the blade.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t genuine gillette mach 3 blades which is obvious by the gel strip. That being said the razors themselves are fairly good but it does get dull faster. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them I would go with some other knock off that is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love these razors and have been using them for years.  Why are they so expensive???</li>
            <li> perfect for my husbands Mach3 razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these razor cartridges for years. It was nice to get it right the second try.</li>
            <li> Blades. They cut ma beard.</li>
            <li> Good price for a blade that seems to be getting harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> The blades last a while and provide a&lt;br /&gt;Close shave.  I have been using them for years.  Hope you have the same experience.</li>
            <li> super fast and excellemt</li>
            <li> It looked like it would be convenient at a good price although this review process is a real pain in the behind.</li>
            <li> Took a while to find refills for hubby&#x27;s razor...he is very happy with them.  Has always liked that razor and was disappointed when we had trouble finding refills.</li>
            <li> These razors are so damn expensive. I&#x27;ve researched the cheapest price extensively and these are the lowest I&#x27;ve found anywhere for the 15 pack.</li>
            <li> Works good as expected from Gillette Cartridges. Comes good packed and seems original. Good price. Usually my husband shaves every day ex. weekend and a cartridge lasts about 3 or more weeks.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone. Using these razors feels like using the orange disposable BIC razors. Save your money and buy the ones from the store.</li>
            <li> Next to Gillette&#x27;s stainless, adjustable razor of old, this is the best and easiest shave ever!  I only wish that they would BRING BACK THE ADJUSTABLE STAINLESS DOUBLE EDGE RAZOR! It was the best product that they have ever made!</li>
            <li> Dull and abrasive. Go with the mach 3 turbo, not worth the savings</li>
            <li> Great price. Just like at the store but a lot less money. These are the same blades you get in the store.</li>
            <li> I am sure that there is a long winded way to express the utility of the MACH3 cartridges,&lt;br /&gt;suffice it to say that I am not planning on switching to another razor.</li>
            <li> Best price I could find on AmazonÂ® at the time. It&#x27;s the real deal product and not some Chinese knock off brand. Recommended</li>
            <li> Still the best I have so far used.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these blades for ever and they do the trick. They&#x27;re sharp and seem to last a long time. I give it 4 stars because I just can never get over the high price of these blades. o_O</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving with a double edged razor for a couple of years now, and came across a mach3 cartridge from the old days in my bathroom cabinet.  I had memories of decades worth of painful shaves using cartridges and other disposables. I had already lathered up to use my double edged razor, and tried this cartridge on a whim. I was very pleasantly surprised. The mach3 was almost as comfortable as the old fashioned DE blades, and it gave a shave that was even closer than a single pass with my DE razor.  It turns out the secret with a comfortable shave has more to do with properly lathering your face than it has to do with the type of razor.  Unfortunately, shaving with mach3 means I would have to shave almost every day. After 4 days of not shaving, a mach3 clogs up hopelessly with hairs and it takes 30+ minutes to shave if you don&#x27;t pre-shave with a beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So mach3 fans, do yourself a favor: buy a shaving brush (even a cheap  $8 drug store one), a soap puck ($1 for Williams mug soap, or more for fancier brands), learn how to work up a thick lather from youtube videos. It takes some practice to perfect it, but it is time well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t repeat the experience with mach3 though, unless I find more &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; surprise cartridges lying around. Even at these lower amazon prices.  A year of shaving with mach3 is at least $200. That&#x27;s about the same as a I would pay for lifetime supply of double-edged razor blades.  But if you insist on using MACH3, at least ditch the NASTY and useless foam cans, and use a real shaving soap. Even the expensive shaving gels and creams and gels you apply by hand are pretty useless. Use a brush and a proper shaving soap.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors on the market even though they are quite pricey, but not as pricey as some others.</li>
            <li> This price (subscribe &amp; save, with 4 other products for a 20% discount) is the best! I actually switched my razor to match my husband&#x27;s because it&#x27;s such a better deal...almost $2.00 cheaper per cartridge. The blades are really thin and make my legs silky smooth. I love this razor!</li>
            <li> Normally I just purchase razor blades at Walmart or Sam&#x27;s Club, but this time I found the best price on Amazon. I saved over $8 on this pack of 15 over the Sam&#x27;s Club price. I know most people just pick them up at the store, but in this case, we were ordering anyway and when we added this product to our cart on Amazon, we got the free shipping and since we are over 10 miles from the closest store, the savings really does add up.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time/as advertised.</li>
            <li> Needed a color match with my new buffalo horn handle. Too much of a color clash with gray - which is the only color I can find in stores.</li>
            <li> I love how easy these blades are to clean.  The shaving scum goes through to the other side.  Water rinses right through.  Cheap disposables have a tendency to get clogged up causing you to cut your self easier.</li>
            <li> I swear they make these blades more dull every year so that you have to keep buying them..... But overall this product is exactly as described and sure saves you money over buying the smaller packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you just gotta shell out if you want to be beautiful ;-)</li>
            <li> This 15 count razor package was always out of stock at my local store.  It was nice to be able to locate it on Amazom because it&#x27;s always cheaper to buy in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> El producto es lo esperado. Recibido en perfectas condiciones. Agradecido con el vendedor por la responsabilidad y compromiso de entrega.- Gracias</li>
            <li> These give me a good clean shave and they last quite a while. Buying them in these bulk packages helps to get the cost of shaving down.</li>
            <li> great  price for that much  I always use this brand work for me great  I will keep using  if stays same price.</li>
            <li> I looked at other online stores and this was the best price for these blades at approx. $2/per.  If you put off buying these because you hate forking over the money, just bite the bullet and buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> Smoother than an android&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Great deal good razors</li>
            <li> they are razors. they shave your face. they do just that. If your like me your buying this because that is the handle you have.</li>
            <li> wish these were cheaper but good value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;Skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated but lubricant gel fades too fast.</li>
            <li> Great deal! Quality seems legit. Price comparable to Sam&#x27;s Club &amp; Costco.</li>
            <li> Comfortable shave beyond belief. I&#x27;ve started a 4-month subscription. Surreal.</li>
            <li> Great product. You need this.</li>
            <li> This is not the original it seems. Whatever I bought from CVS is different than this product. This performance is very bad. Please don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> works great. They last about as long as store bought I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> These are a great buy.  However, wherever these come from, quality control may be a bit lax.  I have blades which actually last for months, and then find one which is done in about a week.  Most are in the &#x27;for months&#x27; category.  So buy them here.</li>
            <li> With dollar shave club, Harry&#x27;s and other competition, these razors are too expensive and need to be more competitively priced. Won&#x27;t be buying anymore!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re knockoffs but it seems like they were &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34;? They didn&#x27;t give nearly as smooth a shave as the Gillette cartridges I get locally.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine at his point there is anything left to say about Mach 3 blades. But for me they clog way less than Fusion ones and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Best blades I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money!!!</li>
            <li> I like that I can have this product shipped to my house when I choose. I liked that I got an extra discount for subscribing &amp; saving.  We have used MACH 3 for a long time. Excellent razors. Loved the idea that I just clicked and saved with Amazon discount and clicked to also use a PG coupon.  AGAIN I check this price at Wal-mart and saved big time.</li>
            <li> These arrived in factory sealed original un tampered container. If you like these razors then you will be happy, I have been using Mach 3 for years and price was better then stores so I ordered these, will continue to order from amazon.</li>
            <li> Good economical package.  No issues.  Saves a lot over regular retail prices.  Same blades as in stores, but cheaper.  Good deal.</li>
            <li> Works well for me to dry shave every morning although I have gone 3 days and if careful you can still get a great shave</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where some of these super-negative reviews are coming from.  I&#x27;ve purchased these blades twice from Amazon with no problems every time.  I got good blades at a good price.  In my opinion, some of the negative reviews raise issues that aren&#x27;t technically possible.  These razors are packaged from the factory in very sturdy, sealed packaging.  I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone could spoof or fake it.  Solid razors at a good price ordered from Amazon.  No problems.  No worries.</li>
            <li> got these due to great price with subscribe and save.  will keep getting them as long as the price remains decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the blades are good. last longer than some brands.  fits both my razor and my husband&#x27;s razor so it is a great value to us.</li>
            <li> These seem to be the real thing and function well.  No complaints and a good prices.  Would buy again.  Purchasing items like this from Amazon is a great idea.</li>
            <li> My x used these for years. They made her legs feel very nice. It&#x27;s a damn shame I don&#x27;t get to feel them any more. ;-)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mach3 for about 7 years now and I have not interest in using anything else. Very smooth, no nicks or cuts and last for 3-4 weeks per blade with daily use. The 15 pack was the best price I found anywhere per blade.</li>
            <li> The razors are great and come at a very good price.  I will continue ordering these because I can&#x27;t come up with any reason not to.</li>
            <li> A good price/value for razor blades. They have been very good and I get several uses out of each one.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 86 year old Dad, he already has everything he needs, and with blades being so expensive, I thought he would enjoy this every day.  I use that brand too.  They are really good.  Wish blades weren&#x27;t so expensive.  I&#x27;m able to use one blade for several weeks with these.....just for my legs.</li>
            <li> Always seem to run out of razors at the worst times. I just buy a pack or two of these and forget about it for a year.</li>
            <li> Mach 3 blades are wonderful for shaving. Very few nicks. Great shave!! I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Quality has gone down</li>
            <li> These work to shave my face. I don&#x27;t use the arm, just hold the razor directly in my fingers, which I like better. Better control. Good stuff</li>
            <li> Was a great choice to buy these razors in bulk. great quality at a discount. Each razor lasts a long time so this package will last me over 6 months.</li>
            <li> With the excenge rate i can get better deals somewhere also.</li>
            <li> We are very happy this purchase.</li>
            <li> They get the job done, though they&#x27;ve become a hassle to find.  They usually last through a few shaves, but the overall cost is fairly high.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing this model from Amazon. I was too late to return these blades otherwise I would have done so.  The blades did not seem to be super sharp and wore out after a few shaves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it was the blades or the new Gillette model!  I do know that I will not be purchasing on line from Amazon or will purchase this model some where else!</li>
            <li> Keeps my face and my junk nice and trimmed.</li>
            <li> Sharp and gives the smoothest shave. Been ordering these cartridges for almost 2 years now. NO REGRETS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the cartridges come in a plastic pack where you can literally discard old razor and rearm you razor without having to even touch the new blades.</li>
            <li> The Mach3 is a good shave and fairly durable. I can get 8-10 shaves per cartridge, depending upon how much beard has grown. They are expensive, however.</li>
            <li> quality and price was good</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mach3 blades by mistake, and what a mistake it was!  These blades belong in the disposable razor catagory.&lt;br /&gt;I would return but I threw away the packaging.  Mach3 Turbo is what I normally buy, what a difference!</li>
            <li> Great buy! right after Gilette released Fusion pro glide which doesnt mean anything! the Mach3 became hard to find. I used to get them at Costco (not anymore) great blades shave great. I have a thick beard and one of this guys lasts me a month.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Mach 3 then switched to the Mach 3 turbo when they came out.  Prices for blades have gotten way beyond reasonable.  So much so that retailers often lock them up like jewelry or watches.  I decided to try the Mach 3 thinking that they may not last as long, but would provide a cheaper per shave cost.  However, the Mach 3 gave me an uncomfortable shave even on first use of the blade.  In my estimation, the quality of the Mach 3 has deteriorated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase them again. I am looking for a reasonably priced alternative to the Mach 3 Turbo as well.</li>
            <li> i have used these razors for years and will continue to as long as they are in production. I have burn scars (2nd degree) and makes it hard to shave,but with these i shave with no hassle at all!</li>
            <li> Ordered this package of Gillette blades at a very good price...and it was delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;More expensive than the Dollar Shave Club...but the blades are so much better.</li>
            <li> This is a really a great buy.  My wife and I love the way these blades last and a half the price.</li>
            <li> These blades last a couple weeks each, so they aren&#x27;t all that expensive for good shaves with no missed whiskers.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and I take care of my Father who is also disabled, at age 90! Being able to receive items in larger volume and delivered to my door is great. Prices are pretty good too.</li>
            <li> i never ordered these. they were sent in same pkg as a shirt i bought</li>
            <li> Cheap way to get them!</li>
            <li> No problem with this one!</li>
            <li> Great blades at a good price.</li>
            <li> These razors work just like you&#x27;d expect. They&#x27;re new, arrived quickly, and saved some money. All in all a good buy.</li>
            <li> good blades that last a while and provide a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Razors are authentic Gillette Mach 3 blades.  Work great.</li>
            <li> I use these men&#x27;s razors instead of women&#x27;s razors...  This size of a pack lasts me over a year AND I have not gotten a better shave!  I use Kiss My Face shaving cream with and the combination is great!  So smooth.</li>
            <li> Love my gillet mach 3 razor and needed more heads, will be buying more in the future, they work very well.</li>
            <li> So glad these are available without the razor.  I wish Gillette would make the large multi-packs for all of their razor blades.</li>
            <li> These do not compare to the five blades razors on the market today. After three uses, I have to throw them out and use a new razor so that I don&#x27;t cut my legs. You get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li> Tried lots of razor blades, and Mach3 is the smoothest shave in the disposable razor market.  Just wish they were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> You want to pay $2~$3 per razor blade? My momma raised no fool. I went shopping on Amazon and found double edge safety razor blades, 100 for 10 dollars. The ratings were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette is brain washing America.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They shave the hair off my face and are the easiest razors to rinse out that I have used.  That is all I ask.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying the Mach3 Turbo baldes, but it was probably my mistake. Just make sure you know exactly what you are buying. The Mach3 are good, but I hear the Turbo are better.</li>
            <li> The shavers are perfect and the real thing. Before I purchased this pack of shavers I read a bunch of reviews about people receiving counterfeit shavers. However, these shavers are the real deal. Make sure you but ONLY the blister pack of shavers. I came to the conclusion that the cardboard box shavers where the counterfeit ones.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! A great way to shop... I recomended for everyone. You get what you want without moving from ypur home</li>
            <li> These razors are amazing for women. Buy the pink razor no more - this will solve all of your hair removal woes. And save you money. And produce less waste. Great buy. Great shave.</li>
            <li> I am not sure where Amazon gets these blades. They are not very good. They don&#x27;t last very long. I have had batches of these identical blades that would last 15 shaves. These don&#x27;t even last 7. I feel these are meant to be sold in 3rd world countries. I would not buy these from Amazon again. Plus I think Gillette is over charging for these and taking advantage of lack of decent competition in blade technology. These have become very very expensive..</li>
            <li> Excellent product, good service from vendor as well as priced right.  I certainly would reorder without hesitation. Delivered in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product as advertised that was offered at a decent price; not counterfeit or reconditioned as some of the reviews would like you to believe.  Unfortunately anyone can make a review for a product or vender at this site so criticisms can come from anywhere, including competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very thick beard that has always been a good product test for shaving system and this one passed for being what it claimed to be.  With the current economic problems and costs rising faster than salaries we are all looking for a good deal, and at the price this item was offered it was a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Great product, ships easy and competitive price. Subscribe and save makes it so simple so you never run out of razors. Mach3 are expensive, so every little bit helps</li>
            <li> Shaving with these blades is like shaving with a rattlesnake, never know when they will strike out and bite.  I replaced with same product from drugstore and got a perfect shave again from blades I could use with confidence.  I ignored the negative reviews and paid for it with my blood.  I have been a very frequent Amazon customer for years and this is the worst product I have purchased.</li>
            <li> delivered as promised delivery was good I am happy I don&#x27;t know what else to say about such a review.  It was perfect.  after all they were new razor blades</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to purchase these razor blades as it appears that many people are receiving counterfeit products that were dull and useless. I decided to take a chance as these were being shipped and sold by Amazon so I figured that if I received fakes I would just return them as returns are pretty simple with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my razors arrived and they were indeed genuine Gillette razor blades. My shave was smooth and nick free and the blades stayed sharp for several shaves. I included some pics of the product packaging so people can compare the product they are receiving to the ones I got. I have ordered Mach 3 blades from Ebay in the past and received horrible razors packaged in what looked like official packaging but made out of cardboard instead of the plastic that the retail ones come one. Perhaps that is an indication of counterfeits?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase and will certainly be ordering more. If I end up getting counterfeit product in the future I will definitely update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 05/15/2012- I purchased another order from Amazon and again recieved genuine Gillette razor blades. Whatever the issue was in the past with people getting counterfeit blades seems to have been fixed.</li>
            <li> I sent these to my dad, and he said it&#x27;s very good to him.&lt;br /&gt;He likes it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard. Barbers have said no to giving me a shave. I have been using Gillette Sensors for years and thought I would try Gillette&#x27;s latest marketing innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on blade 5 and believe I can make a decent assessment of them versus Sensors, for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: Poor, they started out dragging and they still drag. Switched to a vibrator handle, no improvement. Feels like the blades are bending rather than maintaining a stiff edge. My face feels it.&lt;br /&gt;Speed of shave: At first it was taking me twice the time to get a mediocre shave. After 5 blades, it still takes longer than a Sensor, with far more strokes and, only on occasion, can give me as close a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Close in places:  Poor, they are simply to big to get into tight places.&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use: Different and not in a good way. They are large and the Sensors are far easier to put on and take off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If you have a tough beard, I&#x27;d recommend you buy a few and be prepared to bail and go back to whatever you were using. Or, take a pass altogether. I bought 15 blades and am stuck for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Gillette marketing gimmick that, for me, does not deliver.</li>
            <li> i loved the underfwear but they are a little snug everything else  was just right thanks</li>
            <li> These are my husbands favorite razors, after 4 months of Dollar Shave Club, I agreed we could go back to buying these. The last batch I received was just okay. One razor head did not want to stay on. I switched handles (we have many Gillette handles from years of buying) and still had the issue. So far it was just 1 out of 15. My husband wants me to buy from a brick and mortar, but will give Amazon another try.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, good quality product.</li>
            <li> Razor blades are razor blades.  I have been shaving for about 63 years and used a lot of Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> Soft and subtle on the skin- does a neat job</li>
            <li> Seem kind of dull.not the same as the ones bought locally.</li>
            <li> Dry them off with a towel between uses and each blade will last you a very long time (I&#x27;ve been getting a month or more out of each).</li>
            <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> The Mach3 has been the pinnacle of razor design since it&#x27;s introduction.  Highlights of the razor include the way the cartridge is slung from the handle and the open, free-rinsing blades design.  I find the razor light and maneuverable, and the blades stay sharp a long time, though I have a relatively light beard.  For me, the cartridge&#x27;s high cost is it&#x27;s only drawback but I got mine with a coupon discount that helped a lot with that defect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hairy.  These make me less hairy and last for a lot longer than standard razors.  Seriously what else does anyone need to know?</li>
            <li> Just as good as the ones in the store. I checked amazon for the fun of it and found that even with shipping, I saved $7 on razors by having them delivered to my door. Walmart was more expensive. Go figure. Same exact blades that I am used to. Good close shave. Will order again when I run through all 15 blades.</li>
            <li> I had this on auto order and then the price changed pretty dramatically. be careful.</li>
            <li> not a lot to say here. These are the razors I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  Came quickly. sharp and non-irritating. easy to rinse.  Don&#x27;t pinch or catch hair like schick does.</li>
            <li> The razors, as usual are great. Price on this deal was fantastic, over 25 % below store prices</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mach 3 blades for many years. They work the best for me. And buying them through Amazon saved me about half the cost that the major drug chains charge.</li>
            <li> I hope Gillette never stops making these. For me they&#x27;re Perfection. More than 3 blades irritates my skin, and I usually nick myself terribly with single blade &amp;#34;bic&amp;#34; type disposables, so for me these are heaven. Sadly I have to shave my face every morning, but I can usually get 10-12 uses before needing to change cartridges. I do wish that these were cheaper, currently they cost about 2.30-2.50 per cartridge depending on how many you buy at once. But since I do like the results I get so muchI don&#x27;t mind paying that. Still $1.50 per blade would be SWEET hint hint. BTW, if you know someone who uses these or similar expensive blades, they make an awesome and very useful gift idea or stocking stuffer at Christmas time. Everyone appreciates a gift that saves them money, right? Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> There is no where else you can get this great price. I save so much money buying these. I use each for about 3 weeks and I shave every day. 15 of them would last me almost a year which is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my nephews it is brand they used  they like it</li>
            <li> Good price...genuine product</li>
            <li> What to say about razor blades? Price was good and delivery efficient. One has to wonder why these blades as so expensive, but as they are we just have to look elsewhere for more reasonable prices. Thank you, Amazon</li>
            <li> Some of these are bad razors. The head doesn&#x27;t move up and down as they should makes you have to waste at least 3-5 out of the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> go to razors. Been using them for years. No problems or issues.</li>
            <li> 15 cartridges for a very reasonable price. I use them to trim around my beard - they will last a couple of years.</li>
            <li> These are just like the store bought ones. I did not receive knockoffs. At the price they are a great deal for those who use this razor.</li>
            <li> Great product at no so bad of a price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice to get so many at such a good price. these should last me a year. I shave 2 times a week, face and head. I have a moustache and goatee, and one last&#x27;s for about a month! I don&#x27;t do anything special to it when I am done except rinse it off in the Hot water out of the tap, tap it on it&#x27;s side to shake off the loose water, and lay it down. Done!</li>
            <li> As inexpensive as I could find. Walmart is usually out of this item in the fifteen pack So get this hot item while you still have facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many razor blades over the years, but have experienced no closer or more comfortable shaves than those provided by the Gillette MACH3 Cartridges.  I cannot perceive a difference between these blades and four-bladed designs. They seem to last an extraordinary length of time between replacement, which helps justify the cost.  Amazon Prime value and rapid delivery spoil me as usual.</li>
            <li> By far Gillette is my favorite brand when we talk about shaving experience. I try a lot of brands over years but still this is the BEST</li>
            <li> These blades are the best I&#x27;ve found. Consistently good and easy to shave with. The price at Amazon is right and the delivery with Prime is fast.</li>
            <li> Love these razors- and buying them here on amazon is the best bargain ever!!!  Well worth the price.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with these razors- they last forever!</li>
            <li> Was a little concerned when I ordered this, based on reviews of other similar products where purchasers said they were not genuine Gillette blades. But this seems like the real thing to me. And they shipped 2 8-packs, so 16 blades, not 15 as advertised. Roughly half the price as what is sold in stores. Great deal.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s intended job, and it does it quite well. These things are outrageously expensive, but cheaper than the ones with 35-or-some-odd blades that they try and sell to everyone now. 3 blades does just as good a job as 5. 5 just costs more. I&#x27;ll stick with the Mach 3 until they no longer make them.</li>
            <li> If you like mach 3 well then this is the cheapest place to get them.  Amazon price is less then wholesale story and saves you a trip out to the store</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at Sam&#x27;s but I cannot find them in the store anymore.  They&#x27;ve worked better than anything since I was 16 years old and Glliette sent me a razor for free.</li>
            <li> Even though it states this item can be shipped within the U.S., they still wont ship it to me in Alaska. I guess Alaska is not considered part of the United States. I was under the impression that Alaska was the 49th state? Item weighs 4 ounces not 40 pounds. You would think that after all the money someone spends with a company that they would be more helpful. In the end, its the company that loses the money. Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Further to my review below, I would like to note that I purchased these blades from an external source on Amazon (not directly through Amazon). I have added this amendment after going back and reading insightful comments from other reviewers. As mentioned, these are terrific (long-lasting) blades when I have purchased directly through a pharmacy. Other reviewers have had no issues when purchasing directly via Amazon, so I will try that route next time around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not believe these are real Gillette Mach3 blades. Both my boyfriend and I have already gone through half of the package and they are single-use only! They become incredibly dull after 1 use. The Mach3 blades that I usually purchase at the pharmacy are super smooth through several uses (face, legs, etc). These are dull after one use only, tearing at our skin and  across our skin! They appear to be counterfeit. I would absolutely not recommend these to anyone; the savings certainly was not worth it.</li>
            <li> good product and its same as mentioned</li>
            <li> Easier and Better than purchasing at store</li>
            <li> Great. Pricing for a standard set of Mach 3 razor blades</li>
            <li> Product as described and a much better deal than purchasing locally.</li>
            <li> good price. arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Disappointed not as good as some new lady disposable that I got. Seems like there is a difference between the ones you get out of the store and these</li>
            <li> These are the blades I use. So, to get them at a reduced cost is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Identical to what you&#x27;d buy in your local store, but cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;JF</li>
            <li> This was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;No surprises.</li>
            <li> Identical to blades from the store, as far as I can tell, but cheaper. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> They are the best at shaving my face when it needs to look fresh and smiling for the day at work</li>
            <li> Great service - delivered &amp; packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I am accustomed to Schick Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;Schick Quattro is a superior product compared to these blades.&lt;br /&gt;Too many slices on my face &amp; the blades don&#x27;t stay sharp for long.&lt;br /&gt;I am tossing out the Gillette blades and getting my Schick back!&lt;br /&gt;Not making that mistake again!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Mach 3 razors since the 1990s, and I buy this 15-pack here on Amazon because they&#x27;re cheaper at $1.84/each than buying them at Costco.  Add in free SuperSaver or Prime shipping and they&#x27;re a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like that the Mach 3 razor cartridges last for several weeks, even with daily shaving.  They give a smooth, close, nick-free shave without any irritation, and the blades don&#x27;t rust when left in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried all kinds of blades through the years, and always come back to Mach 3.</li>
            <li> These blades work very well on my thick beard.  There isn&#x27;t any reason for me to pay more for any other blade.</li>
            <li> I dont normally buy things like this from Amazon, but these were much cheaper than in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they were the genuine item too... not some Chinese rip off</li>
            <li> I shave my head basically every day, and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact, I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade, because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality, durability, etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes, they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked, then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don&#x27;t know this about disposable razor blades, I&#x27;m sorry to be the one to inform you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was right for me, and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I&#x27;m satisifed.</li>
            <li> A good close shave without nicks The price on Prime really cut the cost on this item, without the hassle of looking around for them.</li>
            <li> Best refile blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> great value! way cheaper than buying at the store and it ships free if you dont mind the wait, worth it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Mach3 razors from the Amazon website before but got roped into buying the cheapest set from a third party vendor.  Needless to say, if they were Mach3 razors, they were in the scrap or reject pile.  I decided to order a new set from the Amazon.com seller and these have worked flawlessly so far.  If my viewpoint changes, I will update this post, but for now, a nice product, great price, and when I ordered the set of 15, the total was over $25 which gave me the free shipping.  I saw a set of 8 going for over $20 at the local Big Box, so a nice value here and would definately buy again.</li>
            <li> el tiempo de envio y la calidad del producto fue de acuerdo a lo esperado. se recomienda a nuevos clientes</li>
            <li> I use these and love them. The moisturizing strip works well for 2 shaves, but then is pretty useless. I get about 5 or 6 shaves out of each blade before I replace it.They are getting harder to find in the stores, when they do carry them they are usually out of stock. I like that you can get a subscription to have them sent every month.</li>
            <li> muchas gracias amigo estoy muy contento y satifecho con el producto era mejor de lo q esperba se lo recomiendo a ojos cerrado</li>
            <li> Iâm disappointed with this item. the mach3 box was not sealed. Cartridges seemed USED, you can tell by the worn color strip and rusty razors. arrived only 14 cartridges</li>
            <li> I bought these at Walmart and I don&#x27;t know what Gillette did but the blades don&#x27;t cut or glide as well as they did 8 years ago. Thought I would go back to the razor I used from  1998 to 2008 I think Gillette may be doing this on purpose to get you to buy fusion blades. I remember these blades would last me 3 weeks now they last 4 days.</li>
            <li> great razors, price is great, repeat delivery is awesome, no more running out of razors.</li>
            <li> exceeded my expectations on timely delivery of a quality product</li>
            <li> I love this price, free shipping, and not having to remember to pick these up at the store. They just automatically ship them when I need them. These also work on the women&#x27;s Venus Vibrance razor. I didn&#x27;t like the razors that came with mine, they had shaving cream already in them but I really liked the razor. This is a good fix for that situation.</li>
            <li> my husband and i both use them. great deal and its always nice to know there are some in the cabinet when i need one!</li>
            <li> Yeah, I still use these. The thing is once I find something I like , I pretty much stick with it. I&#x27;m sure the ones with 4 blades are better, I guess, but these work great. I shave my head too, well two thirds anyway.</li>
            <li> Almost lasts one week.</li>
            <li> The subject line expresses my feelings... plus on more than one occasion the rotating head has fallen off after a few uses. Maybe it&#x27;s time to switch to an electric razor!</li>
            <li> i use it because the better one is too expensive...</li>
            <li> Cheaper then walmart. Came in original package. Nice buy</li>
            <li> This feels like the ones I get from the store.  It took a long time to order these because of the bad reviews, but once good ones started coming in I decided to take a chance.  Well, it paid off cause so far no problems with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 26 Mar 13, still using blades from this order.  I shave about two or three time a week so it&#x27;s about a month before I change blades.  Still satisfied with order.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should change my blades more often, but I use these for over a month before changing. Sometimes two months. I don&#x27;t get razor burn or cuts, so I&#x27;m not sure why I should change them. I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t better or cheaper blades, but I&#x27;m not aware of any.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first with all the negative reviews claiming a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered directly from Amazon and the product I received was not fake (as far as I can tell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors are sharp and work great.  It comes with three packs of five that snap into the back of the plastic thing that holds your Mach3 razor base\handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets with my purchase.</li>
            <li> IF you haven&#x27;t given these a shot, I highly recommend doing so. Very smooth, comfortable shave. Great if you suffer from razor burn, etc.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the money. It is what it promises - 15 blades. Cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and at this price I will be ordering again and again. I have been recommending for a while now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different blades over the years and have settled on these for the last few years.  The Fusion blades work well if not a tad better but don&#x27;t justify the higher price.  These are crazy expensive too for what your getting but I will admit I keep buying them.  They do work much better than the generic two blade versions.  I just never understand how a persons hair can dull a steel blade so quickly after a few shaves.  Seems like they should last forever.</li>
            <li> These simply are the best blades on the market.</li>
            <li> Amazon delivered the Gillette blades in 2 days. Great product with a awesome price.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by these razors and will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Mach3 Cartridges, Package containing 15 cartridges are an original merchandise of excellent quality and as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and this vendor.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the blades sharpness.. I have been using Mach 3 from quite a long time but never had this complain. For the first time I ordered these blades online. They either seem to be an old product with lost sharpness or something else.. not particularly happy..</li>
            <li> Excellent&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li> I usually buy the Mach 3 Turbo blades but these were a much better buy so I got them thinking there wouldn&#x27;t be a big difference. The blades probably last half the time that the Turbo blades do and aren&#x27;t as smooth of a shave. I shave about every day and one blade is beyound using after about a week to a week and a half. This is about half as long as I can get the Turbo to go. If I was to judge these blades on there own I think I would give them 5 stars, but compaired to the Mach 3 Turbo blades, they just aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> great deal compared to department store pricing. Wish they came in larger quantity packages. will continue to but here though</li>
            <li> I like Mach 3 razors but I always run out of things like this and goes for days without stopping to pick them up. Now with Prime when I see I need something I just order from Amazon and it shows up at my house. They had a good price on these razor blades too.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my husband every christmas and have found the best prices right here.  He likes the way they shave and does not want to switch.</li>
            <li> This was the best price on these razor blades I could find anywhere, and they are authentic. It&#x27;s the same thing you&#x27;ve seen in the store for the last decade or so. Now all razor blade pricing is a total scam. The companies will practically give you the shavors and one blade, but then if you want to buy replacements, you have to just hand them your wallet and hope they leave you with enough money to take the bus home to your cardboard box in the abandoned alley because you cannot afford a nicer home due to all the money you spend on razor blades. I mean... the only other option is to quit shaving, and grow a Grizzly Adams style beard. Why do you think all hobos have such insane beards? Do you seriously think they could afford to buy these razor blades. Ha!</li>
            <li> I had really wanted the Gillette Fusion ProGlide blades.  I looked at the picture and didn&#x27;t notice only 3 blades instead of 5.  My mistake.  I used Mach3 for over a year and was happy until I tried the Fusion ProGlide blades and liked them better.  With the Fusion (5) blades didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; as much.  Oh, well I&#x27;ll remember the brand names better next year when I have to reorder.</li>
            <li> Soft skin + thick, coarse facial hair means spending a lot on blades. These are the best I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used them all, but they are pricey. You&#x27;re face is worth it though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved these since they were available back in the day</li>
            <li> shaving is a chore, I had a beard for over 26 years before the wife said it made me look old. Newsflash... I look old cuz I am. GRIN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these are the best price I&#x27;ve found and they are as described so what more can you say... if you love Mach3 you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I tried cheaper alternatives and they just didn&#x27;t give me as close of a shave.</li>
            <li> These razors are the best, enough said. They stay sharp for many many shaves and even when they are dull they still pull through on a clean shave.</li>
            <li> these razors are a very good value for the money, but I must say if the coupon would not have been applied, I would not have made the purchase</li>
            <li> I still dont get why shaving has to be so expensive.  These cartridges certainly give some good shaves, but they cost a small fortune.</li>
            <li> great product, no shipping issues</li>
            <li> Cheapest price you&#x27;ll find on these and great quality.</li>
            <li> Its works great. My warning light go off.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades at a nice price!  These are the real product that you&#x27;ll find at various stores.</li>
            <li> Great blades, Great price, No searching the stores, right at my finger tips.. I highly recomend buying this product on  line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 for years, it&#x27;s just perfect on my face without burn and a nice clean shave.  I decided I needed a new look and shaved my head, I used a specific razor advertised just for shaving your head bald.  As I expected I had to complete the job with my Mach3 blade.  It worked like a charm and my head is smooth.</li>
            <li> mach 3 blades are the only blades for me  i have tried all others ,  their 3 blade system works better  than any other !</li>
            <li> The blades work pretty well for the first couple shaves, but they start to get noticeably worse after only a week and become unusable after two. I&#x27;ve had cheaper disposables last for much longer than that. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> received brand new cartridge and am satisfied with the purchase....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how good they are, they&#x27;re half the price anywhere you go.  This is one of the most mark-up items I&#x27;ve ever seem on Amazon and I shop it A LOT!  Too bad really, but honestly I was buying these from you last year for $19...seriously, who would pay this price?!</li>
            <li> I was a bit wary of buying these because of other reviews indicating that they had received knockoffs.  As far as I can tell though, the blades I received are the legit Gillette product.  Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination but they don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the blades I&#x27;ve bought in store previously.  Still, a decent value.</li>
            <li> Great deal for so many Mach 3 Razor Heads. Will buy here again.</li>
            <li> Great shave!  Works as expected. Moisturizing strip works well but for no longer than a few shaves. Have used for years!</li>
            <li> Is great, my favorite for my delicate skin</li>
            <li> I regard these as a commodity item all coming from the same factory.  These were the cheapest at the time and not a knockoff.</li>
            <li> I love these blades.  They just work and Gillette continues to support a razor I&#x27;ve used for years.  The packaging and quality indicate these are authentic Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> excellent product, product as stated - excellent service! A+</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great item!</li>
            <li> love the mach3 razors, however the price makes me want to check out dollar shave club. if I went through these more often, I&#x27;d complain more, but I don&#x27;t so I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Husband is very happy with these blades</li>
            <li> Great savings compared to other retailers</li>
            <li> Mach 3 is still my favorite razor. Get a slight discount for buying in bulk. These ain&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> Great Deal, Received Quickly!</li>
            <li> best blades around, don&#x27;t compromise</li>
            <li> Good price for lots of razors.  My sensitive skin, however, tells me these blades are a couple frog hairs off.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they&#x27;re not as fine, spacing between blades is wider, don&#x27;t last as long as the exact same make and model you get at the store.  Something is up with the huge discount.  On the bright side, I&#x27;m very fashionable now because I don&#x27;t like to shave so much.  When I finally run out of blades, I may buy these again just because of the absurd prices at retailers.</li>
            <li> The Gillette mach 3 blades work great for my husband&#x27;s face, no complaints.</li>
            <li> These are a great buy!</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price. Thank you</li>
            <li> My husband loves these, they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Getting too expensive for something you throw away. Thinking about replacing my razor with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor my boyfriend uses and it does a good job getting a close shave. I just think these blades are really over priced. Maybe I&#x27;ll learn how to use a straight razor :)</li>
            <li> Worse blade I&#x27;ve ever used.  Barely good for one shave.  Finally started using them but now can&#x27;t send them back.</li>
            <li> I had a concern buying this item when I read quite a few reviews here saying that this item is a knock off. In my opinion it is genuine and is as sharp as the ones I used to buy before from big box store.</li>
            <li> Husband loves these blades, it is all he uses. Arrived on time, packaged well. Cheaper than at the military base! :-)</li>
            <li> Great blades I have no issues with these.</li>
            <li> These blades seem like fakes. My husband complained that they get dull and cause pain after a few shaves. Very disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than Costco and Bjs. Great product</li>
            <li> Maybe a straight blade is better and cleaner, maybe not I&#x27;ve never tried it, but I can&#x27;t shave with anything else.  This is great!</li>
            <li> As you know, the cost of razor blades has soared.  I talked to other guys and they all agreed.  The cost is so high that some guys stopped shaving each day, to stretch the cost.  Amazon has helped me save a lot of money on other products, and this is another great example of ordering from Amazon.  My Mach 3 order arrived earlier that expected, in tact with no problems.  Now I have plenty razor blades at a reduced cost.  (But I&#x27;m trying to stretch my shaves too).</li>
            <li> these blades are not lasting as long as what i was used to, the lubricating strip is gone by the second or third shave.</li>
            <li> In spite of all of the claims these are not legit blades, I bought them.  They are the real deal and last a long time.  I have been drying my blades after every use as a result of advice from a tightwad on the radio, and I get at least two weeks from each blade.  I tried the subscription blades from the slick dude with the humorous videos, but they were sub-par.  These are great!</li>
            <li> Bought both the Mach 3 and Mach 3 Turbo blades here within the last six months and was sorely disappointed.  I purchased my first package from CVS off the shelf and fell in love with the blades and razor, thought I&#x27;d never use another razor. Then I needed some more and purchased here and was extremely disappointed.  The blades were dull, some of the blue strips were already partially white, and I found that with both packs I bought. All the carts I used nicked and scraped and caused irritation.  They cost too damned much to accept that.  I don&#x27;t know if these were counterfeit, used/recycled/resold, or just decreased quality from the factory and really I don&#x27;t care: Never Gillette Again.  I purchased a Schick Hydro 3 and was careful to get it from the Schick Store on Amazon as well as my blades along with my Prime shipping and am very happy with my decision.  The Schick is better than the Mach 3 even when the Mach is a good quality and is less expensive all the time.  After shaving with Gillette for 44 years I&#x27;m a permanent Schick customer now. Gillette has forgotten it&#x27;s customer and arrogantly thinks it can charge what it wants and sell crap to prove it.  Bye Gillette, hello Schick!</li>
            <li> Great product great price</li>
            <li> These cartridges work just fine.  I  would recommend them to anyone.  I get about 30 shaves out of each one.</li>
            <li> good price, cheaper than walmart or target.. and I it works. no knicks or cuts so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kidding aside, this product is not fake or imitation. this is the real thing</li>
            <li> These do a good job at a reasonable price; at least as the price compares to razor blades nowadays; they are ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Large number of blades at a reasonable price. Works pretty well with instrument. Comes in quantity of five in three racks.</li>
            <li> Love these razor heads. I prefer them to women&#x27;s razors.</li>
            <li> as advertised. delivered on time.</li>
            <li> My husband is a big fan of the Mach 3!</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price.  Can buy these in any store at this price, they last longer the any other brand we know</li>
            <li> A fifteen pack lasts me a little longer than a year.  I&#x27;m in the military and have to be clean shaven for work, but usually grow out scruff on the weekend. The blades hold up decently.</li>
            <li> It is a great product as always.  Only reason I bought it from Amazon is I would rather have it at my doorstep than to but it in a store.  Free shipping for prime members.  Plus the extra 5% discount when you subscribe this is a plus.  i would never be short on the razor for my lifetime now!</li>
            <li> Buy these razors and then attach them to the vibrating sensitive razor. Best Shave ever! Honestly, best shave for you dollar.</li>
            <li> These have gotten so expensive in the grocery stores much less the Walmarts of the world.  This is exactly as advertised and priced so much less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many a type of razor and this is one of the best disposable types.  Each one lasts about 15 days or more and the shave is close but not too close.  Great engineering.</li>
            <li> Great Price. These were a lot cheaper than what I usually pay for them at my local stores. Great quality too. I have been using the same cartridge for almost a month now</li>
            <li> These are pretty good razors. I bought &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; as Gillette brought out newer and more expensive razors over the years, until I finally balked at the prices and tried the Dollar Shave Club. It took two months, a pint of blood, and hopefully non-permanent facial scarring to get tired of that way to save money. I thought I&#x27;d try the Mach 3 and see if I could get decent low-attention shaving without the financial or literal blood-letting, and, so far at least, these are doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you&#x27;re willing to do everything right and pay close attention for 10 minutes, you can get a great shave with the cheapest razors available. If you&#x27;re like me and want to shave fast and blind while getting a decent shave without cutting yourself, these are the best value.</li>
            <li> With the price of shaving products climbing ever higher you will like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Every year a new &#x27; wonder razor &#x27; comes out and you are suppose to throw the old&lt;br /&gt;one away. I didn&#x27;t. The MACH 3 system gives you a clean shave every time. Buying&lt;br /&gt;from Amazon makes the whole buying experience worthwhile .</li>
            <li> These are the best blades ever!!  They are a bit expensive, but well worth it.  They give the closest shave ever.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach 3 Plus blades for years and until I ordered these I had forgotten that regular Mach 3&#x27;s are just as good at a much lower cost.  Additionally, these were a good deal with an Amazon coupon available at the time.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this Chineese bootleg item!&lt;br /&gt;You are better off spending the extra money on the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I used an old REAL cartridge, with about 20 shaves on it and it still cut better than one of these new  (chineese I&#x27;m sure) cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;They don&amp;#34;t even look new. The plastic holder was all scratched and chipped.&lt;br /&gt;They cut, but please don&amp;#34;t take the chance.</li>
            <li> perform as I expect for many years now&lt;br /&gt;too bad they are costly&lt;br /&gt;but they do a good job and that&#x27;s what counts</li>
            <li> Good product, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Spend the money and get the fusion blades. These leave me stubbly after a few hours and irritate the corners of my mouth. I loathe these razors.</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected, delivered quickly, and at a reasonably good cost.</li>
            <li> good product; good service</li>
            <li> This stupid race to keep adding more blades to razors is getting old. I hate to say it, but women&#x27;s razors will keep you from cutting up your face and the best part is, women like stubble!</li>
            <li> My favorite for shaving</li>
            <li> There is a recent (meaning about a year old) article in the Forbes magazine mentioning that Gillette finally relented and revealed the life expectancy of a blade. Gillette said these blades should last around 5 weeks. There are, of course, variances. If you have large number of beard, then that could far less. More if you don&#x27;t need to shave all that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is clear is these blades are more than adequate for any shaving needs. In my opinion, having 5 or more blades is an overkill. The 3 is the sweet spot. It is not too cumbersome but it definitely has enough blades to handle any shaving tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a top-end Norelco electric shaver. To my surprise, these blades don&#x27;t shave any closer than my electric shaver. But that&#x27;s really a testament to the quality of the modern electric shaver than a criticism of the efficacy of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)3 blades per head is more than adequate for quality shaving experience. From my experience getting a head with more blades doesn&#x27;t improve the overall shaving efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;2)The authentic blades are high quality and should last 5 weeks or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1)The hair follicles tend to stick to the crevices between the blades even after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;2)Should be sprayed with some sanitizer (I just use a hand sanitizer) to periodically to eliminate bacteria..</li>
            <li> This was about the same price or a little cheaper than buying from Walmart.  Saves me time and it&#x27;s nice to have a stockpile.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for sometime. Have always liked the shave closeness. That is why I purchased a number of cartridges.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used any of them but they appear to be the same Gillette Mach3 blades you buy at WalMart, Walgreens, or Target, etc.,,,just at considerably less money because you are buying them &amp;#34;in bulk&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is always nice to have a supply of razors on hand. Both my wife and I use these razors, so we always need a lot on hand.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> These are definitely fake, OR they are the blades Gillette throws in the rejection bin as they come off the line because they didn&#x27;t pass some quality inspection.  Legit Gillette MACH3 blades feel as if nothing is running across your skin.  With these you can feel the tugging, even with a brand new one.  I&#x27;ve never had more ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Picked these up at the request of my spouse. Price is much better here than locally.</li>
            <li> Excellent product... Since Sams Club no longer carries the 30 pack,&lt;br /&gt;this 15 pack was the largest i could find. Should last me 7 months.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but too expensive!</li>
            <li> GOOD BUY !!!! Great Price -  Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> Great price and quantity that is not easily found in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> This is a fair price.  Much cheaper than in store.  I haven&#x27; tried many other razors at the store since these seem to be the best deal for the amount of blades.  They&#x27;ve always given my husband a good shave on his face and I use them on my legs, etc.  We tried the dollar shave club for a month or two and ended up coming back to Mach3.  So now we buy in bulk to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> These blades are terrific.  We really like the little moisturizing pads above the blade set.  We always use a little hair conditioner on the skin and then the Mach3, with great results.  Plus cool name, eh?  Mach3!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with these blades and much better priced than CVS or other drug stores.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat Amazon for the price, real genuine products delivered fast. The price I paid for the quantity of Mach 3 blades is better than wholesale club prices too!!</li>
            <li> Super...as requested!</li>
            <li> You must be kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razor blades couldn&#x27;t hold an edge for more than four shaves.  Are they \\&quot;knock-offs\\&quot; from China?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Too bad for me, the alternatives are not great..........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RN</li>
            <li> Saw some reviews saying these blades are bad. I order them any way and find they are no different then buying them from the drugstore. I see no difference at all in quality.</li>
            <li> These work fine for my Mach 3 handle.</li>
            <li> Same as in the store for a great price. I&#x27;ll definitely make this purchase again.</li>
            <li> cant do with out these and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the only razor cartridges my husband will use.</li>
            <li> Join Dollar Shave Club instead.</li>
            <li> Expensive. Shaves aren&#x27;t as good as my current favorite. (Harry&#x27;s) I&#x27;ve used Gillette for 30 years but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Better than newer Proglide.</li>
            <li> used them for years.  always good quality</li>
            <li> Well packaged and definately original products.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, quality and cost are pretty much at par with wholesale stores, so no cost benefit here, but the convenience factor at no cost makes the order worthy</li>
            <li> There are 15 replacement heads for the mach3 razor.  There is not much more I can say about the product.People who claim these are a less quality blade are confusing me as they are the same blades as you would get in a store, however for the ;price you get 3 cartridges (5 blades each) for about the same cost as 1 cartridge at a store.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. great price. I have razors for the next decade lol.</li>
            <li> Love the brand will buy again</li>
            <li> Better price than the stores. The Mach3 creates a smooth shave for both men and women</li>
            <li> Very happy with the price and fast shipping. They are genuine Gillette Mach 3 blades and my face feels as smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> los felicitos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;me llego&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;en poco tiempo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;los felicitos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amigo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jose coronado&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;desde&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;venezuela&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mas fino&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok ...&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> They work ok but are not a genuine Gillette razor. Clearly counterfeit. The moisture strip dissolves in one shave and the &amp;#34;stainless steel&amp;#34; will show rust if left in the shower.</li>
            <li> It works well. Leave my skin smooth. With 3 blades does the job very quick. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> i am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Im still with it, though Gillette is again moving us into its next &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; razor.  So if you like Mach3s, stock up on them before the company phases them out to squeeze another investment from you in their later model.</li>
            <li> the product is excellent and the response by the seller is quite fast and effective, I recommend one hundred percent</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried several different types of blades to shave with. I have a course beard and these blades seem to work best for me. Just wish they were not so expensive, I get 3 shaves out of each blade and some blades from the same package don&#x27;t seem as sharp as the others..</li>
            <li> This is not a comment about the supplier in this case, but the manufacturer. I had quit using the Gillette blades when they hit $35 at Wal Mart. These were a pretty good price with the discount that was offered. But because Gillette is so greedy, I now use each blade for about 3 weeks. In the &amp;#34;good old days&amp;#34; I changed blades every week. These will still give a decent shave without nicks after 3 weeks, so I can&#x27;t complain about the quality.</li>
            <li> My son uses these cartridges all of the time. I was glad to find them for him in a big pack as these. I buy them quite often. They do last a good while.</li>
            <li> Great blades. Knock offs are not worth it for my husbands heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for over 10 years and love them. Great, close shave with minimal cuts. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Gillette must have a monopoly to get away with these ridiculous prices.  It is time they get some real competition.  Product works okay but rating poor for being overpriced.</li>
            <li> me parecen perfectos para mis actividades deportivas.  good  good  good  good  good  good  good  good  good  good  good  good  good</li>
            <li> My friend Jason introduced me to these and I could shave a balloon, if it had hair, which it does not, thank goodness, and not fear breaking the balloon.  They are excellent close shaving blades and last a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> Wondered about if these were as good as the ones I bought at wal mart or some other store and reading some of the reviews made me suspicious but I have been using these for a while and no problem at all. If they are &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or such the are damned good fakes. Love em and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> This is only for the true Gillette Mach 3 blades and not any cheap knock offs (all, buy ones that say they are from Gillette and not Mach3 which is the BS one. All about common sense). Either way, I recently went back to the Mach 3 after using the Fusion Pro glides for a long time. Man, I just feel these are the best. Yes, the fusion glide much better but that does not mean a superior shave. I really find that the Fusion cause more ingrown hairs and overall issues after the fact. I believe many have found this. The Mach 3 does a great job of shaving close without digging into the skin which will cause ingrown hairs. Besides, they cost much less than the fusion pro glides.&lt;br /&gt;Again...don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that a gliding razor is a better shave. It is how your face does after that really matters.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Mach3 blades for many years.  This multi-pack offers a discounted price.  I am sure shoplifting keeps brick and mortar stores from even stocking multi-packs with this many razor cartridges.  I will be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> these are GREAT for shaving things... work perfectly on your face, legs, and even crotchal region. not so good on cats though.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth and fast transation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for many years. Always happy with them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, no doubt. Almost everyone agrees these are great products. The beef is always with the price. Don&#x27;t you love paying $3-$4 per cartridge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well established that drying the blades will HUGELY extend the life of the cartridge. Some users reports the blade can last 10x longer. There&#x27;s several ways to do that, but here&#x27;s my trick, which I believe is the easiest as well as the cheapest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;âº After shaving, blow air to remove excess water from the blades (you probably already do that.) Then--gently wipe a small alcohol &amp;#34;prep pad&amp;#34; on the blades. These are those little pads used to swab an area of skin (for example if you have to give yourself insulin injections.) Here&#x27;s a few options, but you can pick them up very cheap at any store:&lt;br /&gt;+ Alcohol Prep Pads&lt;br /&gt;+ Kendall/Covidien Alcohol Prep Pads - #6818 - 1/Box of 200&lt;br /&gt;+ Special Sale - 5 Boxes of 200 - WEBCOL Alcohol Prep Pads KND6818 KENDALL HEAL... MP-KND6818 Box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is this: the alcohol quickly dries out any moisture. These alcohol pads cost about 2 cents apiece. Let&#x27;s see, 2 cents per swab, $4 for cartridge ... Even I can do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â Let me know how it works for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> They are good. But I still prefer the 2 blades sensor excel.</li>
            <li> These razors are of not good quality and I will never be buying them again. They are really cheap. After a couple shaves you have to throw the razor out. My face was bleeding after one shave with the last razor I put on. I couldn&#x27;t believe it and was so mad that I didn&#x27;t return them after the first shave. But seemed not worth the proccess of returning it. Anyway Don&#x27;t buy these unless you plan to throw it away after 1 shave. I will be looking elsewhere to buy razors or I will only buy them in the store in bulk. I feel these were of some cheap china imatation or they just are not of the quality they used to be. Maybe I&#x27;ll try the newest mach and see if thats any better.</li>
            <li> I started using Gillette Mach3 blades many years ago.  I was an old Gillette Sensor user and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference after switching.  The best part about these blades is how the backs are completely open.  That style allows the cut hairs to easily get pushed or wash out of the back without clogging the blades.  Using the old style Sensor blades, all the cut hair gets stuck in the blades until you wash it out.  With this style, you can keep shaving and the hair just keeps getting pushed out of the back.  Much faster with this style blade.  Overall, love the performance of the blades.  I don&#x27;t have any plans of switching anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the pricing, the last time I purchased these from Amazon, it was a much better deal.  My last set of 15 blades cost just under $20.  The Subscribe &amp; Save Program used to be much better than it is now.  The discount back then was something like 15%.  Now with the small discount of 5%, it really isn&#x27;t much cheaper than your local store, especially since you can get coupons for these once in a while.  Make sure to shop around.</li>
            <li> Saved me a ton of money. Would have had to pay ton more in the store. Very happy this far with these.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Mach3 blades for about 5 years, buying them from different places. Since I have a points card with amazon I bought a 15 pack and I&#x27;m happy with the order.  I was a little worry when I read about fake blades in the reviews, but this is a second time that I purchased from Amazon and I have not noticed any poor quality so far.  I usually use a blade for 5 to 10 shaves to get the most out of it because they are expensive.  People who are hesitant, I figure make one purchase and if they are poor quality, you haven&#x27;t lost too much, if they turn out to be good, all the better.</li>
            <li> Authentic product and work well with my Mach 3</li>
            <li> great cartridges.  Real close shave, only issue is price is high</li>
            <li> I only use Gillette Mach 3 blades.  The blades stay on the head when when tapped against the sink basin.  The Mach 3 Plus does not.  Stick with the Gillette Mach 3</li>
            <li> Could not buy any less expensive product any where</li>
            <li> This is all my husband will use on his sensitive face. Consistently good.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty heavy beard and I can use them for about 2 weeks before I have to change the blade.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Great price.</li>
            <li> If you like the Mach3 razor, this is a very good buy.  I like the Mach3 razor.  These are the same blades that you can get at most any supermarket or pharmacy, but it&#x27;s far and away the best price that I&#x27;ve seen (this last thing may change by the time that you read the review).</li>
            <li> The best razors for my face. I&#x27;ve tried dollar shave club for a few months and their best razor doesn&#x27;t cut as close and smooth as the classic mach3. I get more clean shaves from 1 cartridge and I was paying the same price relatively. I&#x27;m just happier with these.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors my husband will use on his sensitive skin.  They do the best job and don&#x27;t irritate his skin.  They are a good deal on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> We love the Mach3 around here. On the expensive side but you do get what you pay for. Truly a smooth close shave for men and women alike.</li>
            <li> For those who are against buying these blades, these seem to be expired blades.  However, I have had no problem with them.  They last just as long as normal store bought blades.  From time to time I may get one less shave, but for the price?  These can&#x27;t be beat! $2 per blade instead of $3-4 per blade?  Seriously this is a good deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chinese junk? NO.  Cheap blades? NO.  Fake? NO.  These are authentic, just maybe a little dated, but like I said, no problems.  I don&#x27;t cut myself at all!  As long as you use these as normal blades, they will work just fine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used single blade, double blade and four-blade razors, and I&#x27;ve even tried the headblade, but nothing i&#x27;ve used before shaves without clogging and lasts nearly as long as the Gillette Mach 3. I&#x27;ve been using them for years, on both my face and my head. It shaves close as you like, and can handle the rough stuff with ease(I usually only shave once a week). Also I&#x27;ve never experienced skin irritation like I have with some of the other blades. The only negative I could mention is they are more expensive than I would like for something that just removes facial and head hair, but isn&#x27;t everything nowadays. You get what you pay for, and these work well.</li>
            <li> Horribly expensive. Switch to DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB.</li>
            <li> I revert back to the mach3, you take one stroke it takes 3!&lt;br /&gt;Do you really need the 5th blade on the Fusion?&lt;br /&gt;I never use that blade, it seems to not make sense to have that there or use it.&lt;br /&gt;The old Mach 3 &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;No need to change a good thing!</li>
            <li> They are cheaper to order here than anywhere else and made a good stocking stuffer gift.  My son loved his gift.  Highly recommend ordering here for cost effective reasons.</li>
            <li> Have not found a better blade to get the smoothest shave. Get many uses out of each blade which offsets the initial high price.</li>
            <li> Great replacement razor blades, clean close shave.  Even though its &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; my husband and I both have a Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> He says that his &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; (he does shave daily, but calls it a beard anyway) is tough to get a smooth shave on.  He has tried several different types of razors, even several different kinds that are similar to the Gillette Mach3, and hasn&#x27;t cared for any of those other brands.  The razor blades last longer with the Gillette Mach3 and his &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t get dull as quickly as other products did.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and were new.</li>
            <li> I ordered these from this seller (Amazon.com).  There are several reviews below that allege they are fake.  They are not.  They shave perfectly comfortably.  I bought a bunch of these off ebay recently which (though they looked very good) came in a cardboard box and were extremely dull --- every single one of them. They were obviously fake.  I suspect some of the folks who are claiming these are fake are reviewing an item bought from a different seller or are trying to draw attention away from this great price to direct traffic to their own items.  Further, if these were fake, Amazon would make it very easy to return them.  These are almost as cheap as the &amp;#34;compatibles&amp;#34; that can be bought at other sites.</li>
            <li> Even though the price is way too high for this product, it does not take away from it being one of the best products done by Gillette... With proper care, one cartridge will give one several good shaves...</li>
            <li> For the price these were the perfect gift for a friend with a heavy beard growth. These may be exactly what you need, but there is never a guarantee because everyone&#x27;s face and body are different.</li>
            <li> I have been using these razor blades for years. These blades from Amazon work fine and the price was very good.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but well worth the money for the durability and performance. My only choice, used them for years.</li>
            <li> The razor blades are very sharp and each blade will last me at least two weeks. I wish they were a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li> Purchased 15 count package, April 2013. They seem fine to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;ve encountered disposable cheapies that felt like they were designed to tear each whiskers out to the root, so I feel like I&#x27;m acquainted with bad-out-of-box razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While cheaper on amazon than the local walley mart, even though the blades may not gouge you, the prices will.</li>
            <li> Use this brand since it has one blade, moved to 2 blades, then 3, and now stop with that - 4 and 5 blades costly and make not any difference.</li>
