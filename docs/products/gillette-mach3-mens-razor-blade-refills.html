            <li>Hi two of the blades were not in good condition 9 they were damaged) .</li>
            <li>Though the packaging was good .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good results from the MAch 3 product</li>
            <li>I think they were also a good value.</li>
            <li>It also fit the product perfectly for which I had ordered it.</li>
            <li>good price</li>
            <li>These leaflets are of excellent quality, are very useful, I use every day, are durable, inexpensive and durable, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the blades and get a clean shave every morning.  </li>
            <li>These are among the best blades I&#x27;ve seen...on the first use.  </li>
            <li>got em on the auto ship program, that&#x27;s a handy feature......</li>
            <li>and I get a nice close shave for myself too.</li>
            <li>These blades are great for covering substantial shaving surface quickly.  </li>
            <li>They are by far the best</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smooth good glide.</li>
            <li>A very good product to buy, those looking for a reasonably priced fitting blades.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good price, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Having the blades delivered every month is so much better than having to find someone to unlock the case.</li>
            <li>What more is there?&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point out that you can get WAY more mileage out of these things</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced you can get more</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s just a better shave.</li>
            <li>Although these blades are marketed for men, I am a woman and love them more than the Venus \\&quot;women&#x27;s version\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>love the vibrating shaver I have.</li>
            <li>Am definitely satisfied</li>
            <li>The best price and last even longer when you soak the razor in baby oil between shaves.</li>
            <li>This will make this purchase even a better saving.</li>
            <li>which are hurting the face more than often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is better on Amazon than the corner grocery or drug store</li>
            <li>Shhh, don&#x27;t tell him. :-)</li>
            <li>I will be getting these agail when need more.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>Way better than the Mach 2, which in turn was revolutionary compared to safety blades.</li>
            <li>However, that was many years ago.</li>
            <li>Besides being better at not nicking/scratching, the Schick blades lasted about twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need three more words, oh... got them.</li>
            <li>pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make for a fantastic shave but is ok for shaving in....</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly through Prime, good packaging and was definitely worth getting.</li>
            <li>The Mach3 Turbo is definately worth the couple extra bucks for a great shave!!!</li>
            <li>Only ones he uses, great price for how many you get.</li>
            <li>Best razors hands down.</li>
            <li>When new, they give a very nice clean, smooth, and even shave on your face.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>It came like I asked and quickly!</li>
            <li>Both gave me equally good shaves, but throughout the Schick never scratched, and adjusted better to areas that are not flat (around the chin, and around the lips).</li>
            <li>I have used both, and there is a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>The blades dont have a lubricant strip as the genuine blades have.</li>
            <li>they fit the razor, saw my face hair, what else can I say......</li>
            <li>these blades work in my Mach3 great, the only razor that works for me.</li>
            <li>Now when you&#x27;re up in the morning trying to get ready for work, you don&#x27;t have that kind of time to spare cleaning a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Problem</li>
            <li>If you like the Venus handle though these blades will clip right on, I love it.</li>
            <li>The blade did not snap on my handle securely and falls out when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;3) Blades are already worn out and were full of dust when package opened.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, nice to have, no trip to the expensive drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the lowest price I found for original Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>I had to spend 10 minutes shaking the razor in both standing and running water to clean it out.  </li>
            <li>but I have always just used water to clean them.</li>
            <li>When I bought my first Mach 3, it worked great, and the initial blade lasted for about three weeks.  </li>
            <li>love this is fantastic shave why order more of the same blades, from John Bradford</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient to buy online and get a good price at the same time.</li>
            <li>The actual Gilette Mach3 blades are good for nearly a full week of shaving.  </li>
            <li>but they last longer and work better (very smooth shave) than any blade I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Super convenient</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed they rust quickly after opening, and issue I never had with store bought brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon need to check before selling these products to its loyal customers.</li>
            <li>The quality of the blades are very good, subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had.</li>
            <li>I decided to go with the larger amount because the reviews seemed to be better and more consistent.</li>
            <li>What can you say other than these blades give a good shave.</li>
            <li>well, with prime, we get the value of ordering with out having to hunt em down in the store, its a  good value</li>
            <li>I tried about half a dozen, and found out that the Nivea gel works noticeably better than any other brand (smoother shave, dries less the skin, and has a pleasant and mild scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye, Gillette!a pleasant and mild scent).  </li>
            <li>The naming of that product is unfortunate - &#x27;Turbo&#x27; sounds like some marketing affectation, when in fact it honestly provides you with a vastly superior shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the rather obscene price point of the Turbo, I&#x27;d suggest you skip the &#x27;Mach III&#x27; and move up.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these blades on 8/3/2014 and they were real!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the service, Gillette!</li>
            <li>When you buy, check the seller&#x27;s rating first.</li>
            <li>The Mach III is the first time I felt like I could shave rather absent-mindedly</li>
            <li>(it is first thing in the morning, after all) and not endanger my face.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I only posted this because these cartridges popped up as the top recommendation on my home page.  </li>
            <li>They work better than using sandpaper, or plucking each hair out individually.</li>
            <li>They were delivered, look , and work exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Mach3 has been my favorite ever since they first come around, as it was the only razor to never cut or nick my face...</li>
            <li>These are wearing out fast!</li>
            <li>is, if you don&#x27;t clean it, the quality of your shave significantly decreases trying to use it the next time.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &amp;quot;indicator strip&amp;quot; sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The store bought razors were far better, far sharper.</li>
            <li>The listing here is for real Mach3 blades, which is exactly what I received and they worked great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that, it&#x27;s a MAJOR pain to clean out the whiskers that get caught between the triple blades.  </li>
            <li>have been a fan of Mach3 for years and temporarily switched to a newer razor, only to find that in ten years, there is nothing as gentle and as effective as my trusty Mach3.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then Gillette wants you to know.  </li>
            <li>These blades are the real deal.</li>
            <li>So, I bought these refills because they are so much cheaper here than in stores.</li>
            <li>If they were a dollar per blade I could understand them dulling so fast.</li>
            <li>The packaging was not the same as original blades.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>What more can I say other than that?</li>
            <li>I find it does a better job than any other razor.</li>
            <li>still I love it compare to any other product.</li>
            <li>Normally I believe that Amazon sells the original product direct from the manufacturer on the reasonable costs which benefits the customer but these blades are far from the original.after 1 Month of use</li>
            <li>A normal new blade would glide over my face, easily removing any facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I love them, but the blades dull so quickly and are only good for a few shaves before having to replace the cartridge.</li>
            <li>That may be the problem, but still for the price I would expect them to not dull so fast.</li>
            <li>I prefer these particular razors over all others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>The razors purchased here are not durable, they are very brittle and they only have a useful life of about 2 shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li>This is about the third time That I have ordered this product &amp; reviewed it needless to say I  am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Mach3 Turbo Razor.  </li>
            <li>The Mach III was a great piece of innovation from Gillette - there are quite a few upgrades here from the last of its double blade releases, the Sensor Excel.  </li>
            <li>they Have worked very well for me so far.</li>
            <li>Sometime the blades will give me a smooth shave, and other times, I get cuts all over.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done better than other razors I have tried since the blades are smaller and get in harder to reach places and even though it has fewer blades than the quatro it still had better longer lasting results.</li>
            <li>Works better dry than wet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mach 3 for 10 year, this one is not the same quality is the one I used before, it feels sharp only in the very beginning, then it&#x27;s easy to tell the difference.</li>
            <li>There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy direct from a Target or a Wal-Mart</li>
            <li>I can clearly see the difference in the blade quality which I used to use from the direct re-sealers.</li>
            <li>Men pick their favorite razor and blade and stick with it - at least that is my experience.</li>
            <li>Not my case: I got regular Gillette packages, so my review applies to the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They always come, never fail, and are just what I expected.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t let bad experiences with sellers lead you away from a great product.</li>
            <li>came on time , pretty sharp , i used it multiple times,,</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought directly from Amazon, but these razors are almost dull fresh out of the package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would buy again as face is tough enough that single blade shavers arent effective anymore.</li>
            <li>They were slightly more expensive than most Web retailers, but they last at least three times as long...</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy from the store (safeway, cvs, etc..) for $3/unit, you pay few cents extra, but you get the real high quality mac 3, as it should be.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon need to check before selling these products to its loyal customers.</li>
            <li> The quality of the blades are very good, subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with the larger amount because the reviews seemed to be better and more consistent.</li>
            <li> What can you say other than these blades give a good shave.</li>
            <li> well, with prime, we get the value of ordering with out having to hunt em down in the store, its a  good value</li>
            <li> I tried about half a dozen, and found out that the Nivea gel works noticeably better than any other brand (smoother shave, dries less the skin, and has a pleasant and mild scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye, Gillette!a pleasant and mild scent).  </li>
            <li> The naming of that product is unfortunate - &#x27;Turbo&#x27; sounds like some marketing affectation, when in fact it honestly provides you with a vastly superior shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the rather obscene price point of the Turbo, I&#x27;d suggest you skip the &#x27;Mach III&#x27; and move up.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these blades on 8/3/2014 and they were real!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the service, Gillette!</li>
            <li> When you buy, check the seller&#x27;s rating first.</li>
            <li> The Mach III is the first time I felt like I could shave rather absent-mindedly</li>
            <li> (it is first thing in the morning, after all) and not endanger my face.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I only posted this because these cartridges popped up as the top recommendation on my home page.  </li>
            <li> They work better than using sandpaper, or plucking each hair out individually.</li>
            <li> They were delivered, look , and work exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mach3 has been my favorite ever since they first come around, as it was the only razor to never cut or nick my face...</li>
            <li> These are wearing out fast!</li>
            <li> is, if you don&#x27;t clean it, the quality of your shave significantly decreases trying to use it the next time.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &amp;quot;indicator strip&amp;quot; sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The store bought razors were far better, far sharper.</li>
            <li> The listing here is for real Mach3 blades, which is exactly what I received and they worked great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that, it&#x27;s a MAJOR pain to clean out the whiskers that get caught between the triple blades.  </li>
            <li> have been a fan of Mach3 for years and temporarily switched to a newer razor, only to find that in ten years, there is nothing as gentle and as effective as my trusty Mach3.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then Gillette wants you to know.  </li>
            <li> These blades are the real deal.</li>
            <li> So, I bought these refills because they are so much cheaper here than in stores.</li>
            <li> If they were a dollar per blade I could understand them dulling so fast.</li>
            <li> The packaging was not the same as original blades.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> What more can I say other than that?</li>
            <li> I find it does a better job than any other razor.</li>
            <li> still I love it compare to any other product.</li>
            <li> Normally I believe that Amazon sells the original product direct from the manufacturer on the reasonable costs which benefits the customer but these blades are far from the original.after 1 Month of use</li>
            <li> A normal new blade would glide over my face, easily removing any facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I love them, but the blades dull so quickly and are only good for a few shaves before having to replace the cartridge.</li>
            <li> That may be the problem, but still for the price I would expect them to not dull so fast.</li>
            <li> I prefer these particular razors over all others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> The razors purchased here are not durable, they are very brittle and they only have a useful life of about 2 shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li> This is about the third time That I have ordered this product &amp; reviewed it needless to say I  am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Mach3 Turbo Razor.  </li>
            <li> The Mach III was a great piece of innovation from Gillette - there are quite a few upgrades here from the last of its double blade releases, the Sensor Excel.  </li>
            <li> they Have worked very well for me so far.</li>
            <li> Sometime the blades will give me a smooth shave, and other times, I get cuts all over.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done better than other razors I have tried since the blades are smaller and get in harder to reach places and even though it has fewer blades than the quatro it still had better longer lasting results.</li>
            <li> Works better dry than wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mach 3 for 10 year, this one is not the same quality is the one I used before, it feels sharp only in the very beginning, then it&#x27;s easy to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy direct from a Target or a Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> I can clearly see the difference in the blade quality which I used to use from the direct re-sealers.</li>
            <li> Men pick their favorite razor and blade and stick with it - at least that is my experience.</li>
            <li> Not my case: I got regular Gillette packages, so my review applies to the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They always come, never fail, and are just what I expected.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t let bad experiences with sellers lead you away from a great product.</li>
            <li> came on time , pretty sharp , i used it multiple times,,</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought directly from Amazon, but these razors are almost dull fresh out of the package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would buy again as face is tough enough that single blade shavers arent effective anymore.</li>
            <li> They were slightly more expensive than most Web retailers, but they last at least three times as long...</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy from the store (safeway, cvs, etc..) for $3/unit, you pay few cents extra, but you get the real high quality mac 3, as it should be.</li>
            <li> These blades purchased from Amazon are worse than a 2 month old used blade; right out of the package they scrape across my skin and pull the facial hair.  </li>
            <li> This is not surprising if you look at the blade mounts: hold the ends and notice how the Schick can flex in the middle, allowing it to follow curvy areas easily, which the Gillette has a center support that prevents that.</li>
            <li> These are the ginuine Gillette cartridges, not counter fit as some of the other reviews have complained about.</li>
            <li> I have a strange suspicion that these blades are not of the same quality as the ones from your local stores.</li>
            <li> I only shave twice a week, and these razors didn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li> As soon as I used the blades for the first time, I knew what the negative person was talking about.</li>
            <li> And talk about long lasting-</li>
            <li> They last long and don&#x27;t nick.</li>
            <li> , even after cleaning, it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.  </li>
            <li> These blades are not as sharp and do not last as long as the ones I get from my local store.</li>
            <li> and they won&#x27;t dull so fast,</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re still unsure if you want to purchase online, I found a site that shows you how to tell if your blades are genuine or fake.</li>
            <li> On average, I can only shave 2-3 times with one of the blades before the blue indicator stripe goes white.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered through Amazon because I prefer to stand in long lines after work.  </li>
            <li> I am a female but prefer these blades since it is less likely to leave razor burn, nicks, or irritation.</li>
            <li> It is a little broad for close trimming work.  </li>
            <li> Is it possible that these razors are imitation knock offs?  </li>
            <li> The blue indicator stripe fades after a few shaves, but I generally reuse mine for two or three months before I need to replace it (shaving once every other day).  </li>
            <li> - I left quite a few of these on med. cabinet (which is slightly damp) and returned after 3 months back.</li>
            <li> Product I have used before and performed as expected.</li>
            <li> careful also not to leave the blade on the sink afterward...</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, other reviewers who complained about scratching, or short blade life, thought they might have received counterfeit Gillette cartridges (they were on some refill program and the packaging was different).</li>
            <li> No issues with the quality as posted in other reviews.</li>
            <li> These razors are causing me to nick myself every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garbage blades.  </li>
            <li> they seem quite dull and don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than you&#x27;d buy at a retail store (which are outrageously expensive).</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair though.</li>
            <li> I bought these and later at one point realized something was wrong, they were not very sharp.</li>
            <li> they are less flexible and</li>
            <li> However, they are expensive for such a small blade and they dull fairly fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I had bought quite a few cartridges, and the Mach 3 are inferior but still useable, I used the rest.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that I was going to get some fake steel Chinese knock offs, but they were real Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li> I typically can get at least 4+ shaves a blade.  </li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s anything wrong, I&#x27;ll update my review later.</li>
            <li> Either these blades are the ones that didn&#x27;t pass Q/A or they are made from a cheaper metal; I&#x27;m not sure, but I&#x27;m writing Gillette to find out.</li>
            <li> This re-confirmed my past perceptions (from years of use), as well as the test</li>
            <li> I bought refills, and each blade was dull within a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However they dull faster than I would expect for the price they cost.</li>
            <li> I read a negative review complaining about the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li> Or at least lower the price on them.</li>
            <li> My husband has a thick and course beard and he demands this blade.</li>
            <li> These are so bad, I can barely get one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they were less expensive</li>
            <li> Bad choice: As with others, the packaging was faded, and although the blades look the same, they are NOT.  </li>
            <li> Very hard on the face runs only for 1-2 weeks edges bad</li>
            <li> Not happy with the experience.</li>
            <li> : I shave my armpits every time I shower- almost everyday, and it is sick</li>
            <li> They help you identify fake blades.</li>
            <li> difficult to find them for cheaper.</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> Mach3 may be on the expensive side</li>
            <li> blades are too expensive.</li>
            <li> or I get cuts and a bad shave.  </li>
            <li> A very bad experience..</li>

    <ol>
            <li> the ONLY razor my husband (&lt;br /&gt;AND I) will ever use!</li>
            <li> I ordered these blades on 8/3/2014 and they were real! I was afraid that I was going to get some fake steel Chinese knock offs, but they were real Mach 3 blades. I paid $15.79. It looks like they went up in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still unsure if you want to purchase online, I found a site that shows you how to tell if your blades are genuine or fake. I recommend that you Google thecounterfeitreport Mach 3 blades. They help you identify fake blades.</li>
            <li> Having the blades delivered every month is so much better than having to find someone to unlock the case. Thanks for the service, Gillette!</li>
            <li> These blades are great for covering substantial shaving surface quickly.  It is a little broad for close trimming work.  I use them to shave my head.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Mach3 Turbo Razor.  I have used both, and there is a huge difference.  The Mach3 Turbo is definately worth the couple extra bucks for a great shave!!!</li>
            <li> I have used the standard Mach 3 blades since they came out (several years), and tried to save money by purchasing these. Bad choice: As with others, the packaging was faded, and although the blades look the same, they are NOT.  A normal new blade would glide over my face, easily removing any facial hair.  These blades purchased from Amazon are worse than a 2 month old used blade; right out of the package they scrape across my skin and pull the facial hair.  I suggest avoiding these at all cost!</li>
            <li> I saw that some of the reviews were complaining that their blades were counterfeit, but that seems to be a problem with the seller, not the product itself. The listing here is for real Mach3 blades, which is exactly what I received and they worked great.&lt;br /&gt;I have been a fan of Mach3 for years and temporarily switched to a newer razor, only to find that in ten years, there is nothing as gentle and as effective as my trusty Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;If you get counterfeit blades, notify Amazon and complain to the seller. When you buy, check the seller&#x27;s rating first. But don&#x27;t let bad experiences with sellers lead you away from a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about a month ago. These blades are counterfeit.They are counterfiet because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The packaging was not the same as original blades.&lt;br /&gt;2) The blade did not snap on my handle securely and falls out when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;3) Blades are already worn out and were full of dust when package opened.&lt;br /&gt;4) The blades dont have a lubricant strip as the genuine blades have. They have a rubber strip to imitate the lubricant strip.&lt;br /&gt;5) Blades are misaligned causing cuts on my face.</li>
            <li> excellent product recommend 100%</li>
            <li> got em on the auto ship program, that&#x27;s a handy feature......they fit the razor, saw my face hair, what else can I say......</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the blades and get a clean shave every morning.  I use them for about 2 weeks each, then it&#x27;s time to change or I get cuts and a bad shave.  Wish I could go 2 months like one of the reviewers here - that would save me a lot of money!  I have steel wool for a beard, so 2 weeks is the max.  Fast shipping, good price, very satisfied.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Was delivered as advertised</li>
            <li> Mach 3 Cartridges give a wonderful shave !!!</li>
            <li> It looks great, but I haven&#x27;t got a chance to use them. If there&#x27;s anything wrong, I&#x27;ll update my review later.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  No razor burn, closest shave you can get, never get cut.  What more is there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point out that you can get WAY more mileage out of these things then Gillette wants you to know.  The blue indicator stripe fades after a few shaves, but I generally reuse mine for two or three months before I need to replace it (shaving once every other day).  I NEVER get cut, and I NEVER get razor burn.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these razors!! Only ones he uses, great price for how many you get. Deff a great find here,</li>
            <li> I prefer these particular razors over all others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> The Mach III was a great piece of innovation from Gillette - there are quite a few upgrades here from the last of its double blade releases, the Sensor Excel.  The Mach III is the first time I felt like I could shave rather absent-mindedly (it is first thing in the morning, after all) and not endanger my face.&lt;br /&gt;The issue is that the Mach III has been surpassed by the so-called &#x27;Mach III Turbo&#x27; product release from Gillette.  The naming of that product is unfortunate - &#x27;Turbo&#x27; sounds like some marketing affectation, when in fact it honestly provides you with a vastly superior shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the rather obscene price point of the Turbo, I&#x27;d suggest you skip the &#x27;Mach III&#x27; and move up.  I&#x27;m convinced you can get more shaves out of it and make your money back.  Plus, it&#x27;s just a better shave.</li>
            <li> love this is fantastic shave why order more of the same blades, from John Bradford</li>
            <li> these blades work in my Mach3 great, the only razor that works for me.That&#x27;s all I can say.Don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> pretty good deal. difficult to find them for cheaper.</li>
            <li> When I bought my first Mach 3, it worked great, and the initial blade lasted for about three weeks.  The refills that came with it lasted similarly long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought refills, and each blade was dull within a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two years ago, I found a place on the Web that sold cryonically-treated razor cartridges (you can Google for \\&quot;cryogenically tempered Mach 3 razor\\&quot;).  They were slightly more expensive than most Web retailers, but they last at least three times as long... I&#x27;m just now running out of them (I think I bought 32, and gave eight to my dad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I only posted this because these cartridges popped up as the top recommendation on my home page.  Weird.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and Happy that Amazon is doing this online.  Super convenient</li>
            <li> These blades are the real deal. Much cheaper than you&#x27;d buy at a retail store (which are outrageously expensive). No issues with the quality as posted in other reviews. These are not knockoffs. Happy shavin! Buy these.</li>
            <li> Product I have used before and performed as expected. Works better dry than wet. Would buy again as face is tough enough that single blade shavers arent effective anymore.</li>
            <li> Although these blades are marketed for men, I am a woman and love them more than the Venus \\&quot;women&#x27;s version\\&quot;. If you like the Venus handle though these blades will clip right on, I love it. And talk about long lasting- I kid you not: I shave my armpits every time I shower- almost everyday, and it is sick but I have used the same blade for weeks and weeks! I don&#x27;t recommend that, but you&#x27;ve gotta do what you&#x27;ve gotta do. Mach3 may be on the expensive side but they last longer and work better (very smooth shave) than any blade I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, nice to have, no trip to the expensive drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the vibrating shaver I have.</li>
            <li> This is a stable and excellent product. The quality of the blades are very good, subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had. There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation. A very good product to buy, those looking for a reasonably priced fitting blades. At Amazon - the price is excellent for this product. Just update - I left quite a few of these on med. cabinet (which is slightly damp) and returned after 3 months back. NO RUSTS.</li>
            <li> Same product but cheaper than what you might find in the store.  Doesn&#x27;t make for a fantastic shave but is ok for shaving in....uhhh...sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mach 3 for 10 year, this one is not the same quality is the one I used before, it feels sharp only in the very beginning, then it&#x27;s easy to tell the difference. Save your money and buy from the store (safeway, cvs, etc..) for $3/unit, you pay few cents extra, but you get the real high quality mac 3, as it should be.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach3 cartridges for 10 years plus.  I typically can get at least 4+ shaves a blade.  These are so bad, I can barely get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought directly from Amazon, but these razors are almost dull fresh out of the package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that Amazon blends merchandise from geniuine/third party vendors in the warehouse if the UPC code matches.  Do yourself a favor and buy direct from a Target or a Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> Hi two of the blades were not in good condition 9 they were damaged) . Though the packaging was good . But i just saw that out of the 8 cartridges two the cartridges are damaged. Not happy with the experience.</li>
            <li> These are among the best blades I&#x27;ve seen...on the first use.  When new, they give a very nice clean, smooth, and even shave on your face.&lt;br /&gt;After that, it&#x27;s a MAJOR pain to clean out the whiskers that get caught between the triple blades.  I had to spend 10 minutes shaking the razor in both standing and running water to clean it out.  Now when you&#x27;re up in the morning trying to get ready for work, you don&#x27;t have that kind of time to spare cleaning a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, if you don&#x27;t clean it, the quality of your shave significantly decreases trying to use it the next time.&lt;br /&gt;Also, even after cleaning, it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.  On average, I can only shave 2-3 times with one of the blades before the blue indicator stripe goes white.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful also not to leave the blade on the sink afterward...store it someplace dark, because bright light seems to fade the blue &amp;quot;indicator strip&amp;quot; sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Turbo...it seems to be longer lasting, getting an extra shave or two out of it, although the cleaning remains a problem.</li>
            <li> These blades are great. I have been using them for years. I do get quite a bit of reuse out of them before i have to switch The blades. they Have worked very well for me so far. I will continue to use this product for quite some time.</li>
            <li> This was the lowest price I found for original Gillette razors. Shipped quickly through Prime, good packaging and was definitely worth getting. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hit or miss when I buy these. Sometime the blades will give me a smooth shave, and other times, I get cuts all over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good results from the MAch 3 product so I have no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time, great price and I will buy and have again.</li>
            <li> Husband likes these as they do the job well.</li>
            <li> What can you say other than these blades give a good shave. I think they were also a good value.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The razors I bought here are NOT the actual Gilette Mach3 razors that you buy in the store.  The razors purchased here are not durable, they are very brittle and they only have a useful life of about 2 shaves per blade.  The actual Gilette Mach3 blades are good for nearly a full week of shaving.  These razors are causing me to nick myself every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garbage blades.  Don&#x27;t buy em.</li>
            <li> I like these. I use them for my arm pits and legs. They have enough rows and I have not had any problems with them.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette for years and have no complaints.  I ordered through Amazon because I prefer to stand in long lines after work.  It is so convenient to just get home and open the mail.</li>
            <li> It came like I asked and quickly! It also fit the product perfectly for which I had ordered it. Am definitely satisfied</li>
            <li> Just like store bought blades but saves me shopping time.&lt;br /&gt;All blades are too expensive.</li>
            <li> Is it possible that these razors are imitation knock offs?  they seem quite dull and don&#x27;t last.  I only shave twice a week, and these razors didn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li> not what i thought i was buying.  I have no use for them until i buy the mach three razor</li>
            <li> My face is now baby bottom smooooooth. What more can I say other than that? They work better than using sandpaper, or plucking each hair out individually.</li>
            <li> I order these blades on Subscribe and Save every 3 months.  They always come, never fail, and are just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I read a negative review complaining about the quality of the blades. This review was for the same product, just the smaller amount of cartridges. I decided to go with the larger amount because the reviews seemed to be better and more consistent. As soon as I used the blades for the first time, I knew what the negative person was talking about. I have been buying Gillette Mach 3 blades for years from my local grocery store. These blades are not as sharp and do not last as long as the ones I get from my local store. I have a strange suspicion that these blades are not of the same quality as the ones from your local stores. Either these blades are the ones that didn&#x27;t pass Q/A or they are made from a cheaper metal; I&#x27;m not sure, but I&#x27;m writing Gillette to find out.</li>
            <li> Great razors, Delivered as a subscription, so I dont&#x27; forget? Awesome idea</li>
            <li> came on time , pretty sharp , i used it multiple times,, good price</li>
            <li> I am female and I use the Gillette Mach 3 razor. I find it does a better job than any other razor. So, I bought these refills because they are so much cheaper here than in stores. I definitely recommend these, to males or females. Remember, these are just the refills. You&#x27;ll have to buy the razor if you don&#x27;t have one already.</li>
            <li> Its the only blades I&#x27;ve tried that don&#x27;t make me itch after I shave but I wsh they were less expensive</li>
            <li> This is about the third time That I have ordered this product &amp; reviewed it needless to say I  am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great price for great product...&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The best price and last even longer when you soak the razor in baby oil between shaves. This will make this purchase even a better saving.</li>
            <li> These razors do not last long before you see that the lubrication strip is almost bare.  The blades also don&#x27;t give a close shave.  These could be counterfeit blades or else Gillette decided to pawn off their irregulars.  My advice to anyone is to buy these in a brick and mortar store or find another online site to order them from.  I have decided to switch to Dorco and bought  separate razors with plenty of blades for about the same price as this.</li>
            <li> perfect. They were delivered, look , and work exactly as described.</li>
            <li> No issues getting a close shave with the blades but I&#x27;ve noticed they rust quickly after opening, and issue I never had with store bought brands.</li>
            <li> Normally I believe that Amazon sells the original product direct from the manufacturer on the reasonable costs which benefits the customer but these blades are far from the original.after 1 Month of use I can clearly see the difference in the blade quality which I used to use from the direct re-sealers.Very hard on the face runs only for 1-2 weeks edges bad which are hurting the face more than often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon need to check before selling these products to its loyal customers. A very bad experience..</li>
            <li> well, with prime, we get the value of ordering with out having to hunt em down in the store, its a  good value</li>
            <li> I bought these and later at one point realized something was wrong, they were not very sharp. I bought the same razors from Walgreens locally and compared the two. The store bought razors were far better, far sharper.</li>
            <li> Best razors hands down. I am a female but prefer these blades since it is less likely to leave razor burn, nicks, or irritation. It gets the job done better than other razors I have tried since the blades are smaller and get in harder to reach places and even though it has fewer blades than the quatro it still had better longer lasting results.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;I can use one every month, cant ask for anything more, Gillette is the best</li>
            <li> Men pick their favorite razor and blade and stick with it - at least that is my experience. The price is better on Amazon than the corner grocery or drug store so I buy them here. My husband has a thick and course beard and he demands this blade. Once in awhile I sneak a leg shave with his razor and I get a nice close shave for myself too. Shhh, don&#x27;t tell him. :-)</li>
            <li> Mach3 has been my favorite ever since they first come around, as it was the only razor to never cut or nick my face... I love them, but the blades dull so quickly and are only good for a few shaves before having to replace the cartridge.</li>
            <li> These are the ginuine Gillette cartridges, not counter fit as some of the other reviews have complained about. I will be getting these agail when need more.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! It&#x27;s convenient to buy online and get a good price at the same time. Totally recommend</li>
            <li> Great blades with a descent price</li>
            <li> Very good quality, not a counterfeit parts!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades. They are by far the best and they work great. However they dull faster than I would expect for the price they cost. If they were a dollar per blade I could understand them dulling so fast. However, they are expensive for such a small blade and they dull fairly fast. I&#x27;ve heard you can put them in baby oil and they won&#x27;t dull so fast, but I have always just used water to clean them. That may be the problem, but still for the price I would expect them to not dull so fast. Or at least lower the price on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product since 6-7 yrs. still I love it compare to any other product. I will recommend this to others for use</li>
            <li> Edit on 1/11/16:&lt;br /&gt;In 2013 the Gillette 3-blade cartridges compared unfavourably against the 3-blade Schick. However, I just reordered Schick&#x27;s, and even though their packaging and product name hasn&#x27;t changed, the design has: they are less flexible and scratch... I returned them, and will look again at alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posted in 2013 &#x27;13:&lt;br /&gt;When the Mach 3 came out, it was great. Way better than the Mach 2, which in turn was revolutionary compared to safety blades. However, that was many years ago. Comparing it with a 3-blade Schick, the Mach 3 is inferior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Gillette products for decades, but decided to run a test. I am Caucasian, my beard is of medium thickness, and I shave daily in the shower. I opened a Gillete and a Schick, and alternated until the Gillette became unuseable. Both gave me equally good shaves, but throughout the Schick never scratched, and adjusted better to areas that are not flat (around the chin, and around the lips). This is not surprising if you look at the blade mounts: hold the ends and notice how the Schick can flex in the middle, allowing it to follow curvy areas easily, which the Gillette has a center support that prevents that. Besides being better at not nicking/scratching, the Schick blades lasted about twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had bought quite a few cartridges, and the Mach 3 are inferior but still useable, I used the rest. This re-confirmed my past perceptions (from years of use), as well as the test result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, other reviewers who complained about scratching, or short blade life, thought they might have received counterfeit Gillette cartridges (they were on some refill program and the packaging was different). Not my case: I got regular Gillette packages, so my review applies to the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I switched to Schick razors, I decided to also test the shaving gels. I tried about half a dozen, and found out that the Nivea gel works noticeably better than any other brand (smoother shave, dries less the skin, and has a pleasant and mild scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye, Gillette!a pleasant and mild scent).  Goodbye, Gillette!</li>
            <li> These are wearing out fast! maybe 10 uses and they are showing their wear. I have thick facial hair though. I only use them for my face.</li>
            <li> These leaflets are of excellent quality, are very useful, I use every day, are durable, inexpensive and durable, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use these, not my husband. They last long and don&#x27;t nick. It&#x27;s a smooth good glide. I need three more words, oh... got them.</li>
