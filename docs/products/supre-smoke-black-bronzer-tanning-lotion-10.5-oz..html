            <li>it has a great smell and it tanned really good</li>
            <li>I still love smoke best</li>
            <li>I just make sure I rub it in real good.</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>if u rub the lotion in good &amp; rub it in a circular motion when applying.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells so good, like oranges when your applying it...</li>
            <li>It smells good, but does have a bronzer smell after tanning.</li>
            <li>After I tried it, I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good bronzer that does not tingle.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good level 2 or level 3 bronzer, I recommend Coco Tini (level 2) and</li>
            <li>Smells good also.  </li>
            <li>Good color.</li>
            <li>It work good in booth or outdoor tanning.</li>
            <li>Good for your skins moisture</li>
            <li>good in the bottle</li>
            <li>so I am in a hurry...not good..</li>
            <li>and I know my sister used it and loved it too.</li>
            <li>Did not give good color at all</li>
            <li>It works good too</li>
            <li>smells good too, not too smelly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really good, has a lot of bronzes in it.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and don&#x27;t even have streaking issues.</li>
            <li>Really good</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on this lotion, I was convinced to buy it because I am fair skin and do not tan immediately</li>
            <li>so I need a good bronzer.</li>
            <li>It works great, doesn&#x27;t smell all girly, has a nice amount of bronzer to it, and its a good size bottle.</li>
            <li>I tan very easy and in just one session I get great color.</li>
            <li>great smell and again beautiful color that shows up quickly.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would be as great as it was reviewed to be.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great.</li>
            <li>is great, read the reviews though make sure you wash your hands with something before tanning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an amazing tanning lotion smells good.</li>
            <li>What a great product for an even greater price.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and the shipping was very timely!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I feel I can use the tanning spray and get better results and cheaper!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this lotion!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent bronzer, but prepare yourself - you are going to smell real funky after using this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>Make sure you wipe your hands!</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you evenly apply the lotion and WASH your hands after you apply it or it will stain!</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tingle his skin, smells nice &amp; helps the indoor tan deepen.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top-notch tan!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it and highly encourage others to try it.</li>
            <li>It works perfect of the high pressure beds that I tan in during the summer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell so wonderful after I lay in the super hot tanning bed, but do any lotions smell wonderful after you&#x27;ve laid in an extremely hot bed?</li>
            <li>Love love this lotion!</li>
            <li>A superb seller w/ easy ordering and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>While I felt wonderfully moisturized while using this for tanning, I didn&#x27;t see any of the great results that other reviewers are posting.  </li>
            <li>Great for first time tanners!</li>
            <li>AT THE TIME, IF YOU DON&#x27;T RUB IT IN VERY GOOD, YOU WILL HAVE STREAKS ALL OVER YOU, WIPE HAND VERY</li>

            <li>I love this lotion, its smell and the color I have.</li>
            <li>Okay, I have to say that I question the quality of the product that I got.  </li>
            <li>I found it worked even better when I tanned with an accelerator for three days</li>
            <li>Most of my lotions smell like burnt flesh but this one just smells like a coconut breeze.</li>
            <li>One tip, make sure you wipe off hands with baby wipes after applying this.</li>
            <li>eh : )</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used before many times.  </li>
            <li>WELL AFTER USING, DOES IMPROVE YOUR TAN 100 PERCENT AND DARKER FAST, GREAT PRODUCT, BUT</li>
            <li>Lala love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell (kinda fruity)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see after more applications how I like it..</li>
            <li>I researched the top indoor tanning</li>
            <li>if you use this product be sure to wash your hands immediately afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Seller, just make sure your caps are tightened well before packaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>

            <li>you will love it.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>better lotions out there?</li>
            <li>Is there a better value then this one?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not gonna have to tan as much to get the color I want!!!!  </li>
            <li>when it comes to scents, I think this lotion smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Well, my tan was looking pretty good</li>
            <li>It is a great bronzer, you really need to make sure you smooth on every where..</li>
            <li>It is worth the money!!</li>
            <li>It applies easily, does not suffer from the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; many tanning lotions have</li>
            <li>It gives you a very natural sun kissed glow and has a very nice tropical scent, not that yucky chemical smell that some bronzers have.  </li>
            <li>Overall this lotion is incredible &amp; it does what it&#x27;s suppose to....</li>
            <li>Worked great as far as tanning goes</li>
            <li>Gives good color but REALLY stains your skin.</li>
            <li>tan!&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable right after 1st use a darker shade !!</li>
            <li>Great Deal and Super Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>Other than that, great!!</li>
            <li>it got here very quickly</li>
            <li>and it tanned me VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the lotion it went on easy</li>
            <li>had my  product very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I received this lotion very quickly.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I had them special order it after they stopped carrying it in-store.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>It smells great and gives a nice dark tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Package came quick!</li>
            <li>I always order Smoke when I need a quick tan!</li>
            <li>Really love how quickly it tans you.</li>
            <li>light medium tan.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Really happy with the Tanning Lotion, but when I was telling a friend about the product we noticed that Amazon had the same item at a lower cost.</li>
            <li>Deep tan, great color.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall is you should be somewhat an experienced tanner to use this stuff.</li>
            <li>Leaves great color and lasting.</li>
            <li>Product smells wonderful, but after wards gives a hint of tanning skin ( not to harsh) is tolerable.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this tanning</li>
            <li>I got great results and only used a gold bed.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>Warning though, even though I am experienced and I know how to rub lotion in and pay attention to key areas that say &amp;#34;I tan&amp;#34;, this lotion turns my hands orange.</li>
            <li>Although, it is a good bronzer as far as the tanning.</li>
            <li>she loved the product and it saved me some money the tanning salon wanted much more for the same product</li>
            <li>However, since this lotion is a bronzer it will stain your hands orange after you apply it so be sure to wipe your hands right after you apply.</li>
            <li>girlfriend manages a huge tanning salon and has all kinds of free samples to use, I tan maybe 4 times a month and always try different lotions, I tried this about 6 months ago and decided I liked it the most.</li>
            <li>She is excited..</li>
            <li>I have been buying this stuff for many years, it&#x27;s the only bronzer that I have come across that actually works great!</li>
            <li>worth the 20 bucks!</li>
            <li>It has amazing bronzing action for a quick and easy difference.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for fast color,  but be careful when apply and wash hands after applying, it stains.</li>
            <li>gotta be the best lotion I have ever used, lasts an extremely long time after just one use, even better if you are a regular tanner</li>
            <li>Great lotion and gets you dark quick!</li>
            <li>it gets an amazing natural colour,</li>
            <li>I actually think this smells good</li>
            <li>Just a side note: really make sure to spread evenly and wash hands thoroughly after using.</li>
            <li>, MAKE SURE YOU DON&#x27;T PUT TO MUCH</li>
            <li>but make sure you wipe your hands very well</li>
            <li>Be sure and wash your hands after tanning and rub in very well around wrist and fingers when you are applying it to body.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and saw results after only 4 times tanning.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin, very silky NOT sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different lotions and this one is by FAR my favorite!!</li>
            <li>Is super good for the girl on the go who can only get to the salon once a week</li>
            <li>I have skin that tans pretty easily, but this helped me keep my tan</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>This lotion made me orange, left streaks and spots, even when I tried my best to go as evenly as possible.</li>
            <li>This is the very first time I&#x27;ve used indoor lotion</li>
            <li>It bronzes after the fact slowly and comes out a nice brown and not so much orange like the rest of the bronzers which is great.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it on here for half the price.</li>
            <li>Smells EXACTLY like vitamin c tablets!</li>
            <li>BUT OVERALL I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>If you apply it very carefully/evenly and wash your hands after tanning you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a year round tanner, and I have many lotions in my bag, but this is one of my favorites for sure!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this lotion after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t turn golden brown overnight</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel its worth the hassel.</li>
            <li>It was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Nice, deep tan.  </li>
            <li>If you like in door tanning lotions with bronzers, this is absolutely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I have my own tanning bed, its only a 16 bulb bed.</li>
            <li>Kinda stinky afterwards but for the color and results its worth it.</li>
            <li>BUT ITS STILL WORTH BUYING FOR THE PRICE...</li>
            <li>My favorite tanning lotion of all of them so far.</li>
            <li>This lotion is leaving me with a very beautiful &amp; natural dark golden tan and super fast, way faster than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used....</li>
            <li>There are so many other lotions that are a little cheaper that give wonderful results.</li>
            <li>After I received this I used it right away.</li>
            <li>If that happens I used peroxide and it came right off.</li>
            <li>You have to be very careful to rub it in good and evenly or it will leave orangish brown streaks.</li>
            <li>has a great smell and will get you a dark tan fast.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion to use if you want to get dark fast.</li>
            <li>Awesome deep dark bronzer.....</li>
            <li>If you want a great dark tan that&#x27;s brown (not orange) than buy this!!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to whipe inbetween your fingers and palms to make sure you dont get awkward stains and rub it in really good.</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend for anyone wanting a deep tan,quick results and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>I had to use a pumice sponge on the palms of my hand near my wrists because it definitely turned the dry, calloused skin there a bit orange, but small price to pay for a great lotion that gave me a wonderful boost of color when I was at a plateau.</li>
            <li>I could use free packets of lotion forever, but this lotion is perfect for guys that don&#x27;t want to tan numerous times to get a little color and a lot of burn, once a week using this will give you a natural tan color.</li>
            <li>and it gets you brown very fast.</li>
            <li>I pretty picky</li>
            <li>so I used this for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>I have tanned for several years and this is probably my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>This is the first tanning lotion I will ever re-order.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I have used many different bronzers, this product does not make you look orange or streaky at all.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely purchase this product again!  </li>
            <li>So glad to have found it again now that I&#x27;m back to tanning!!!</li>
            <li>Fast tan, never turned orange!</li>
            <li>I give it a solid 10 for sure.</li>
            <li>and Im willing to try again</li>
            <li>However, this is the first tanning lotion I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is  suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>No orange, no stain, brown brown and NO offensive smell, unlike most of my bronzers, this one is white lotion..</li>
            <li>AT FIRST...</li>
            <li>I guess everyone&#x27;s skin is different and perhaps this lotion just doesn&#x27;t suit my skin type, I would not have a problem using it again, but would not be something I would consider at top of my list.</li>
            <li>I saw color with the first use.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and on time!</li>
            <li>Noticeable tan in first use.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rub it in all the way especially on elbows, knees and ankles otherwise it will leave streaks.</li>
            <li>I tried Snookie for a few months and it wasn&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li>I received my purchase right away which i was very thankful for.</li>
            <li>After I get super dark from this lotion I will order Fire Walker by Figi brand also this is a super, super, super Tingler.</li>
            <li>Especially when there are better products in the Designer Skin line just as reasonable in cost.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Product was just as described and seller was pretty fast with shipment.</li>
            <li>got a nice dark tan in just 3 days.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you apply it evenly and allow it to dry before you get dressed and wash your hands after application.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different lotions and this is my fave by far!</li>
            <li>So that really shouldn&#x27;t be a factor.  </li>
            <li>From the moment I started applying it to my body, I was really turned off by the smell.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely cannot tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li>This lotion worked very well to maximize my tan after I had hit the plateau.</li>
            <li>Really like the smoke lotion.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li>It really helps me while I&#x27;m getting my tan for the summer.</li>
            <li>I ordered the lotion and it was everything i expected and more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was delivered really fast</li>
            <li>but I did use this one for 1 week straight and it did seem to get me darker.  </li>
            <li>and like the pink diamond better.</li>
            <li>(Not that it matters much)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this has really enhanced my tan</li>
            <li>and it can leave splotches of orange on your skin (even though I really try to rub it in well).</li>
            <li>It is very streaky and did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Thanks to Prime.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Try it you will really be amazed at the results.</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well for use at the tanning bed and out in the sun.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>If the product I purchased is the real thing, I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like how the lotion streaks on my skin though</li>
            <li>Lotion does work super fast compared to others I have used, this time around I am tanning every other day for about a week and already seeing a significantly darker color.</li>
            <li>you feeling soft!!!</li>
            <li>Love the color it gave me and the smell did not put me off at all, though based on other reviews I was unsure.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave me looking &amp;#34;orangish&amp;#34; like most other self tanning lotions do.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rub it in well because it will leave streaks if you aren&#x27;t careful!</li>
            <li>You have to be very careful with it and make sure that you run it in well and wipe your hands off after applying.</li>
            <li>but it was nothing compared to how gorgeous &amp; dark my tan was the next morning when I woke up</li>
            <li>The color actually lasts for a full week.</li>
            <li>This gets me really dark, but if I use it too often too many times in a row I get orangy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple lotions and none have worked this quickly.</li>
            <li>Have ordered from this seller multiple times, and receive product quickly each time.</li>
            <li>and it has given me a nice medium base tan considering I&#x27;m naturally fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the seller &amp; I</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have used it 3 times in the high end beds</li>
            <li>I got this in two days and it really surprised me!!</li>
            <li>remember to have something to rinse your hands with, or u will have a little discoloration goin on :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive and works great.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I just tanned smell\\&quot; is if you&#x27;ve used too much lotion or if you&#x27;re in a tanning bed that doesn&#x27;t have enough ventilation resulting in your body getting really hot.</li>
            <li>Maybe I will give it a few shades darker and see if I continue to notice, but I&#x27;m sure after I get even darker</li>
            <li>Designer Skin Luminary Bronzer is a bit more expensive, but is a much better product, and will last much longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my new smoke lotion twice</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new lotion</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make you orange at all, but remember to use like a wet nap to clean your hands after you&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I noticed a pretty big difference even after one use!</li>
            <li>I just started tanning for this summer and recently bought (smoke) for the first time.</li>
            <li>I love my dark color I got almost instantly.</li>
            <li>I feel like it worked really well at first, but now I am not really seeing any improvements.</li>
            <li>It does stain the palms of your hands a little but carry a baby wipe with you and wipe them off after you apply and they will be fine.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tanned in over a year due to being pregnant and having a baby.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me and have a hard time getting a natural tan, you will love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used black grease lotion and other popular brands.</li>
            <li>&amp; wow</li>
            <li>I always wait at least 4 hours before showering after I&#x27;ve tanned to make sure the bronzers have time to do their thing.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was old, maybe it&#x27;s diluted, maybe, maybe, maybe...  </li>
            <li>I was surprised it was still on market.</li>
            <li>I have a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Really took my tan to the next level!</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t see a difference using this product on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural look, this is not the way to go.</li>
            <li>The lotion does make you much darker, possibly the darkest I have been (I have tanned in a tanning bed for 4 years now).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that is resembling the old supree products ,this is it</li>
            <li>After trying it out I realized this lotion does not do nearly what it says.</li>
            <li>so I will not waste my money.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell old either.&lt;br /&gt;WASH</li>
            <li>I liked that it gave a good tan, but the smell after tanning was awful.. and</li>
            <li>Does not last long in the bottle, so use it up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of bad reviews but some also really good!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t give you that after tan smell that other lotions do.&lt;br /&gt;definitely worth getting</li>
            <li>Great lotion for getting tough to tan areas dark</li>
            <li>price is very reasonable, it&#x27;s twice as expensive in most tanning</li>
            <li>This lotion made my tone less red and more of a deep bronze.</li>
            <li>My step-mom just noticed that I was a different type of tan than I normally am.&lt;br</li>
            <li>little pricey but would def reccommend it to anyone lokking for a quick tan</li>
            <li>the platinum smoke is the exact same lotion but in a different packaging, so if you go for the other option you are basically paying for the prettier bottle of lotion and the exact same juice.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see any major results</li>
            <li>I get super dark, even in regular sun!</li>
            <li>As long as the smell is decent</li>
            <li>I have a nice base tan and tan easily, but wanted to take it to the next level.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast, dark tan!</li>
            <li>I was using a tingler that left me spotty and this lotion fixed that for me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and protect was what I expected.</li>
            <li>Not happy with paying more than if I had ordered it today.</li>
            <li>I honestly think I got a fake, because it didn&#x27;t even turn my hands orange.</li>
            <li>dark tan is what this lotion is all about, I used many over the years and this one will definitely give you a very deep dark</li>
            <li>/&gt;2: When I went swimming this summer, the parts of my body that rubbed together like the creases of my arm and armpits as well as the area around my belly ring rubbed off and left the areas white while the rest of my body was a considerable amount</li>
            <li>no instant bronzers so your clothes wont get stained or anything, smells quite nice and faint</li>
            <li>I want to make it very clear that I&#x27;m really not picky about tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, only problem was the bottle had opened in the package and made a mess</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the product, it means you&#x27;ve gone tanning just a little too much.  </li>
            <li>It has a very neutral smell, like a cocoanut smell with a little vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> smells good tans great</li>
            <li> it has a great smell and it tanned really good</li>
            <li> I still love smoke best</li>
            <li> I just make sure I rub it in real good.</li>
            <li> Smells good</li>
            <li> if u rub the lotion in good &amp; rub it in a circular motion when applying.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells so good, like oranges when your applying it...</li>
            <li> It smells good, but does have a bronzer smell after tanning.</li>
            <li> After I tried it, I loved it.</li>
            <li> Good bronzer that does not tingle.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good level 2 or level 3 bronzer, I recommend Coco Tini (level 2) and</li>
            <li> Smells good also.  </li>
            <li> Good color.</li>
            <li> It work good in booth or outdoor tanning.</li>
            <li> Good for your skins moisture</li>
            <li> good in the bottle</li>
            <li> so I am in a hurry...not good..</li>
            <li> and I know my sister used it and loved it too.</li>
            <li> Did not give good color at all</li>
            <li> It works good too</li>
            <li> smells good too, not too smelly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good, has a lot of bronzes in it.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and don&#x27;t even have streaking issues.</li>
            <li> Really good</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this lotion, I was convinced to buy it because I am fair skin and do not tan immediately</li>
            <li> so I need a good bronzer.</li>
            <li> It works great, doesn&#x27;t smell all girly, has a nice amount of bronzer to it, and its a good size bottle.</li>
            <li> I tan very easy and in just one session I get great color.</li>
            <li> great smell and again beautiful color that shows up quickly.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would be as great as it was reviewed to be.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great.</li>
            <li> is great, read the reviews though make sure you wash your hands with something before tanning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tanning lotion smells good.</li>
            <li> What a great product for an even greater price.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and the shipping was very timely!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I feel I can use the tanning spray and get better results and cheaper!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent bronzer, but prepare yourself - you are going to smell real funky after using this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> Make sure you wipe your hands!</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you evenly apply the lotion and WASH your hands after you apply it or it will stain!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Well first off - I was very impressed with the smell of the lotion.</li>

            <li> and I get a nice tan</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tingle his skin, smells nice &amp; helps the indoor tan deepen.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with it and highly encourage others to try it.</li>
            <li> It works perfect of the high pressure beds that I tan in during the summer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell so wonderful after I lay in the super hot tanning bed, but do any lotions smell wonderful after you&#x27;ve laid in an extremely hot bed?</li>
            <li> Love love this lotion!</li>
            <li> A superb seller w/ easy ordering and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> While I felt wonderfully moisturized while using this for tanning, I didn&#x27;t see any of the great results that other reviewers are posting.  </li>
            <li> Great for first time tanners!</li>
            <li> AT THE TIME, IF YOU DON&#x27;T RUB IT IN VERY GOOD, YOU WILL HAVE STREAKS ALL OVER YOU, WIPE HAND VERY</li>
            <li> It is by far the BEST lotion I have ever used</li>

            <li> I used it in high school, a good 10 yrs ago, and loved it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and pretty good bronzer.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and it has a very good bronzer.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wipe your hand and fingers thoroughly or else</li>
            <li> Love love</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome because it has a self tanner and does double duty when using it in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, its smell and the color I have.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have to say that I question the quality of the product that I got.  </li>
            <li> I found it worked even better when I tanned with an accelerator for three days</li>
            <li> Most of my lotions smell like burnt flesh but this one just smells like a coconut breeze.</li>
            <li> One tip, make sure you wipe off hands with baby wipes after applying this.</li>
            <li> eh : )</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used before many times.  </li>
            <li> WELL AFTER USING, DOES IMPROVE YOUR TAN 100 PERCENT AND DARKER FAST, GREAT PRODUCT, BUT</li>
            <li> Lala love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> but I love the smell (kinda fruity)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see after more applications how I like it..</li>
            <li> I researched the top indoor tanning</li>
            <li> if you use this product be sure to wash your hands immediately afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Seller, just make sure your caps are tightened well before packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Then you Google bronzing tanning lotions this is one of the top</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> and I have used MANY bronzers</li>
            <li> love this lotion.</li>
            <li> tans you really fast and smells great.</li>
            <li> have to make sure I wipe it off after tanning.  </li>
            <li> you will love it.</li>
            <li> Continue buying it, but don&#x27;t even use it that often in tanning beds, I just love the self tanner it provides.</li>
            <li> Try getting this quality for under $100.00 at your favorite Tanning Salon.</li>

            <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I will not be able to notice.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> better lotions out there?</li>
            <li> Is there a better value then this one?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna have to tan as much to get the color I want!!!!  </li>
            <li> when it comes to scents, I think this lotion smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Well, my tan was looking pretty good</li>
            <li> It is a great bronzer, you really need to make sure you smooth on every where..</li>
            <li> It is worth the money!!</li>
            <li> It applies easily, does not suffer from the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; many tanning lotions have</li>
            <li> It gives you a very natural sun kissed glow and has a very nice tropical scent, not that yucky chemical smell that some bronzers have.  </li>
            <li> Overall this lotion is incredible &amp; it does what it&#x27;s suppose to....</li>
            <li> Worked great as far as tanning goes</li>
            <li> Gives good color but REALLY stains your skin.</li>
            <li> tan!&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable right after 1st use a darker shade !!</li>
            <li> Great Deal and Super Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Other than that, great!!</li>
            <li> it got here very quickly</li>
            <li> and it tanned me VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion it went on easy</li>
            <li> had my  product very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I received this lotion very quickly.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I had them special order it after they stopped carrying it in-store.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> It smells great and gives a nice dark tan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Package came quick!</li>
            <li> I always order Smoke when I need a quick tan!</li>
            <li> Really love how quickly it tans you.</li>
            <li> light medium tan.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the Tanning Lotion, but when I was telling a friend about the product we noticed that Amazon had the same item at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> Deep tan, great color.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is you should be somewhat an experienced tanner to use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Leaves great color and lasting.</li>
            <li> Product smells wonderful, but after wards gives a hint of tanning skin ( not to harsh) is tolerable.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this tanning</li>
            <li> I got great results and only used a gold bed.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Warning though, even though I am experienced and I know how to rub lotion in and pay attention to key areas that say &amp;#34;I tan&amp;#34;, this lotion turns my hands orange.</li>
            <li> Although, it is a good bronzer as far as the tanning.</li>
            <li> she loved the product and it saved me some money the tanning salon wanted much more for the same product</li>
            <li> However, since this lotion is a bronzer it will stain your hands orange after you apply it so be sure to wipe your hands right after you apply.</li>
            <li> girlfriend manages a huge tanning salon and has all kinds of free samples to use, I tan maybe 4 times a month and always try different lotions, I tried this about 6 months ago and decided I liked it the most.</li>
            <li> She is excited..</li>
            <li> I have been buying this stuff for many years, it&#x27;s the only bronzer that I have come across that actually works great!</li>
            <li> worth the 20 bucks!</li>
            <li> It has amazing bronzing action for a quick and easy difference.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for fast color,  but be careful when apply and wash hands after applying, it stains.</li>
            <li> gotta be the best lotion I have ever used, lasts an extremely long time after just one use, even better if you are a regular tanner</li>
            <li> Great lotion and gets you dark quick!</li>
            <li> it gets an amazing natural colour,</li>
            <li> I actually think this smells good</li>
            <li> Just a side note: really make sure to spread evenly and wash hands thoroughly after using.</li>
            <li> , MAKE SURE YOU DON&#x27;T PUT TO MUCH</li>
            <li> but make sure you wipe your hands very well</li>
            <li> Be sure and wash your hands after tanning and rub in very well around wrist and fingers when you are applying it to body.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and saw results after only 4 times tanning.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my skin, very silky NOT sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different lotions and this one is by FAR my favorite!!</li>
            <li> Is super good for the girl on the go who can only get to the salon once a week</li>
            <li> I have skin that tans pretty easily, but this helped me keep my tan</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> This lotion made me orange, left streaks and spots, even when I tried my best to go as evenly as possible.</li>
            <li> This is the very first time I&#x27;ve used indoor lotion</li>
            <li> It bronzes after the fact slowly and comes out a nice brown and not so much orange like the rest of the bronzers which is great.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find it on here for half the price.</li>
            <li> Smells EXACTLY like vitamin c tablets!</li>
            <li> BUT OVERALL I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> If you apply it very carefully/evenly and wash your hands after tanning you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a year round tanner, and I have many lotions in my bag, but this is one of my favorites for sure!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this lotion after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t turn golden brown overnight</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel its worth the hassel.</li>
            <li> It was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Nice, deep tan.  </li>
            <li> If you like in door tanning lotions with bronzers, this is absolutely worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I have my own tanning bed, its only a 16 bulb bed.</li>
            <li> Kinda stinky afterwards but for the color and results its worth it.</li>
            <li> BUT ITS STILL WORTH BUYING FOR THE PRICE...</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion of all of them so far.</li>
            <li> This lotion is leaving me with a very beautiful &amp; natural dark golden tan and super fast, way faster than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used....</li>
            <li> There are so many other lotions that are a little cheaper that give wonderful results.</li>
            <li> After I received this I used it right away.</li>
            <li> If that happens I used peroxide and it came right off.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful to rub it in good and evenly or it will leave orangish brown streaks.</li>
            <li> has a great smell and will get you a dark tan fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion to use if you want to get dark fast.</li>
            <li> Awesome deep dark bronzer.....</li>
            <li> If you want a great dark tan that&#x27;s brown (not orange) than buy this!!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to whipe inbetween your fingers and palms to make sure you dont get awkward stains and rub it in really good.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend for anyone wanting a deep tan,quick results and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> I had to use a pumice sponge on the palms of my hand near my wrists because it definitely turned the dry, calloused skin there a bit orange, but small price to pay for a great lotion that gave me a wonderful boost of color when I was at a plateau.</li>
            <li> I could use free packets of lotion forever, but this lotion is perfect for guys that don&#x27;t want to tan numerous times to get a little color and a lot of burn, once a week using this will give you a natural tan color.</li>
            <li> and it gets you brown very fast.</li>
            <li> I pretty picky</li>
            <li> so I used this for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> I have tanned for several years and this is probably my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the first tanning lotion I will ever re-order.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I have used many different bronzers, this product does not make you look orange or streaky at all.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely purchase this product again!  </li>
            <li> So glad to have found it again now that I&#x27;m back to tanning!!!</li>
            <li> Fast tan, never turned orange!</li>
            <li> I give it a solid 10 for sure.</li>
            <li> and Im willing to try again</li>
            <li> However, this is the first tanning lotion I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is  suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> No orange, no stain, brown brown and NO offensive smell, unlike most of my bronzers, this one is white lotion..</li>
            <li> AT FIRST...</li>
            <li> I guess everyone&#x27;s skin is different and perhaps this lotion just doesn&#x27;t suit my skin type, I would not have a problem using it again, but would not be something I would consider at top of my list.</li>
            <li> I saw color with the first use.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and on time!</li>
            <li> Noticeable tan in first use.</li>
            <li> Make sure you rub it in all the way especially on elbows, knees and ankles otherwise it will leave streaks.</li>
            <li> I tried Snookie for a few months and it wasn&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase right away which i was very thankful for.</li>
            <li> After I get super dark from this lotion I will order Fire Walker by Figi brand also this is a super, super, super Tingler.</li>
            <li> Especially when there are better products in the Designer Skin line just as reasonable in cost.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Product was just as described and seller was pretty fast with shipment.</li>
            <li> got a nice dark tan in just 3 days.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you apply it evenly and allow it to dry before you get dressed and wash your hands after application.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lotions and this is my fave by far!</li>
            <li> So that really shouldn&#x27;t be a factor.  </li>
            <li> From the moment I started applying it to my body, I was really turned off by the smell.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely cannot tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion worked very well to maximize my tan after I had hit the plateau.</li>
            <li> Really like the smoke lotion.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li> It really helps me while I&#x27;m getting my tan for the summer.</li>
            <li> I ordered the lotion and it was everything i expected and more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was delivered really fast</li>
            <li> but I did use this one for 1 week straight and it did seem to get me darker.  </li>
            <li> and like the pink diamond better.</li>
            <li> (Not that it matters much)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this has really enhanced my tan</li>
            <li> and it can leave splotches of orange on your skin (even though I really try to rub it in well).</li>
            <li> It is very streaky and did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Thanks to Prime.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Try it you will really be amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for use at the tanning bed and out in the sun.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> If the product I purchased is the real thing, I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like how the lotion streaks on my skin though</li>
            <li> Lotion does work super fast compared to others I have used, this time around I am tanning every other day for about a week and already seeing a significantly darker color.</li>
            <li> you feeling soft!!!</li>
            <li> Love the color it gave me and the smell did not put me off at all, though based on other reviews I was unsure.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me looking &amp;#34;orangish&amp;#34; like most other self tanning lotions do.</li>
            <li> Make sure you rub it in well because it will leave streaks if you aren&#x27;t careful!</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful with it and make sure that you run it in well and wipe your hands off after applying.</li>
            <li> but it was nothing compared to how gorgeous &amp; dark my tan was the next morning when I woke up</li>
            <li> The color actually lasts for a full week.</li>
            <li> This gets me really dark, but if I use it too often too many times in a row I get orangy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple lotions and none have worked this quickly.</li>
            <li> Have ordered from this seller multiple times, and receive product quickly each time.</li>
            <li> and it has given me a nice medium base tan considering I&#x27;m naturally fair skinned.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the seller &amp; I</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times in the high end beds</li>
            <li> I got this in two days and it really surprised me!!</li>
            <li> remember to have something to rinse your hands with, or u will have a little discoloration goin on :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and works great.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I just tanned smell\\&quot; is if you&#x27;ve used too much lotion or if you&#x27;re in a tanning bed that doesn&#x27;t have enough ventilation resulting in your body getting really hot.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will give it a few shades darker and see if I continue to notice, but I&#x27;m sure after I get even darker</li>
            <li> Designer Skin Luminary Bronzer is a bit more expensive, but is a much better product, and will last much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my new smoke lotion twice</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new lotion</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you orange at all, but remember to use like a wet nap to clean your hands after you&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I noticed a pretty big difference even after one use!</li>
            <li> I just started tanning for this summer and recently bought (smoke) for the first time.</li>
            <li> I love my dark color I got almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I feel like it worked really well at first, but now I am not really seeing any improvements.</li>
            <li> It does stain the palms of your hands a little but carry a baby wipe with you and wipe them off after you apply and they will be fine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned in over a year due to being pregnant and having a baby.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me and have a hard time getting a natural tan, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used black grease lotion and other popular brands.</li>
            <li> &amp; wow</li>
            <li> I always wait at least 4 hours before showering after I&#x27;ve tanned to make sure the bronzers have time to do their thing.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was old, maybe it&#x27;s diluted, maybe, maybe, maybe...  </li>
            <li> I was surprised it was still on market.</li>
            <li> I have a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Really took my tan to the next level!</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t see a difference using this product on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural look, this is not the way to go.</li>
            <li> The lotion does make you much darker, possibly the darkest I have been (I have tanned in a tanning bed for 4 years now).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that is resembling the old supree products ,this is it</li>
            <li> After trying it out I realized this lotion does not do nearly what it says.</li>
            <li> so I will not waste my money.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell old either.&lt;br /&gt;WASH</li>
            <li> I liked that it gave a good tan, but the smell after tanning was awful.. and</li>
            <li> Does not last long in the bottle, so use it up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of bad reviews but some also really good!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t give you that after tan smell that other lotions do.&lt;br /&gt;definitely worth getting</li>
            <li> Great lotion for getting tough to tan areas dark</li>
            <li> price is very reasonable, it&#x27;s twice as expensive in most tanning</li>
            <li> This lotion made my tone less red and more of a deep bronze.</li>
            <li> My step-mom just noticed that I was a different type of tan than I normally am.&lt;br</li>
            <li> little pricey but would def reccommend it to anyone lokking for a quick tan</li>
            <li> the platinum smoke is the exact same lotion but in a different packaging, so if you go for the other option you are basically paying for the prettier bottle of lotion and the exact same juice.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any major results</li>
            <li> I get super dark, even in regular sun!</li>
            <li> As long as the smell is decent</li>
            <li> I have a nice base tan and tan easily, but wanted to take it to the next level.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast, dark tan!</li>
            <li> I was using a tingler that left me spotty and this lotion fixed that for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and protect was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not happy with paying more than if I had ordered it today.</li>
            <li> I honestly think I got a fake, because it didn&#x27;t even turn my hands orange.</li>
            <li> dark tan is what this lotion is all about, I used many over the years and this one will definitely give you a very deep dark</li>
            <li> /&gt;2: When I went swimming this summer, the parts of my body that rubbed together like the creases of my arm and armpits as well as the area around my belly ring rubbed off and left the areas white while the rest of my body was a considerable amount</li>
            <li> no instant bronzers so your clothes wont get stained or anything, smells quite nice and faint</li>
            <li> I want to make it very clear that I&#x27;m really not picky about tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, only problem was the bottle had opened in the package and made a mess</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the product, it means you&#x27;ve gone tanning just a little too much.  </li>
            <li> It has a very neutral smell, like a cocoanut smell with a little vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my skin dry and the color was barely there.</li>
            <li> I am very pasty and it is hard for me to tan, but with this product I began seeing color almost instantly and the tan lasts much longer than with any other product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> for instance my hands certain areas of palms are rough because I lift weights and even fingers are a little orange.</li>
            <li> I couldnt use it long enough to tell if it works!</li>
            <li> It has a good smell going on, but after you tan it STINKS!</li>
            <li> The bottle is black and to me the name smoke stands out thinking wow</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this really helped.</li>
            <li> Only downfall would be that you have to be careful about wearing whites clothes when using this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would possibly buy this again maybe for the winter, but for the summer, as I swim a lot, I would not want my tan to rub off just because I stayed wet for 45 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> Works well for long term use.</li>
            <li> It did not take long to ship maybe 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> It smells nice when you first put it on, but after you tan you smell horrible.</li>
            <li> NOTICED THEY KEEP RAISING THE PRICE, THAT WHY I HATE TO WRITE A GOOD REVIIEW</li>
            <li> Smells good, does not stain my hands or clothing provided a base tan</li>
            <li> IF YOU DONT ALREADY HAVE A GOOD BASE TAN</li>
            <li> I alternate lotions every other day,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to be very careful next time.</li>
            <li> This product specifies that it should be used only after you have a nice base tan.</li>
            <li> : it didn&#x27;t make me my natural brown tan color that I usually get with the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> this lotion will give me a deep dark tan.</li>
            <li> You have to wait several hours before you can shower or you will be washing your color down the drain.</li>
            <li> Typically, the only time you get that</li>
            <li> An hour later and after applying my usual scented body lotion, I was starting getting the \\&quot;I just tanned smell\\&quot; AGAIN.</li>
            <li> , so, I will probably go back to the 20x black.</li>
            <li> will stick with solid black from millenium</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of lotions from all kinds of manufactures, this is a cheaper alternative to super expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> but it definitely has a little self tanner in it</li>
            <li> so it will add a little bronzer to your skin and make you look darker than you actually are.</li>
            <li> but it gave me a great base to start with and NO ORANGE!</li>
            <li> It does contain some self tanners so you have to be careful and wash hands immediately to avoid streaking between fingers.</li>
            <li> Also be careful because it will stain your whites.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> but I have to be careful that it doesn&#x27;t stain my skin around my toes and ankles....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned in a few months and had only had 2 sessions before receiving this lotion.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> I was already a little tan, but this stuff made me really dark and in only 2, 20 minute sessions!!!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t gonna be an everyday tanning lotion for me simply because of how dark the bronzes are in it.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know what those other people are talking about.  </li>
            <li> I used this  for four months about every other day</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other tanning lotions with bronzers that I didn&#x27;t have to wipe between my fingers when I have used them.</li>
            <li> I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT THE BRONZING ISSUE..</li>
            <li> the other comments, yes this product will stain your hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I took one star off because it does stain my hands - and yes I am VERY careful about wiping them and washing them</li>
            <li> Be careful as to wipe your hands well because in between my fingers got a little discolored.</li>
            <li> I thought I looked dark</li>
            <li> tanning lotions got me darker and didnt turn my finger orange so its just not worth it for me</li>
            <li> Not worth the $20 I paid.</li>
            <li> - color is dark, not orange.</li>
            <li> and it got me dark within two weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> It is for ADVANCED tanners that already have a base tan so a pale person may not have the same results.</li>
            <li> The down side to all that bronzer is that leaves streaks/spots and stained hands.</li>
            <li> I will have to agree with other reviews that say to wipe your hands after applying, otherwise your fingers WILL be orange-y!  </li>
            <li> before I purchased smoke black.</li>
            <li> I also got the brown sugar spicy black.</li>
            <li> It does have a very active bronzer, so</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you want dark color!</li>
            <li> Gets you so dark!</li>
            <li> but I get dark after 2 times tanning !</li>
            <li> THEN YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE STREAKY</li>
            <li> I noticed they remain a little orange in tougher areas of the skin-</li>
            <li> , I felt like after a week of using I had a little uneven color on my arms and had some orangy color by my wrists.</li>
            <li> Personally I have not experienced any of these issues.</li>
            <li> but, it was just from the dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the brown was wearing off within a few days of not using.</li>
            <li> You can put it on for alittle boost like a self tanner if your feeling pale...</li>
            <li> It gets u DARK, DARK, DARK!!!!</li>
            <li> Very little fragrance.</li>
            <li> I saw a few reviews with negative commits about the smell</li>
            <li> but I cant get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit oranger than usual but</li>
            <li> However i wanted a tan maximizer without bronzer and unfortunately this product made me a bit orange, especially between my fingers.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful during application because you wont know you have streaks until it&#x27;s too late!</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this with any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I moisturized at least once and sometimes twice a day, plus used this</li>
            <li> but it looks like I go at least 5 times.</li>
            <li> Slowly bronzer throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Slow delivery&lt;br /&gt;Low</li>
            <li> Only lotion ill use!</li>
            <li> I can not tell the difference between this lotion and the expensive luxury tanning lotions other than the 40 bucks i save buying this one.</li>
            <li> lotion does contain some serious bronzers, so you cannot leave a bunch of lotion on your hands for hours as it will bronze your hands (duh).</li>
            <li> However in my  local salon it is VERY expensive</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see the orange on my feet the NEXT day.</li>
            <li> I even applied it evenly but that did no good...</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is quite bad after tanning, but that&#x27;s really to be expected with any tanning</li>
            <li> not great but works if you have nothing else to use.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s one of the few bronzers that doesn&#x27;t smell so bad</li>
            <li> This lotion streaks badly and makes your orange colored after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the worst lotion I have used.</li>
            <li> and he says you can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the Smoke Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li> Results after tanning are mediocre.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of all the rave reviews, but am not impressed.</li>
            <li> I hate to say I was a little disappointed in this product myself.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time getting a base tan</li>
            <li> it will make ur hands dirty.</li>
            <li> Smells unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Now unfortunately, the bad news - it streaked!</li>
            <li> I read over some of the reviews before buying and some people stated that it had a bad smell after tanning and gave them an orange tan that washes off.</li>
            <li> but it streaked really bad</li>
            <li> To the garbage it goes... :-(</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest someone without a base tan to use this stuff though because it may turn them orange.</li>
            <li> Iam very disappointed with my purchase</li>
            <li> The worst after-smell I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> it was one of the worst lotions I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This was the worst tanning lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It was AWFUL!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One of the best tanning lotions I have ever used. It&#x27;s expensive and works great. I am very pasty and it is hard for me to tan, but with this product I began seeing color almost instantly and the tan lasts much longer than with any other product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Smells good but it definitely has a little self tanner in it, I felt like after a week of using I had a little uneven color on my arms and had some orangy color by my wrists. If you apply it very carefully/evenly and wash your hands after tanning you should be fine.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and the shipping was very timely! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Smoke is a great tanning product However in my  local salon it is VERY expensive I saved a lot by buying on line</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly. Love this product</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!  I used to work in the tanning industry and used this product religiously.  Im very happy to see that Supre has not discontinued it!  I will have to agree with other reviews that say to wipe your hands after applying, otherwise your fingers WILL be orange-y!  If rubbed in well you won&#x27;t have any problems!</li>
            <li> Awesome deep dark bronzer..... Just make sure to wipe your hand and fingers thoroughly or else it will make ur hands dirty. Slowly bronzer throughout the day. Love love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and it has given me a nice medium base tan considering I&#x27;m naturally fair skinned. It was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome because it has a self tanner and does double duty when using it in a tanning bed. I pretty picky when it comes to scents, I think this lotion smells pretty good. Only downfall would be that you have to be careful about wearing whites clothes when using this tanning lotion. It can turn your white clothes orange but it washes out.</li>
            <li> Got it today! It is the best bronzer I have ever used! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This product rocks.  I actually think this smells good, I don&#x27;t know what those other people are talking about.  Also, it gave me a great tan, I&#x27;m usually as white as a person can get but this definitely gave me color, like bronze not orange.  Also if you turn orange it&#x27;s not the product, it means you&#x27;ve gone tanning just a little too much.  I used this  for four months about every other day and I didn&#x27;t turn orange.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews, but I just received my Smoke lotion a couple of days ago &amp; boy am I impressed!!!  It is by far the BEST lotion I have ever used &amp; I&#x27;ve used hundreds of lotions over my tanning years!!! I&#x27;ve used my new smoke lotion twice &amp; wow the results are incredible!!!!  I thought I looked dark a couple of hours after I tanned but it was nothing compared to how gorgeous &amp; dark my tan was the next morning when I woke up... I was blown away!!!  This lotion is leaving me with a very beautiful &amp; natural dark golden tan and super fast, way faster than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.... It looks like I&#x27;ve been at the beach for a week!!!  I&#x27;m beyond thrilled with this lotion &amp; it&#x27;s gonna save me money bc I&#x27;m not gonna have to tan as much to get the color I want!!!!  I didn&#x27;t have any streaking &amp; you won&#x27;t either if u rub the lotion in good &amp; rub it in a circular motion when applying. The lotion smells so good, like oranges when your applying it... It doesn&#x27;t smell so wonderful after I lay in the super hot tanning bed, but do any lotions smell wonderful after you&#x27;ve laid in an extremely hot bed? Nope!!!! So that really shouldn&#x27;t be a factor.  Overall this lotion is incredible &amp; it does what it&#x27;s suppose to.... It gets u DARK, DARK, DARK!!!!</li>
            <li> This THE BEST tanning product ever!  Amazing color, smells great and works fast.  Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top-notch tan!</li>
            <li> Really awesome scent and had great results!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for about 10 years now. Typically, the only time you get that \\&quot;I just tanned smell\\&quot; is if you&#x27;ve used too much lotion or if you&#x27;re in a tanning bed that doesn&#x27;t have enough ventilation resulting in your body getting really hot. I want to make it very clear that I&#x27;m really not picky about tanning lotions. As long as the smell is decent and I get a nice tan, it&#x27;s fine by me. This product specifies that it should be used only after you have a nice base tan. Well, my tan was looking pretty good so I used this for the first time yesterday. From the moment I started applying it to my body, I was really turned off by the smell. I tanned for 15 minutes in a well ventilated turbo bed and when I got out, I saw immediate results. This lotion did what it said. I always wait at least 4 hours before showering after I&#x27;ve tanned to make sure the bronzers have time to do their thing. Well... I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of myself. I could only wait an hour and I HAD to get this stuff off of my body. I washed myself 3 times head to toe. I figured that would be overkill... An hour later and after applying my usual scented body lotion, I was starting getting the \\&quot;I just tanned smell\\&quot; AGAIN. I couldn&#x27;t even smell my lotion. I have washed my hands about 8 times since then and they STILL smell like this stuff... I&#x27;m baffled. I have never experienced this with any other lotion. I got great results and I wish I could say that I would be using this again but I absolutely cannot tolerate the smell. To the garbage it goes... :-(</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all! Turned me  Orange! I like like a freak!</li>
            <li> i always wash my hands after applying a brownser tanning lotion but with this one just washing isnt enuff u have to scrub inbetween ur fingers and that might not even work&lt;br /&gt;other tanning lotions got me darker and didnt turn my finger orange so its just not worth it for me&lt;br /&gt;it is the best smelling lotion ive ever used it smells like fruit gummy life savors and comes out as a clear lotion wich i thought was interesting and it got here very quickly</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned in over a year due to being pregnant and having a baby.  I have a very hard time getting a base tan and  I&#x27;m very fair skinned so I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would be as great as it was reviewed to be. In just one use, I saw a difference. I didn&#x27;t turn golden brown overnight but it gave me a great base to start with and NO ORANGE! I&#x27;m very excited to continue using this!  I&#x27;ve tried multiple lotions and none have worked this quickly. I&#x27;m buying my mom a bottle today because this lotion was awesome!</li>
            <li> favourite tanning lotion!! it gets an amazing natural colour, no instant bronzers so your clothes wont get stained or anything, smells quite nice and faint so you won&#x27;t be reeking of tanning lotion all day if you have to go out after. I&#x27;ve used this one for a while as my build-up lotion and I&#x27;m very happy with it and highly encourage others to try it. if you are debating between this lotion and the platinum some by the same company THIS IS THE WAY TO GO. the platinum smoke is the exact same lotion but in a different packaging, so if you go for the other option you are basically paying for the prettier bottle of lotion and the exact same juice.</li>
            <li> I had used this product before ordering from Sunless Liquidators and was immediately impressed by the price.  My order arrived sooner than the estimated delivery date so I was very happy. It does contain some self tanners so you have to be careful and wash hands immediately to avoid streaking between fingers. I spray my hands with the tanning bed cleaner and wipe off as soon as I&#x27;m finished applying it and that works great for me. It is for ADVANCED tanners that already have a base tan so a pale person may not have the same results. The color I have received and maintained with this product is AMAZING! I read over some of the reviews before buying and some people stated that it had a bad smell after tanning and gave them an orange tan that washes off. Personally I have not experienced any of these issues. I love this lotion, its smell and the color I have. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion worked very well to maximize my tan after I had hit the plateau. It smells good, but does have a bronzer smell after tanning. Definitely be extremely careful to evenly apply and rub in completely, as well as wipe your hands off with a towel or something, or you will turn bronze between your fingers. Also be careful because it will stain your whites. Otherwise this is a very good lotion for the price and I will never buy lotion from the salon again!</li>
            <li> Leaves orange residue on skin</li>
            <li> Slow delivery&lt;br /&gt;Low quality lotion&lt;br /&gt;Maybe expired??</li>
            <li> This lotion made me orange, left streaks and spots, even when I tried my best to go as evenly as possible. It smells nice when you first put it on, but after you tan you smell horrible. The worst after-smell I&#x27;ve ever had. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have to say that I question the quality of the product that I got.  Maybe it was old, maybe it&#x27;s diluted, maybe, maybe, maybe...  While I felt wonderfully moisturized while using this for tanning, I didn&#x27;t see any of the great results that other reviewers are posting.  I moisturized at least once and sometimes twice a day, plus used this and while it was great for moisturizing I can&#x27;t say that it delivers on the promises it makes.  I do know that different lotions work differently on different skin types too and what works for me might not work for others.  I woulnd&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have tanned for several years and this is probably my favorite lotion. I have skin that tans pretty easily, but this helped me keep my tan and it tanned me VERY quickly. However, since this lotion is a bronzer it will stain your hands orange after you apply it so be sure to wipe your hands right after you apply. I recommend this if you want dark color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m German/Dutch. Blonde hair, blue eyes, light medium tan. I tan, but my tan is somewhat reddish toned. This lotion made my tone less red and more of a deep bronze. I love it! I found it worked even better when I tanned with an accelerator for three days THEN started using this lotion. It deepened my tan in one session. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t stink either! Most of my lotions smell like burnt flesh but this one just smells like a coconut breeze. One tip, make sure you wipe off hands with baby wipes after applying this. I had reallllly stained marks between my fingers for a week afterwards.</li>
            <li> Didnt realize it was white bronzer so I was skeptical at first. After I tried it, I loved it. Gets you so dark!</li>
            <li> Used this product before. Product was just as described and seller was pretty fast with shipment. Good bronzer that does not tingle. Just a side note: really make sure to spread evenly and wash hands thoroughly after using. Recommend</li>
            <li> Really like the smoke lotion. Is super good for the girl on the go who can only get to the salon once a week but it looks like I go at least 5 times. Will leave inbetween fingers orangey tho if your not diligent on wiping. Smells EXACTLY like vitamin c tablets! Not my fav smell but eh : )</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. I have used before many times.  has a great smell and will get you a dark tan fast.</li>
            <li> dark tan is what this lotion is all about, I used many over the years and this one will definitely give you a very deep dark tan!&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable right after 1st use a darker shade !!</li>
            <li> IT WORKS VERY WELL, MAKE SURE YOU DON&#x27;T PUT TO MUCH ON AT THE TIME, IF YOU DON&#x27;T RUB IT IN VERY GOOD, YOU WILL HAVE STREAKS ALL OVER YOU, WIPE HAND VERY WELL AFTER USING, DOES IMPROVE YOUR TAN 100 PERCENT AND DARKER FAST, GREAT PRODUCT, BUT NOTICED THEY KEEP RAISING THE PRICE, THAT WHY I HATE TO WRITE A GOOD REVIIEW BECAUSE AFTER THAT THE RAISE PRICES.</li>
            <li> I recently received my bottle of Smoke and went tanning that day. It has a good smell going on, but after you tan it STINKS! You have to wait several hours before you can shower or you will be washing your color down the drain. You have to be very careful to rub it in good and evenly or it will leave orangish brown streaks. I do not recommend putting this product on your face or neck. This product also stains your hands if you don&#x27;t wash them as soon as your done applying the lotion. I did not get the results I thought I would. I don&#x27;t feel its worth the hassel. If you are looking for a good level 2 or level 3 bronzer, I recommend Coco Tini (level 2) and Blackberry Tini(Level 3) by Fiesta Sun. These have worked wonderfully for me and they are not costly.</li>
            <li> This will make a difference in one use!!! The self tanners in it are wonderful! It does stain the palms of your hands a little but carry a baby wipe with you and wipe them off after you apply and they will be fine.</li>
            <li> Very very good product! It was worth the wait. I will be reordering soon!  I love my dark color I got almost instantly.</li>
            <li> not enough self tanning ingredients</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> Awesome product for fast color,  but be careful when apply and wash hands after applying, it stains.</li>
            <li> This lotion was a very good price. I used to use this product years ago. I was surprised it was still on market. Works great!</li>
            <li> Lala love this tanning lotion. It has amazing bronzing action for a quick and easy difference. Totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first tanning lotion I will ever re-order. Love the color it gave me and the smell did not put me off at all, though based on other reviews I was unsure. I had to use a pumice sponge on the palms of my hand near my wrists because it definitely turned the dry, calloused skin there a bit orange, but small price to pay for a great lotion that gave me a wonderful boost of color when I was at a plateau.</li>
            <li> By far the best tanning bronzer on the market!</li>
            <li> Only lotion ill use! Great price too!!</li>
            <li> I actually use this tanning lotion as a &amp;#34;sunless tanning lotion.&amp;#34; I apply it as soon as I shower and within a couple of hours I have a natural looking tan. It doesn&#x27;t leave me looking &amp;#34;orangish&amp;#34; like most other self tanning lotions do. The color actually lasts for a full week. It really helps me while I&#x27;m getting my tan for the summer. If you are like me and have a hard time getting a natural tan, you will love this product. Make sure that you apply it evenly and allow it to dry before you get dressed and wash your hands after application.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion! I saw a few reviews with negative commits about the smell but I love the smell (kinda fruity), it&#x27;s one of the few bronzers that doesn&#x27;t smell so bad I can&#x27;t stop at the store on the way home. The coverage is great too. I was using a tingler that left me spotty and this lotion fixed that for me.</li>
            <li> I liked that it gave a good tan, but the smell after tanning was awful.. and O&lt;br /&gt;I wait 4 hrs to shower, so, I will probably go back to the 20x black.</li>
            <li> Yes this does stain your hands and toes if you don&#x27;t wipe off... Works pretty well I like the color. Bronzer made me burn and I&#x27;ve had 3 sessions before I used this with accelerator lotion... I&#x27;ll see after more applications how I like it..</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion!!!! Except the one that I received was expired.</li>
            <li> Cheap. Smells unpleasant. Not worth the $20 I paid. I would not buy this again. Designer Skin Luminary Bronzer is a bit more expensive, but is a much better product, and will last much longer.</li>
            <li> Used it before, will continue to use it.  Nice, deep tan.  Very little fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the very first time I&#x27;ve used indoor lotion so I truly am one you can trust on this review! I researched the top indoor tanning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lotions  before I purchased smoke black. I like what consumers had to say&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;about it and the price was in my range I felt I wanted to spend. I like the lotion it went on easy and the smell was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion did darken me up only because of  the dye in it. I thought that the lotion helped the browning but, it was just from the dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the brown was wearing off within a few days of not using. I feel I can use the tanning spray and get better results and cheaper!</li>
            <li> Great color but make sure you wipe your hands very well</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.  Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it again from the seller.  It does have a very active bronzer, so if you use this product be sure to wash your hands immediately afterwards.  Otherwise, it is a great product.  It has a very pleasant fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet used the product but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work great. Fast shipping, only problem was the bottle had opened in the package and made a mess but thankfully it didn&#x27;t all come out. Smells really good compared to most bronzing tanning lotions. Seller, just make sure your caps are tightened well before packaged. Other than that, great!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the lotion and it was everything i expected and more. I searched reviews of this for a while and finally decided to try it. It bronzes after the fact slowly and comes out a nice brown and not so much orange like the rest of the bronzers which is great. Just make sure to whipe inbetween your fingers and palms to make sure you dont get awkward stains and rub it in really good. I ordered it yesterday and it came today. Best seller so far i&#x27;ve delt with on amazon. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the Tanning Lotion, but when I was telling a friend about the product we noticed that Amazon had the same item at a lower cost. Not happy with paying more than if I had ordered it today.</li>
            <li> This is the best taking lotion around!! I&#x27;ve tried many. I would recommend this over JWOW and the others.  Smells good also.  Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time.  Deep tan, great color.  I wouldn&#x27;t go any darker than this product provides.  The bronzer is a perfect color &amp; I&#x27;ve never had any issues with streaking.  It works perfect of the high pressure beds that I tan in during the summer.  I highly recommend the seller &amp; I had my  product very quickly.  Zero issues with the product, seller or shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this bronzer for years. No steaks. Good color. No orange. It work good in booth or outdoor tanning. Good for your skins moisture</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she enjoys her tanning, so I wanted to get something that would help make her darker.. She is excited.. Happy Wife &#x3D; Happy Life</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I use it as a self tanner as well as using it in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable, it&#x27;s twice as expensive in most tanning salons.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered really fast, I think it only took like 4 days to get it. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent w/ a great price to go along w/ it.  On occassion I sample newer tanning lotions and not one ever works as well as this product.  A superb seller w/ easy ordering and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion!  I alternate lotions every other day, but I did use this one for 1 week straight and it did seem to get me darker.  I&#x27;m a year round tanner, and I have many lotions in my bag, but this is one of my favorites for sure!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this stuff for many years, it&#x27;s the only bronzer that I have come across that actually works great! I will always continue to buy it. Package came quick!</li>
            <li> My husband switches between this lotion and a hot/ tingle lotion and he says you can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion. The smell is nice and he has a sexy brown tan. This is a great tanning lotion for men and women. Then you Google bronzing tanning lotions this is one of the top and we agree. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. It was delivered within 4 day and just all around a great purchase.</li>
            <li> My fav tanning lotion !!</li>
            <li> If you like in door tanning lotions with bronzers, this is absolutely worth trying.  I have used many different bronzers, this product does not make you look orange or streaky at all.  It gives you a very natural sun kissed glow and has a very nice tropical scent, not that yucky chemical smell that some bronzers have.  And a definity plus is that this product is PARABEN free !!  YAY !!  I would absolutely purchase this product again!  Happy Tanning !</li>
            <li> Awesome tanning lotion and great seller, I got it in only 3 days! Doesn&#x27;t make you orange at all, but remember to use like a wet nap to clean your hands after you&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for experienced tanners. Really took my tan to the next level! Great seller. I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Gives good color but REALLY stains your skin. Leaves you looking orange after a couple days. Would not order this again.</li>
            <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;color is great, read the reviews though make sure you wash your hands with something before tanning.&lt;br /&gt;smells good in the bottle but it fades from your body quick.&lt;br /&gt;definitely worth the 20 bucks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent bronzer, but prepare yourself - you are going to smell real funky after using this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> Love love this lotion! Smells great with great browsers! And it leaves ed s you feeling soft!!! Make sure you wipe your hands! It will stain the in between if the fingers.</li>
            <li> I have my own tanning bed, its only a 16 bulb bed. I have used black grease lotion and other popular brands. I got this in two days and it really surprised me!! It is a white lotion but don&#x27;t let that fool you, I forgot to wash my hands off and there now brown lol. This is by far the best tanning lotion on the market!! I was already a little tan, but this stuff made me really dark and in only 2, 20 minute sessions!!!! If you want a great dark tan that&#x27;s brown (not orange) than buy this!! It is worth the money!!</li>
            <li> It is a great bronzer, you really need to make sure you smooth on every where.. It will leave streaks if your in a hurry. Wipe between fingers and ankles..You look brown in 2 days; however I go during lunch so I am in a hurry...not good..</li>
            <li> best lotion ever!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this years ago when I worked at a tanning salon in college.. I loved it so much that I had them special order it after they stopped carrying it in-store.  So glad to have found it again now that I&#x27;m back to tanning!!! Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Keeps me tan and happy!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and protect was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Fast tan, never turned orange! Great for first time tanners! Would recommend to anyone wanting a great tan! Love this</li>
            <li> WOW! This stuff gives me amazing color. I have been tanning for years and I have used MANY bronzers but this is the best one. I took one star off because it does stain my hands - and yes I am VERY careful about wiping them and washing them but I still have some orange going on, but its not enough to get me to stop using this lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff may work but I cant get past the smell.  I couldnt use it long enough to tell if it works!</li>
            <li> Love !!! Leaves lines sometimes but I get dark after 2 times tanning !</li>
            <li> Does not last long in the bottle, so use it up quickly.  Get the tan on before your vacation.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from the reviews I read. Really don&#x27;t see a difference using this product on a regular basis. I indoor tan five times a week and like the pink diamond better.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this lotion after reading all the positive reviews. Big mistake! This is by far the worst lotion I have used. It keeps the &#x27;smell&#x27; for a couple of days. Yes..even after a shower. I was shocked to see the orange on my feet the NEXT day. Yes, I know how to apply the lotion.  Not a problem when I got up the next morning. However, the evening was a different story after I took my shoes off.  My feet had deep orange streaks.  I would never recommend this product. Especially when there are better products in the Designer Skin line just as reasonable in cost.  I will stay with DS.  I tan great with any of those products.  Just thought I would change it up. Big mistake!</li>
            <li> Great product and on time</li>
            <li> Great lotion for getting tough to tan areas dark</li>
            <li> I read a lot of bad reviews but some also really good! Soo I gave it a try &amp; as soon as I left the tanning bed I had orange streaks EVERYWHERE. I even applied it evenly but that did no good... it was one of the worst lotions I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This lotion left streak marks all over my body. The &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; in it is no joke. If you are looking for a natural look, this is not the way to go.</li>
            <li> love this lotion. tans you really fast and smells great. little pricey but would def reccommend it to anyone lokking for a quick tan</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Not oily what so ever.</li>
            <li> Great product, but I have to be careful that it doesn&#x27;t stain my skin around my toes and ankles....have to make sure I wipe it off after tanning.  Otherwise it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion in may of this year from amazon. Product came in 2 days because I have amazon prime. The lotion does make you much darker, possibly the darkest I have been (I have tanned in a tanning bed for 4 years now). The drawbacks of this product are that:&lt;br /&gt;1: it didn&#x27;t make me my natural brown tan color that I usually get with the tanning bed. I was a bit oranger than usual but not anything that made me look like a pumpkin. My step-mom just noticed that I was a different type of tan than I normally am.&lt;br /&gt;2: When I went swimming this summer, the parts of my body that rubbed together like the creases of my arm and armpits as well as the area around my belly ring rubbed off and left the areas white while the rest of my body was a considerable amount darker.&lt;br /&gt;3. The smell of this lotion is quite bad after tanning, but that&#x27;s really to be expected with any tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would possibly buy this again maybe for the winter, but for the summer, as I swim a lot, I would not want my tan to rub off just because I stayed wet for 45 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> I always order Smoke when I need a quick tan! This gets me really dark, but if I use it too often too many times in a row I get orangy so I switch it up! Be sure and wash your hands after tanning and rub in very well around wrist and fingers when you are applying it to body.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion very quickly. I haven&#x27;t tanned in a few months and had only had 2 sessions before receiving this lotion. After I received this I used it right away. I noticed a pretty big difference even after one use! I&#x27;ve used many different lotions and this one is by FAR my favorite!! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast, dark tan! The smell of this stuff is wonderful as well! (Not that it matters much) The only downfall is you should be somewhat an experienced tanner to use this stuff. You have to make sure you evenly apply the lotion and WASH your hands after you apply it or it will stain! It can streak if you do not apply evenly. Again, I love love love this product! I will be ordering more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Well first off - I was very impressed with the smell of the lotion. And then the lack of smell or odor after tanning. I give it a solid 10 for sure. Worked great as far as tanning goes - color is dark, not orange. I give it an 8. Now unfortunately, the bad news - it streaked! Agh! I will say I&#x27;ve only used it once and Im willing to try again but it streaked really bad and I use self tanners a lot. Didn&#x27;t expect the streaking. I&#x27;ll have to be very careful next time. And if that doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll definitely try the Smoke without bronzer. Guess you just can&#x27;t have it all?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this has really enhanced my tan and it can leave splotches of orange on your skin (even though I really try to rub it in well). However, this is the first tanning lotion I&#x27;ve bought so I have nothing to compare it too.</li>
            <li> I did not like this lotion at all. It is very streaky and did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Leaves great color and lasting. Kinda stinky afterwards but for the color and results its worth it. And Im a guy and I know my sister used it and loved it too.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I used it in high school, a good 10 yrs ago, and loved it. I was happy to find it on here for half the price. Does not streak or look orange on me as some have stated. I have tried many different lotions and this is my fave by far!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is  suppose to do.  No orange, no stain, brown brown and NO offensive smell, unlike most of my bronzers, this one is white lotion..you will love it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that is resembling the old supree products ,this is it it&#x27;s inexpensive smells good tans great</li>
            <li> This was the worst tanning lotion I have ever tried. Did not give good color at all and all I did was turn my hands orange</li>
            <li> This is by far the best bronzing lotion you can buy.... You can put it on for alittle boost like a self tanner if your feeling pale...&lt;br /&gt;Washing your hands and finger webbing is a MUST immediately after application! Don&#x27;t wait until after you tan...use atleast a baby wipe or you will regret it!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing going on and immediately afterwards....but after an hour or so I smelled like rotten canilope! It was AWFUL!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> The down side to all that bronzer is that leaves streaks/spots and stained hands. You have to be very careful during application because you wont know you have streaks until it&#x27;s too late!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion to use if you want to get dark fast. It has a lot of bronzer so it will add a little bronzer to your skin and make you look darker than you actually are. You have to be very careful with it and make sure that you run it in well and wipe your hands off after applying.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years and used many,many lotions. I just started tanning for this summer and recently bought (smoke) for the first time. The bottle is black and to me the name smoke stands out thinking wow this lotion will give me a deep dark tan. After trying it out I realized this lotion does not do nearly what it says. There are so many other lotions that are a little cheaper that give wonderful results. Iam very disappointed with my purchase but I would of never known if I would of not tried smoke out. I don&#x27;t see any reviews on the figi tanning lotion brand. Island Dreams by Figi is about $25.00 on line and it gets you brown very fast. In fact, I will use the Smoke lotion I bought so I will not waste my money. But I will soon order Island Dreams by Figi. After I get super dark from this lotion I will order Fire Walker by Figi brand also this is a super, super, super Tingler. Thank you, Brandy G from Lousiana</li>
            <li> not great but works if you have nothing else to use. wont buy again. will stick with solid black from millenium</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the Smoke Tanning Lotion. Because you have to wipe in between your fingers when using it. I&#x27;ve used other tanning lotions with bronzers that I didn&#x27;t have to wipe between my fingers when I have used them. Although, it is a good bronzer as far as the tanning.</li>
            <li> You get a great a tan with this.</li>
            <li> Great lotion and gets you dark quick!</li>
            <li> Smells good, does not stain my hands or clothing provided a base tan but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great it dont leave you oily it has a great smell and it tanned really good so yes i will be buying again</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TANNING LOTION! YOU CAN DEF TELL YOU TANNED AFTERWARDS THOUGH BUT ITS STILL WORTH BUYING FOR THE PRICE...I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT THE BRONZING ISSUE..IF YOU DONT ALREADY HAVE A GOOD BASE TAN THEN YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE STREAKY AT FIRST...BUT OVERALL I LOVE IT! THANKS</li>
            <li> Works As Advertised! Great Deal and Super Fast Shipping Thanks to Prime.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new lotion so bought this one.  Results after tanning are mediocre.  Not the instant results I was hoping for.  Works well for long term use.</li>
            <li> I hate to say I was a little disappointed in this product myself. It applies easily, does not suffer from the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; many tanning lotions have but I simply did not receive any noticeable results from this lotion that made it stand out for me. I guess everyone&#x27;s skin is different and perhaps this lotion just doesn&#x27;t suit my skin type, I would not have a problem using it again, but would not be something I would consider at top of my list.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, and seller ships very quickly! Continue buying it, but don&#x27;t even use it that often in tanning beds, I just love the self tanner it provides. I put it on after every shower for some color. Smells great. Have ordered from this seller multiple times, and receive product quickly each time.</li>
            <li> gotta be the best lotion I have ever used, lasts an extremely long time after just one use, even better if you are a regular tanner</li>
            <li> Received this product and immediately went to the tanning salon. Product is great, saw immediate results even after one use.. Product is not oily by any means, literally no residue left at all.! Product smells wonderful, but after wards gives a hint of tanning skin ( not to harsh) is tolerable. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This lotion streaks badly and makes your orange colored after a few uses.  The orange is very noticeable and I ended up stopping use after a few tans and switching to another brand.  I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> she loved the product and it saved me some money the tanning salon wanted much more for the same product</li>
            <li> Yes. This is an amazing tanning lotion smells good. You can use indoors or out. I&#x27;m getting smoking tanned!  Will be ordering this again.  I also got the brown sugar spicy black. It works good too I recommend both!</li>
            <li> Great product. Really works. Definitely would recommend for anyone wanting a deep tan,quick results and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> What a great product for an even greater price. Try getting this quality for under $100.00 at your favorite Tanning Salon. Try it you will really be amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> I have shopped around when it comes to tanning lotion. I can not tell the difference between this lotion and the expensive luxury tanning lotions other than the 40 bucks i save buying this one.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I get super dark, even in regular sun!</li>
            <li> This product has an awesome smell to it. It goes on clear and it has a very good bronzer. I received my purchase right away which i was very thankful for.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Smells great and works wonders. I saw color with the first use. Yes, you need to wash your hands after each use or it will turn them orange. If that happens I used peroxide and it came right off. Will purchase more. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> Really love how quickly it tans you. However i wanted a tan maximizer without bronzer and unfortunately this product made me a bit orange, especially between my fingers. Even though I thoroughly washed my hands before tanning. Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell. Not too fruity but it doesn&#x27;t smell old either.&lt;br /&gt;WASH YOUR HANDS thoroughly before getting in the tanning bed. Especially in the creases if your fingers. You will turn orange otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Great product I would buy it again. I got great results and only used a gold bed. I have fair skin and saw results after only 4 times tanning.</li>
            <li> I turned orange and if i didnt put it no well it left orange spots every where! Also it would stain my fingers and in between them</li>
            <li> I love the color this gives. I do not like how the color rubs off thou. great smell and again beautiful color that shows up quickly.</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion of all of them so far. I used this years ago loved it and tried it again and still love it.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> love this, absorbs nicely and i got a better color. smells good too, not too smelly. remember to have something to rinse your hands with, or u will have a little discoloration goin on :)</li>
            <li> I love this tanner. It smells great and gives a nice dark tan.&lt;br /&gt;As the other comments, yes this product will stain your hands.&lt;br /&gt;I always carry baby wipes when I go to the tanning salon for this reason.</li>
            <li> Great produce!!  Tans great!!  Arrived fast and on time!</li>
            <li> It shipped within 3 days and was everything the reviews and details set up for it to be. I was very impressed and it got me dark within two weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> This is the best and the price is great. I tried Snookie for a few months and it wasn&#x27;t any good. Made my skin dry and the color was barely there. I still love smoke best</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any major results</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good, has a lot of bronzes in it. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest someone without a base tan to use this stuff though because it may turn them orange. This isn&#x27;t gonna be an everyday tanning lotion for me simply because of how dark the bronzes are in it. Make sure you rub it in well because it will leave streaks if you aren&#x27;t careful! Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I ever bought. Noticeable tan in first use. I have fair skin and don&#x27;t even have streaking issues. I just make sure I rub it in real good.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for use at the tanning bed and out in the sun. The price of the product was awesome!</li>
            <li> Have use This two summers in a row and have gotten the best tan!&lt;br /&gt;We love it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of all the rave reviews, but am not impressed. I have a nice base tan and tan easily, but wanted to take it to the next level. I have used it 3 times in the high end beds and I see no change. I honestly think I got a fake, because it didn&#x27;t even turn my hands orange. I think I&#x27;ll try a sample packet from a salon and see if there is a difference.  If the product I purchased is the real thing, I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great. I am very pale and this really helped. Be careful as to wipe your hands well because in between my fingers got a little discolored. No big deal though, washed away in a day.</li>
            <li> Came here just on time! Don&#x27;t really like how the lotion streaks on my skin though</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for about 4-5 years and tried several lotions. This lotion smells fruity to me, and tans me great! Lotion does work super fast compared to others I have used, this time around I am tanning every other day for about a week and already seeing a significantly darker color. Warning though, even though I am experienced and I know how to rub lotion in and pay attention to key areas that say &amp;#34;I tan&amp;#34;, this lotion turns my hands orange. I noticed they remain a little orange in tougher areas of the skin- for instance my hands certain areas of palms are rough because I lift weights and even fingers are a little orange. Maybe I will give it a few shades darker and see if I continue to notice, but I&#x27;m sure after I get even darker I will not be able to notice.</li>
            <li> He simply won&#x27;t try another despite cheaper options out there.  It doesn&#x27;t tingle his skin, smells nice &amp; helps the indoor tan deepen.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works great!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and this is by far the BEST lotion for me. I will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> Very good bronzer and leaves my skin very soft!</li>
            <li> Really good I love it</li>
            <li> thsi is the best tanning lotion I have found and I have used hundreds of differents samples because my Mom owned a tanning bed. I tan very easy and in just one session I get great color.</li>
            <li> Great product. got a nice dark tan in just 3 days. smells great as well. doesn&#x27;t give you that after tan smell that other lotions do.&lt;br /&gt;definitely worth getting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of lotions from all kinds of manufactures, this is a cheaper alternative to super expensive lotions. It works great, doesn&#x27;t smell all girly, has a nice amount of bronzer to it, and its a good size bottle. I don&#x27;t tan often, I don&#x27;t have any brand loyalty, and I don&#x27;t go off price paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend manages a huge tanning salon and has all kinds of free samples to use, I tan maybe 4 times a month and always try different lotions, I tried this about 6 months ago and decided I liked it the most. It is NOT a tingle, It does not make you smell like a stripper, and it does not have rhinestones all over the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does contain some serious bronzers, so you cannot leave a bunch of lotion on your hands for hours as it will bronze your hands (duh). It has a very neutral smell, like a cocoanut smell with a little vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there better lotions out there? Yes. Is there a better value then this one? Id say no. I could use free packets of lotion forever, but this lotion is perfect for guys that don&#x27;t want to tan numerous times to get a little color and a lot of burn, once a week using this will give you a natural tan color.</li>
            <li> I feel like it worked really well at first, but now I am not really seeing any improvements. I think I am going to try a different lotion next time</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this lotion, I was convinced to buy it because I am fair skin and do not tan immediately so I need a good bronzer. It has a nice smell and pretty good bronzer. Make sure you rub it in all the way especially on elbows, knees and ankles otherwise it will leave streaks. Also, wipe your hands off after applying it-- even in between fingers because it will stain your hands and fingers! First time I used lotion, I noticed my skin was darker than usual later that night after tanning and the bronzer did NOT wash off in the shower the next day. I love the way it feels on my skin, very silky NOT sticky. It did not take long to ship maybe 3-4 days.I will probably buy this lotion again.</li>
