            <li>Very nice -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled many, trying to find the perfect one.</li>
            <li>I feel Aura Cacia products are wonderful, and their Lavender is so fine.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the experience and will order again once I run out.</li>
            <li>Lavender oil Ina&#x27;s so many great uses</li>
            <li>It seems pure and has a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing like the blend of lavender.</li>
            <li>This seller did a spectacular job of responding to me.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I will surely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>Read the description and make sure</li>
            <li>I love this lavender blend...  </li>
            <li>love this stuff and ran out to get some as soon as class was over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My friend&#x27;s love the smell when they come for a visit.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use prior to bed.</li>
            <li>Comes in handy w our new dryer balls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard before about how calming lavender is, and I&#x27;ve used other lavender products, but this particular oil smells especially amazing.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Healing your skin, soothing baths for sore muscles, mild anxiety.</li>
            <li>Lavender also promotes a feeling of love, peace and general well being.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are a connoisseur of lavender scent I would recommend that you purchase the pure Aura Cacia Lavandula augustifolia instead of this product</li>
            <li>Lavender is a very soothing scent.  </li>
            <li>universal oil has traditionally been known to balance the body and has many uses.</li>
            <li>Elizabethan times, lavender oil was rubbed into oak furniture to give it a high gloss.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you purchase this oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered straight lavender oil from this seller and when I went to reorder some more using the same link as my previous order, they switched it to a &amp;#34;lavender blend&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference in this product verses just Lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To fully experience the essence of lavender, you must normally visit a lavender farm, but this lavender essential oil will bring you closer to the purple fields swaying in the breeze and the heady aroma of sun kissed flowers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s so nice is the fact the applicator has a small hole so the oil will not pour out and be wasted.  </li>
            <li>I wanted the straight lavender oil and this is a mix of other stuff too.</li>

            <li> Without essential oils, life seems less relaxing, less mysterious, less alive.</li>

            <li> So, it&#x27;s not worth the increased price for me.</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> this past week, I noticed that the other teacher took a sniff from a little bottle in her bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with just plain Lavender.</li>

            <li> Love this. Comes in handy w our new dryer balls.</li>
            <li> We use this on your children s feet to help them sleep.</li>
            <li> I feel Aura Cacia products are wonderful, and their Lavender is so fine.  What&#x27;s so nice is the fact the applicator has a small hole so the oil will not pour out and be wasted.  All one needs is two and three droplets.  Lavender is a very soothing scent.  And the oil can also be used on minor cuts as it has a healing effect.  Enjoy.  I will surely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product. just what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing like the blend of lavender.</li>

            <li> This seller did a spectacular job of responding to me. The product arrived when promised and was as it was described. I was very pleased with the experience and will order again once I run out. Lavender oil Ina&#x27;s so many great uses and I always keep it in my house</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled many, trying to find the perfect one. Will def order this one again. I put on my pillow at night, and on my temple when I get a migraine. Must have to keep in the house.</li>

Not cool. I wanted the straight lavender oil and this is a mix of other stuff too. Not very happy with that switch up. Read the description and make sure you know what you&#x27;re ordering.</li>
            <li> I love this lavender blend...  I appreciate that it is not cut with a carrier oil.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> If you are a connoisseur of lavender scent I would recommend that you purchase the pure Aura Cacia Lavandula augustifolia instead of this product</li>
            <li> Without essential oils, life seems less relaxing, less mysterious, less alive. It is the difference between living in a world without flowers and one where you are always surrounded by fragrance and beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fully experience the essence of lavender, you must normally visit a lavender farm, but this lavender essential oil will bring you closer to the purple fields swaying in the breeze and the heady aroma of sun kissed flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This universal oil has traditionally been known to balance the body and has many uses. In ancient times, there are accounts of the use of lavender to scent the bath or laundry. Lavender essence is an efficient antiseptic and is used to treat burns and wounds. You can retain the intoxicating scent of lavender in sachets and pillows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Elizabethan times, lavender oil was rubbed into oak furniture to give it a high gloss.  British researchers found that insomniacs who sniffed lavender oil at bedtime fell asleep just as fast as those who took a heavy sedative. The scent of lavender is known to increase the brain&#x27;s alpha waves, which are associated with relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender is anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and regenerative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other uses for this oil include: Healing your skin, soothing baths for sore muscles, mild anxiety. Lavender also promotes a feeling of love, peace and general well being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Dreams ;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> This oil is incredible!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a co-teacher, and this past week, I noticed that the other teacher took a sniff from a little bottle in her bag. I asked what she was sniffing (!!!) and she said, \\&quot;Lavender oil\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I sniffed it and it smelled amaaaaaaazing and made me feel seriously relaxed almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;As the students arrived, they got curious about the oil and smelled it, too, and the class was SO MELLOW!&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and ran out to get some as soon as class was over.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard before about how calming lavender is, and I&#x27;ve used other lavender products, but this particular oil smells especially amazing.</li>
            <li> This oil caught my eye while shopping at a CVS pharmacy store. I have used this fragrance with massage oil. My friend&#x27;s love the smell when they come for a visit. For I use it in a candle disk for porch patio dinners. I highly recommend that you purchase this oil.</li>
            <li> I use it for relaxation.  I put a dab of it under my nose (as suggested by my doctor) to help reduce stress.  It&#x27;s great to use prior to bed.</li>
            <li> This lavender oil is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  It seems pure and has a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very nice - but I can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference in this product verses just Lavender essential oil. So, it&#x27;s not worth the increased price for me. I&#x27;ll stick with just plain Lavender.</li>
