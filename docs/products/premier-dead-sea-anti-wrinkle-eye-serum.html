            <li>Love this product!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s so soothing, hydrating and helps ready your eye area wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>What a nice difference it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really good for smooth the wrinkle.</li>
            <li>It also gives a very smooth feeling after putting around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the fast shipping and the bottle is beautiful, but that is about it.</li>
            <li>That said, I really love the products.</li>
            <li>It most definitely is the best eye serum I have ever tried</li>
            <li>I love this eye serum...</li>
            <li>You have to pump more than once</li>
            <li>The serum is excellent, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>and she has ordered more for herself.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than two years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years now, I love it.</li>
            <li>Just better than nothing to your your eye skin.</li>
            <li>I have used these items for many years</li>
            <li>and then what comes out is more than you need</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>a consumer rip, off over priced, drug store serums are better quality.</li>
            <li>I recommend all of their products and I have used many of them.</li>
            <li>and i love the way it absorbs into my skin i do think my eyes look better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of different eye creams/lotions/gels, and I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect one.</li>
            <li>Again, I will be better able to rate this after more continued use.</li>
            <li>and it really works and thru Amazon a great price.</li>
            <li>I give it three stars because maybe it works better for some skin types and not others.</li>
            <li>Love this serum.</li>
            <li>better then any product I ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I tried the serum&#x27;s and fell in love</li>
            <li>--I am so glad i can find them on amazon</li>
            <li>AND MAKES YOU FEEL RENEWED AND HEALTHY LOOKING SKIN.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so I have to wipe even more off with the tissue.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye serum.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad to see them go being over 40 and all.</li>
            <li>The pump doesnt work and I have to take the top off to use it.  </li>
            <li>I saw a very quick improvement in my undereyes--the lines have diminished and the area feels smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is magic, but it does reduce some of my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I love the results - temporarily erases fine lines around eye area.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and you get so much product excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li>product arrived early and in great condition.  </li>
            <li>so far I am satisfied!!</li>
            <li>Good and decent price.</li>
            <li>Will post an update if I see any improvement in fine lines around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product helps diminish any fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth, easy to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>As so many others have written, I was suckered into spending an extraordinary amount of money on Premier products at a mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>eye serum is fine and smooth.</li>
            <li>I let my sister used, she liked it so much</li>
            <li>Dead Sea products are wonderful!  </li>
            <li>This product is so smooth and silky feeling when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>The sample seemed to smooth the eye wrinkles</li>
            <li>Fantastic product</li>
            <li>Can not imagine it is so light, just like the air.</li>
            <li>I recommend that if you purchase this product, keep it out of the light.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to smooth the lines under your eyes</li>
            <li>it has been a great addition to my facial care.</li>
            <li>GOES ON SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend these products; just be sure to purchase them here!</li>
            <li>That worked &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34; and I was so excited to get the product.</li>
            <li>I love this Premier line for the face and receive compliments on my skin on how pretty it looks.  </li>
            <li>I originally got ripped off in the mall.  </li>
            <li>Really keeps my eyes smooth and reduces puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too:)</li>
            <li>But....it does seem to improve my fine lines pretty well.</li>
            <li>This product has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It came fairly quickly too.</li>
            <li>High quality and price is so much better than mall kiosks.</li>
            <li>I love spa&#x27;s and people are always asking me how I stay so young looking!!</li>
            <li>I love serums in general for the light weight silky</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I knew this is what I have been looking for!  </li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes have really improved.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to find this eye serum on Amazon after loving the Premier Eye Serum I purchased last year in Miami.  </li>
            <li>Soaks in quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth and soft not at all oily.</li>
            <li>I found the exact same product on Amazon at a much better price, but what everyone else says is true.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a few of the Premier products for a while, but the eye serum is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>but if I don&#x27;t moisturize my face well, it appears dry and not  as nice as it could.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I was amazed the first time I put it on, it really felt like silk, and no greasy residue!  </li>
            <li>I tend to try out pricier, higher quality offerings.</li>
            <li>it either doesn&#x27;t pump at all ( first bottle) or a ton comes out with each pump.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for several years and love it</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this product, I had gotten sucked in at one of those mall kiosks.  </li>
            <li>It feels light and grease free when you put it on, and it really does help to keep your face younger looking.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would live us to the full priced serum.</li>
            <li>When I push it down, a lot of product comes out, way more than needed!</li>
            <li>Same as above I bought this at the fair and paid double-triple that you charge.  </li>
            <li>I used Arbonne&#x27;s RE-9 Advanced Eye Cream before and it did not show the same improved tone and texture that this product proves to provide.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and I like that the bottle is clear so that I can see how much I have left.</li>
            <li>It was nice feeling and absorbed well, but for the money I have found products that work equally well in my local drugstore in the beauty aisle.</li>
            <li>It really helps with my fine lines and you can barely see them.</li>
            <li>You cannot control the large amount that squirts out.....</li>
            <li>This eye serum made me look older at first.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered quickly and the price was right, I saw the same thing in Vegas for three times the money.  </li>
            <li>It really does make a huge difference in the appearance of the eyes, especially helping lids to not droop.</li>
            <li>As it turned out, it wasn&#x27;t much of a chance.  </li>
            <li>The pump does not work very well.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>then you get too much product.  </li>
            <li>The serum absorbs fast and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>It feels really silky</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would work for somebody with very oily skin, though.</li>
            <li>It absorts fast and hydrates the skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>It does&#x27;t work so much.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t recommend to the one who really need to improve your eye circle area.</li>
            <li>so I feel they make my skin softer, reduce wrinkles and moisturize very well.  </li>
            <li>Its like velvet so gentle on your eye circles.</li>
            <li>The serum just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; as hydrating, or like my skin absorbs much.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t notice much if any difference.</li>
            <li>I use this product all over my whole face (except my chin)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product has really helped at all.</li>
            <li>I also thought that the bottle pumped out way too much at once.</li>
            <li>Also, (maybe because it squirts too much out)</li>
            <li>It really helps with the eye puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>(because way too much comes out of that pump) on the tops of my hands after application.</li>
            <li>and I really see a difference.</li>
            <li>The pump pumps out too much each time.  </li>
            <li>The original was over $125 for the same sized bottle but delivered visible results.  </li>
            <li>Listed in the ingredients was retinol which is great, but retinol breaks down in the sunlight, so one would think they would disclose that this product needs to be kept out of the sunlight or at least package it in a bottle that would protect it from the light.</li>
            <li>This is just a typical moisturizing serum and nothing more.  </li>
            <li>because i am getting older</li>
            <li>I love it, but wish it didn&#x27;t dispense so much at one time, a waste.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you purchase them here on Amazon, though, instead of at a mall.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Amazing product for my sensitive eyes.. and the price i unbelievable.</li>
            <li>Con - the dispenser squirts way more than you need, so just be careful and try to control it, and it will last much longer.</li>
            <li>i will reserve a complete opinion until i have used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I ultimately believe this is just a moisturizing eye product that won&#x27;t work any magic in the long run like an eye product with retinol or peptides would.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this eye serum, and I was skeptical, but they were all positive and the price was good, so I took a chance.  </li>
            <li>I do not use this eye serum as much as I should because I have found that the anti-aging biox cream and serum mixed together have really helped improve the skin under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>and you will say wow!</li>
            <li>Claims on this product are false for fast results, sure it is silky and feel great when you apply, but that&#x27;s it unfortunately, it may require months of use in order to see a difference.</li>
            <li>I use on my eyes and throat area and definitely see a positive difference.  </li>
            <li>but se this product on you whole face and especially neck....</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in early 50&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far i do like it.</li>
            <li>The pump is too big for the amount you really need.</li>
            <li>It agrees with my asthma, no heavy perfume smell and it leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>It has a soft, silky feel on your fingers and under your eyes while applying.</li>
            <li>My mother who is in her early seventies uses it as well and is also a repeat purchaser.  </li>
            <li>I thought all through my teens and early twenties that i couldn&#x27;t use any moisture because of my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and yet this product works and has not given me any problems.  </li>
            <li>Initially, the serum will smooth the under eye area, however, I find a highly emollient eye cream is also necessary lest the area will dry out soon after application.</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave only 1 stars for this product is: first it was opened, which means u can not give it as a gift and second when I opened the box serum</li>
            <li>I have used dead sea products, in fact they were the very first serum that i tried.  </li>
            <li>Not sure I would order again due to the waste experienced.</li>
            <li>a lot comes out on that one finger - a large drop because of the consistency - unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see anything it would doing to help not show fine lines</li>
            <li>This is a good product; however, it is very difficult to manage the amount of serum which squirts out of the bottle.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was pleased with the fast shipping and the bottle is beautiful, but that is about it.</li>
            <li> That said, I really love the products.</li>
            <li> It most definitely is the best eye serum I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum...</li>
            <li> You have to pump more than once</li>
            <li> The serum is excellent, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> and she has ordered more for herself.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than two years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years now, I love it.</li>
            <li> Just better than nothing to your your eye skin.</li>
            <li> I have used these items for many years</li>
            <li> and then what comes out is more than you need</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> a consumer rip, off over priced, drug store serums are better quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend all of their products and I have used many of them.</li>
            <li> and i love the way it absorbs into my skin i do think my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different eye creams/lotions/gels, and I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> Again, I will be better able to rate this after more continued use.</li>
            <li> and it really works and thru Amazon a great price.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars because maybe it works better for some skin types and not others.</li>
            <li> Love this serum.</li>
            <li> better then any product I ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I tried the serum&#x27;s and fell in love</li>
            <li> --I am so glad i can find them on amazon</li>
            <li> AND MAKES YOU FEEL RENEWED AND HEALTHY LOOKING SKIN.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so I have to wipe even more off with the tissue.  </li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this eye serum.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad to see them go being over 40 and all.</li>
            <li> The pump doesnt work and I have to take the top off to use it.  </li>
            <li> I saw a very quick improvement in my undereyes--the lines have diminished and the area feels smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is magic, but it does reduce some of my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I love the results - temporarily erases fine lines around eye area.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and you get so much product excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> product arrived early and in great condition.  </li>
            <li> so far I am satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Good and decent price.</li>
            <li> Will post an update if I see any improvement in fine lines around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product helps diminish any fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth, easy to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> As so many others have written, I was suckered into spending an extraordinary amount of money on Premier products at a mall kiosk.</li>
            <li> eye serum is fine and smooth.</li>
            <li> I let my sister used, she liked it so much</li>
            <li> Dead Sea products are wonderful!  </li>
            <li> This product is so smooth and silky feeling when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> The sample seemed to smooth the eye wrinkles</li>
            <li> Fantastic product</li>
            <li> Can not imagine it is so light, just like the air.</li>
            <li> I recommend that if you purchase this product, keep it out of the light.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to smooth the lines under your eyes</li>
            <li> it has been a great addition to my facial care.</li>
            <li> GOES ON SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend these products; just be sure to purchase them here!</li>
            <li> That worked &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34; and I was so excited to get the product.</li>
            <li> I love this Premier line for the face and receive compliments on my skin on how pretty it looks.  </li>
            <li> I originally got ripped off in the mall.  </li>
            <li> Really keeps my eyes smooth and reduces puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too:)</li>
            <li> But....it does seem to improve my fine lines pretty well.</li>
            <li> This product has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li> It came fairly quickly too.</li>
            <li> High quality and price is so much better than mall kiosks.</li>
            <li> I love spa&#x27;s and people are always asking me how I stay so young looking!!</li>
            <li> I love serums in general for the light weight silky</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I knew this is what I have been looking for!  </li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes have really improved.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to find this eye serum on Amazon after loving the Premier Eye Serum I purchased last year in Miami.  </li>
            <li> Soaks in quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth and soft not at all oily.</li>
            <li> I found the exact same product on Amazon at a much better price, but what everyone else says is true.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a few of the Premier products for a while, but the eye serum is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> but if I don&#x27;t moisturize my face well, it appears dry and not  as nice as it could.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I was amazed the first time I put it on, it really felt like silk, and no greasy residue!  </li>
            <li> I tend to try out pricier, higher quality offerings.</li>
            <li> it either doesn&#x27;t pump at all ( first bottle) or a ton comes out with each pump.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for several years and love it</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this product, I had gotten sucked in at one of those mall kiosks.  </li>
            <li> It feels light and grease free when you put it on, and it really does help to keep your face younger looking.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would live us to the full priced serum.</li>
            <li> When I push it down, a lot of product comes out, way more than needed!</li>
            <li> Same as above I bought this at the fair and paid double-triple that you charge.  </li>
            <li> I used Arbonne&#x27;s RE-9 Advanced Eye Cream before and it did not show the same improved tone and texture that this product proves to provide.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice and I like that the bottle is clear so that I can see how much I have left.</li>
            <li> It was nice feeling and absorbed well, but for the money I have found products that work equally well in my local drugstore in the beauty aisle.</li>
            <li> It really helps with my fine lines and you can barely see them.</li>
            <li> You cannot control the large amount that squirts out.....</li>
            <li> This eye serum made me look older at first.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly and the price was right, I saw the same thing in Vegas for three times the money.  </li>
            <li> It really does make a huge difference in the appearance of the eyes, especially helping lids to not droop.</li>
            <li> As it turned out, it wasn&#x27;t much of a chance.  </li>
            <li> The pump does not work very well.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> then you get too much product.  </li>
            <li> The serum absorbs fast and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> It feels really silky</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it would work for somebody with very oily skin, though.</li>
            <li> It absorts fast and hydrates the skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It does&#x27;t work so much.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t recommend to the one who really need to improve your eye circle area.</li>
            <li> so I feel they make my skin softer, reduce wrinkles and moisturize very well.  </li>
            <li> Its like velvet so gentle on your eye circles.</li>
            <li> The serum just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; as hydrating, or like my skin absorbs much.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t notice much if any difference.</li>
            <li> I use this product all over my whole face (except my chin)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product has really helped at all.</li>
            <li> I also thought that the bottle pumped out way too much at once.</li>
            <li> Also, (maybe because it squirts too much out)</li>
            <li> It really helps with the eye puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> (because way too much comes out of that pump) on the tops of my hands after application.</li>
            <li> and I really see a difference.</li>
            <li> The pump pumps out too much each time.  </li>
            <li> The original was over $125 for the same sized bottle but delivered visible results.  </li>
            <li> Listed in the ingredients was retinol which is great, but retinol breaks down in the sunlight, so one would think they would disclose that this product needs to be kept out of the sunlight or at least package it in a bottle that would protect it from the light.</li>
            <li> This is just a typical moisturizing serum and nothing more.  </li>
            <li> because i am getting older</li>
            <li> I love it, but wish it didn&#x27;t dispense so much at one time, a waste.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you purchase them here on Amazon, though, instead of at a mall.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for my sensitive eyes.. and the price i unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Con - the dispenser squirts way more than you need, so just be careful and try to control it, and it will last much longer.</li>
            <li> i will reserve a complete opinion until i have used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I ultimately believe this is just a moisturizing eye product that won&#x27;t work any magic in the long run like an eye product with retinol or peptides would.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this eye serum, and I was skeptical, but they were all positive and the price was good, so I took a chance.  </li>
            <li> I do not use this eye serum as much as I should because I have found that the anti-aging biox cream and serum mixed together have really helped improve the skin under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and you will say wow!</li>
            <li> Claims on this product are false for fast results, sure it is silky and feel great when you apply, but that&#x27;s it unfortunately, it may require months of use in order to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I use on my eyes and throat area and definitely see a positive difference.  </li>
            <li> but se this product on you whole face and especially neck....</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in early 50&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far i do like it.</li>
            <li> The pump is too big for the amount you really need.</li>
            <li> It agrees with my asthma, no heavy perfume smell and it leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> It has a soft, silky feel on your fingers and under your eyes while applying.</li>
            <li> My mother who is in her early seventies uses it as well and is also a repeat purchaser.  </li>
            <li> I thought all through my teens and early twenties that i couldn&#x27;t use any moisture because of my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and yet this product works and has not given me any problems.  </li>
            <li> Initially, the serum will smooth the under eye area, however, I find a highly emollient eye cream is also necessary lest the area will dry out soon after application.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave only 1 stars for this product is: first it was opened, which means u can not give it as a gift and second when I opened the box serum</li>
            <li> I have used dead sea products, in fact they were the very first serum that i tried.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I would order again due to the waste experienced.</li>
            <li> a lot comes out on that one finger - a large drop because of the consistency - unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see anything it would doing to help not show fine lines</li>
            <li> This is a good product; however, it is very difficult to manage the amount of serum which squirts out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and absolutely cannot get a small &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Each bottle last a long time and it works well.  </li>
            <li> And they do last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It is hard to grade how much you want to pump.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very greasy and hard to get patted in</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> By the time I discovered that it might contain retinol it had been in the light for months, so even if it did have any, it had broken down already.</li>
            <li> I have really started to show my age the past few years, and this stuff makes me feel like a did before when I looked 10 years younger than I am.  </li>
            <li> It totally lives up to its name and I plan to purchase it again and to try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> It is oily, but I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a tendency toward dry eyelids.</li>
            <li> The eye area is so delicate, and you have to be careful how much you apply around it to prevent those pesky bumps that surface.</li>
            <li> The pump on this particular serum doesn&#x27;t work well (maybe because the serum is quite thick).  </li>
            <li> The only downside I can think of is that the nozzle is tight, so when I want to use it, I have to push so hard that I get too much, not just a drop or two.  </li>
            <li> and I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I changed it to simply put on this eye serum, and then the eye cream (Premier Dead Sea).</li>
            <li> I have used it for only a few weeks now, and it seems to have helped my droopy-looking lids already.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the Premier Dead Sea products.</li>
            <li> really not seeing a difference using it.</li>
            <li> Other eye creams I have used seem to &amp;</li>
            <li> I am in my late thirties and It really helps to take away the under eye circles and firm up skin without feeling too greasy or stiff when applied.  </li>
            <li> You can remove swollen, dark circles without skin problems.  </li>
            <li> I love the product but hate the pump.</li>
            <li> this helped my eyes look less baggy when used with the DS eye</li>
            <li> Less wrinkles under eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I do have a few wrinkles</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under my eyes went away after about 4 weeks of using this serum everyday.  </li>
            <li> I had used it another few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Like the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; component is missing.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and does not give you a heavy greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Too much is wasted.</li>
            <li> thats really sad, coz every time I order something they have various problems!</li>
            <li> The skin feels firmer and it does mask small creases.</li>
            <li> I bought this believing that there would be a at least a small difference after using it a few weeks on small lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is quite difficult to only pump out in one press a small amount for use around eyes.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product but glad that I didn&#x27;t pay the ridiculous price at the mall.</li>
            <li> amount out, hard as I try.  </li>
            <li> once you get some on your fingers it is impossible to just get a little and as other reviews say the push spout causes you to waste the product</li>
            <li> But once I&#x27;d been using the Premier Dead Sea Anti-Wrinkle Eye Serum for about a month, I noticed that my eyes weren&#x27;t looking as tired anymore.  </li>
            <li> &amp; now I&#x27;ve found it for MUCH cheaper than at that annoying kiosk.</li>
            <li> not a good product design at all.</li>
            <li> All in all, not a good experience.</li>
            <li> Sadly, there is something seriously lacking in both the feel and efficacy of this product.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m without this eye serum, people tell me I look tired!</li>
            <li> Unless I got a fake one, this product is completely useless.</li>
            <li> Then my husband accidentally broke the REALLY expensive bottle.  </li>
            <li> I put this in the frig to apply cold and it works well in the morning.</li>
            <li> If anything it causes your undereye concealer to crack like crazy.</li>
            <li> no visible results found&lt;br /&gt;pump very difficult to use keeps getting stuck</li>
            <li> I find it extremely annoying that the company chooses to hide what is in the product.</li>
            <li> and I have tried lots of them ranging from inexpensive to very expensive!</li>
            <li> the dispenser is HORRIBLE!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works amazingly well under eyes as well as on mouth wrinkles.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave only 1 stars for this product is: first it was opened, which means u can not give it as a gift and second when I opened the box serum was spilled. thats really sad, coz every time I order something they have various problems!</li>
            <li> As so many others have written, I was suckered into spending an extraordinary amount of money on Premier products at a mall kiosk. That said, I really love the products. And they do last for a very long time. I highly recommend that you purchase them here on Amazon, though, instead of at a mall. I also use the Aromatherapy Para-Pharmaceutical Exfoliating and Cleansing Facial Gel, the Milk Cleanser, several of the masks, and the Obey Your Body body scrub. The body scrub is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. All in all, I highly recommend these products; just be sure to purchase them here!</li>
            <li> Amazing product for my sensitive eyes.. and the price i unbelievable.I would recommend for everybody.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This is just a typical moisturizing serum and nothing more.  It does not do what it promises.</li>
            <li> Does not work like the application done to my eyes at a mall.  That worked &amp;#34;instantly&amp;#34; and I was so excited to get the product. I think the product applied to my face was NOT the same as I ordered.</li>
            <li> I love the product and was very happy with this vendor.  It was here within a week. I had ordered from them before and they didn&#x27;t dissapoint me.</li>
            <li> Love this eye serum!! It&#x27;s truely the best!! I love spa&#x27;s and people are always asking me how I stay so young looking!! I do have a few wrinkles but once I place the eye serum on my eyes in a matter of minutes they disappear and stay that way !! Amazon has great pricing compare to the malls!! This eye serum is a amazing blessing!!</li>
            <li> This is great for fine lines around eyes!  It works!  Takes a couple of weeks to notice, but it&#x27;s there!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  The first time I tried it, I knew this is what I have been looking for!  It most definitely is the best eye serum I have ever tried and I have tried lots of them ranging from inexpensive to very expensive!</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum...it actually works! I also love that I was able to get it at a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this eye serum, and I was skeptical, but they were all positive and the price was good, so I took a chance.  As it turned out, it wasn&#x27;t much of a chance.  This stuff is a miracle.  You don&#x27;t use it for weeks before you get results.  They are almost immediate.  I have really started to show my age the past few years, and this stuff makes me feel like a did before when I looked 10 years younger than I am.  I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.  Con - the dispenser squirts way more than you need, so just be careful and try to control it, and it will last much longer.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It really does make a huge difference in the appearance of the eyes, especially helping lids to not droop.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed for under the eyes but se this product on you whole face and especially neck.... and you will say wow!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under my eyes went away after about 4 weeks of using this serum everyday.  I can tell if I skip a day or two of not using it.  This eye serum is perfect for puffy under-eyes and for maintaining a smoothness under your eye.</li>
            <li> Initially, the serum will smooth the under eye area, however, I find a highly emollient eye cream is also necessary lest the area will dry out soon after application. Four stars because the effects are not cumulative.</li>
            <li> The pump does not work very well.It is hard to grade how much you want to pump. A larger  amount than neede comes out with each pumping.  Otherwise the product seems to work well and to reduce my eye puffiness as claimed</li>
            <li> I really, really like this serum.  It&#x27;s so soothing, hydrating and helps ready your eye area wonderfully.  The pump on this particular serum doesn&#x27;t work well (maybe because the serum is quite thick).  You have to pump more than once then you get too much product.  I just open the bottle and retrieve what I need and forgo the pump on some days.  The serum is excellent, especially for the price.  Will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs fast and is not greasy. However I don&#x27;t like the dispenser. When I push it down, a lot of product comes out, way more than needed!</li>
            <li> Been using it about 6 weeks.  I see no difference at all in the area around my eyes.  (I&#x27;m in early 50&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using this until it&#x27;s gone.  Will post an update if I see any improvement in fine lines around eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  it&#x27;s now Nov 7, 2014.  I had used it another few weeks.  Nothing.  No improvement in my skin/fine lines whatsoever.</li>
            <li> this helped my eyes look less baggy when used with the DS eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;I  keep buying this product since I think it helps.</li>
            <li> product arrived early and in great condition.  i use it every morning and every evening. i will reserve a complete opinion until i have used the whole bottle. so far i do like it.</li>
            <li> Used this religiously for a month and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement. It feels really silky but I&#x27;m not going to pay a ton of money for that.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is magic, but it does reduce some of my fine lines.  It also gives a very smooth feeling after putting around my eyes.  I let my sister used, she liked it so much and she has ordered more for herself.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than two years.  Each bottle last a long time and it works well.  It is oily, but I have dry skin.  I don&#x27;t know how it would work for somebody with very oily skin, though.</li>
            <li> This eye serum made me look older at first. I later realized it&#x27;s because I put it over my Shiseido moisturizer, which made it too \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;. I changed it to simply put on this eye serum, and then the eye cream (Premier Dead Sea). What a nice difference it made!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye serum is fine and smooth. It absorts fast and hydrates the skin around the eyes. I think it actually reduces the wrinkles around my eyes. I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The pump is too big for the amount you really need. I changed it to a smaller pump. Now it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years now, I love it. It agrees with my asthma, no heavy perfume smell and it leaves my skin feeling so soft. The fine lines around my eyes have really improved. The product was delivered quickly and the price was right, I saw the same thing in Vegas for three times the money.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I use this around my eyes at bedtime.  Soaks in quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth and soft not at all oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it has done anything for my eyes and the dispenser is HORRIBLE! You cannot control the large amount that squirts out.....not a good product design at all.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye serums out. It really helps with my fine lines and you can barely see them.</li>
            <li> It does&#x27;t work so much. Just better than nothing to your your eye skin. I won&#x27;t recommend to the one who really need to improve your eye circle area.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea products are wonderful!  I have used these items for many years and I have very dry skin so I feel they make my skin softer, reduce wrinkles and moisturize very well.  High quality and price is so much better than mall kiosks.</li>
            <li> I have been using a few of the Premier products for a while, but the eye serum is definitely the best. It has a soft, silky feel on your fingers and under your eyes while applying. It took me about 4 days to start noticing the change under my eyes and on the lids. The skin feels firmer and it does mask small creases. I&#x27;ve noticed that it works best on me for my eye lids. I&#x27;m beginning to droop quite a bit and may need a Bletchley at some point, but this serum does straighten them out a bit.</li>
            <li> this is the best eye serum i&#x27;ve ever used.Its like velvet so gentle on your eye circles.I highly recommend this product and you get so much product excellent value for the price.I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> no visible results found&lt;br /&gt;pump very difficult to use keeps getting stuck and then what comes out is more than you need&lt;br /&gt;very wasteful</li>
            <li> I put this in the frig to apply cold and it works well in the morning. Wakes me up and soothes the under eyes.</li>
            <li> Same as above I bought this at the fair and paid double-triple that you charge.  I&#x27;ll be buying from you now on.  I love this product</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as I thought it would. I would not purchase again. My neighbor and I purchased this item and we do not see a difference</li>
            <li> I bought this believing that there would be a at least a small difference after using it a few weeks on small lines around my eyes. Claims on this product are false for fast results, sure it is silky and feel great when you apply, but that&#x27;s it unfortunately, it may require months of use in order to see a difference.</li>
            <li> This product is so smooth and silky feeling when I put it on.  I have used it for only a few weeks now, and it seems to have helped my droopy-looking lids already.  I was amazed the first time I put it on, it really felt like silk, and no greasy residue!  Other eye creams I have used seem to &amp;#34;cake up&amp;#34;, or even wear off after only a short time, but this product lasts all day!  The only downside I can think of is that the nozzle is tight, so when I want to use it, I have to push so hard that I get too much, not just a drop or two.  The packaging is nice and I like that the bottle is clear so that I can see how much I have left.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to find this eye serum on Amazon after loving the Premier Eye Serum I purchased last year in Miami.  The original was over $125 for the same sized bottle but delivered visible results.  I was hoping this product would live us to the full priced serum. Sadly, there is something seriously lacking in both the feel and efficacy of this product.  Like the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; component is missing.  Will not be reordering this in the future.  It did arrive promptly and very nicely presented.</li>
            <li> a consumer rip, off over priced, drug store serums are better quality. I would not recommend the product, maybe for hand lotion.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bottle purchased.  I love the results - temporarily erases fine lines around eye area. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this serum!  Been using it for a few years now.  Really keeps my eyes smooth and reduces puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too:)</li>
            <li> I have a tendency toward dry eyelids. This product has helped tremendously.  I recommend all of their products and I have used many of them.</li>
            <li> because i am getting older i need all the help i can get the eye serum seems to be working and i love the way it absorbs into my skin i do think my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> So happy with this serum, spectacular, every woman should use it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different eye creams/lotions/gels, and I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect one. I tend to try out pricier, higher quality offerings. This one ranks low on my list. The serum just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; as hydrating, or like my skin absorbs much. I also don&#x27;t notice much if any difference. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this while visiting at a mall in AK.  The sample seemed to smooth the eye wrinkles so I decided to keep using it.  Again, I will be better able to rate this after more continued use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product however like many people say-- the pump doesn&#x27;t work-- it either doesn&#x27;t pump at all ( first bottle) or a ton comes out with each pump. Not sure I would order again due to the waste experienced.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I saw a very quick improvement in my undereyes--the lines have diminished and the area feels smoother and more hydrated. It totally lives up to its name and I plan to purchase it again and to try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for several years and love it and it really works and thru Amazon a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39, I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but if I don&#x27;t moisturize my face well, it appears dry and not  as nice as it could. I use this product all over my whole face (except my chin) and I look dewy but not too oily. My  makeup sets on my face so well. One squirt is enough. I look 5 years younger. There is no smell whatsoever either. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product has really helped at all. I was pleased with the fast shipping and the bottle is beautiful, but that is about it. I give it three stars because maybe it works better for some skin types and not others. I also thought that the bottle pumped out way too much at once. I now open the lid to get some out.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this product, I had gotten sucked in at one of those mall kiosks.  When I researched the product I almost fainted at the price difference.  But once I&#x27;d been using the Premier Dead Sea Anti-Wrinkle Eye Serum for about a month, I noticed that my eyes weren&#x27;t looking as tired anymore.  I continued to faithfully use it twice a day &amp; I contined to see results.  I like this product.  It seems to work for me &amp; now I&#x27;ve found it for MUCH cheaper than at that annoying kiosk.</li>
            <li> This serum works great.  This is the second bottle I have used and I plan to continue.  I am in my late thirties and It really helps to take away the under eye circles and firm up skin without feeling too greasy or stiff when applied.  My mother who is in her early seventies uses it as well and is also a repeat purchaser.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this at night with the cream. Fantastic product</li>
            <li> I like it very much. The price is very attractive. Can not imagine it is so light, just like the air.</li>
            <li> It was nice feeling and absorbed well, but for the money I have found products that work equally well in my local drugstore in the beauty aisle.</li>
            <li> I had been given a demonstration with this product and I have to admit that it was amazing when they used it on me.  But when I received my order, I didn&#x27;t notice ANY difference after using it for over a month.  Very disappointed in the product but glad that I didn&#x27;t pay the ridiculous price at the mall.</li>
            <li> This product helps diminish any fine lines around my eyes. The bottle will last you for eternity, even if you use quite a bit of product. I ultimately believe this is just a moisturizing eye product that won&#x27;t work any magic in the long run like an eye product with retinol or peptides would. I find it extremely annoying that the company chooses to hide what is in the product. After a thorough internet search I found a site that listed the ingredients; although whether they were the actual ones I wouldn&#x27;t know. Listed in the ingredients was retinol which is great, but retinol breaks down in the sunlight, so one would think they would disclose that this product needs to be kept out of the sunlight or at least package it in a bottle that would protect it from the light. By the time I discovered that it might contain retinol it had been in the light for months, so even if it did have any, it had broken down already. I recommend that if you purchase this product, keep it out of the light. And consider a company that will actually list the ingredients you&#x27;re paying to put on your face.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Will buy more when I run out!! It is so smooth, easy to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> Very good product, came on time, and works miracles for the eyes! I have been using it for a long time. Thank you</li>
            <li> I do not use this eye serum as much as I should because I have found that the anti-aging biox cream and serum mixed together have really helped improve the skin under my eyes.  This serum is very smooth and makes your skin feel wonderful.  I was sold this serum to use on my lips, which I have done.  I definitely recommend the Premier Dead Sea products.</li>
            <li> so far I am satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Good and decent price. My wrinkles have been les after using for a month. Will buy after this one is finished</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m without this eye serum, people tell me I look tired! Not so when I apply it in the morning.I &#x27;m not a big cosmetics consumer, but I&#x27;m never without this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my third time buy this. Quite a good product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good for smooth the wrinkle. better then any product I ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Will come back for it.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order of this eye serum.  I use on my eyes and throat area and definitely see a positive difference.  I love this Premier line for the face and receive compliments on my skin on how pretty it looks.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Unless I got a fake one, this product is completely useless. I used it patiently for 2 months and nothing. I don&#x27;t know what people are raving about. If anything it causes your undereye concealer to crack like crazy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and has helped to reduce the wrinkles around my eyes and makes my face feel good.</li>
            <li> I have used dead sea products, in fact they were the very first serum that i tried.  I thought all through my teens and early twenties that i couldn&#x27;t use any moisture because of my oily skin.  I tried the serum&#x27;s and fell in love--I am so glad i can find them on amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few weeks and I can see some improvement in my under eye area.  It feels so good putting it on and I can see improvement.  Not a miracle product but I do believe it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> really not seeing a difference using it.</li>
            <li> once you get some on your fingers it is impossible to just get a little and as other reviews say the push spout causes you to waste the product - I put mine in another jar hoping I wouldn&#x27;t waste it so fast, but each time I put my finger into it a lot comes out on that one finger - a large drop because of the consistency - unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see anything it would doing to help not show fine lines - it does feel good putting it on and nice looking jar - just doesn&#x27;t work well and couldn&#x27;t see any difference - it&#x27;s a sort of glycerin consistency.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to smooth the lines under your eyes it has been a great addition to my facial care.</li>
            <li> WISH I WOULD HAVE HAD IT TO USE YEARS AGO. GOES ON SMOOTHLY AND MAKES YOU FEEL RENEWED AND HEALTHY LOOKING SKIN.</li>
            <li> Helped to diminish the aging bags under my eyes. I love it.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;spigot&amp;#34; cannot be regulated.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and absolutely cannot get a small &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; amount out, hard as I try.  So, I end up wiping 2/3rds off on a tissue.  Also, (maybe because it squirts too much out) it&#x27;s very greasy and hard to get patted in so I have to wipe even more off with the tissue.  All in all, not a good experience.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best serum you will ever find! It feels light and grease free when you put it on, and it really does help to keep your face younger looking. It moisturizes and does not give you a heavy greasy feeling. I love this product!</li>
            <li> The pump needs to be redesigned. It is quite difficult to only pump out in one press a small amount for use around eyes.  Too much is wasted.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It has done wonders for my eyes. My wrinkles are diminishing and my eyes are brighter.</li>
            <li> The quality is great. It really helps with the eye puffiness and wrinkles. It is easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> This is a good product; however, it is very difficult to manage the amount of serum which squirts out of the bottle.  I have yet to find the best way to regulate the amount that comes out when you press the top.  I may not order it again because of that.</li>
            <li> A very good product. I love it, but wish it didn&#x27;t dispense so much at one time, a waste.  Will definitely buy again…works!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Great for night time use.</li>
            <li> Best eye serum I ever used</li>
            <li> I see a difference under my eyes. Less wrinkles under eyes. Not greasy either. I would recomend this product. It came fairly quickly too.</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum. I love serums in general for the light weight silky feel they provide. The eye area is so delicate, and you have to be careful how much you apply around it to prevent those pesky bumps that surface. You can&#x27;t get rid of those bumps! This serum is so silky I use the remainder (because way too much comes out of that pump) on the tops of my hands after application. My eye area is firmer and hydrated through out the day. I use it morning and night, religiously and I really see a difference. I used Arbonne&#x27;s RE-9 Advanced Eye Cream before and it did not show the same improved tone and texture that this product proves to provide. My wrinkles are going away and I&#x27;m really glad to see them go being over 40 and all.</li>
            <li> I originally got ripped off in the mall.  Then my husband accidentally broke the REALLY expensive bottle.  I found the exact same product on Amazon at a much better price, but what everyone else says is true.  The pump pumps out too much each time.  But....it does seem to improve my fine lines pretty well.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at a kiosk at the mall. The price there was double what was charged at this site. Good product for around the under eye. Very happy and would recommend to anyone..wish I used it years ago.</li>
            <li> You can remove swollen, dark circles without skin problems.  I have sensitive skin and yet this product works and has not given me any problems.  I have now used it daily for two years and it is still working.</li>
            <li> The pump doesnt work and I have to take the top off to use it.  I love the product but hate the pump.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Bought it in a kiosk at the mall for a lot more, and then found it on-line!</li>
