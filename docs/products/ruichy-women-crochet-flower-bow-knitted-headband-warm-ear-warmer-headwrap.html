            <li>/&gt;Especially for those who love, it is very suitable.</li>
            <li>Amy 2015/5/13 15:43:17&lt;br /&gt;Little, my huge head, but great value and work.</li>
            <li>Good quality and cheap price!&lt;br</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re shopping for one of these for a child, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li>Pretty and good quality,</li>
            <li>This is great to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t fit my head.</li>
            <li>it just about fit her head.</li>
            <li>I have really liked these for my cutomers they seem to fit really well for everyone.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair out of your face and clean</li>
            <li>I use my headband to cleanse my face &amp; when when I apply my make up for those special party occasions.  </li>
            <li>Wrap under chin and velco at top of head to avoid mouth breathing by keeping mouth closed during sleep. :)</li>
            <li>the idea is great but its really really small...</li>
            <li>It works as expected and it comes with nice fabric.</li>
            <li>Fell apart first time in wash</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>pretty much self explanatory.</li>
            <li>This works very will for my face.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I do have a bigger head &#x3D;^&#x3D; , but when I tried it on my bf&#x27;s head, it fits, but it&#x27;s tight.</li>
            <li>I can clean my face with ease knowing that my hair will not get wet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is adult size</li>
            <li>I even tried it on my 9 year old when she was washing her face..</li>
            <li>I find that I have to push it down around my forehead to get it to fit and by that point, it defeats the purpose of pushing my hair back because it extends further than my hair!</li>

    <ol>

            <li> If u hVe a big head it won&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It works as expected and it comes with nice fabric. This is a need for all girly girls out there. Great product!</li>
            <li> Good but I got it too late after 3 months of my order!</li>
            <li> Fell apart first time in wash</li>
            <li> Amy 2015/5/13 15:43:17&lt;br /&gt;Little, my huge head, but great value and work. Good quality and cheap price!&lt;br /&gt;Especially for those who love, it is very suitable.</li>
            <li> This is great to use on a daily basis. I use my headband to cleanse my face &amp; when when I apply my make up for those special party occasions.  I recommend this to all my friends &amp; family.</li>
            <li> I had to re-sew the velcro strip on it after about two&lt;br /&gt;uses.&lt;br /&gt;But the item is good to keep hair out of the face.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t fit my head. To be honest, I do have a bigger head &#x3D;^&#x3D; , but when I tried it on my bf&#x27;s head, it fits, but it&#x27;s tight. And my bf has a smaller head. I don&#x27;t think this is adult size</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. My hair still gets wet while washing my face.</li>
            <li> the idea is great but its really really small...I even tried it on my 9 year old when she was washing her face..it just about fit her head.</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician and I use headbands 6 days a week. I have really liked these for my cutomers they seem to fit really well for everyone. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Child-sized.  Pretty and good quality, but I can&#x27;t imagine that any grown women could get this around their heads.  If you&#x27;re shopping for one of these for a child, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and met all my expectations.  It can also be used as a snore aide.  Wrap under chin and velco at top of head to avoid mouth breathing by keeping mouth closed during sleep. :)</li>
            <li> I have an average sized head and this does not fit me very well. I find that I have to push it down around my forehead to get it to fit and by that point, it defeats the purpose of pushing my hair back because it extends further than my hair!</li>
            <li> I wish it was just a little longer.</li>
            <li> Perfect for washing face or getting massages. It keeps your hair out of your face and clean</li>
            <li> This works very will for my face. I can clean my face with ease knowing that my hair will not get wet.</li>
            <li> Perfect to do your makeup and/or wash your face! Really like it!</li>
