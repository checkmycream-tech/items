    <ol>
            <li>followed the instructions on how to use the gel peel serum, and after 1 month of using it, I don&#x27;t have any pimples on my chin or forehead anymore, my skin looks great, and I am not breaking out anymore.</li>
            <li>(probably because I am still using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>the bright side the service was great.</li>
            <li>She immediately liked it because of the feeling of it drying out the bacteria.  </li>
            <li>As an over-the-counter salicylic acid, there are reasonable limits for peel agents and one must discover how to best use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to put this on my face and for five minutes no burn, nothing and then 10 mins still nothing, then i even layered it and still nothing.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional salycilic acid peels at salons and they are amazing at peeling through the top layer of skin to expose the newer skin underneath -- and also great at stopping acne.</li>
            <li>and then the most extensive set of instructions ever - I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Best results come from leaving it on the skin for a longer time, up to about ten minutes, and from repeated use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this gel serum.</li>
            <li>Better than a trip to the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with any type of peel product -- I can honestly say that I am impressed so far with my results after just one use!  </li>
            <li>Great product that I would be willing to pay full price</li>
            <li>Great product that I would be willing to pay full price for.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking to improve their skin and feel good!</li>
            <li>to apply and easy to remove from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;*Seemed to bring a couple whiteheads to the surface; this is not a con because I believe that this is part of the cleaning/unclogging pores process.&lt;br /&gt;*Does</li>
            <li>I love to use a mild soap, even baby shampoo, and follow up with the gel cream by philosophy.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t expect to see fast improvements, but the serum really works great.</li>
            <li>It is effective for me, gentle in comparison to others I have tried, and I would concur that this is indeed a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality.</li>

            <li>While this product is not as good as a professional peel, it did make my skin noticably smoother and also helped stop breakouts.</li>
            <li>but I did receive an email with tips and useful information; I was able to find a very useful guide online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth, bright, and years younger.</li>
            <li>so they are trying to fool people into thinking it some special ingredient.</li>
            <li>It really helps to be able to see the step-by-step, even though the included instructions are thorough.</li>
            <li>The tingle starts in about 15 seconds, as you hit a full minute you can&#x27;t wait to get it off</li>
            <li>I choose I am writing this review, because I love this product so much.  </li>
            <li>I received my refund very quickly, but I must say I would have preferred positive results any day over a refund.</li>
            <li>Be sure to carefully rinse it from the skin, making sure to keep it out of the eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally, I feel that I may need a stronger solution, however this is great for quick touchups - especially if you can&#x27;t afford to have any downtime after a peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;*Skin</li>
            <li>This is a healthy way to shed skin and generate new skin without burning and much redness.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have seen a remarkable difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I am also in my early forties, so fine lines are an issue.  </li>
            <li>I decided to return my product, because my guts was telling me that most likely</li>
            <li>followed the directions (to apply it) from the video posted by another customer - very helpful!  </li>
            <li>All the good reviews made it seem so promising, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work on my African American Brown skin.</li>
            <li>I would not say that it made a huge difference after the first use, but I did see some overall positive results.</li>
            <li>This is a good-quality salicylic acid peel and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a mild, at-home facial treatment to reveal fresh skin.  </li>
            <li>I was very alarmed, though that there are NO instructions or cautions on the label or included.</li>
            <li>I really hope it will continue its popularity.  </li>
            <li>This product allows the customer to control how light they make their skin, so I can still have my freckles, but the big spots that come with age are gone.  </li>
            <li>did not see a real difference</li>
            <li>I also found the review from the customer who included the video to be extremely helpful, so she deserves many thanks.</li>
            <li>not burn the skin or tingle very much; I was easily able to tolerate it for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;*No downtime needed - can be applied a few hours before an event without worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It will most likely (it does for me) leave some residual redness as this is indeed a chemical peel, which indicates it is penetrating the skin, so you do not want to do this immediately before a special ocassion, before work, or any other event.</li>
            <li>Not only did I save money, my skin is super vibrant.  </li>
            <li>As you&#x27;ll see in the video there are quite a few supplies needed, but it&#x27;s easy to apply and very gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this product also has an ingredient in called peg-8 which is ethylene glycol which is anti-freeze which is highly toxic to humans and animals.</li>
            <li>Unless you like putting anti-freeze on your face I would highly recommend staying away from this product.</li>
            <li>Each time I noticed clear, smooth, rejuvenated skin after the initial removal and cool down.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo20FDP4Q94FDWR]]I created a video to demonstrate the use of this product - for those who are new to peels or just want to see how it all works.</li>
            <li>We left it on for over 5 minutes on the first try, although I don&#x27;t suggest this for everybody.  </li>
            <li>This peel is the first one I have used where people look at me and ask what I have done differently.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok, it only helped a little with exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Real face peel will frost your skin over in 5 min., comes with documentation- real drug warnings and must be carefully rinsed off.</li>
            <li>It has taken me a while to submit the review as this is a sensitive product</li>
            <li>Either way, I did receive the instructions via email and they were clear, concise, and met my expectations for a skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vital to use a sunscreen</li>
            <li>This is a professional grade treatment for $30.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a mild peel, but I would recommend testing it on the inner arm before applying it to the face and be careful to keep it away from the eyes.  </li>
            <li>not seem to provide a major difference in scars or breakouts after just one use; however, my breakouts are hormonally induced (under the skin - do not come to a head)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to see a major difference.</li>

            <li> Some peeling around my nose but not major wrinkle improvement.</li>

            <li> so I, like the customer in the video, may have developed a slight tolerance to the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; sensation, so I left the serum on slightly longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> oily, acne-prone, lots of deep scars from under-the-skin hormonal breakouts due to PCOS.</li>
            <li> Diets and other things didn&#x27;t work, and I was constantly looking for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it was very long.</li>
            <li> And, I turned down a friend&#x27;s invite to go to a botox facial party.  </li>
            <li> I had to look up instructions on the Internet for similar products and am not sure if I used it properly.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li> which was about what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I used it for my chin and forehead, where I keep breaking out, for some unknown reason.</li>
            <li> I even tried using this product every other day and still no indication of even a slight change or improvement, or peeling, literally nothing.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d want to do this on a day where you have down time, time to relax, or plan to be doing something mellow.</li>
            <li> I truly was hoping this product would burn and peel the black spot I had on my face</li>
            <li> Yes, my wrinkles are less visible too.</li>
            <li> It produces a slight stinging sensation as expected with a chemical peel, but it is not overly irritating.</li>
            <li> helps some on small blemishes and not much more, I wont buy again</li>
            <li> Now I am back to the drawing board trying to find a remedy for my STUBBORN dark spot on my face. :(</li>
            <li> When I complained about the lack of instructions and my concerns, I received a phone call</li>
            <li> I find this product very hard to use.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product.</li>
            <li> Fake fake product.</li>
            <li> I think this product is particularly dangerous to ship to customers without instructions.</li>
            <li> I tested this product on my niece as she suffers from acne.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that I had go find instructions.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I truly was hoping this product would burn and peel the black spot I had on my face but it didn&#x27;t. All the good reviews made it seem so promising, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work on my African American Brown skin. I was able to put this on my face and for five minutes no burn, nothing and then 10 mins still nothing, then i even layered it and still nothing. Can you imagine I didn&#x27;t even need to wash it off?  and still nothing!  I even tried using this product every other day and still no indication of even a slight change or improvement, or peeling, literally nothing. I decided to return my product, because my guts was telling me that most likely my waiting in anticipation to see results will be in vain. I received my refund very quickly, but I must say I would have preferred positive results any day over a refund. Now I am back to the drawing board trying to find a remedy for my STUBBORN dark spot on my face. :( Maybe a stronger peel? Idk, I think I&#x27;m gonna try TCA instead now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side the service was great.</li>
            <li> I find this product very hard to use. It comes with no directions. Went I did get the directions it was very long. But it does work, that&#x27;s  the reason I gave it a three star.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. It has taken me a while to submit the review as this is a sensitive product and I wanted to give it sufficient time ( based on instructions) before I came to a conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;  I noticed someone mentioned the lack of instructions, and I also neglected to realize I had immediately received instructions via email until I did a search in my &amp;#34;junk mail&amp;#34; and found that it had been sent out immediately upon ordering. I have not gone back and re-read the product description, but if that is not mentioned, I would suggest it be included so the customer knows to look for it. Additionally, it may be beneficial to email it one or two days after the initial order, perhaps on the expected delivery date. Either way, I did receive the instructions via email and they were clear, concise, and met my expectations for a skin product.&lt;br /&gt;  I also found the review from the customer who included the video to be extremely helpful, so she deserves many thanks. It really helps to be able to see the step-by-step, even though the included instructions are thorough. I followed the lead of the video review. I cleansed my skin, applied the serum, and removed without hassle. I have done a chemical peel before, and so I, like the customer in the video, may have developed a slight tolerance to the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; sensation, so I left the serum on slightly longer than recommended. Your mileage may vary. I have repeated this cycle 3 separate times. Each time I noticed clear, smooth, rejuvenated skin after the initial removal and cool down. It will most likely (it does for me) leave some residual redness as this is indeed a chemical peel, which indicates it is penetrating the skin, so you do not want to do this immediately before a special ocassion, before work, or any other event. You&#x27;d want to do this on a day where you have down time, time to relax, or plan to be doing something mellow. All in all I find this to be what it is promised. It is effective for me, gentle in comparison to others I have tried, and I would concur that this is indeed a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality. Great product that I would be willing to pay full price for.is promised.

            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional salycilic acid peels at salons and they are amazing at peeling through the top layer of skin to expose the newer skin underneath -- and also great at stopping acne. While this product is not as good as a professional peel, it did make my skin noticably smoother and also helped stop breakouts. I was very alarmed, though that there are NO instructions or cautions on the label or included. I had to look up instructions on the Internet for similar products and am not sure if I used it properly. I think this product is particularly dangerous to ship to customers without instructions. I could recommend only with instructions -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************** UPDATE - 3/29/14 ****************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to change it from three to five stars.  When I complained about the lack of instructions and my concerns, I received a phone call and then the most extensive set of instructions ever - I was very impressed.  Oh, and getting compliments on my skin .... it must be working.</li>
            <li> This salicylic acid serum from Aveya Beauty comes in a 1 oz. glass bottle with a dropper.  It has a pH of 2.0, an acidity similar to that of lemon juice.  It also contains ingredients to aid in application and to moisturize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a mild peel, but I would recommend testing it on the inner arm before applying it to the face and be careful to keep it away from the eyes.  It can be applied with a fingertip or cotton swab.  It produces a slight stinging sensation as expected with a chemical peel, but it is not overly irritating. Be sure to carefully rinse it from the skin, making sure to keep it out of the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves the skin feeling and looking renewed and refreshed rather than burnt.  Best results come from leaving it on the skin for a longer time, up to about ten minutes, and from repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveya Beauty provided a sample for testing and evaluation.  This is a good-quality salicylic acid peel and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a mild, at-home facial treatment to reveal fresh skin.  It could also be used to soften calluses or corns and remove warts.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo20FDP4Q94FDWR]]I created a video to demonstrate the use of this product - for those who are new to peels or just want to see how it all works. My skin type: oily, acne-prone, lots of deep scars from under-the-skin hormonal breakouts due to PCOS. As you&#x27;ll see in the video there are quite a few supplies needed, but it&#x27;s easy to apply and very gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this peel and would recommend it salicylic acid peel newbies. I had no major or unbearable burning, yet I also did not experience any major peeling (not even a few days after application). I would not say that it made a huge difference after the first use, but I did see some overall positive results. Personally, I feel that I may need a stronger solution, however this is great for quick touchups - especially if you can&#x27;t afford to have any downtime after a peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;*Skin is noticeably smoother and brighter after use.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to apply and easy to remove from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;*Seemed to bring a couple whiteheads to the surface; this is not a con because I believe that this is part of the cleaning/unclogging pores process.&lt;br /&gt;*Does not burn the skin or tingle very much; I was easily able to tolerate it for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;*No downtime needed - can be applied a few hours before an event without worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;*Does not seem to provide a major difference in scars or breakouts after just one use; however, my breakouts are hormonally induced (under the skin - do not come to a head) so that could make a difference; I do know that it will take a few peels to see a major improvement in my deep scars.&lt;br /&gt;*No instructions provided with the product, but I did receive an email with tips and useful information; I was able to find a very useful guide online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For MY type of skin, I give it 4 stars after initial use. I do plan to use this peel again in 2-3 weeks and will update my review with the results. I&#x27;m hoping to see a major difference.</li>
            <li> I tested this product on my niece as she suffers from acne.  She immediately liked it because of the feeling of it drying out the bacteria.  We left it on for over 5 minutes on the first try, although I don&#x27;t suggest this for everybody.  As an over-the-counter salicylic acid, there are reasonable limits for peel agents and one must discover how to best use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This peel opens up the pores in ways that facial cleansers and creams cannot.  This is a healthy way to shed skin and generate new skin without burning and much redness.  It&#x27;s vital to use a sunscreen afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this peel - it worked.  Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> helps some on small blemishes and not much more, I wont buy again</li>
            <li> The tingle starts in about 15 seconds, as you hit a full minute you can&#x27;t wait to get it off which was about what I expected. I&#x27;ve used it three times with minimum results. Some peeling around my nose but not major wrinkle improvement. I have VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product. Not 20% salycilic acid. Real face peel will frost your skin over in 5 min., comes with documentation- real drug warnings and must be carefully rinsed off. This junk can be left on. Fake fake product. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this gel serum. My face feels so smooth, bright, and years younger. I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking to improve their skin and feel good!</li>
            <li> I think it is working. Disappointed that I had go find instructions. Time will see, it only been a week but my daughters big acne pimples seem to be reduced.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have seen a remarkable difference in my complexion.  I am in the sun all Summer, so I do a peel every Fall.  This peel is the first one I have used where people look at me and ask what I have done differently.  I choose I am writing this review, because I love this product so much.  I really hope it will continue its popularity.  I am acne prone.  I am also in my early forties, so fine lines are an issue.  I am freckled andI like my freckles, but I do not want age spots, and I believe there is a difference.  This product allows the customer to control how light they make their skin, so I can still have my freckles, but the big spots that come with age are gone.  Better than a trip to the dermatologist.  And, I turned down a friend&#x27;s invite to go to a botox facial party.  Not only did I save money, my skin is super vibrant.  I love to use a mild soap, even baby shampoo, and follow up with the gel cream by philosophy.  Always put vaseline on your eyebrows and on your lips, and follow the directions closely.  This is a professional grade treatment for $30.  It rocks my world!  Yes, my wrinkles are less visible too.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. this product also has an ingredient in called peg-8 which is ethylene glycol which is anti-freeze which is highly toxic to humans and animals. Also on the front of the box the list 3 ingredients witch hazel, butylene glycol, hamamelis virginiana. Hamamelis virginiana is witch hazel so they are trying to fool people into thinking it some special ingredient. Unless you like putting anti-freeze on your face I would highly recommend staying away from this product.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, it only helped a little with exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with any type of peel product -- I can honestly say that I am impressed so far with my results after just one use!  My skin cleared up overnight and I can already see a drastic improvement on the smoothness of my skin.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it again in two weeks -- wish I could use it again sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions (to apply it) from the video posted by another customer - very helpful!  I left the peel on for 5 minutes without any problems or burning.  Next time I will leave it on for longer!  Hope this product works for you like it has for me!</li>
            <li> This product did not give me the results promised...I followed the instructions as advised.I was told I needed a stronger grade of 30%...</li>
            <li> I received a review sample of this serum and I used it for my chin and forehead, where I keep breaking out, for some unknown reason. Diets and other things didn&#x27;t work, and I was constantly looking for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect to see fast improvements, but the serum really works great. The salicylic acid is something I always responded to, not like benzoyl peroxide, which doesn&#x27;t have any effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions on how to use the gel peel serum, and after 1 month of using it, I don&#x27;t have any pimples on my chin or forehead anymore, my skin looks great, and I am not breaking out anymore. (probably because I am still using it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> did not see a real difference</li>
