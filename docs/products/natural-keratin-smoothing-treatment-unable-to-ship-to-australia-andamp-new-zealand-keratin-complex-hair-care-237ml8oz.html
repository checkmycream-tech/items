            <li>I was very pleased with the results; however, I do not want to risk my health.  </li>
            <li>The results are great and much more affordable than the salon</li>
            <li>After 2 done in a salon, to the tune of $700, I decided to purchase it on-line and have a friend apply it for me, so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I know delivers phenomenal results!  </li>
            <li>just fabulous!!</li>
            <li>I just re-did it again and the results were amazing</li>
            <li>HE DID AN AMAZING JOB</li>
            <li>I wanted to give the coppola a shot since all the reviews were so amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I found a way to do my own Keratin Treatments with the brand</li>
            <li>HONESTLY I</li>
            <li>WELL TO BE HONEST</li>
            <li>I know this is a good product, and I wish I was able to do it on my own, but I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I can be patient; it&#x27;s my own hair :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on many clients and have done it on my own hair maybe</li>
            <li>With the help of that we were able to do it with great success.</li>
            <li>I love this keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>Keratin treatment has returned my hair to what it once was, its smooth, shiny, and in addition to my hair extensions, I feel amazing again.</li>
            <li>OSHA has a requirement of an accepted amount of formaldehyde, but most salons are over that limit.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was going to move out of country and could not imagine not being able to get this protein treatment done by my stylist.  </li>
            <li>The product bottle was designed for that formula and, thus, all times etc are for the most optimal results.</li>
            <li>Product is authentic.</li>
            <li>I love this smoothing treatment.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the solution is evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more you use it the longer you can go in between applications.</li>
            <li>You have to maintain your hair by washing it with the Keratin shampoo and conditioner and be sure to follow the smoothing treatment instructions to the letter otherwise</li>
            <li>(make sure you follow instructions to the letter for salon-quality results) but</li>
            <li>Ok so I bought the product and used after I had colored my hair w highlights.</li>
            <li>AND AM SO GLAD WITH MY DECISION.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the process, I had to wash my hair out because I was worried that something might happen if I kept it in because my eyes kept tearing up and what not.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a good month or two depending on if you use the right shampoo and conditioner that will not strip your hair of the treatment. .</li>
            <li>I was able to find more detailed instructions online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, everything was fine and hair was fabulous!</li>
            <li>the product is very good, the hair looks shining, no frizz, but it doesn&#x27;t last too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Have the right things handy:</li>
            <li>Its easy to use just follow the directions on the bottle.</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my hair look younger and seals in the fly away hairs for 3+ months.</li>
            <li>AND THAT&#x27;S IT EASY</li>
            <li>product had some strong fumes that made my eyes water at times, so ventilate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still have a lot left in the bottle too, so if anyone is planning on buying this item, I&#x27;ll be more than happy to give you my bottle, free of charge.</li>
            <li>I will have to say that this is not the first time I do this kind of treatment myself.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I did it with this kind of Keratin.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions on the bottle and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be a smart idea to do it on my own,</li>
            <li>they are formaldehyde free.</li>
            <li>I was convinced into using this product because I was told it was formaldehyde free.</li>
            <li>Since the application was free I saved almost $200 by getting it through Amazon compared to going to a salon.  </li>
            <li>Great Product my only wish  is not  having to wait 3 days to before you wash it out.</li>
            <li>&amp;  I tried Pravana, which is free of formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li>Formaldehyde free....</li>
            <li>After 3 days or 72 hours, hair should be washed with a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>but it did not cause me to be nauseous or light headed.</li>
            <li>but it did not cause me to be nauseous or light headed.</li>
            <li>and feel free to ask me questions.</li>
            <li>but because that is very costly, a friend who does her own hair did mine too.</li>
            <li>I bought it via amazon, but I had doubts whether its original and its term of use is not expired, but all turned to be fine.</li>
            <li>For chemically treated or damaged hair reduce heat to 420-430 degrees and pay special attention to not over iron the ends.  </li>
            <li>I threw out almost a full bottle of the Coppola Keratin Treatment.</li>
            <li>We watched a YOUTUBE video on how to do Keratin Complex by Coppola and found an awesome tutorial.</li>
            <li>A must have for those with super curly hair but do not have the money to always go out and spend $300 for one application at the salon.</li>
            <li>The product was also shipped quickly and packaged well to protect.  </li>
            <li>I have done many of these treatments and had the same issues as others but now issues have been resolved and every customer is 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Most salons who use keratin treatments endanger their employees as high levels of formaldehyde is released into the salon.  </li>
            <li>It helps the hair to be more manageable without changing the normal look.</li>
            <li>You can pretty much use any conditoner you want since most conditioners do not have sulfrates in them.</li>
            <li>yourself if your hair is really worth risking your life and the lives of everyone around you while applying this treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair feels natural, no freeze and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews on Keratin treatments, both home and professional applications.</li>
            <li>I actually do my own outside on my deck if I don&#x27;t have it done in the salon.  </li>
            <li>I actually do my own outside on my deck if I don&#x27;t have it done in the salon.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sooo worth the cost savings.</li>
            <li>Follow directions and you will achieve success no matter who you are.</li>
            <li>THATS RIGHT,</li>
            <li>When done correctly and on the right head of hair, this treatment is miracle.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, on the right head of hair this treatment is truly a miracle.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, on the right head of hair this treatment is truly a miracle.  </li>
            <li>, I will continue to do this treatment for even just a few months of beautiful, shiny, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Comb through every section with a fine tooth comb until hair is completely saturated.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not meant for very fine hair (you&#x27;ll feel flat and greasy).  </li>
            <li>really I guess I&#x27;ll go back to him, groupon and living social have great deals on keratin treatments and Brazilian blowouts</li>
            <li>It makes my hair manageable and smooth and much straighter than normal.</li>
            <li>I discovered the exact reason why it was taken away</li>
            <li>Also, many manufacture&#x27;s, including this one, are claiming there is no formaldehyde in the treatment when in fact scientist did test on multiple 3 month treatments and everyone was found to have varying degrees of formaldehyde</li>
            <li>First time I tried this product in salon.</li>
            <li>For the first time in 10 years I have stepped out of the house with out having to spend an hour+ on my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks Coppola!</li>
            <li>Lastly, a trim afterwards will prolong the healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got great long lasting results from using this product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Your hair will get really, really hot and may burn your hand and</li>
            <li>We tested many brands of keratin treatments before deciding on this one, because this was the only one that did exactly what it advertised and was still within OSHA standards of safety in terms of the aldehyde exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We tested many brands of keratin treatments before deciding on this one, because this was the only one that did exactly what it advertised and was still within OSHA standards of safety in terms of the aldehyde exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well I must say the first time I did it</li>
            <li>First of all the bottle didn&#x27;t have the coppola name on it</li>
            <li>I first had it put in my hair in a salon</li>
            <li>large rounded brush, fine-toothed comb, high quality straight iron, high quality blow dryer, gloves, shower cap, clips to section hair... and help if needed :)</li>
            <li>your hair will feel very flat, just to warn you  ;)  after 72 hours shampoo with a good quality, sulfate-free shampoo and condition only the ends (if you over-condition after this treatment you will feel greasy).</li>
            <li>The most important instructions that you need to remember is the product in the bottle must be shaken very well, then measured and poured into a bowl to allow the product to breathe prior to application, and finally ventilation.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is the strong odor that comes when you are applying.  </li>
            <li>I certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>a technician in a very high end salon</li>
            <li>It worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li>The product was shipped really fast and the product works</li>
            <li>However, he says, there isn&#x27;t very much...?!?!@%</li>
            <li>the keratin goes deep onto the damaged cuticle and your hair will come out silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>The bottle does NOT come with detailed instructions, just a brief overview printed on it.</li>
            <li>TO MUCH HAIR.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It turned out just as good, if not better, and I save a ton of $!</li>
            <li>Having read various reviews (here and other places) a few key points seemed the most important for successful results:&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li>the only good thing about the treatment is that it left my hair soft with volume but soft.</li>
            <li>I normally buy the 16 ounce bottle because I use about 3 to 4 ounces per application since my hair is very dense.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it does not stick to the hair and once blown dry and flat-ironed</li>
            <li>Anyway, I needed to ask the seller a question prior to purchase and they responded quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have to be fair and say I would completely wash out hair w keratin complex shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>It is a long process but for me the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li>Also, the Keratin Complex flat irons are the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m a flat iron maniac.  </li>
            <li>Also, the Keratin Complex flat irons are the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m a flat iron maniac.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The right head of hair is frizzy, puffy, and not too curly, as this treatment is designed to collapse puff, smooth frizz and tame waves.  </li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s why I needed to use a little more.  </li>
            <li>I feel like a normal person again.</li>
            <li>Just apply the color like you normally do and condition like normal and just the clarifying shampoo once.bangs.</li>
            <li>Just apply the color like you normally do and condition like normal and just the clarifying shampoo once.</li>
            <li>hair will come out frizz free, extremely shiny and healthier.</li>
            <li>and I live in the south</li>
            <li>1 bottle yields 4 complete treatments!  </li>
            <li>The price clearly states $98 dollars</li>
            <li>I really hope this information helps stop someone from making the same mistakes I did.</li>
            <li>I learned how to use this product from the professional saloon.</li>
            <li>I had my sister apply it for me, since she is a professional hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>For very resistant, coarse hair, allow hair to absorb solution for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair has done a complete 360.</li>
            <li>it would be a waste of time and money to do this treatment with a cheap one.  </li>
            <li>it would be a waste of time and money to do this treatment with a cheap one.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s also naturally frizzy</li>
            <li>I have had keratin treatment done on my hair before by a professional</li>
            <li>After the solution has absorbed for the specific time period, blow dry hair on medium or high heat with a paddle brush/vent brush until it is 100%</li>
            <li>here comes the real major WARNING:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But still hair felt dry and not as described it should be like soon after first wash.  </li>
            <li>Anything claiming over 30 days either has Formaldehyde or doesn&#x27;t actually last that long since the formaldehyde is what fuses the keratin to your hair for the extended period of time kind of like how it also preserves a dead body.</li>
            <li>The sections should be small enough that you should be able to see your hand through the hair.</li>
            <li>It does take a while to do the treatment, and the treatment doesn&#x27;t last even close to six months, but as unruly as my hair has gotten as I have older</li>
            <li>product is the same they use in the high end salons (I called all in my area.)</li>
            <li>With the help of my mother who is not a hair stylist at or better yet knows very little on how to use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>Using a flat iron on high temperatures can cause evaporation of aldehyde or sulfurous fumes when applied to the hair.</li>
            <li>Using a flat iron on high temperatures can cause evaporation of aldehyde or sulfurous fumes when applied to the hair.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH, WASH MY HAIR YESTURDAY AND BLOW DRY IT</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy blonde hair and wanted to reduce/eliminate the need to blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li>Apparently there is formaldehyde in this treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair is barely shoulder length</li>
            <li>but, the keratin treatment has left my hair truly silky and ultra soft.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels now and it seriously takes me about 15 minutes to flat iron, before it would take me about 1 hr.</li>
            <li>When I let my hair dry naturally, my hair comes out with a soft wave that has no frizz.</li>

            <li>B00563K6VO HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron]] - use it.  </li>
            <li>NO WILLING TO PAY THAT MUCH</li>
            <li>I washed my hair evry other day because it is really oily.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and after using this I had an icky shade of light brown.</li>
            <li>Even after washing it 3 days later it was still the same.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it did not last anywhere near 3 to 5 months.</li>
            <li>Companies are trying to find other ways and methods to provide the public with manageable straight hair with safety in mind.</li>
            <li>dry the hair completely.</li>

            <li> just fabulous!!</li>
            <li> I just re-did it again and the results were amazing</li>
            <li> HE DID AN AMAZING JOB</li>
            <li> I wanted to give the coppola a shot since all the reviews were so amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I found a way to do my own Keratin Treatments with the brand</li>
            <li> HONESTLY I</li>
            <li> WELL TO BE HONEST</li>
            <li> I know this is a good product, and I wish I was able to do it on my own, but I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I can be patient; it&#x27;s my own hair :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on many clients and have done it on my own hair maybe</li>
            <li> With the help of that we were able to do it with great success.</li>
            <li> I love this keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> Keratin treatment has returned my hair to what it once was, its smooth, shiny, and in addition to my hair extensions, I feel amazing again.</li>
            <li> OSHA has a requirement of an accepted amount of formaldehyde, but most salons are over that limit.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was going to move out of country and could not imagine not being able to get this protein treatment done by my stylist.  </li>
            <li> The product bottle was designed for that formula and, thus, all times etc are for the most optimal results.</li>
            <li> Product is authentic.</li>
            <li> I love this smoothing treatment.</li>
            <li> Make sure that the solution is evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The more you use it the longer you can go in between applications.</li>
            <li> You have to maintain your hair by washing it with the Keratin shampoo and conditioner and be sure to follow the smoothing treatment instructions to the letter otherwise</li>
            <li> (make sure you follow instructions to the letter for salon-quality results) but</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought the product and used after I had colored my hair w highlights.</li>
            <li> AND AM SO GLAD WITH MY DECISION.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the process, I had to wash my hair out because I was worried that something might happen if I kept it in because my eyes kept tearing up and what not.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a good month or two depending on if you use the right shampoo and conditioner that will not strip your hair of the treatment. .</li>
            <li> I was able to find more detailed instructions online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , everything was fine and hair was fabulous!</li>
            <li> the product is very good, the hair looks shining, no frizz, but it doesn&#x27;t last too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Have the right things handy:</li>
            <li> Its easy to use just follow the directions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I love how it makes my hair look younger and seals in the fly away hairs for 3+ months.</li>
            <li> AND THAT&#x27;S IT EASY</li>
            <li> product had some strong fumes that made my eyes water at times, so ventilate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have a lot left in the bottle too, so if anyone is planning on buying this item, I&#x27;ll be more than happy to give you my bottle, free of charge.</li>
            <li> I will have to say that this is not the first time I do this kind of treatment myself.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time I did it with this kind of Keratin.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions on the bottle and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> so I thought it would be a smart idea to do it on my own,</li>
            <li> they are formaldehyde free.</li>
            <li> I was convinced into using this product because I was told it was formaldehyde free.</li>
            <li> Since the application was free I saved almost $200 by getting it through Amazon compared to going to a salon.  </li>
            <li> Great Product my only wish  is not  having to wait 3 days to before you wash it out.</li>
            <li> &amp;  I tried Pravana, which is free of formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li> Formaldehyde free....</li>
            <li> After 3 days or 72 hours, hair should be washed with a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it did not cause me to be nauseous or light headed.</li>
            <li> but it did not cause me to be nauseous or light headed.</li>
            <li> and feel free to ask me questions.</li>
            <li> but because that is very costly, a friend who does her own hair did mine too.</li>
            <li> I bought it via amazon, but I had doubts whether its original and its term of use is not expired, but all turned to be fine.</li>
            <li> For chemically treated or damaged hair reduce heat to 420-430 degrees and pay special attention to not over iron the ends.  </li>
            <li> I threw out almost a full bottle of the Coppola Keratin Treatment.</li>
            <li> We watched a YOUTUBE video on how to do Keratin Complex by Coppola and found an awesome tutorial.</li>
            <li> A must have for those with super curly hair but do not have the money to always go out and spend $300 for one application at the salon.</li>
            <li> The product was also shipped quickly and packaged well to protect.  </li>
            <li> I have done many of these treatments and had the same issues as others but now issues have been resolved and every customer is 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Most salons who use keratin treatments endanger their employees as high levels of formaldehyde is released into the salon.  </li>
            <li> It helps the hair to be more manageable without changing the normal look.</li>
            <li> You can pretty much use any conditoner you want since most conditioners do not have sulfrates in them.</li>
            <li> yourself if your hair is really worth risking your life and the lives of everyone around you while applying this treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair feels natural, no freeze and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews on Keratin treatments, both home and professional applications.</li>
            <li> I actually do my own outside on my deck if I don&#x27;t have it done in the salon.  </li>
            <li> I actually do my own outside on my deck if I don&#x27;t have it done in the salon.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sooo worth the cost savings.</li>
            <li> Follow directions and you will achieve success no matter who you are.</li>
            <li> THATS RIGHT,</li>
            <li> When done correctly and on the right head of hair, this treatment is miracle.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, on the right head of hair this treatment is truly a miracle.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, on the right head of hair this treatment is truly a miracle.  </li>
            <li> , I will continue to do this treatment for even just a few months of beautiful, shiny, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Comb through every section with a fine tooth comb until hair is completely saturated.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not meant for very fine hair (you&#x27;ll feel flat and greasy).  </li>
            <li> really I guess I&#x27;ll go back to him, groupon and living social have great deals on keratin treatments and Brazilian blowouts</li>
            <li> It makes my hair manageable and smooth and much straighter than normal.</li>
            <li> I discovered the exact reason why it was taken away</li>
            <li> Also, many manufacture&#x27;s, including this one, are claiming there is no formaldehyde in the treatment when in fact scientist did test on multiple 3 month treatments and everyone was found to have varying degrees of formaldehyde</li>
            <li> First time I tried this product in salon.</li>
            <li> For the first time in 10 years I have stepped out of the house with out having to spend an hour+ on my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks Coppola!</li>
            <li> Lastly, a trim afterwards will prolong the healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got great long lasting results from using this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Your hair will get really, really hot and may burn your hand and</li>
            <li> We tested many brands of keratin treatments before deciding on this one, because this was the only one that did exactly what it advertised and was still within OSHA standards of safety in terms of the aldehyde exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> well I must say the first time I did it</li>
            <li> First of all the bottle didn&#x27;t have the coppola name on it</li>
            <li> I first had it put in my hair in a salon</li>
            <li> large rounded brush, fine-toothed comb, high quality straight iron, high quality blow dryer, gloves, shower cap, clips to section hair... and help if needed :)</li>
            <li> your hair will feel very flat, just to warn you  ;)  after 72 hours shampoo with a good quality, sulfate-free shampoo and condition only the ends (if you over-condition after this treatment you will feel greasy).</li>
            <li> The most important instructions that you need to remember is the product in the bottle must be shaken very well, then measured and poured into a bowl to allow the product to breathe prior to application, and finally ventilation.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is the strong odor that comes when you are applying.  </li>
            <li> I certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> a technician in a very high end salon</li>
            <li> It worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li> The product was shipped really fast and the product works</li>
            <li> However, he says, there isn&#x27;t very much...?!?!@%</li>
            <li> the keratin goes deep onto the damaged cuticle and your hair will come out silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> The bottle does NOT come with detailed instructions, just a brief overview printed on it.</li>
            <li> TO MUCH HAIR.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me.</li>
            <li> It turned out just as good, if not better, and I save a ton of $!</li>
            <li> Having read various reviews (here and other places) a few key points seemed the most important for successful results:&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li> the only good thing about the treatment is that it left my hair soft with volume but soft.</li>
            <li> I normally buy the 16 ounce bottle because I use about 3 to 4 ounces per application since my hair is very dense.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it does not stick to the hair and once blown dry and flat-ironed</li>
            <li> Anyway, I needed to ask the seller a question prior to purchase and they responded quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have to be fair and say I would completely wash out hair w keratin complex shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> It is a long process but for me the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li> Also, the Keratin Complex flat irons are the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m a flat iron maniac.  </li>
            <li> Also, the Keratin Complex flat irons are the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m a flat iron maniac.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The right head of hair is frizzy, puffy, and not too curly, as this treatment is designed to collapse puff, smooth frizz and tame waves.  </li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s why I needed to use a little more.  </li>
            <li> I feel like a normal person again.</li>
            <li> Just apply the color like you normally do and condition like normal and just the clarifying shampoo once.bangs.</li>
            <li> Just apply the color like you normally do and condition like normal and just the clarifying shampoo once.</li>
            <li> hair will come out frizz free, extremely shiny and healthier.</li>
            <li> and I live in the south</li>
            <li> 1 bottle yields 4 complete treatments!  </li>
            <li> The price clearly states $98 dollars</li>
            <li> I really hope this information helps stop someone from making the same mistakes I did.</li>
            <li> I learned how to use this product from the professional saloon.</li>
            <li> I had my sister apply it for me, since she is a professional hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> For very resistant, coarse hair, allow hair to absorb solution for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair has done a complete 360.</li>
            <li> it would be a waste of time and money to do this treatment with a cheap one.  </li>
            <li> it would be a waste of time and money to do this treatment with a cheap one.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s also naturally frizzy</li>
            <li> I have had keratin treatment done on my hair before by a professional</li>
            <li> After the solution has absorbed for the specific time period, blow dry hair on medium or high heat with a paddle brush/vent brush until it is 100%</li>
            <li> here comes the real major WARNING:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But still hair felt dry and not as described it should be like soon after first wash.  </li>
            <li> Anything claiming over 30 days either has Formaldehyde or doesn&#x27;t actually last that long since the formaldehyde is what fuses the keratin to your hair for the extended period of time kind of like how it also preserves a dead body.</li>
            <li> The sections should be small enough that you should be able to see your hand through the hair.</li>
            <li> It does take a while to do the treatment, and the treatment doesn&#x27;t last even close to six months, but as unruly as my hair has gotten as I have older</li>
            <li> product is the same they use in the high end salons (I called all in my area.)</li>
            <li> With the help of my mother who is not a hair stylist at or better yet knows very little on how to use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Using a flat iron on high temperatures can cause evaporation of aldehyde or sulfurous fumes when applied to the hair.</li>
            <li> Using a flat iron on high temperatures can cause evaporation of aldehyde or sulfurous fumes when applied to the hair.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH, WASH MY HAIR YESTURDAY AND BLOW DRY IT</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy blonde hair and wanted to reduce/eliminate the need to blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li> Apparently there is formaldehyde in this treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair is barely shoulder length</li>
            <li> but, the keratin treatment has left my hair truly silky and ultra soft.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels now and it seriously takes me about 15 minutes to flat iron, before it would take me about 1 hr.</li>
            <li> When I let my hair dry naturally, my hair comes out with a soft wave that has no frizz.</li>

            <li> NO WILLING TO PAY THAT MUCH</li>
            <li> I washed my hair evry other day because it is really oily.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and after using this I had an icky shade of light brown.</li>
            <li> Even after washing it 3 days later it was still the same.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it did not last anywhere near 3 to 5 months.</li>
            <li> Companies are trying to find other ways and methods to provide the public with manageable straight hair with safety in mind.</li>
            <li> dry the hair completely.</li>
            <li> The flat iron process is the critical step ...</li>
            <li> By infusing (letting product sit and flat ironing it in)</li>
            <li> Using a 450 degree flat iron, start at the nape of the neck taking 1/8 inch sections.</li>
            <li> you must use an iron that can get 450-500 degrees and be patient to flat iron every single strand with multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> Dry, brittle, over-processed hair should be pre-conditioned prior to treatment.</li>
            <li> Hair Cuttery&#x27;s corporate head told me himself in a long discussion... that the reason they stopped doing the treatment is because they were getting pressure from the state and local Government to discontinue use Immediately since Formaldehyde is an extremely harmful CARCINOGEN.</li>
            <li> dry the product on the hair with a hairdryer, and begin to flat iron.</li>
            <li> I was very much into this treatment for several months until I became annoyed with burning eyes and the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing and it lasts at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li> and I bought it for a long time for $98.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional hairdresser and did not want to spend $400 to get this done in a salon.</li>
            <li> and I normally do not even have to use a flat iron for retouch except for mybangs.</li>
            <li> The 8 ounce bottle is enough for 2 treatments although the typical quantity for treatment is only 2 ounces.  </li>
            <li> Blow dry until your hair is 100%</li>
            <li> It never crossed my mind that the stuff my salon is offering me could be so detrimental and not say a single word.</li>
            <li> If you have a heat safe resistance glove such as this: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have almost the same volume previous to the keratin.</li>
            <li> of Keratin Complex Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment solution into a bowl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it is expensive but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no formaldehyde, not even when heat is applied.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to my hair over the last 5 years, perhaps perimenopausal, but I&#x27;ve lost much of my hair and in addition, it has slowly lost all its shine, its thin, frail and breaking and basically became a fuzz ball.</li>
            <li> Our hair is shoulder length and not very full.</li>
            <li> I usually use a blow-dryer and a flat iron to get my hair to a manageable point.</li>
            <li> It is extremely detrimental to your health and it puts everyone know inhales it at risk for CANCER; apparently far worse than anything else.</li>
            <li> Slowly move the iron from root to ends 5-7 times (7-10 times for extremely curly, coarse hair) infusing the keratin into the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> The OSHA website provides lots of information about different keratin treatments, and Coppola Keratin Complex is listed on the site.  </li>

            <li> My eyes did sting a little bit when I applied the product to the front of my head</li>
            <li> Ordered this with a little skepticism since I had paid $300 to have the Keratin treatment done at a salon.  </li>

            <li> We followed the instructions which are written in very small font on the bottle (although we read them carefully spending lot of time) but still this product did not work.</li>
            <li> I can tell you this will help you tame your unruly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> (I have very long hair) seemed steep, especially when I&#x27;ve read bad reviews regarding impatient professionals rushing the application...</li>
            <li> and I may as well have been sitting there blowing cigarette smoke in their faces non-stop for hours; it was just as bad if not worse.</li>
            <li> spoke to (Hair Cuttery&#x27;s) corporate headquarters after my failed attempt with this stuff asking why they took it away since no one at the salon appeared to know anything.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try doing the keratin treatment at home because getting the treatment regularly was getting really expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually let the solution sit while I am blow drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> take small sections and go over each section 7-10 times, at between 400 and 420 degrees depending on the texture of your hair (lower heat for finer hair or hair</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product from Amazon and I was praying for the salon quality results I was used to since my hair salon stopped using Keratin Treatments.&lt;br /&gt;First of all I have blonde hair and after using this I had an icky shade of light brown. NOT COOL. Even after washing it 3 days later it was still the same.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it did not last anywhere near 3 to 5 months. I would say maybe 6 washes.&lt;br /&gt;Third, I had Keratin treatment done of my hair every three months for almost a year before they suddenly stopped. Well, now I know why they did...Apparently there is formaldehyde in this treatment. Yeah, THATS RIGHT, the stuff they shoot into dead people; which for me I can deal with that stuff honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here comes the real major WARNING:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spoke to (Hair Cuttery&#x27;s) corporate headquarters after my failed attempt with this stuff asking why they took it away since no one at the salon appeared to know anything. I discovered the exact reason why it was taken away and no one was told anything. Hair Cuttery&#x27;s corporate head told me himself in a long discussion... that the reason they stopped doing the treatment is because they were getting pressure from the state and local Government to discontinue use Immediately since Formaldehyde is an extremely harmful CARCINOGEN. It is extremely detrimental to your health and it puts everyone know inhales it at risk for CANCER; apparently far worse than anything else. Also, many manufacture&#x27;s, including this one, are claiming there is no formaldehyde in the treatment when in fact scientist did test on multiple 3 month treatments and everyone was found to have varying degrees of formaldehyde and this brand was among the highest and yet they claim there is NONE at all.&lt;br /&gt;Ask yourself if your hair is really worth risking your life and the lives of everyone around you while applying this treatment. If you want this treatment that badly I recommend the 14 to 30 day treatments they are a LOT cheaper and you don&#x27;t have to worry about risking your health sense they are formaldehyde free. Anything claiming over 30 days either has Formaldehyde or doesn&#x27;t actually last that long since the formaldehyde is what fuses the keratin to your hair for the extended period of time kind of like how it also preserves a dead body. I really hope this information helps stop someone from making the same mistakes I did. The worst thing about it all is that I have spent the last year, every 2 months, in enclosed room at the salon and home with my two very small children for HOURS while they were breathing in a harsh Carcinogen. I should have been warned. It never crossed my mind that the stuff my salon is offering me could be so detrimental and not say a single word. My babies where in there and I may as well have been sitting there blowing cigarette smoke in their faces non-stop for hours; it was just as bad if not worse.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this product in salon. As salon procedure quite expensive I decided to do it myself. I bought it via amazon, but I had doubts whether its original and its term of use is not expired, but all turned to be fine. Great product. Will use it again.</li>
            <li> My hair has what I like to call a \\&quot;life of its own\\&quot;. Miami&#x27;s humidity doesn&#x27;t help at all. I can tell you this will help you tame your unruly frizzy hair. I feel like in a commercial saying this but believe me when I say my hairs history is now divided into before Coppola Keratin Smoothing system and after. Tamed frizz and still kept my wavy hair. ^_^  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I usually use a blow-dryer and a flat iron to get my hair to a manageable point. This product worked wonders on my hair. For the first time in 10 years I have stepped out of the house with out having to spend an hour+ on my hair. Follow the directions on the bottle and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I have been having this treatment done for several years.  After 2 done in a salon, to the tune of $700, I decided to purchase it on-line and have a friend apply it for me, so glad I did!  It turned out just as good, if not better, and I save a ton of $!</li>
            <li> We  have purchases this product twice now and both times have had great results.  Only downside is the strong odor that comes when you are applying.  Fortunately, it does not stick to the hair and once blown dry and flat-ironed, everything was fine and hair was fabulous!</li>
            <li> I learned how to use this product from the professional saloon. I have been doing it periodically and it delivers an excellent result.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is expensive but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The description of the results is unreal. Total disappointment. Way to expensive for the results obtained, regular keratin supplements at a pharmacy do better.</li>
            <li> I love this keratin treatment. It is a long process but for me the results are worth it!  It will take over an hour to do and leave your hair greasy for a couple of days, well mine gets greasy anyway.  It lasts for a good month or two depending on if you use the right shampoo and conditioner that will not strip your hair of the treatment. . It makes my hair manageable and smooth and much straighter than normal. Gets rid of almost all of my frizz.</li>
            <li> I got ripped off. The price clearly states $98 dollars and I bought it for a long time for $98. This time they charged me $200. I am so disappointed. I didn&#x27;t notice it until now. I don&#x27;t know if it is a mistake or they meant to charge me double.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life. I feel like a normal person again. I don&#x27;t know what happened to my hair over the last 5 years, perhaps perimenopausal, but I&#x27;ve lost much of my hair and in addition, it has slowly lost all its shine, its thin, frail and breaking and basically became a fuzz ball. Its horrible. Keratin treatment has returned my hair to what it once was, its smooth, shiny, and in addition to my hair extensions, I feel amazing again. I use it once every 3-6 months. Its easy to use just follow the directions on the bottle. I use a hair color bottle to apply so I don&#x27;t waste any product. It smells nice too. It keeps my hair in check. Thanks Coppola!</li>
            <li> I was convinced into using this product because I was told it was formaldehyde free. However, keratin complex releases formaldehyde when heated.  There is an ingredient in this product called Timonacic acid that releases formaldehyde when heated.  Timonacic acid is the cause of burning eyes, skin irritations, and breathing difficulties with this product. Since this product releases formaldehyde, it is banned from several countries. This is why the seller of Coppola keratin complex cannot ship to NZ or Australia because the product is banned.  Most salons who use keratin treatments endanger their employees as high levels of formaldehyde is released into the salon.  OSHA has a requirement of an accepted amount of formaldehyde, but most salons are over that limit. I have provided a link to the OSHA website about keratin treatments. The OSHA website provides lots of information about different keratin treatments, and Coppola Keratin Complex is listed on the site.  [...]    I was very much into this treatment for several months until I became annoyed with burning eyes and the smell. I was very pleased with the results; however, I do not want to risk my health.  There is another keratin treatment called Chi Enviro Smoothing Treatment.  Absolutely no formaldehyde, not even when heat is applied.  I will be trying that soon. Companies are trying to find other ways and methods to provide the public with manageable straight hair with safety in mind. Coppola Keratin Complex is not safe. I threw out almost a full bottle of the Coppola Keratin Treatment. I will not be purchasing this product anymore.</li>
            <li> the product is very good, the hair looks shining, no frizz, but it doesn&#x27;t last too long.&lt;br /&gt;maximum 3 months.</li>
            <li> I had my sister apply it for me, since she is a professional hairdresser.  It worked better than expected.  Since the application was free I saved almost $200 by getting it through Amazon compared to going to a salon.  My hair length is passed my shoulders so I had enough for a second treatment.</li>
            <li> Great Product my only wish  is not  having to wait 3 days to before you wash it out. all in all good product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was going to move out of country and could not imagine not being able to get this protein treatment done by my stylist.  This is the product my stylist uses on my hair and I love how it makes my hair look younger and seals in the fly away hairs for 3+ months.</li>
            <li> I have used this product at home and it works.  This is the real thing and it lasts at least 3 months.  I bought the bottle for around $100.00 and have used it for my mom and me. I beleive I have enough to use it another 2 times.  Our hair is shoulder length and not very full. My hair feels natural, no freeze and healthy.  I certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews on Keratin treatments, both home and professional applications. I have naturally wavy blonde hair and wanted to reduce/eliminate the need to blow dry it straight. $300+ (I have very long hair) seemed steep, especially when I&#x27;ve read bad reviews regarding impatient professionals rushing the application... thus producing poor results. I can be patient; it&#x27;s my own hair :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the same they use in the high end salons (I called all in my area.) Same product, step one. Next was following the directions... to the letter. Having read various reviews (here and other places) a few key points seemed the most important for successful results:&lt;br /&gt;~ Great product&lt;br /&gt;~ Follow bottle directions specifically. Do NOT free-form your own method (unless you&#x27;ve done this and realize what works best for you.) The product bottle was designed for that formula and, thus, all times etc are for the most optimal results. Meaning, some products say to keep product on 20 minutes and others for 30 minutes, do what YOUR bottle says, not the internet. Follow the bottle&#x27;s directions exactly.&lt;br /&gt;~ Be patient and don&#x27;t take shortcuts. This takes a while... a lot of washing, blow drying etc. Take your time.&lt;br /&gt;~ Have the right things handy: large rounded brush, fine-toothed comb, high quality straight iron, high quality blow dryer, gloves, shower cap, clips to section hair... and help if needed :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be washing your hair for 2-3 days, and when you do you need to use Sulphate-free products... have these on hand. Lastly, a trim afterwards will prolong the healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product had some strong fumes that made my eyes water at times, so ventilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again and do it at home. Although it&#x27;s a lot of time and effort, you can get absolutely perfect results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and shipping were perfect (on-time and wrapped well.) Product is authentic.</li>
            <li> The product came in within the week.  I used half the bottle as directed for my hair length, and ..... No frizz. Love it!</li>
            <li> The product was shipped really fast and the product works Great!! I got great long lasting results from using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this smoothing treatment. It is &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34; to the hair. It helps the hair to be more manageable without changing the normal look. That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I just wish it could last longer. I wash my hair with non sodium products every 2 days and it seems to last about 1.5 months only.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try doing the keratin treatment at home because getting the treatment regularly was getting really expensive. The results are great and much more affordable than the salon</li>
            <li> My hairdresser admits there is formaldehyde in this product.  However, he says, there isn&#x27;t very much...?!?!@%&amp;  I tried Pravana, which is free of formaldehyde.  Besides changing the color of my hair, it had a horrible odor.  The odor lasted..... The product I like is Chi Enviro smoothing treatment.  Formaldehyde free....no odor. As of now, I will continue to use this product.  Also, some places sell a smaller supply of the formula.  You get about 3 oz of shampoo, conditioner, &amp; the treatment for about $25.</li>
            <li> If you have frizzy, thick curly hair this is the best treatment you can splurge yourself to. It will eliminate about 95% of the curl and frizz. Keratin restores and restructures hair. By infusing (letting product sit and flat ironing it in) the keratin goes deep onto the damaged cuticle and your hair will come out silky smooth and shiny. It also penetrates the hair follicle with a keratinous bond to promote healing. I normally buy the 16 ounce bottle because I use about 3 to 4 ounces per application since my hair is very dense. It can last up to 3 to 5 months depending on how often you wash your hair. I am not a professional hairdresser and did not want to spend $400 to get this done in a salon. The bottle does NOT come with detailed instructions, just a brief overview printed on it. I was able to find more detailed instructions online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Dry, brittle, over-processed hair should be pre-conditioned prior to treatment. I used the [[ASIN:B00375L8JC Coppola Keratin Complex Vanilla Bean Deep Conditioner, 7-Ounce Tube]]. After shampooing my hair and towel drying, I applied the conditioner, put on a plastic cap and sat under a hair dryer for 20 minutes. Rinse only ONCE with a clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you are NOT pre-conditioning your hair prior to treatment, you are to shampoo with a clarifying shampoo two times for chemically treated hair, three times for virgin, coarse, resistant or gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Blow dry until your hair is 100% dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Shake bottle well. Pour 2-3 oz. of Keratin Complex Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment solution into a bowl. Let the solution sit for at least 10 to 15 minutes. I usually let the solution sit while I am blow drying my hair.  Using gloves, apply to hair with a brush using 1/2\\&quot; sections. Keep product away from scalp but try to get it as close as possible. Comb through every section with a fine tooth comb until hair is completely saturated. Do not over saturate the hair, it should not be dripping. If there is any solution collected on the comb, wipe the excess off with a towel. Make sure that the solution is evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Place hair in plastic cap such as [[ASIN:B002HWS7RM Diane Processing Caps, 100-pack]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. For chemically treated or damaged hair, allow hair to absorb solution for 20 minutes. For very resistant, coarse hair, allow hair to absorb solution for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. After the solution has absorbed for the specific time period, blow dry hair on medium or high heat with a paddle brush/vent brush until it is 100% dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. With a heat resistant comb, divide hair into 4 to 6 sections depending on length and density of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Using a 450 degree flat iron, start at the nape of the neck taking 1/8 inch sections. The sections should be small enough that you should be able to see your hand through the hair. Slowly move the iron from root to ends 5-7 times (7-10 times for extremely curly, coarse hair) infusing the keratin into the hair shaft. For chemically treated or damaged hair reduce heat to 420-430 degrees and pay special attention to not over iron the ends.  If you have a heat safe resistance glove such as this: [[ASIN:B00563K6VO HSI Professional Heat Resistant Glove for Curling and flat iron]] - use it.  Your hair will get really, really hot and may burn your hand and fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. After 3 days or 72 hours, hair should be washed with a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. You can pretty much use any conditoner you want since most conditioners do not have sulfrates in them. I suggest [[ASIN:B001NSUGF2 Pureology Hydrate Shampoo and Conditioner Duo]]. DO NOT USE clips, handbands, place your hair behind your ears or pull it up in a pony tail during the 72 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will come out frizz free, extremely shiny and healthier. Blow drying time is cut in half and I normally do not even have to use a flat iron for retouch except for mybangs. When I let my hair dry naturally, my hair comes out with a soft wave that has no frizz. When it is necessary to have the treatment done again, it is applied to the entire head just like before. Build-up of keratin will improve you hair shaft giving lifeless dull hair a healthier feel and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coppola uses Aldehyde which is a derivative of formaldehyde. My eyes did sting a little bit when I applied the product to the front of my head but it did not cause me to be nauseous or light headed. Using a flat iron on high temperatures can cause evaporation of aldehyde or sulfurous fumes when applied to the hair. Use the product in a well ventilated area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can color your hair the same day prior to doing the Coppola Keratin Smoothing Treatment. It will actually seal in the color, making it last longer. Otherwise, you will have to wait to color your hair 2 weeks after applying the keratin treatment. Just apply the color like you normally do and condition like normal and just the clarifying shampoo once.bangs. When I let my hair dry naturally, my hair comes out with a soft wave that has no frizz.

            <li> A must have for those with super curly hair but do not have the money to always go out and spend $300 for one application at the salon. This bottle cost a third of the salon price and can be used twice (meaning it will last you about a yr.) The suggestion is to repeat the treatment every five months but in my case I do it every six. The more you use it the longer you can go in between applications. My hair has done a complete 360. You have to maintain your hair by washing it with the Keratin shampoo and conditioner and be sure to follow the smoothing treatment instructions to the letter otherwise it can be dangerous since you are dealing with chemicals.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 3/19/13:  please read through the comments.  lots of helpful Q&amp;A!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a technician in a very high end salon and this is the keratin treatment we use on our clients.  When done correctly and on the right head of hair, this treatment is miracle.  The right head of hair is frizzy, puffy, and not too curly, as this treatment is designed to collapse puff, smooth frizz and tame waves.  It is not designed to straighten kinky curls, and it will reduce your volume A LOT so it&#x27;s not meant for very fine hair (you&#x27;ll feel flat and greasy).  I&#x27;ve used this on many clients and have done it on my own hair maybe 4 times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The procedure we use is:  shampoo with clarifying shampoo to remove buildup, do not condition. dry the hair completely. paint the keratin product on with a brush, enough to cover but not over-saturated and dripping. over-saturated &#x3D; greasy! cover with a cap and sit for 30 minutes. do not rinse. dry the product on the hair with a hairdryer, and begin to flat iron. the ironing is the key! take small sections and go over each section 7-10 times, at between 400 and 420 degrees depending on the texture of your hair (lower heat for finer hair or hair that&#x27;s been colored). after you&#x27;re finished ironing do not shampoo, sweat, or put your hair up in clips or ponytails for 72 hours. your hair will feel very flat, just to warn you  ;)  after 72 hours shampoo with a good quality, sulfate-free shampoo and condition only the ends (if you over-condition after this treatment you will feel greasy). sulfates will strip the keratin coating off faster, as will salt water and chlorine. but your hair will be shinier and smoother than you ever thought it could be! a treatment typically lasts 3-5 months, depending on how often you shampoo and whether you&#x27;re a swimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the bottle, this product is relatively harmless, but when you hit it with the iron it will heat up and release steam which contains an aldehyde.  You must do this treatment in a well ventilated area!!!  I actually do my own outside on my deck if I don&#x27;t have it done in the salon.  We tested many brands of keratin treatments before deciding on this one, because this was the only one that did exactly what it advertised and was still within OSHA standards of safety in terms of the aldehyde exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!  Like I said, on the right head of hair this treatment is truly a miracle.  Also, the Keratin Complex flat irons are the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m a flat iron maniac.  PLEASE use a good iron... it would be a waste of time and money to do this treatment with a cheap one.  Good luck girls!  and feel free to ask me questions.well ventilated area!!!

            <li> Ordered this with a little skepticism since I had paid $300 to have the Keratin treatment done at a salon.  The 8 ounce bottle is enough for 2 treatments although the typical quantity for treatment is only 2 ounces.  My hair is barely shoulder length but it&#x27;s thick so maybe that&#x27;s why I needed to use a little more.  Worked perfectly .... applied to thoroughly washed and blow dried hair.  The flat iron process is the critical step ... you must use an iron that can get 450-500 degrees and be patient to flat iron every single strand with multiple passes.  This takes a while to good if you can get a friend to help you.  My hair is naturally curly and I live in the south so it&#x27;s also naturally frizzy (this is an understatement!) but, the keratin treatment has left my hair truly silky and ultra soft.  It does straighten out the curls but I like that because I can put them back in through styling.  I purchased this through Hair Care Outlet here on Amazon but, for some reason, the name of the seller on this post is showing as another company.  Anyway, I needed to ask the seller a question prior to purchase and they responded quickly.  The product was also shipped quickly and packaged well to protect.  Good luck -</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. We followed the instructions which are written in very small font on the bottle (although we read them carefully spending lot of time) but still this product did not work. Wasted $100 and lot of time. BAD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ecstatic in that I found a way to do my own Keratin Treatments with the brand I know delivers phenomenal results!  Yes, it&#x27;s a time consuming process (make sure you follow instructions to the letter for salon-quality results) but it&#x27;s sooo worth the cost savings. 1 bottle yields 4 complete treatments!  I&#x27;m smiling all the way to the bank + my hair is shiny, humidity resistant...just fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought the product and used after I had colored my hair w highlights. I later realized there is a specific one for blonde hair/highlights.  Went on vacation n went in ocean. Also used pool.  I have to be fair and say I would completely wash out hair w keratin complex shampoo and conditioner (yes I took travel size containers).  So maybe these reasons made the product wash out faster. But still hair felt dry and not as described it should be like soon after first wash.  Felt product was weak. Also stated it was OSHA compliant on bottle, so I can imagine it is weaker. Won&#x27;t buy this product or brand again.</li>
            <li> When I can get this at a lower price, I jump on it because the product is great. It does take a while to do the treatment, and the treatment doesn&#x27;t last even close to six months, but as unruly as my hair has gotten as I have older, I will continue to do this treatment for even just a few months of beautiful, shiny, straight hair.</li>
            <li> With the help of my mother who is not a hair stylist at or better yet knows very little on how to use a flat iron. We were able to do this and it turned out AWESOMMEEE!!! We watched a YOUTUBE video on how to do Keratin Complex by Coppola and found an awesome tutorial. With the help of that we were able to do it with great success. I love the way my hair feels now and it seriously takes me about 15 minutes to flat iron, before it would take me about 1 hr. So yea, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair and I have had the Coppola keratin treatment done in salon for about $400 a pop. I saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a try (and try saving $300) well I must say the first time I did it I had my sister help me because of the length and thickness of my hair. I followed the instructions to the tea and my hair was still close to perfect after 4months. I just re-did it again and the results were amazing but this time I did the process myself and my hair is still perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Coppola for making my hair manageable</li>
            <li> I AM A LATINA WITH LOTS OF HAIR AND DECIRED TO BUY THIS THREAMENT AND SELF DO IT BECAUSE A THE SALON THEY WOULD CHARGE ME $450 DOLLARS TO DO IT, REASON I HAVE TO MUCH HAIR. HONESTLY I WASN&#x27;T NO WILLING TO PAY THAT MUCH AND AM SO GLAD WITH MY DECISION. CAME HERE SAW THE REVIEW BUY IT AND DID IT. WELL TO BE HONEST I HAD MY HUBBY DO IT FOR ME LIKE  I SAID I HAVE LOT OF HAIR HE DID AN AMAZING JOB HE HELP ME SO MUCH, WASH MY HAIR YESTURDAY AND BLOW DRY IT AND IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING EVER HAPPEN TO MY HAIR. IF ANY OF YOU LADIES ARE THINKING DO IT GO FOT IT. GO TO YOUTUBE WRITE KERATN COMPLEX AND THAT&#x27;S IT EASY</li>
            <li> I have had keratin treatment done on my hair before by a professional and he did a great job so I thought it would be a smart idea to do it on my own, yeah dumbest idea ever. I followed the directions to a T, but when I applied it to my hair, my eyes burned like crazy, I couldn&#x27;t keep my eyes open it was really bad, and I am not the sensitive type. I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the process, I had to wash my hair out because I was worried that something might happen if I kept it in because my eyes kept tearing up and what not. I know this is a good product, and I wish I was able to do it on my own, but I won&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t have this experience at the salon so I thought it was weird, and since he didn&#x27;t take much money really I guess I&#x27;ll go back to him, groupon and living social have great deals on keratin treatments and Brazilian blowouts, might as well stick to that. I still have a lot left in the bottle too, so if anyone is planning on buying this item, I&#x27;ll be more than happy to give you my bottle, free of charge.</li>
            <li> I got this Keratin from shampoo4less. First of all the bottle didn&#x27;t have the coppola name on it so I was a little bit unsure. I will have to say that this is not the first time I do this kind of treatment myself. I have been doing for at least a year but this is the first time I did it with this kind of Keratin. (QOD Previously) I followed all the direction as they were on the bottle, I washed my hair two times with clarifying shampoo, dryed it 100% etc, etc and I waited for 3 annoying days without washing my hair. I washed my hair evry other day because it is really oily. Today was the second time I washed it and that keratin seems to do not have even taken 1% of my volume. I have almost the same volume previous to the keratin. So I will have to say that it is no a good keratin. I wanted to give the coppola a shot since all the reviews were so amazing. I am not happy I waisted $100 and my hair is almost the same the only good thing about the treatment is that it left my hair soft with volume but soft. I woould definetelly WON&#x27;T buy agai.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044WRRQU/ref&#x3D;ox_ya_os_product</li>
            <li> The Coppola Keratin Smoothing Treatment is a miracle in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair and find the product to be the best for a person who works out and swims and has to also keep their hair in check. It works well with or without a relaxer. I first had it put in my hair in a salon but because that is very costly, a friend who does her own hair did mine too. She followed the instructions on the bottle to a tee and we both have great results. I highly recommend this product. Works very well for me. I have been using it for almost a year now.</li>
            <li> This products requires step by step instructions...The most important instructions that you need to remember is the product in the bottle must be shaken very well, then measured and poured into a bowl to allow the product to breathe prior to application, and finally ventilation.  A small fan is helpful to blow the fumes away from yourself and the customer receiving the treatment.  Result are perfect.  Eye irritation is brought to a minimum.  I have done many of these treatments and had the same issues as others but now issues have been resolved and every customer is 100% satisfied.  Follow directions and you will achieve success no matter who you are.</li>
