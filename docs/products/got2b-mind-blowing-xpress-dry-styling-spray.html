            <li>literally* never had effects this amazing!</li>
            <li>It leaves you hair with a nice hold but not a sticky hold !</li>
            <li>Love this stuff; great fragrance, great non-stiff or sticky hold &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my forehead break out if i spray it too close to my hairline.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, I sometimes have to stop myself from over spraying.</li>
            <li>I like my hair smelling good, not like hairspray.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always nice when you get compliments on how good your hair</li>

            <li>I hope Amazon continues to sold this product as I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Love this finishing spray!</li>
            <li>This hairspray does not smell particularly amazing.</li>
            <li>, I have no visible fly aways or frizzies which is extremely uncommon for my untamable hair, and it is SERIOUSLY straight.</li>
            <li>is run the nozzle under warm water.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love these products!!</li>
            <li>From all the great reviews, I was expecting a unique product.</li>
            <li>Oh, I didn&#x27;t even mention the GREAT price, I was able to get this on Amazon cheaper than what I purchased at the store, it was like buy one get one FREE, what could be better than that.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray its amazing.</li>
            <li>This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve found for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely wonderful and leaves your hair feeling soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this hairspray, rite aid, cvs, walgreens and walmart quit carrying it, I called the toll free number on the can they said call amazon, I did, now I am waiting for my 3 cans to be delivered by mail, real easy dont have to look for it anymore</li>
            <li>The smooth operator hairspray doesn&#x27;t even feel like hairspray!</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, light hold</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like there is any caked product sitting on top of my head</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it holds without being tacky.</li>
            <li>have to mention that my hair is more on the frizzy side...</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY hairsprays.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that I can still run my fingers thru my hair and it isn&#x27;t sticky all day...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for a better hair straightening product.</li>
            <li>why is it not found In most FL stores?</li>
            <li>so I may need to use more on my hair, it may have to do with the hair type in terms of who it works for.</li>
            <li>This is pretty nice, smells kinda like candy, but nice.</li>
            <li>This spray is awesome in that it absolutely leaves my hair controlled, shiny, yet not &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; This hairspray smells so sweet and clean..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it adds a shine like I was hoping, the hold is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love that it is very light on your hair and holds like super glue and all you have to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Has a pleasant smell, almost like a light sweet perfume smell, not overpowering, smells pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t count it as a strong hold hairspray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottle is easy to store, looks nice, isn&#x27;t a large bulky hairspray bottle.  </li>
            <li>Its nice, smells good, but I dont think I&#x27;ll be buying it again, still on the hunt for a good smelling, hard holding spray!</li>
            <li>So happy to finally find this product!</li>
            <li>I would describe the scent as being a light mixture of cotton candy and bubblegum.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is very nice don&#x27;t have that funk hairspray smell like most of the other ones on the market.  </li>
            <li>This one smells sweet, almost like a light raspberry scent.  </li>
            <li>I received a free bottle and I can say this smells amazingly great, unlike every other hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, is easy to apply, and really smooths my hair without making it stiff.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and holds my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I will probably continue to use this product in the future and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good smoothing hairspray.</li>
            <li>Not too sticky, keeps a hold and is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite hairspray and I can&#x27;t get it in stores anymore</li>
            <li>Looks cool on my dresser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds fly away hairs in place without giving you a stiff look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another reason why I really like it is because the name smooth operator really gives it justice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definately sticking to this hairspray ;)</li>
            <li>:) I will continue using this and only this hair spray and definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure it provides enough hold on my hair</li>
            <li>I have to experiment more with it-this alone sends up red flags for me if I have to do this if it&#x27;s not doing what it claims to do after the first</li>
            <li>I use hairspray everyday and I&#x27;ve gone through many different brands over the years and could never find one I really liked.</li>
            <li>The best part is that, while I have used sprays in the past, none of them left my hair feeling this natural!</li>
            <li>I have been using the got2b smooth operator hairspray on an almost daily basis for over a week, and I have to admit that I really like this product!</li>
            <li>So happy I found it, bought a few cans to last me a while.</li>
            <li>My hair is SO soft right now</li>
            <li>smells amazing and helps keep frizz down, and helps keep my hair feeling soft!</li>
            <li>Normally, I use hairspray very infrequently (maybe a couple of times a year).</li>
            <li>I had initially bought this at a local walmart and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;d have to spray a decent amount for it to hold up in windy conditions, bc</li>
            <li>Got2b Smooth Operator is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>I have found that most hairspray makes my hair feel very crispy and stiff.</li>
            <li>so I could try it with a new style I was doing</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it really does leave hair soft and not frizzy, it doesnt get sticky or hard and hold style in place all day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times since buying it a few days ago and so far it seems kinda ok.  </li>
            <li>it by far better than what you buy at the beauty shops, my hair dresser even said that, also, Not sticky or stiff at all.</li>
            <li>I remember first using it years ago, sense the smell of it takes me back.</li>
            <li>Guardian Angel Flat Iron Balm before straightening and finished it off with a touch of g&amp;ouml;t2b Smooth Operator Smoothing Hairspray before a final run through.</li>
            <li>It will maintain a smooth, straight style, without feeling hard or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this as much as a sister can I had used prior too...</li>
            <li>This spray helps my hair look and feel natural but keeps the curl.</li>
            <li>This is better for natural hold styles, definitely not if you need firm hold.  </li>
            <li>The only downside I&#x27;ve had with it so far is that it tends to clog more frequently but that&#x27;s not a huge deal since all you have to do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other hairsprays and just can&#x27;t be convinced to buy any other.  </li>
            <li>spray is lightweight, not a sharp heavy spray like a regular heavy hairspray would have, the nozzle is very easy to press doesn&#x27;t take much effort to press down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really provide much of a hold although this has yet to be determined as I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m spraying enough of it though I believe I am</li>
            <li>Too much or too little, this product confuses me, not sure if I need to spray more on to give more hold and not sure if I need to use less since it makes my hair weighed down sometimes.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Too much or too little, this product confuses me, not sure if I need to spray more on to give more hold and not sure if I need to use less since it makes my hair weighed down sometimes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not leave your hair super stiff like all other hairsprays but holds it well if you wear it up or curl it.  </li>
            <li> I notice that I have less flyaway hairs by the end of the day, and my normally frizzy hair looks smoother.</li>
            <li> This hairspray made my hair extra wet, which caused it to frizz up after drying, making my styling even more difficult.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s from using too much.  </li>
            <li> I would have to spray, brush through, wait for the hairspray to dry, and the flat iron over the frizzes that it created!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to give an Aquanet type of hold but at least some type of hold &amp; so far I haven&#x27;t seen that.  </li>
            <li> this one leaves your hair wet..</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no staying power from this product.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair that I straighten everyday with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they don&#x27;t carry it at walmart anymore, but I can always find it on amazon;)</li>
            <li> and I believed them because I couldn&#x27;t find it on any other store shelf around.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I&#x27;m not spraying enough of it on my hair.  </li>
            <li> All the other hairsprays made my hair feel stiff and looked extremely dry.</li>
            <li> What conviced my to pay $6 for it over $4 or less for other brand was the smell.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, its not worth the $10.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to weigh my hair down sometimes</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when it was no longer available at the store I always purchased it</li>
            <li> which is why my hair looked a mess the 1st day I used it</li>
            <li> being naturally wavy and somewhat difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> does not have the typical hairspray sticky consistency to it!</li>
            <li> is a small amount.  </li>

            <li> Extra frustrating!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t provide any type of shine although I&#x27;m not sure if it claims to give shine so</li>
            <li> I hate hairspray and usually do not use it at all, but I read some reviews that said this didnt get sticky or hard and kept hair from being frizzy.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, but it&#x27;s holding power is not great.  </li>
            <li> Getting tough to find in stores, thank goodness for amazon!</li>
            <li> sort of made me angry.</li>

            <li> I received a free bottle and I can say this smells amazingly great, unlike every other hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.  This one smells sweet, almost like a light raspberry scent.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, but it&#x27;s holding power is not great.  This is better for natural hold styles, definitely not if you need firm hold.  I never use hairspray because of the obvious alcohol scent, I always end up using mousse or spray gel, but I will keep using this one and see myself buying this hairspray in the future.  I will be layering it with gel or mousse if I need extra holding power.  I received the sample as a BzzAgent as well and I was impressed with the product!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray ! Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and holds my thick hair.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat.  I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I was given this product to test and review. Normally, I use hairspray very infrequently (maybe a couple of times a year). I have been using the got2b smooth operator hairspray on an almost daily basis for over a week, and I have to admit that I really like this product! I have found that most hairspray makes my hair feel very crispy and stiff. The smooth operator hairspray doesn&#x27;t even feel like hairspray! It smells wonderful, is easy to apply, and really smooths my hair without making it stiff. I notice that I have less flyaway hairs by the end of the day, and my normally frizzy hair looks smoother. I will probably continue to use this product in the future and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good smoothing hairspray.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Not too sticky, keeps a hold and is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This hairspray was used in a tutorial I saw on YouTube, so that&#x27;s what made me buy it. SO GLAD I did! It left my curls in tact ALL DAY without feeling sticky. My hair was manageable and it smells soooo good! I wish they made shampoo of this scent!!! I&#x27;m definately sticking to this hairspray ;)</li>
            <li> this hair spray is the best I have ever used. No stickey residue left on your hair. Keeps my hair neat  and manageable. I will order more.</li>
            <li> This hairspray deserves to have five stars. I remember first using it years ago, sense the smell of it takes me back. It smells so good, I sometimes have to stop myself from over spraying. It has a nice, light hold but I wouldn&#x27;t count it as a strong hold hairspray. Even if you spray a lot. I would deeply miss it if I couldn&#x27;t buy it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair since I can remember and I have *literally* never had effects this amazing! I used g&amp;ouml;t2b Guardian Angel Flat Iron Balm before straightening and finished it off with a touch of g&amp;ouml;t2b Smooth Operator Smoothing Hairspray before a final run through. My hair is SO soft right now, I have no visible fly aways or frizzies which is extremely uncommon for my untamable hair, and it is SERIOUSLY straight. The best part is that, while I have used sprays in the past, none of them left my hair feeling this natural! I don&#x27;t feel like there is any caked product sitting on top of my head and I can run my hands through my hair without worrying about getting sticky! I love, love, love these products!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for years and I LOVE IT!  I was really disappointed when it was no longer available at the store I always purchased it, they said they were no longer going to carry this product, I don&#x27;t know why as it always sold out.  I love that it is very light on your hair and holds like super glue and all you have to use is a small amount.  Also, the smell is very nice don&#x27;t have that funk hairspray smell like most of the other ones on the market.  All I know is I hope Amazon continues to sold this product as I LOVE IT!  Oh, I didn&#x27;t even mention the GREAT price, I was able to get this on Amazon cheaper than what I purchased at the store, it was like buy one get one FREE, what could be better than that.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and this seems to be the only hair spray that does not case my scalp to have break outs. I have used it now for several years.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray its amazing. It leaves you hair with a nice hold but not a sticky hold !</li>
            <li> This spray is awesome in that it absolutely leaves my hair controlled, shiny, yet not &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; This hairspray smells so sweet and clean..</li>
            <li> I had initially bought this at a local walmart and fell in love with it. What conviced my to pay $6 for it over $4 or less for other brand was the smell.  I love the smell and it&#x27;s always nice when you get compliments on how good your hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason why I really like it is because the name smooth operator really gives it justice. It does not leave your hair super stiff like all other hairsprays but holds it well if you wear it up or curl it.  It does not leave the white residue once you start messing with your hair throughout the day. I&#x27;ve tried many other hairsprays and just can&#x27;t be convinced to buy any other.  Unfortunately they don&#x27;t carry it at walmart anymore, but I can always find it on amazon;)</li>
            <li> So happy to finally find this product!</li>
            <li> I hate hairspray and usually do not use it at all, but I read some reviews that said this didnt get sticky or hard and kept hair from being frizzy. I bought it so I could try it with a new style I was doing and I am in love with it. It smells amazing and it really does leave hair soft and not frizzy, it doesnt get sticky or hard and hold style in place all day! :) I will continue using this and only this hair spray and definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite hairspray and I can&#x27;t get it in stores anymore so I ordered five cans.  I love the scent and it holds without being tacky.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this as much as a sister can I had used prior too...this one leaves your hair wet..</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve found for my naturally curly hair. I want my curls to hold but not look sticky. This spray helps my hair look and feel natural but keeps the curl. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is all about. This hairspray does not smell particularly amazing. I would describe the scent as being a light mixture of cotton candy and bubblegum. There is absolutely no staying power from this product. From all the great reviews, I was expecting a unique product. In my opinion, its not worth the $10.&lt;br /&gt;I have to mention that my hair is more on the frizzy side... being naturally wavy and somewhat difficult to manage. This hairspray made my hair extra wet, which caused it to frizz up after drying, making my styling even more difficult. I would have to spray, brush through, wait for the hairspray to dry, and the flat iron over the frizzes that it created! Extra frustrating!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair that I straighten everyday with a flat iron.  I have tried MANY hairsprays.  This is the only one that works.  It will maintain a smooth, straight style, without feeling hard or sticky.  If you don&#x27;t like the style, you can brush it out without any fear of flakes.  It holds fly away hairs in place without giving you a stiff look.  Love this finishing spray!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff; great fragrance, great non-stiff or sticky hold &amp; doesn&#x27;t make my forehead break out if i spray it too close to my hairline. Getting tough to find in stores, thank goodness for amazon!</li>
            <li> smells amazing and helps keep frizz down, and helps keep my hair feeling soft! does not have the typical hairspray sticky consistency to it!</li>
            <li> bought this hairspray at Walmart and it has since been discontinued. So happy I found it, bought a few cans to last me a while.</li>
            <li> I got this hairspray, wanting to find a nice one that holds well but smells good. I like my hair smelling good, not like hairspray. This is pretty nice, smells kinda like candy, but nice. I don&#x27;t think it adds a shine like I was hoping, the hold is pretty good. I think you&#x27;d have to spray a decent amount for it to hold up in windy conditions, bc maybe I didn&#x27;t, which is why my hair looked a mess the 1st day I used it &amp; I was outside all day in the wind. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s discontinued bc I&#x27;ve never seen it at stores &amp; mine didn&#x27;t come with the charm either! Not like I&#x27;d want it anyway. My can was kinda dinged up too, prolly from shippping, but my can seemed sticky? so I don&#x27;t know. Its nice, smells good, but I dont think I&#x27;ll be buying it again, still on the hunt for a good smelling, hard holding spray!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that I can still run my fingers thru my hair and it isn&#x27;t sticky all day...and it smells great!!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this hairspray, rite aid, cvs, walgreens and walmart quit carrying it, I called the toll free number on the can they said call amazon, I did, now I am waiting for my 3 cans to be delivered by mail, real easy dont have to look for it anymore, please, please do not let them quit making it, it by far better than what you buy at the beauty shops, my hair dresser even said that, also, Not sticky or stiff at all. I give it a 10 plus, plus. Joan Scott in newport news va.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything great, but mine did not come with a charm. I&#x27;ll keep looking for a better hair straightening product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use hairspray everyday and I&#x27;ve gone through many different brands over the years and could never find one I really liked. All the other hairsprays made my hair feel stiff and looked extremely dry. Got2b Smooth Operator is the complete opposite. It smells absolutely wonderful and leaves your hair feeling soft and shiny. The only downside I&#x27;ve had with it so far is that it tends to clog more frequently but that&#x27;s not a huge deal since all you have to do is run the nozzle under warm water.</li>
            <li> I Used to buy it from Wal-Mart Until it mysteriously disappeared from the shelf. I asked a sales person what happened and they said it was discontinued and I believed them because I couldn&#x27;t find it on any other store shelf around. sort of made me angry. and now I find it online. why is it not found In most FL stores? what&#x27;s going on? plz plz plz get it back on the shelf&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times since buying it a few days ago and so far it seems kinda ok.  I&#x27;m not so sure it provides enough hold on my hair and I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I&#x27;m not spraying enough of it on my hair.  I don&#x27;t expect it to give an Aquanet type of hold but at least some type of hold &amp; so far I haven&#x27;t seen that.  I have to experiment more with it-this alone sends up red flags for me if I have to do this if it&#x27;s not doing what it claims to do after the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a pleasant smell, almost like a light sweet perfume smell, not overpowering, smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray is lightweight, not a sharp heavy spray like a regular heavy hairspray would have, the nozzle is very easy to press doesn&#x27;t take much effort to press down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is easy to store, looks nice, isn&#x27;t a large bulky hairspray bottle.  Looks cool on my dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really provide much of a hold although this has yet to be determined as I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m spraying enough of it though I believe I am but we shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t provide any type of shine although I&#x27;m not sure if it claims to give shine so I can&#x27;t really totally knock it for that one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to weigh my hair down sometimes but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s from using too much.  Too much or too little, this product confuses me, not sure if I need to spray more on to give more hold and not sure if I need to use less since it makes my hair weighed down sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair so I may need to use more on my hair, it may have to do with the hair type in terms of who it works for.</li>
