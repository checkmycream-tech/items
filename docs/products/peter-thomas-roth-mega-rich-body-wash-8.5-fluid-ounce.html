            <li>The bottle lasts quite a while and it makes your skin feel really good.</li>
            <li>This is a good price</li>
            <li>It smells so good, almost like aromatherapy with a hint of orange and lemon, and sugar.  </li>
            <li>We stayed in a Hilton in Nashville, and I loved the shower gel, shampoo, conditioner &amp; body</li>
            <li>but I find this to be a superior product and will continue to use...</li>
            <li>Bought this because of all the good reviews and was looking forward to receiving it and trying it out.  </li>
            <li>It does not lather good at all and because of that you have to use a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>and I loved the smell.</li>
            <li>Found this product in a hotel somewhere and had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothest body gel I have tried to date and smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;Price is a bit on the steep side</li>
            <li>Good for people who are looking for both.</li>
            <li>smells good, and leaves you refreshed.</li>
            <li>Came across this product at Hilton Hotels and loved it.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful shower gel, non-drying, luxurious, lightly scented.</li>
            <li>Beautiful citrus aroma, love the popping beads.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job :-)&lt;br /&gt;Fell</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the lather, great product.</li>
            <li>Very clean smell, great for both men and women.</li>
            <li>the wash is fine, but the lotion&#x27;s scent lingers beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, leaves skin soft and great price!  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>you well love it TOO!</li>
            <li>It works into a very nice lather, rinses cleanly and smells good, with a hint of citrus.  </li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>In September,the Hilton in SF had it with their bath products and I smelled it and really liked the smell and decided to try it and as soon as I got home</li>
            <li>Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase the wash again myself--but it is a nice product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much for a wonderful lather with a citrus scent</li>
            <li>Good luck finding anything better.</li>
            <li>and I liked the moisturizing and scrubbing effect.</li>
            <li>This was stocked at our hotel in Dublin and one that both my husband and I liked the smell and texture of.</li>
            <li>Kind of like citrus</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you want an excellent cleanser, and the companion Mega Rich lotion is just as good.</li>
            <li>First experienced this bath gel at a hotel and loved it.</li>
            <li>Smells so clean and refreshing and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Great citrus fresh smelling shampoo without feeling like you have perfume on.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the fresh smell and great lather.</li>
            <li>I first experienced this when I stayed in a Hilton.  </li>
            <li>I too first experienced this wash while staying at a Hilton, but in LA.  </li>
            <li>used it at the hilton sydney and liked it alot.smells great and is highly concentrated.</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and clean and it feels great on the body.</li>
            <li>Just love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>so well I had to get more.</li>
            <li>in love with PTR products because Hilton Hotels uses them as samples.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent.  </li>
            <li>Most body washes that moisturize have a \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; or floral smell</li>
            <li>I love this bodywash.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap...</li>

            <li>I love this body wash and have always purchased it from Sephora.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While in the shower I unscrewed the lid, prepared to grab the flap and peel off the seal from the top</li>
            <li>LOVE this body wash found it while staying at a Hilton</li>
            <li>Great scent and very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I was introduced to it at Hilton&#x27;s where I stay for business and love that I can get it for my home on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just love the fragrance</li>
            <li>Love the smell and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product before, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love body wash.</li>
            <li>However, this appears to be a specialty item that Amazon has the most affordable price.  </li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>discovered this brand in Hilton hotels and fell in love with it ever after.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is what grabbed me more than anything.</li>
            <li>it helps to wake me up and get going.:)</li>
            <li>Love the lemon-grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the product and the service.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>I found it at the Hilton Hotel in Budapest, and I wanted more than just the samples from the hotel.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing &amp; Moisturizing...</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized - more so than the &#x27;popular&#x27; moisturizing shower gels/ body soaps out there</li>
            <li>It has a really  nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>First used this as a trial bottle in a hotel - loved it.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite body wash!!</li>
            <li>I am glad to see it is now available for purchase.  </li>
            <li>It gives you an extra burst of energy in the morning with its brilliant smell and micro-scrubbing beads.</li>
            <li>Fresh, nice smell....</li>
            <li>Feels good, smells great and exfoliates just a little.</li>
            <li>The seal isn&#x27;t easy to remove and I can&#x27;t see that happening on</li>
            <li>Great product...got acquainted with it by staying at the Hilton in Moorea, French Polynesia.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so soft and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like shower gels that lather a lot so this one&#x27;s really fine.</li>
            <li>I, too love smell on him and whole bathroom as well!!</li>
            <li>I went on PTR&#x27;s site to buy it, but it wasn&#x27;t available for sale yet.    </li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample and has lasted me a while.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it in a larger size, and I&#x27;ll keep ordering this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m found this on-line at a cheaper price, Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Going to purchase more, very soon!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>Just very clean and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>He love so much this product, he brought home, gave me bottle to purchase for him!</li>
            <li>I first tried PTR product on a vacation and fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li>I first came across PTR&#x27;s body wash in a 5 star hotel (one of the many I stay in per annum).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crisp, citrus-sy and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The original has a pamplemousse fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>will be coming back for more, for sure!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>suds galore clean citrus scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but a bit pricey for not doing much.</li>
            <li>It has a very distinctive and refreshing fragance.  </li>
            <li>I loved it and this is the second time that I am purchasing a full size via Amazon.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have two other favourite brands but for now, I am happy with this.</li>
            <li>Rich, fresh, with vitamins beads.</li>
            <li>love this product, it works really well, smells good and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>skin feels fresh, clean and nourished.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin fresh and has a fabulous fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I would love to see this in more places than just here on Amazon like at a big box store.  </li>
            <li>This product has a fresh citrus scent, not sickly or synthetic in nature.</li>
            <li>I first tried this at a hotel in London and since that day, nothing compared to how smooth and moisturized this body wash leaves your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice clean feeling</li>
            <li>We first found these in some of the upper level Hiltons in Europe, and found this product here on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li>(so does my daughter), it&#x27;s so fresh and not over-powering.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and has a fresh, not perfumed, scent.</li>
            <li>when I use it I feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Has a gentle citrus-like smell and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The price is right too on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Masculine but could easily be a unisex fragrance.</li>
            <li>it is much more expensive than the mass-produced brands but using it is a joy.</li>
            <li>First used at a Hilton condo in Florida.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Peter Roth products and love this products.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more of this when it runs out.</li>
            <li>First sampled it in a NYC hotel.</li>
            <li>First tried this product while staying at a hotel in Louisville, KY.</li>
            <li>I first got some of these in the Hilton Hotels.  </li>
            <li>The micro-beads act exactly as described...</li>
            <li>I first ran across this bodywash when I was staying in a Hilton Hotel in Barcelona.</li>
            <li>I first used this shampoo in a Hilton hotel.</li>
            <li>Difficult to get in Europe but the best body wash ever.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll save $5 as it sells for $18 pretty much everywhere else</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but gets me clean and smells like grapefruit, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>and it really does help to moisterize.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real product.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty masculine smell to it which is something I appreciate.</li>
            <li>The price point of $18 is not worth it, this should be more in the $8 range.  </li>
            <li>Yes, a tad more expensive than most</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s irony in the fact that most reviewers became acquainted with it as a hotel freebie, because its lousy to carry when you&#x27;re traveling.  </li>
            <li>Expensive for the amount, but really does smell great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re always quick showers because it&#x27;s a relatively short 1.5 hour ride where we don&#x27;t get too sweaty.  </li>
            <li>and I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight after my shower.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Seems to be highly concentrated</li>
            <li>I bought 3 to make the ridiculous postage worth it, and so glad i did.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and I will definitely be looking at their other products now!</li>
            <li>this soap was at a hotel in New orleans.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great pick me up in the morning especially if you&#x27;re feeling slightly tired.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer bar soap over shower gel but LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Plus, it actually is different from most other body washes with the bead effect.  </li>
            <li>using it as a treat on occasions only (say, when I am very happy or very sad.</li>
            <li>you always wanting more so only wish it cost less.....</li>
            <li>It really cleans the skin as do all of the facial products as well.</li>
            <li>The packaging is suitably masculine.</li>
            <li>but as the old adage goes, \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The moisturizing/exfoliating beads in the product get stuck in the tiny opening of the cap, rendering it very difficult/</li>
            <li>As noted by others, the little beads frequently prevent full closure of the spout and you end up with all of your toiletries floating around in your plastic bag immersed in shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind a little indulgence if it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I love the fresh orange smell, the fact that it lathers up like crazy (making a container last longer than any other shower gel I have ever used) and it is well tolerated by my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After using it a couple of times its pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li>She was using L&#x27;Occitane (loves the verbena smell), but she really likes the little beads that provide some exfoliation as she scrubs</li>
            <li>Further, the bottle itself is very slippery if it gets even a little soap on it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does a great job :-)&lt;br /&gt;Fell</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the lather, great product.</li>
            <li> Very clean smell, great for both men and women.</li>
            <li> the wash is fine, but the lotion&#x27;s scent lingers beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Great smell, leaves skin soft and great price!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite body wash!  </li>
            <li> Most amazing body wash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Had to get more!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> So glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> you well love it TOO!</li>
            <li> It works into a very nice lather, rinses cleanly and smells good, with a hint of citrus.  </li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> In September,the Hilton in SF had it with their bath products and I smelled it and really liked the smell and decided to try it and as soon as I got home</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase the wash again myself--but it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much for a wonderful lather with a citrus scent</li>
            <li> Good luck finding anything better.</li>
            <li> and I liked the moisturizing and scrubbing effect.</li>
            <li> This was stocked at our hotel in Dublin and one that both my husband and I liked the smell and texture of.</li>
            <li> Kind of like citrus</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you want an excellent cleanser, and the companion Mega Rich lotion is just as good.</li>
            <li> First experienced this bath gel at a hotel and loved it.</li>
            <li> Smells so clean and refreshing and is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great citrus fresh smelling shampoo without feeling like you have perfume on.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the fresh smell and great lather.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this when I stayed in a Hilton.  </li>
            <li> I too first experienced this wash while staying at a Hilton, but in LA.  </li>
            <li> used it at the hilton sydney and liked it alot.smells great and is highly concentrated.</li>

            <li> Just love this body wash.  </li>
            <li> so well I had to get more.</li>
            <li> in love with PTR products because Hilton Hotels uses them as samples.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent.  </li>
            <li> Most body washes that moisturize have a \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; or floral smell</li>
            <li> I love this bodywash.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap...</li>

            <li> I love this body wash and have always purchased it from Sephora.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While in the shower I unscrewed the lid, prepared to grab the flap and peel off the seal from the top</li>
            <li> LOVE this body wash found it while staying at a Hilton</li>
            <li> Great scent and very hydrating.  </li>

            <li> Love the smell and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love body wash.</li>
            <li> However, this appears to be a specialty item that Amazon has the most affordable price.  </li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> discovered this brand in Hilton hotels and fell in love with it ever after.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is what grabbed me more than anything.</li>
            <li> it helps to wake me up and get going.:)</li>
            <li> Love the lemon-grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the product and the service.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> I found it at the Hilton Hotel in Budapest, and I wanted more than just the samples from the hotel.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing &amp; Moisturizing...</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized - more so than the &#x27;popular&#x27; moisturizing shower gels/ body soaps out there</li>
            <li> It has a really  nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> First used this as a trial bottle in a hotel - loved it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite body wash!!</li>
            <li> I am glad to see it is now available for purchase.  </li>
            <li> It gives you an extra burst of energy in the morning with its brilliant smell and micro-scrubbing beads.</li>
            <li> Fresh, nice smell....</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells great and exfoliates just a little.</li>
            <li> The seal isn&#x27;t easy to remove and I can&#x27;t see that happening on</li>
            <li> Great product...got acquainted with it by staying at the Hilton in Moorea, French Polynesia.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so soft and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shower gels that lather a lot so this one&#x27;s really fine.</li>
            <li> I, too love smell on him and whole bathroom as well!!</li>
            <li> I went on PTR&#x27;s site to buy it, but it wasn&#x27;t available for sale yet.    </li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample and has lasted me a while.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find it in a larger size, and I&#x27;ll keep ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m found this on-line at a cheaper price, Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Going to purchase more, very soon!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> Just very clean and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> He love so much this product, he brought home, gave me bottle to purchase for him!</li>
            <li> I first tried PTR product on a vacation and fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li> I first came across PTR&#x27;s body wash in a 5 star hotel (one of the many I stay in per annum).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crisp, citrus-sy and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The original has a pamplemousse fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> will be coming back for more, for sure!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> suds galore clean citrus scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but a bit pricey for not doing much.</li>
            <li> It has a very distinctive and refreshing fragance.  </li>
            <li> I loved it and this is the second time that I am purchasing a full size via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Worth the money and worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have two other favourite brands but for now, I am happy with this.</li>
            <li> Rich, fresh, with vitamins beads.</li>
            <li> love this product, it works really well, smells good and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> skin feels fresh, clean and nourished.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin fresh and has a fabulous fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I would love to see this in more places than just here on Amazon like at a big box store.  </li>
            <li> This product has a fresh citrus scent, not sickly or synthetic in nature.</li>
            <li> I first tried this at a hotel in London and since that day, nothing compared to how smooth and moisturized this body wash leaves your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a nice clean feeling</li>
            <li> We first found these in some of the upper level Hiltons in Europe, and found this product here on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li> (so does my daughter), it&#x27;s so fresh and not over-powering.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and has a fresh, not perfumed, scent.</li>
            <li> when I use it I feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Has a gentle citrus-like smell and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The price is right too on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Masculine but could easily be a unisex fragrance.</li>
            <li> it is much more expensive than the mass-produced brands but using it is a joy.</li>
            <li> First used at a Hilton condo in Florida.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Peter Roth products and love this products.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be getting more of this when it runs out.</li>
            <li> First sampled it in a NYC hotel.</li>
            <li> First tried this product while staying at a hotel in Louisville, KY.</li>
            <li> I first got some of these in the Hilton Hotels.  </li>
            <li> The micro-beads act exactly as described...</li>
            <li> I first ran across this bodywash when I was staying in a Hilton Hotel in Barcelona.</li>
            <li> I first used this shampoo in a Hilton hotel.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get in Europe but the best body wash ever.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll save $5 as it sells for $18 pretty much everywhere else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but gets me clean and smells like grapefruit, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> and it really does help to moisterize.  </li>
            <li> This is not the real product.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty masculine smell to it which is something I appreciate.</li>
            <li> The price point of $18 is not worth it, this should be more in the $8 range.  </li>
            <li> Yes, a tad more expensive than most</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s irony in the fact that most reviewers became acquainted with it as a hotel freebie, because its lousy to carry when you&#x27;re traveling.  </li>
            <li> Expensive for the amount, but really does smell great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re always quick showers because it&#x27;s a relatively short 1.5 hour ride where we don&#x27;t get too sweaty.  </li>
            <li> and I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight after my shower.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Seems to be highly concentrated</li>
            <li> I bought 3 to make the ridiculous postage worth it, and so glad i did.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and I will definitely be looking at their other products now!</li>
            <li> this soap was at a hotel in New orleans.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great pick me up in the morning especially if you&#x27;re feeling slightly tired.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer bar soap over shower gel but LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Plus, it actually is different from most other body washes with the bead effect.  </li>
            <li> using it as a treat on occasions only (say, when I am very happy or very sad.</li>
            <li> you always wanting more so only wish it cost less.....</li>
            <li> It really cleans the skin as do all of the facial products as well.</li>
            <li> The packaging is suitably masculine.</li>
            <li> but as the old adage goes, \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The moisturizing/exfoliating beads in the product get stuck in the tiny opening of the cap, rendering it very difficult/</li>
            <li> As noted by others, the little beads frequently prevent full closure of the spout and you end up with all of your toiletries floating around in your plastic bag immersed in shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind a little indulgence if it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I love the fresh orange smell, the fact that it lathers up like crazy (making a container last longer than any other shower gel I have ever used) and it is well tolerated by my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After using it a couple of times its pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> She was using L&#x27;Occitane (loves the verbena smell), but she really likes the little beads that provide some exfoliation as she scrubs</li>
            <li> Further, the bottle itself is very slippery if it gets even a little soap on it.  </li>
            <li> and my skin would normally be dry and itchy, this soap helps eliminate all that and does not dry out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So a bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Scent is long lasting as people have often complimented me at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I do have occasional minor psoriasis-type flare ups.  </li>
            <li> The result - the bottle squirts out of your hand while you are trying to squeeze it hard enough to clear the logjam of the moisturizing/exfoliating beads in the tiny bottlecap opening.  </li>
            <li> although the seller will be packing it carefully, the fluid might still come out a bit when you get it.</li>
            <li> and I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It doesnt contain alcohol, so it doesnt dry out your skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and sometimes I forget to put on lotion after I get out of the shower or just don&#x27;t have time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have chronically dry skin or anything</li>
            <li> what an experience, this body wash clearly out performs the average ones on the market You do not need a lot of product on your shower puff a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> body wash has a slight grapefruit smell and you only have to use a couple of drops to make a lot of suds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed in the winter when it is very dry</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t purchase any other body wash...</li>
            <li> Will not buy from this seller again due to falsehood.</li>
            <li> what a morning eye opener no need for any other body wash cleans well moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> My co-workers also seem to like it because I noticed it was getting used by others and was almost empty!  </li>
            <li> So, don&#x27;t bother looking at other websites.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers, I came to know this product in one of my stays at the Hilton.  </li>
            <li> Also, a little body wash on a sponge goes a long way so don&#x27;t waste it.  </li>
            <li> this product line never let&#x27;s me down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t a bad product, but nothing special, and definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously used the lotion, so</li>
            <li> Slightly imperfect bottle design then,</li>
            <li> Would have rated it 5 stars but a little pricey</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d save a little money buying it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey for the amount,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the little sample in the shower at work after my noon bike ride.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for a bath wash</li>
            <li> Not sure that he is going to like it after I smelled it.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried a small sample from Hilton hotel on my stay in Minneapolis and was amazed.  </li>
            <li> If it was a little less expensive, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> and this body wash keeps my skin hydrated for a at least 48 hours after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Being a male, one thing I hate about  </li>
            <li> I believe these are either fake or expired goods.</li>
            <li> The reason I give it 2 Stars to say &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it.&amp;#34; is because this is a fake.</li>
            <li> almost impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> BAD BUSINESS</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased for my husband,he got a from Hilton hotel. He love so much this product, he brought home, gave me bottle to purchase for him! I, too love smell on him and whole bathroom as well!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not so attractive.</li>
            <li> great fragrance and lather</li>
            <li> Just love this body wash.  First used at a Hilton condo in Florida.  I liked it so well I had to get more.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this when I stayed in a Hilton.  Afterwards, I looked for this in the stores, but could not find them.  Finally, I bought this from Amazon. It has a wonderful refreshing fragrance which sticks in your memory.  I recommend this if you like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Def recommend to anybody.  Does a great job :-)&lt;br /&gt;Fell in love with PTR products because Hilton Hotels uses them as samples.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer bar soap over shower gel but LOVE this stuff.  I am glad to see it is now available for purchase.  I stay at Hiltons quite a bit and they started carrying PTR products recently.  In September,the Hilton in SF had it with their bath products and I smelled it and really liked the smell and decided to try it and as soon as I got home I went on PTR&#x27;s site to buy it, but it wasn&#x27;t available for sale yet.    I like the beads and I have dry skin and it really does help to moisterize.  Being a male, one thing I hate about  alot of body wash&#x27;s is the smell.  I LOVE the scent.  Most body washes that moisturize have a \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; or floral smell and this doesn&#x27;t.  It has a pretty masculine smell to it which is something I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on accident, thinking it was the face scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t a bad product, but nothing special, and definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this bodywash. Its great, smells good and lasts all day. It doesnt contain alcohol, so it doesnt dry out your skin and it just works. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this body wash. The bottle lasts quite a while and it makes your skin feel really good.</li>
            <li> I first tried PTR product on a vacation and fell in love with the scent.  I&#x27;d previously used the lotion, so I figured why not the wash---the wash is fine, but the lotion&#x27;s scent lingers beautifully.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase the wash again myself--but it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap...great citrus smell.  I&#x27;ve also noticed in the winter when it is very dry and my skin would normally be dry and itchy, this soap helps eliminate all that and does not dry out.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase any other body wash...this is the best there is.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the lather, great product. You only have to use a tiny bit. So a bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Perhaps anything I use will not combat my issues. The product has a pleasant smell though. I haven&#x27;t found that miracle bath wash/soap yet.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!! Smells so clean and refreshing and is a great moisturizer. This is a good price and I cannot get locally. Please don&#x27;t stop carrying this product!!!</li>
            <li> I first came across PTR&#x27;s body wash in a 5 star hotel (one of the many I stay in per annum).  It gives you an extra burst of energy in the morning with its brilliant smell and micro-scrubbing beads.</li>
            <li> body wash has a slight grapefruit smell and you only have to use a couple of drops to make a lot of suds.  this is the only one I will use now.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body wash!  I will be ordering this again and will also get the lotion too!  It smells so good, almost like aromatherapy with a hint of orange and lemon, and sugar.  My skin feel great after!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Peter Roth products and love this products. It really cleans the skin as do all of the facial products as well. The price is right too on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so great and is a perfect texture for a body wash. Goes on and comes off well. Leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> We stayed in a Hilton in Nashville, and I loved the shower gel, shampoo, conditioner &amp; body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I went online to get the best deal, and was so happy to get the products home!</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times because it has a citrus and pomelo fragrance. However, the products I received smells like Dettol. I believe these are either fake or expired goods.</li>
            <li> Yes, a tad more expensive than most but I find this to be a superior product and will continue to use...</li>
            <li> She was using L&#x27;Occitane (loves the verbena smell), but she really likes the little beads that provide some exfoliation as she scrubs and they dissolve to release whatever&#x27;s in them. We first found these in some of the upper level Hiltons in Europe, and found this product here on Amazon at a good price. Feels good, smells great and exfoliates just a little. My wife loves it - I can&#x27;t argue with that!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body wash. I got this as a free sample and has lasted me a while. It&#x27;s such a nice clean feeling and I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight after my shower. It smells nice and I will definitely be looking at their other products now! Would have rated it 5 stars but a little pricey, even thought I&#x27;m still going to buy the bigger bottle..</li>
            <li> This product has a fresh citrus scent, not sickly or synthetic in nature. Masculine but could easily be a unisex fragrance. A little goes a long way and I&#x27;d advise using the product with a body sponge or face cloth. Leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized - more so than the &#x27;popular&#x27; moisturizing shower gels/ body soaps out there (you know who you are!). Scent is long lasting as people have often complimented me at the end of the day. It&#x27;s a great pick me up in the morning especially if you&#x27;re feeling slightly tired. The packaging is suitably masculine. I will definitely be getting more of this when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Fresh, nice smell.... Great Product! Discovered this shower gel while beeing in NZ at Hilton Taupo. Good value for the money!</li>
            <li> love this product, it works really well, smells good and the bottle lasts a long time. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> So just like almost everyone else who has reviewed this product, I was introduced to it during a business trip that included a stay in a Hilton Hotel. I loved it and this is the second time that I am purchasing a full size via Amazon. I love the fresh orange smell, the fact that it lathers up like crazy (making a container last longer than any other shower gel I have ever used) and it is well tolerated by my sensitive skin. Will be buying it over and over.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping , great product.</li>
            <li> I love the lemony fragrance of these shower gel as well as how it feels on my skin.  First sampled it in a NYC hotel.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash and have always purchased it from Sephora. I thought I&#x27;d save a little money buying it on Amazon. It took a week longer to get it from Amazon but you&#x27;ll save $5 as it sells for $18 pretty much everywhere else (Macy&#x27;s, Sephora, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in the shower I unscrewed the lid, prepared to grab the flap and peel off the seal from the top but there wasn&#x27;t a seal. I looked in the lid and there it was. The seal isn&#x27;t easy to remove and I can&#x27;t see that happening on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> First used this as a trial bottle in a hotel - loved it. It&#x27;s really great stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is the best body wash i have ever used! Makes your skin feel so soft and smells amazing! Wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product...got acquainted with it by staying at the Hilton in Moorea, French Polynesia.  Every time I use it, it takes me back.  There&#x27;s irony in the fact that most reviewers became acquainted with it as a hotel freebie, because its lousy to carry when you&#x27;re traveling.  As noted by others, the little beads frequently prevent full closure of the spout and you end up with all of your toiletries floating around in your plastic bag immersed in shampoo.</li>
            <li> Most amazing body wash I&#x27;ve ever used! I first tried this at a hotel in London and since that day, nothing compared to how smooth and moisturized this body wash leaves your skin. When I arrived back to the states, I looked online for this product and ordered it immediately. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and sometimes I forget to put on lotion after I get out of the shower or just don&#x27;t have time and this body wash keeps my skin hydrated for a at least 48 hours after taking a shower. Worth the money and worth a try! I am in LOVE with this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE this body wash found it while staying at a Hilton and now i can&#x27;t use anything else it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Great scent and very hydrating.  I don&#x27;t have chronically dry skin or anything but I can tell a difference.  I do have occasional minor psoriasis-type flare ups.  I use a prescription spray called Clobex for a day or two and it goes away.  This body wash helps moisturize my skin.  (If I eat eggs too often, it seems to trigger flare ups--just passing that along.)  I definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I was introduced to it at Hilton&#x27;s where I stay for business and love that I can get it for my home on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just wish that it came in an even lArger size. Introduced to it At a Hilton hotel. Doesn&#x27;t take much for a wonderful lather with a citrus scent</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the good reviews and was looking forward to receiving it and trying it out.  After using it a couple of times its pretty much a waste of money. It does not lather good at all and because of that you have to use a lot of it.  The price point of $18 is not worth it, this should be more in the $8 range.  Buyer beware on this product.</li>
            <li> this soap was at a hotel in New orleans. I kept the bottle and searched for it online. Of course Amazon had it.  It&#x27;s crisp, citrus-sy and refreshing. Love it!</li>
            <li> I had a sample from the Hilton in San Antonio TX and I loved the smell. When I bought the bigger bottle the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to stay with you and I also used the lotion.</li>
            <li> Best body wash out there! Good luck finding anything better. Makes your skin fresh and has a fabulous fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Found this product in a hotel somewhere and had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothest body gel I have tried to date and smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;Price is a bit on the steep side but I am not one to shower twice a day.</li>
            <li> Did not like it compared to Molton Brown or Thann products.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING!! Smells like mandarin and is intoxicating on your body - you wont want to use anything else!!</li>
            <li> The reason I give it 2 Stars to say &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it.&amp;#34; is because this is a fake. This is not the real product. Not in color, texture or fragrance. Especially fragrance. The original has a pamplemousse fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;*Disappointed because it was to be a gift but now I will not insult them with this imposter. Will not buy from this seller again due to falsehood. BAD BUSINESS</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love It !!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell, the feel, the foam....it&#x27;s all wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for creating a great product !&lt;br /&gt;I will be coming back for more, for sure!</li>
            <li> The wonder of product placement in hotels - I tried this while staying at a Hilton Hotel... wow! Just love the fragrance (so does my daughter), it&#x27;s so fresh and not over-powering. Ended up buying it from Amazon. I have two other favourite brands but for now, I am happy with this. I don&#x27;t like shower gels that lather a lot so this one&#x27;s really fine. Highly recommended. I like the shampoo and body lotion too.</li>
            <li> First tried this product while staying at a hotel in Louisville, KY. Had to get more! Love the smell and how it makes my skin feel! This is my new favorite body wash!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before, and I love it.  I was happy to find it in a larger size, and I&#x27;ll keep ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Every time I stay at the Hilton I use it. So glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I tried these at a hotel and I liked the moisturizing and scrubbing effect. Good for people who are looking for both. Ordered a big bottle when I got home and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kept it from 5 stars? I&#x27;ve used about 1/3 of it and it seems the opening at the cap where the body wash is squeezed out is stuck. The scrubbing particles inside probably cased a blockage there. Slightly imperfect bottle design then, but that&#x27;s not a knock on the body wash itself (and I continued using it by unscrewing the cap).</li>
            <li> excellent. used it at the hilton sydney and liked it alot.smells great and is highly concentrated. i also recommend the shampoo by peter thomas roth.</li>
            <li> I first got some of these in the Hilton Hotels.  I fell in love with the fresh smell and great lather.</li>
            <li> Expensive for the amount, but really does smell great. wish it had a thicker lather.</li>
            <li> This was stocked at our hotel in Dublin and one that both my husband and I liked the smell and texture of. I am very pleased with the Peter Thomas Body Wash and really happy I could find it on Amazon.  It was a little pricey for the amount, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> What an Excellent body Wash! Seems to be highly concentrated what an experience, this body wash clearly out performs the average ones on the market You do not need a lot of product on your shower puff a little goes a long way suds galore clean citrus scent what a morning eye opener no need for any other body wash cleans well moisturizes your skin.I will only buy this product. So happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I too first experienced this wash while staying at a Hilton, but in LA.  I&#x27;ve been using the little sample in the shower at work after my noon bike ride.  They&#x27;re always quick showers because it&#x27;s a relatively short 1.5 hour ride where we don&#x27;t get too sweaty.  But, using this wash, I always feel energized and refreshed.  It has a really  nice clean scent.  The wash doesn&#x27;t lather up a lot for me, but I use just a tiny amount since it&#x27;s a short shower.  My co-workers also seem to like it because I noticed it was getting used by others and was almost empty!  So now I&#x27;m buying a bottle to replenish the supply.  It&#x27;s a little pricey for a bath wash but I don&#x27;t mind a little indulgence if it&#x27;s worth it.  If it was a little less expensive, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  Actually compared to Nuetrogena, it&#x27;s not that much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I love body wash. the smell is good!</li>
            <li> Discovered this while staying at a Hilton over a year ago--it was the body wash provided in the room. Found it on Amazon and I have been using it ever since. Has a gentle citrus-like smell and leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my son in law. Not sure that he is going to like it after I smelled it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful citrus aroma, love the popping beads.  I bought 3 to make the ridiculous postage worth it, and so glad i did.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried a small sample from Hilton hotel on my stay in Minneapolis and was amazed.  So, I had to purchase this and also give this as gift to my sister.  Well, the scent is citric with microbeads that burst upon scrubbing on your body.  This is not at all feminine so I would recommend it to guys.  Plus, it actually is different from most other body washes with the bead effect.  Also, a little body wash on a sponge goes a long way so don&#x27;t waste it.  I would love to see this in more places than just here on Amazon like at a big box store.  However, this appears to be a specialty item that Amazon has the most affordable price.  So, don&#x27;t bother looking at other websites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m found this on-line at a cheaper price, Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Going to purchase more, very soon!&lt;br /&gt;Try it you well love it TOO!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this producer by stain at Hilton hotel, I like their shampoo and conditioner, so I figured to try this also, I was not disappointed. smells good, and leaves you refreshed.</li>
            <li> The micro-beads act exactly as described...skin feels fresh, clean and nourished.  Wonderful scent! Will purchase this body wash again for self or as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. It smells very fresh and clean and it feels great on the body. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Came across this product at Hilton Hotels and loved it. It lathers well and has a fresh, not perfumed, scent.</li>
            <li> great moisturizing, and pleasant smell</li>
            <li> discovered this brand in Hilton hotels and fell in love with it ever after. it is much more expensive than the mass-produced brands but using it is a joy. great smell! using it as a treat on occasions only (say, when I am very happy or very sad. lol.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note although the seller will be packing it carefully, the fluid might still come out a bit when you get it. just wash it off. no big deal.</li>
            <li> First experienced this bath gel at a hotel and loved it. The fragrance is what grabbed me more than anything. After a restless, sleepless night....it helps to wake me up and get going.:)</li>
            <li> Does not do anymore than the washes I buy at the local store. Smells like grapefruit. It&#x27;s ok but a bit pricey for not doing much.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shower gel, non-drying, luxurious, lightly scented. Definitely worth a try if you want an excellent cleanser, and the companion Mega Rich lotion is just as good.</li>
            <li> I first ran across this bodywash when I was staying in a Hilton Hotel in Barcelona. Love the lemon-grapefruit scent. Spendy...but as the old adage goes, \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the product and the service. Everything went well. I am happy with my purchase and with purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great smell, leaves skin soft and great price!  Also lathers well. Will definitely buy again!....this product line never let&#x27;s me down.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful! Kind of like citrus, maybe grapefruit? Just very clean and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> I first used this shampoo in a Hilton hotel. Great citrus fresh smelling shampoo without feeling like you have perfume on. Great for guys.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers, I came to know this product in one of my stays at the Hilton.  It has a very distinctive and refreshing fragance.  Grapefruit?</li>
            <li> I like it. when I use it I feel fresh. I would totally recommend it to any one in hart beat</li>
            <li> The product, featured in Hilton Hotels, is great!  It works into a very nice lather, rinses cleanly and smells good, with a hint of citrus.  The problem is the bottle.  The moisturizing/exfoliating beads in the product get stuck in the tiny opening of the cap, rendering it very difficult/almost impossible to use.  Further, the bottle itself is very slippery if it gets even a little soap on it.  The result - the bottle squirts out of your hand while you are trying to squeeze it hard enough to clear the logjam of the moisturizing/exfoliating beads in the tiny bottlecap opening.  For a premium product, this is simply unacceptable.</li>
            <li> The best body gel ever!!</li>
            <li> I found it at the Hilton Hotel in Budapest, and I wanted more than just the samples from the hotel.  This stuff smells so good!</li>
            <li> Invigorating Citrus Fragrance! Refreshing &amp; Moisturizing...Allover Happy Feel Good Experience Every Shower!  Leaves you always wanting more so only wish it cost less.....</li>
            <li> Difficult to get in Europe but the best body wash ever. Rich, fresh, with vitamins beads. Using only this one from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but gets me clean and smells like grapefruit, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth has the perfect balance of fragrance that lingers without overwhelming scent. I have bought the body lotion to layer the fragrance. Very clean smell, great for both men and women.</li>
