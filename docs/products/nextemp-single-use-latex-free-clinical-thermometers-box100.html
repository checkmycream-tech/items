            <li>these gave me a chance to monitor my temperature during classes to stay healthy!</li>
            <li>but they work okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After this had happened one time too many, I bought these.  </li>
            <li>This product is so much more accurate than any thing else that is on the market.</li>
            <li>and you can caring them with you and is dispose so easily.</li>
            <li>kids can hold it in for a minute, and the dots are easy to read.  </li>
            <li>the numbers are easy to read if you pay attention to the column and row headings.  </li>
            <li>Easy to read and always accurate.  </li>
            <li>Accurate, convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I searched on line and ordered a box to have available when needed.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use on a baby, these are what they used in the hospital so we like to use them at home too</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super accurate</li>
            <li>They work great in a pinch when you don&#x27;t have any other thermometer available.</li>
            <li>They were nice enough to give me a few of these disposables after I commented that I was impressed by them.</li>
            <li>I enjoy hot yoga, but had a special risk pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and as advertised</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that these strips are often more accurate than the digital thermometers I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>Love the old style mercury thermometers.  </li>
            <li>and you have to read them right away</li>
            <li>They seem to be accurate but they cool down very quickly.  </li>
            <li>No rinsing, sterilizing, kids yelling to go first b/c</li>
            <li>I put them in my first aid kit.</li>
            <li>I ordered these overnight delivery, and the temp wasn&#x27;t even that hot when i bought these, and yet they came ruined from heat exposure.</li>
            <li>I bought these to put in my diaper bag and my first aid kits.</li>
            <li>found one yet but as suggested by other reviewers, I ordered these in the winter to make sure that they were not activated by the summer heat.  </li>
            <li>It may be just because I use this orally, but it is usually a good average of the digital thermometers&#x27; readings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really have to keep the NexTemp strip in your mouth a very long time to get an accurate reading.</li>
            <li>You can either do it under the tongue (must be a full minute and placed ALL THE WAY in teh back under the tongue), or you can do under the armpit for 3 minutes which is what I opt to do.  </li>
            <li>I donated blood several weeks ago and the Red Cross staff used this thermometer on me to make sure I was healthy enough to donate.</li>
            <li>The third shipment seemed okay (none of the strips appeared to be activated) but I tried it several times and I could never get a reading abover 96 degrees Farenheit.  </li>
            <li>kids like the novelty of a new method&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>The product description doesn&#x27;t mention it but simply having the product shipped to you on a hot day will ruin it.  </li>
            <li>I first saw these in a hospital clinic several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that these will definitely lose their efficacy if exposed to hot temperatures, which makes sense (since they are a one time use thermometer).</li>
            <li>These have made any illness a much easier process, and I can&#x27;t imagine purchasing a different product if and when I make my way through 100 of them.</li>
            <li>I have always had trouble reading other thermometers or had too many complaints from kids about using them, but these are much easier.</li>
            <li>When my son caught the flu last year, I couldn&#x27;t find our old mercury thermometer.  </li>
            <li>I may change my review later as I will continue to try these, but so far I&#x27;ve used them twice</li>
            <li>but during the Summer it&#x27;s difficult to say how warm the product gets during shipping.  </li>
            <li>I always take my kids temperatures with multiple methods when they are sick, to try to make sure we are getting an accurate reading.</li>
            <li>When I think that someone in my family (or myself) might have a fever, I used to spend several minutes trying to figure out where the digital thermometer went, then clean it, then take the temperature (if the battery wasn&#x27;t dead), then discover it was actually set on</li>
            <li>The second shipment was also ruined due to it being too hot the second time it arrived and sat in our mailbox until someone got home.  </li>

            <li> You should only order it when the expected 10 day forecast remains between 50 and 70 Farenheit.  </li>
            <li> Bought a box to store with some other medical supplies in case the SHTF.</li>

            <li> /&gt;These single use thermometers are the way to go.  </li>
            <li> The last black dot was my temperature.     </li>
            <li> Simply slipped the small, flat plastic stick under my tongue for one minute, then read the dots.</li>

            <li> AND all of this usually happened between the hours of 2 to 4 AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, they seem to take forever to get a temp, especially with sick and impatient kids, and I&#x27;m always twisting to try to read it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a good patient and waiting forever to see the results just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li> A bit difficult to read</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are so handle and you can caring them with you and is dispose so easily. Great product I would order again.</li>
            <li> I donated blood several weeks ago and the Red Cross staff used this thermometer on me to make sure I was healthy enough to donate. Simply slipped the small, flat plastic stick under my tongue for one minute, then read the dots. The last black dot was my temperature.     They were nice enough to give me a few of these disposables after I commented that I was impressed by them. When my son got sick a few days ago, I got a chance to try them. I have always had trouble reading other thermometers or had too many complaints from kids about using them, but these are much easier. Since he had the swine flu, we could just toss the used thermometers.    My grocery store does not carry these yet, so I am buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought these disposable thermometer strips for my kids when they are sick.  You can either do it under the tongue (must be a full minute and placed ALL THE WAY in teh back under the tongue), or you can do under the armpit for 3 minutes which is what I opt to do.  Easy to read and always accurate.  When my oldest daughter had double lung pneumonia this summer it took her readings all the way over 105 degrees.  Very good product and does NOT spread germs!  Simply throw it away when used.  The box has like 500 or something.  Lasts forever!  I&#x27;ve had them a few years now.</li>
            <li> disposable! love it when someone is sick</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use on a baby, these are what they used in the hospital so we like to use them at home too</li>
            <li> The product description doesn&#x27;t mention it but simply having the product shipped to you on a hot day will ruin it.  You should only order it when the expected 10 day forecast remains between 50 and 70 Farenheit.  I ordered during the Summer and all the strips were activated and ruined.  BP Medical sent replacements TWICE but during the Summer it&#x27;s difficult to say how warm the product gets during shipping.  The second shipment was also ruined due to it being too hot the second time it arrived and sat in our mailbox until someone got home.  The third shipment seemed okay (none of the strips appeared to be activated) but I tried it several times and I could never get a reading abover 96 degrees Farenheit.  In the end I pitched them in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This product is so much more accurate than any thing else that is on the market. Thank you.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super accurate but they work okay.</li>
            <li> Bought a box to store with some other medical supplies in case the SHTF. When my son caught the flu last year, I couldn&#x27;t find our old mercury thermometer.  Yep, the SHTF. Love the old style mercury thermometers.  However, they seem to take forever to get a temp, especially with sick and impatient kids, and I&#x27;m always twisting to try to read it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These single use thermometers are the way to go.  One minute -done.  Even influenza ridden devil attitude kids can hold it in for a minute, and the dots are easy to read.  Throw it away after. No rinsing, sterilizing, kids yelling to go first b/c they don&#x27;t want what the other has (y&#x27;all have the same thing, devils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up finding the mercury thermometer after the flu episode.  I&#x27;m ordering another box of these, though.</li>
            <li> There is no glass to break and no mercury to leak! the numbers are easy to read if you pay attention to the column and row headings.  This is a great product! Perfect to carry in a purse, put in a first aid kit or keep in your desk at work.  Once it&#x27;s used, just throw it away, no cleaning or worrying about who used it before you.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  I put them in my first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I enjoy hot yoga, but had a special risk pregnancy.  these gave me a chance to monitor my temperature during classes to stay healthy!</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and as advertised</li>
            <li> I may change my review later as I will continue to try these, but so far I&#x27;ve used them twice and they didn&#x27;t register at all although I followed the directions to a T.</li>
            <li> I first saw these in a hospital clinic several years ago.  They were being used for seizure patients.  I thought about them when I was caring for a small child who was running a temperature.  I searched on line and ordered a box to have available when needed.  They seem to be accurate but they cool down very quickly.  You need to check them immediately after removal.</li>
            <li> I always take my kids temperatures with multiple methods when they are sick, to try to make sure we are getting an accurate reading. I&#x27;ve noticed that these strips are often more accurate than the digital thermometers I&#x27;m using. (I use a digital thermometer under each arm and one of these onder their tongue.)  It may be just because I use this orally, but it is usually a good average of the digital thermometers&#x27; readings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Disposable so no germs are transmitted&lt;br /&gt;Accurage&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;The kids like the novelty of a new method&lt;br /&gt;Easy to read&lt;br /&gt;Quick to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found one yet but as suggested by other reviewers, I ordered these in the winter to make sure that they were not activated by the summer heat.  I&#x27;ve read that these will definitely lose their efficacy if exposed to hot temperatures, which makes sense (since they are a one time use thermometer).</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to read and you have to read them right away (the black dots fade after 30 seconds or so). Bottom line is it makes me feel like I need a backup thermometer to double check.</li>
            <li> I ordered these overnight delivery, and the temp wasn&#x27;t even that hot when i bought these, and yet they came ruined from heat exposure. What a waste of shipping.</li>
            <li> When I think that someone in my family (or myself) might have a fever, I used to spend several minutes trying to figure out where the digital thermometer went, then clean it, then take the temperature (if the battery wasn&#x27;t dead), then discover it was actually set on celsius- then try to decide if I wanted to try to fix the setting or just google for the conversion, and by the time I got a number, I often didn&#x27;t always trust it. AND all of this usually happened between the hours of 2 to 4 AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this had happened one time too many, I bought these.  I now have a few stashed all around, so there are some in all of the common places I might look in the middle of the night.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning before or after, and when it gives me a number, I trust it.  These have made any illness a much easier process, and I can&#x27;t imagine purchasing a different product if and when I make my way through 100 of them.</li>
            <li> You really have to keep the NexTemp strip in your mouth a very long time to get an accurate reading. I&#x27;m not a good patient and waiting forever to see the results just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I bought these to put in my diaper bag and my first aid kits. They work great in a pinch when you don&#x27;t have any other thermometer available.</li>
            <li> Accurate, convenient and easy to use. I&#x27;ve cross-checked these against various other thermometers and like the accuracy.</li>
