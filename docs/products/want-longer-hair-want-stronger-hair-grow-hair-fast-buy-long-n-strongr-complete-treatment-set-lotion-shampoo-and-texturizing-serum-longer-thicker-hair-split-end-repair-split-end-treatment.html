            <li>The very first time i used this product my hair felt amazing!</li>
            <li>The service is great, very fast.</li>
            <li>I did not help me make my hair more thinner</li>
            <li>Hope it helps my hair grow faster too! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It also says that if you wash your hair more with the stuff, you&#x27;ll see faster results.</li>
            <li>However, it made my hair more brittle than it was and caused it to fall out, break off, and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>The product has also taken most of the kink out of my curls so they appear softer.</li>
            <li>I do agree the packaging should be better but over</li>
            <li>Garnier Length and Strength worked much better</li>
            <li>Love this product don&#x27;t know about longer in 5 to 7 days but do know about it</li>
            <li>So cheap too!</li>
            <li>It helped my hair get smoother but has not grown more than maybe an inch longer then it was.</li>
            <li>Yes my hair has grown, but I&#x27;m not so sure that it was because of the product.</li>
            <li>And I love the shine its gives my hair.</li>
            <li>good things are pricey, you are worth it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but over all i love it</li>
            <li>ok i want to know has anyone had \\&quot; hair growth\\&quot; with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...</li>
            <li>I have used it once, it feels okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sellers Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the delivery of this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>nothing.......good shampoo and love the texturizing serum</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and it really did help my hair grow!</li>
            <li>and the shampoo is awesome just a dime amount on your hand goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair very soft and great my hair is a lot thicker and healthier than it was.</li>
            <li>After using this product my hair has been growing and becoming thicker.</li>
            <li>It is also becoming softer.</li>
            <li>If I could get more for my money&#x27;s worth I would consider buying more.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS GROWING STRONG.</li>
            <li>when and your hair will be long and gorgeous!  </li>
            <li>If it was $15 or $20 it would be more worth it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have not only received this on time</li>
            <li>The product is cheaply made and packaged and the ingredients don&#x27;t justify the price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any significant hair growth using this product....</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>OK, so im really hoping this stuff works.</li>
            <li>So all said and done, this is just shampoo and conditioner and if you have curly or coarse hair that needs to be managed the leave-in is probably good.</li>
            <li>The product, for something not being tested on animals, smells amazing and felt really amazing once it was dried and styled.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$</li>
            <li>For my baby fine super straight hair not so much.</li>
            <li>I am still trying to find the right shampoo and conditioner for me.</li>
            <li>amazingly I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in length in my hair but the overall appearance and health of my hair is phenomenal</li>
            <li>Makes your hair so soft and strong so it won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>My hair has never grown very fast, I&#x27;ve had this product for two weeks</li>
            <li>My hair hasent grown much at all since i had my son 2 years ago, and its soo britle!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy this save your money and get extensions and hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I am experiencing any real growth in length, but the product does give my hair the illusion of being longer since it has loosened my curls.</li>
            <li>The Item is very niiice and the seller in very niiiiice tooooooooo ......</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I just got this yesterday, fast shipping and greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>but if they don&#x27;t list them, I know they are hiding what I found in this whole set.</li>
            <li>I Can see regrowth at my roots, but have to realize nothing is going to make it grow fast then</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any growth difference.</li>
            <li>Not much on growing it seems to just be refreshing my ends.</li>
            <li>so I am ready to re-order NOW.</li>
            <li>i ordered the long and strong shampooo and lotioin.</li>
            <li>but MAINLY that this product is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>This product when you use all three leaves your hair like your teen years, and the next day its even better.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>my hair does not grow naturally from a certain point, I thought this would make it grow, well it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>So soft!!</li>
            <li>; stuff makes my hair super flat and kills any volume I might have, so I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old and married with a 2 year old boy.</li>
            <li>This product is a scam and all of the positive reviews previously written about this product were most likely written by the people at the company.</li>
            <li>After only a week of use, I think Long N Strong may be the product for me.</li>
            <li>I am naturally blond and have curly hair, but i dye my hair brown and straighten it every day!</li>
            <li>The shampoo to me is just shampoo and the after shampoo wash-out conditioner is too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I only have tried the product for 3 days it makes your hair really greasy</li>
            <li>Made my hair soft but nothing else even after month 3</li>
            <li>its too early to tell if this will work ..</li>
            <li>do not waste ur money on it.</li>
            <li>well see, I will use till its gone, but unless my hair grows a lot by the end of the teeny tiny bottles they give you, I wont waste any more money.</li>
            <li>It barely made my hair feel like it was washed.</li>
            <li>okay but not great.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but made hair difficult to brush.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had this since February and still have a little more than half a bottle of each product</li>
            <li>Long &#x27;N Strong treatment set all wet cos half of the shampoo has spilled into the package.   </li>
            <li>Gave it one star because this price is not worth how much you actually get of the product.</li>
            <li>but I found many bad ingredients that strip your hairs natural oils and make it dry in all of the products in the whole kit.</li>

            <li> but I found many bad ingredients that strip your hairs natural oils and make it dry in all of the products in the whole kit.</li>
            <li> well my hair would NOT grow past a certain point and it just stayed at that length for years and years ....</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from Rush and was skeptical but our daughter was getting married</li>
            <li> The shampoo is exactly like watered down dish soap and the conditioner or \\&quot;hair lotion\\&quot; is very thin and does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this product for about  1 week every other day.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t dry my hair.</li>
            <li> dry brittle and breaking.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely thicker and I am experiencing less breakage.</li>
            <li> did leak slightly during transport but not enough to complain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do not think I will be purchasing more simply due to the price and the VERY SMALL bottles!!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very dry and rough.</li>
            <li> will come back and update the review after I use it for a little while.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair very dry and was a big waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have spent years and thousands of dollars trying to get my hair to grow&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Only used for a few weeks, not really noticing anything?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me; seemed to make my hair fall out more. :(</li>
            <li> put all other nonsence at the bottom</li>
            <li> it didnt make my hair grow but it did make it a little softer not much though.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> The quantity was small but lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shampoos previously that advertised that they grow or strengthen hair...</li>
            <li> it feels like a greasy mess and has no ingredients to help the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> this product mde my hair a little healthier also but its just not like how i read it would be.</li>
            <li> Due to the bottles being so small I switched to twice a week to conserve as it is costly.  </li>
            <li> When i opened my package, the bottle opening of shampoo has broken,the liquid has flow out a little.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> What if i washed my everyday with this stuff, will me hair grow faster?????</li>
            <li> My hair was dried out &amp; un-manageable.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair and did not helped to grow.</li>
            <li> Not cool!</li>
            <li> Sorry everyone is different with what they use..</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulder.</li>
            <li> The bottles are on the small side</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and didn&#x27;t use it again after the first wash.</li>
            <li> usually you feel some tingling when the shampoo is working on your scalp.</li>
            <li> the packaging seems small</li>
            <li> it sucks.</li>
            <li> I had thick, mid-length, relaxed hair that began breaking off really bad due to over processing.</li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy, curly hair that is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> and the&lt;br /&gt;condition of my hair is actually worse.</li>
            <li> I only bought because I cut my hair for the summer and hate it, so I was desperate to grow it faster.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> Almost leaves an oily residue and makes it difficult to style my hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel sticky and weird.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks that I have been using this product on my hair and my hair hasn&#x27;t grown at all its really disappointing</li>
            <li> The serum cakes onto hair and makes it appear greasy or dirty.</li>
            <li> and it was itching so bad that I had to wash my hair again...</li>
            <li> The texturizing serum is worthless</li>
            <li> Looks very ugly packaging.</li>
            <li> These is terrible, made my hair feel terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is not worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Gave it one star because this price is not worth how much you actually get of the product. If it was $15 or $20 it would be more worth it. The product itself is very good and works great.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and I loved this product. The quantity was small but lasted me a long time. I loved the smell and it really did help my hair grow!</li>
            <li> I AM HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT I SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY MY HAIR IS GROWING STRONG.</li>
            <li> Lies, all lies. This product is expensive and doesn&#x27;t even work. I have tried it 4 times.</li>
            <li> I did not help me make my hair more thinner and it was itching so bad that I had to wash my hair again... Sorry everyone is different with what they use..</li>
            <li> I only have tried the product for 3 days it makes your hair really greasy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any significant hair growth using this product.... It felt like it actually made my hair drier...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old and married with a 2 year old boy. So my life is already stressful!  lol. I bought this alittle over a week ago, and i have to say its the best hair treatment i have ever used! I am naturally blond and have curly hair, but i dye my hair brown and straighten it every day! So my hair is horibly damaged. My hair hasent grown much at all since i had my son 2 years ago, and its soo britle! The very first time i used this product my hair felt amazing! So soft!! Iv used it every time i take a shower, the shampoo and conditioner is great, but the leave in treatment is the best, i cant live without it anymore!!  haha. Really i love this stuff!!!! Hope it helps my hair grow faster too! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> OK, so im really hoping this stuff works. The bottle says to wash your hair 1-2 times a week with the treatment set. It also says that if you wash your hair more with the stuff, you&#x27;ll see faster results. What if i washed my everyday with this stuff, will me hair grow faster????? Please Help!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair growth to make my hair stronger and grow.  However, it made my hair more brittle than it was and caused it to fall out, break off, and frizzy.  Definitely would not recommend anyone to buy this hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy, curly hair that is prone to breakage. I have been searching for a product that would not only make my hair appear fuller but also strengthen it so that it will grow. After only a week of use, I think Long N Strong may be the product for me. My hair is definitely thicker and I am experiencing less breakage. The product has also taken most of the kink out of my curls so they appear softer. I can&#x27;t say that I am experiencing any real growth in length, but the product does give my hair the illusion of being longer since it has loosened my curls. So far, I am very pleased with the results and I plan on continuing use. I have measured my hair and will report back in a few months to let everyone know if it the product really works the way that it claims.</li>
            <li> I received the \\&quot; Long &#x27;N Strong treatment set all wet cos half of the shampoo has spilled into the package.   the packaging should be improved upon, please.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and must say that it does work . I do agree the packaging should be better but over all the product is very good .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that my hair is growing any faster. The &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; stuff makes my hair super flat and kills any volume I might have, so I don&#x27;t use it. The shampoo to me is just shampoo and the after shampoo wash-out conditioner is too heavy for fine hair. I literally use just a drop and massage it into my scalp and then follow up with volumizing conditioner and leave-in volumizer (different brand). So all said and done, this is just shampoo and conditioner and if you have curly or coarse hair that needs to be managed the leave-in is probably good. For my baby fine super straight hair not so much.</li>
            <li> The Item is very niiice and the seller in very niiiiice tooooooooo ...... (^_^)    THANX A LOT MY FRIEND    I HOPE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER TIME FROM YOU    WITH MY BEST WISHES.... Abu-Abdullah</li>
            <li> This product does seem to help with breakage, smells okay but not great. Almost leaves an oily residue and makes it difficult to style my hair. Not to mention the static! I do not think I will be purchasing more simply due to the price and the VERY SMALL bottles!!! If I could get more for my money&#x27;s worth I would consider buying more. This product didn&#x27;t last a month of using it once daily. Not cool!</li>
            <li> Only used for a few weeks, not really noticing anything? well see, I will use till its gone, but unless my hair grows a lot by the end of the teeny tiny bottles they give you, I wont waste any more money. I only bought because I cut my hair for the summer and hate it, so I was desperate to grow it faster.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel like straw. I just couldn&#x27;t use it &amp; I did try. My hair was dried out &amp; un-manageable.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have not only received this on time but MAINLY that this product is not tested on animals. The product, for something not being tested on animals, smells amazing and felt really amazing once it was dried and styled. I will definitely re-order this when I run out again and again and again.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair and did not helped to grow.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair very dry and was a big waste of money.  Would not advise getting this product at all.  Garnier Length and Strength worked much better didn&#x27;t dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair so good after this cure. I really like it.I&#x27;ll check in the future for another products. Thank you</li>
            <li> Yes, it works!  This product does make my hair softer and I have seen faster growth while using it, than with out.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair grow beautifully</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft but nothing else even after month 3</li>
            <li> Love this product don&#x27;t know about longer in 5 to 7 days but do know about it making the hair stronger and shinier without it feeling greasy. and the shampoo is awesome just a dime amount on your hand goes a long way. My hair is past my shoulder.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday, fast shipping and greatly appreciated. I have been loosing my hair for years because of medications so I hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;It did leak slightly during transport but not enough to complain.&lt;br /&gt;I will come back and update the review after I use it for a little while.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so soft and strong so it won&#x27;t break. My hair has grown faster.</li>
            <li> The hair lotion and serum are amazing in the product.All you have to do is do what it tells you to do and when and your hair will be long and gorgeous!  Thank you Amazon for having this product. So cheap too! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have to say this product did improve the overall condition of my hair but it did not make it grow any faster at all. The bottles are on the small side and I feel it is way over priced.</li>
            <li> The advertising says oh yea it helps your hair grow I bet it does but it didn&#x27;t give the ingredients and so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try but I got it (on time- even earlier!) but I found many bad ingredients that strip your hairs natural oils and make it dry in all of the products in the whole kit. I was disappointed and didn&#x27;t use it again after the first wash. It made my hair feel sticky and weird. It isn&#x27;t as great as they say. I am still trying to find the right shampoo and conditioner for me. I am going to read the ingredients before hand but if they don&#x27;t list them, I know they are hiding what I found in this whole set. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I Can see regrowth at my roots, but have to realize nothing is going to make it grow fast then just time it&#x27;s self. I am taking hair nail and skin gummy vitamin supplements and taking care of my hair by not washing it as often and not over heating it.</li>
            <li> This product is garbage &amp; a scam. I cant believe I paid $45 for this. It doesnt work. It barely made my hair feel like it was washed. I&#x27;ve used shampoos previously that advertised that they grow or strengthen hair... usually you feel some tingling when the shampoo is working on your scalp. No such thing happened with this shampoo. This product is a scam and all of the positive reviews previously written about this product were most likely written by the people at the company. THIS IS A SCAM.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this product for about  1 week every other day. it smells wonderful. its too early to tell if this will work ..but i will use the bottle and get back with you.</li>
            <li> The product is cheaply made and packaged and the ingredients don&#x27;t justify the price. The shampoo is exactly like watered down dish soap and the conditioner or \\&quot;hair lotion\\&quot; is very thin and does absolutely nothing. The texturizing serum is worthless it feels like a greasy mess and has no ingredients to help the health of your hair. Despite all this I still finished all the hair products hoping I would still&lt;br /&gt;see growth but of course I didn&#x27;t and the&lt;br /&gt;condition of my hair is actually worse. My hair&lt;br /&gt;is dry brittle and breaking. This product&lt;br /&gt;did nothing it promised. It is a gimmick product&lt;br /&gt;or scam and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> These is terrible, made my hair feel terrible.  Had to wash three time to get this out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any growth difference. Smells nice but made hair difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way if made my hair feel. Also I don&#x27;t don&#x27;t think there will be any faster growth</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me; seemed to make my hair fall out more. :(</li>
            <li> It helped my hair get smoother but has not grown more than maybe an inch longer then it was. Not much on growing it seems to just be refreshing my ends.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product. Yes my hair has grown, but I&#x27;m not so sure that it was because of the product.</li>
            <li> It is helping my hair grow faster. And I love the shine its gives my hair. Great Product. Buy It.</li>
            <li> My hair feels great, fuller, stronger, healthier, it don&#x27;t fall like it used to, I recommend this product, the only downfall is the price, hey! good things are pricey, you are worth it.</li>
            <li> it didnt make my hair grow but it did make it a little softer not much though. this product mde my hair a little healthier also but its just not like how i read it would be.</li>
            <li> Works! Love it! Worth the $$</li>
            <li> Excellent product high quality</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair has been growing and becoming thicker. It is also becoming softer. I am very satisfied with this product and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> My hair has never grown very fast, I&#x27;ve had this product for two weeks and I can already tell my hair is longer! Not only that, but my hair is shinier and fuller. This product is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I love it. I also told my friends and they are amazed and bought one as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you I will also buy it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Jil</li>
            <li> Its just been 3 days ive used it i have not seen changes but over all i love it</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from Rush and was skeptical but our daughter was getting married and I wanted to lengthen my hair.  I followed the directions and used it daily for one month and even my hairdresser noticed the difference.  My hair is longer and thicker and has great texture.  Due to the bottles being so small I switched to twice a week to conserve as it is costly.  I highly recommend this product.  One suggestion to the mfr is make the bottles bigger....PLEASE!!!!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair very soft and great my hair is a lot thicker and healthier than it was. The split end protected does it&#x27;s job amazingly I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in length in my hair but the overall appearance and health of my hair is phenomenal the packaging seems small but I&#x27;ve had this since February and still have a little more than half a bottle of each product</li>
            <li> hello,  am i the only one here that sees not one comment has mentioned \\&quot; hair growth \\&quot; come on ladies. just write about yourexperience with what the product says it will do to what it did to you. put all other nonsence at the bottom ok i want to know has anyone had \\&quot; hair growth\\&quot; with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT... ITS AMAZING...</li>
            <li> When i opened my package, the bottle opening of shampoo has broken,the liquid has flow out a little. Looks very ugly packaging. I have used it once, it feels okay. I&#x27;ll try to use it twice a week, see if it works or not. Hopefully it works well.</li>
            <li> i ordered the long and strong shampooo and lotioin. it didnt make a difference in my hair at all. all it did was make it staticy. do not waste ur money on it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see no results in a week like it said !</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 to 8 months. I have my hair highlighted...well my hair would NOT grow past a certain point and it just stayed at that length for years and years .... UNTIL I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT!!! My hair has grown about 5 inches in the time I have been using this-- I have tried everything...This is the stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, Amazing, Amazing...I have spent years and thousands of dollars trying to get my hair to grow&#x3D; THIS IS THE KEY! AMAZING...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sellers Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the delivery of this product. It arrived as promised and advertised. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;My item arrived early, perfectly packaged !\\&quot; great seller!!!</li>
            <li> This product when you use all three leaves your hair like your teen years, and the next day its even better. The service is great, very fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 weeks that I have been using this product on my hair and my hair hasn&#x27;t grown at all its really disappointing however it has became thicker but not longer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. It leaves my hair very dry and rough. The serum cakes onto hair and makes it appear greasy or dirty.</li>
            <li> I had thick, mid-length, relaxed hair that began breaking off really bad due to over processing. I was just doing extra moisturizing and had no idea how to get my hair back. I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week for 2 weeks now and it appears to be working! Gives hair a great texture, doesn&#x27;t tangle or break off during combing, and smells great. I think this product may be the answer to my problem. I will follow-up with another review to let you know how this product works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t send another review so I am adding to this one! I love this product. It last me 6 months. I ran out and started using another product but it&#x27;s not the same! I&#x27;m not getting the same results so I am ready to re-order NOW. You should see a great difference using this product; I recommend it.</li>
            <li> it did nothing to my hair don&#x27;t buy this it sucks. my hair does not grow naturally from a certain point, I thought this would make it grow, well it didn&#x27;t. don&#x27;t buy this save your money and get extensions and hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> Verdict is still out I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> its a phenomenal shampoo!!...the texture of the hair is amazing...HOWEVER.....Hair DOES NOT grow....biggest publicity scam ever!!!...I have used it for 4 weeks and nothing.......good shampoo and love the texturizing serum....but it is NOT a help on growing hair!!!!</li>
