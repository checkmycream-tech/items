            <li>It does not dissolve thoroughly, even in VERY warm water.</li>

            <li>Ease of use - better than tablets!  </li>
            <li>What kind of number is that anyway?</li>
            <li>When I use the tab kind on my retainers, there is always undissolved particles in the water.</li>
            <li>It works great, and my retainers always feel clean.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This stuff is quick, convenient and works great.</li>
            <li>They crystals dissolve fine for me but the cleaning job is not as good as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and my coffee tastes so much better.</li>
            <li>Even the efferdent tablets are better than these.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dentures, but I sure did buy this.</li>
            <li>I really do love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The tear top still does not work reliably, but then none of this type ever do, but that doesn&#x27;t stop manufacturers from continuing to use them now</li>
            <li>But then again, maybe I should have gotten three more</li>
            <li>Much better for my orthodontic trays.</li>
            <li>Many drugstores don&#x27;t carry this product so I buy them here.</li>
            <li>But the pouches are much more convenient.</li>
            <li>Cleaning of dentures is a challenge to many individuals, but Efferdent gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I was a Polident user for many years and assumed that my dentures were the cleanest they could get.</li>
            <li>used &amp;#34;Efferdent&amp;#34; for many years - just be sureto rinse</li>
            <li>This is a very quick and easy and effective means of cleaning dentures.</li>
            <li>I use these to keep my retainers nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>The Efferdent Power Clean Crystals do the job nicely.</li>

            <li>Wow amazing!</li>
            <li>quick and easy to clean the dentures!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to pack the right number if you&#x27;re going away because if you try to rip that many tablets apart they never tear at the perforations</li>
            <li>Enjoy using this product for my night guard</li>
            <li>Efferdent Power Clean Crystals, 48 Count]] works just fine.</li>
            <li>Recommend to everyone with dentures who want to keep their dentures clean and worry free from odor.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t work as easily or effectively as Retainer Brite on my invisilign trays, and they are more of a pain to open.</li>
            <li>I use this product to clean my night guard.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my dentures since 2006 and if I drink coffee, iced tea or anything that might have a color to it this product just won&#x27;t clean the stains.</li>
            <li>It keeps them clean.</li>
            <li>I use denture cleaners to keep retainers clean.  </li>
            <li>Everyone who wears dentures needs clean ones.</li>
            <li>My dentures were CLEAN, the stains were gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these work very well.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I love the cheap thrill of trying new products.  </li>
            <li>These crystals are far superior and much faster than the tablets.</li>
            <li>When looking online to find the best denture soaking cleanser, denture toothpaste, and denture adhesive, Efferdent is the only one that won the \\&quot;ADA Seal\\&quot; (from the American Dental Association).</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>New is not always better, this is certainly the case for Efferdent Power Clean Crystals.  </li>
            <li>GREAT Product and fast delivery with boxes intack, not damage and/or crushed boxes.</li>
            <li>blue dye sticks to my retainers and requires a toothbrush to clean (versus a good rinse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the old!</li>
            <li>I have been using this to clean my retainers for the last year and I love it.</li>
            <li>It burns the throat and eyes, AND it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean better than regular efferdent.  </li>
            <li>I use it to clean my stainless steel water bottles and coffee canisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this to clean my coffee thermos and couldn&#x27;t believe how much crud this got rid of.</li>
            <li>The price is a little more, but the reading on box says it kills 10x more germs.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I keep a small pair of scissors in the bathroom cabinet top drawer for various needs and it&#x27;s so easy to snip the top off this tube and pour it in a glass and VOILA!</li>
            <li>Works very well!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped out super fast!</li>
            <li>larger size - more economy  &#x3D; gret service</li>
            <li>First time I used these crystals I was amazed.</li>
            <li>First I couldn&#x27;t open the packet-had to use scissors, then there sure wasn&#x27;t much \\&quot;fizz\\</li>
            <li>I have Invisalign and I needed something inexpensive to keep my trays clean and clear.</li>
            <li>It also works fast and dissolves fast!</li>
            <li>So I think it wise to stock up and as usual AMAZON to the rescue.</li>
            <li>Easy open packs and fast dissolving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a while even stainless steel can get a coating and discoloration.</li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;d have a whole year of no aggravation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yeah, they dissolve so much faster too.</li>
            <li>These work really well</li>
            <li>Really cleans.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t do it right the first time, though, I kind of mess up the packet and have to use scissors to open.  </li>
            <li>If you want clean, white dentures</li>
            <li>Deffenetely my new brand!</li>
            <li>There is a lot of residue that hardens in the glass so not as easy as other products</li>
            <li>The packets are easy enough to open if you bend on the dotted line and tear in the correct place.  </li>
            <li>Thought I would try this new product.</li>
            <li>If you have new or fairly new dentures</li>
            <li>I have been using this product with Invisiline Braces for nearly 2 years.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job of breaking down the crud without being too harsh on the metal (a different cleaner ate through the metal, and I had to buy new retainers.  </li>
            <li>packets are SUPER hard to open!!</li>
            <li>This product works the same as their tablets, or should I say DOES NOT WORK, does not whiten dentures, does not remove any stains (even mild stains) in the least.  </li>

            <li> Well, all my teeth made it for 60 years, thanks to a little paint-and-paper (cavities filled, caps, etc.), but a few gave up the ghost this past year.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my son&#x27;s retainers and I still have to scrub pretty hard to get the tartar (or</li>
            <li> Cleans my retainers, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as tablets I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Personally, that little denture cup sitting on the counter of my bathroom sink, with my small partial bridge, is the first thing that&#x27;s made me feel...not-so-young!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as long as I am wearing retainers.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product, I have used Efferdent tablets for a long time and thought this would be great.  </li>
            <li> They carry the 48 count size and I bought 3 boxes, that&#x27;ll last me a half year.</li>
            <li> My mother tried these Power Clean Crystals and ended up with blue streaks on her dentures which are impossible for her to remove.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any trouble tearing the packets open.</li>
            <li> With these crystals, it doesn&#x27;t leave behind that nasty tast and it leaves my retainer nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I would always start a new box of tablets by getting out the strongest pair of scissors I have and spend the next however long trying to remove the tablet without cutting it.</li>
            <li> I had a few stains that just wouldn&#x27;t come off, no matter how long I soaked them how hard I brushed them.</li>
            <li> but are SO hard to open.</li>
            <li> the crystals worked properly but each packet was difficult to open and a scissors was needed.</li>
            <li> but in some cases I&#x27;ll leave them in for up to an hour hour n a half</li>
            <li> takes up little space in the cupboard.  </li>
            <li> A little efferdent, some water and a few minutes</li>
            <li> Quitr a few packets.  </li>
            <li> and then brush them with a separate toothbrush and dish washing liquid soap to ensure the stubborn debris left behind is removed..</li>
            <li> I usually have to get scissors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The packaging is difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> No need to pay $80 bucks for some &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; dentist cleaning system or fancy cleaning machine when all you need is a cup, small container or denture bath and some water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with these.</li>
            <li> It usually required cutting at least three sides of each little one to accomplish this.</li>
            <li> Sorry I did.</li>
            <li> The slit is usually useless, therefore requires scissors.&lt;br /&gt;-The powder clumps together at the bottom of the glass.&lt;br /&gt;-The crystals take longer to dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> I bought a pack months ago and still haven&#x27;t finished it because of the horrible, cough-inducing fumes that come out of the packet once you open it.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave an unpleasant aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Wrong!!!  </li>
            <li> , all the nasty stuff is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also I have to rinse off my retainers longer as all the tabs brands I have used leave a awful tast if I don&#x27;t rinse well.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> as described works good</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this new product. Sorry I did. It does not dissolve thoroughly, even in VERY warm water. 3 minutes turned into 6 or 10. No difference.Still not doing the job as claimed. I went back to the polident tablets. Even the efferdent tablets are better than these.</li>
            <li> What a deal! These work so well too! quick and easy to clean the dentures! Works very well!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped out super fast!</li>
            <li> larger size - more economy  &#x3D; gret service</li>
            <li> packets are SUPER hard to open!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dentures, but I sure did buy this. I use it to clean my stainless steel water bottles and coffee canisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a while even stainless steel can get a coating and discoloration. A little efferdent, some water and a few minutes, all the nasty stuff is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the idea from the actual tabs created for the purpose, but is so much more expensive. Efferdent does the job just as well as a much better price!</li>
            <li> the crystals worked properly but each packet was difficult to open and a scissors was needed.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the product.  I use daily.</li>
            <li> GREAT Product and fast delivery with boxes intack, not damage and/or crushed boxes. very happy with my buy</li>
            <li> I use these to keep my retainers nice and clean.  They do a good job of breaking down the crud without being too harsh on the metal (a different cleaner ate through the metal, and I had to buy new retainers.  Oops...).  The Efferdent Power Clean Crystals do the job nicely.</li>
            <li> I really do love this stuff. This packaging is infinetly easier to use than those individually wrapped tablets engineered to be a dickens to open. They say to rip them open....RIGHT!!! Like that ever works! I would always start a new box of tablets by getting out the strongest pair of scissors I have and spend the next however long trying to remove the tablet without cutting it. It usually required cutting at least three sides of each little one to accomplish this. Then I would put them in a well sealed jar and breath a sigh of relief until next time I ran out. Now it&#x27;s simple. No ordeal. The tear top still does not work reliably, but then none of this type ever do, but that doesn&#x27;t stop manufacturers from continuing to use them now does it? Anyway, I keep a small pair of scissors in the bathroom cabinet top drawer for various needs and it&#x27;s so easy to snip the top off this tube and pour it in a glass and VOILA! No aggravation whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my only fear is that they are just testing them. And what if they stop making them? The biggest box store carried them in 24&#x27;s and 48&#x27;s, but lately only in the 24&#x27;s. What kind of number is that anyway? One box doesn&#x27;t even do you for a month? So I think it wise to stock up and as usual AMAZON to the rescue. They carry the 48 count size and I bought 3 boxes, that&#x27;ll last me a half year. But then again, maybe I should have gotten three more and then I&#x27;d have a whole year of no aggravation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, they dissolve so much faster too. And it&#x27;s easy to pack the right number if you&#x27;re going away because if you try to rip that many tablets apart they never tear at the perforations and then you have to seal the torn ones somehow.</li>
            <li> These work really well but are SO hard to open. I usually have to get scissors.</li>
            <li> Overpriced. Don&#x27;t dissolve well. Don&#x27;t work as easily or effectively as Retainer Brite on my invisilign trays, and they are more of a pain to open.</li>
            <li> I wear a mouth gaurd at all times, 1 to bed and 1 during the day and I want them to be cleaned while I take my very quick morning shower.  These crystals are far superior and much faster than the tablets.</li>
            <li> My mother tried these Power Clean Crystals and ended up with blue streaks on her dentures which are impossible for her to remove.  I&#x27;ll be taking her to the dentist this week and hopefully he can remove these blue stains.</li>
            <li> I use this product to clean my night guard.  I like the Efferdent Power Clean Crystals the best.  It does not leave an unpleasant aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Wow amazing! Much better for my orthodontic trays. Really cleans. Much better than the tablet.s Great price. I did find these in the store eventually at specialty stores.</li>
            <li> Fast-easy convenient. Easy open packs and fast dissolving. Do a great job!</li>
            <li> The price is a little more, but the reading on box says it kills 10x more germs. It also works fast and dissolves fast! When I use the tab kind on my retainers, there is always undissolved particles in the water. Also I have to rinse off my retainers longer as all the tabs brands I have used leave a awful tast if I don&#x27;t rinse well. With these crystals, it doesn&#x27;t leave behind that nasty tast and it leaves my retainer nice and clean. Deffenetely my new brand!</li>
            <li> If you have new or fairly new dentures I&#x27;m sure these work very well.  I&#x27;ve had my dentures since 2006 and if I drink coffee, iced tea or anything that might have a color to it this product just won&#x27;t clean the stains.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all stains..dont like it</li>
            <li> I have to wash my sleep apnea mouth guard every morning - these are perfect - dissolve easily and travel well.  I will definitely keep purchasing them.</li>
            <li> I got this to clean my coffee thermos and couldn&#x27;t believe how much crud this got rid of. It&#x27;s very easy to use and my coffee tastes so much better. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to clean biking water bottles, worked great!</li>
            <li> Many drugstores don&#x27;t carry this product so I buy them here. It&#x27;s an EXCELLENT product.</li>
            <li> Cleans my retainers, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as tablets I have used in the past. There is a lot of residue that hardens in the glass so not as easy as other products</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with these. I thought they would be more convenient than the tablets, especially for travel, but the packets were difficult to open. I needed scissors. I&#x27;ll stick with the tablets.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with Invisiline Braces for nearly 2 years.  I use it in the morning and at night.  It keeps them clean.</li>
            <li> The packets are easy enough to open if you bend on the dotted line and tear in the correct place.  If I don&#x27;t do it right the first time, though, I kind of mess up the packet and have to use scissors to open.  They crystals dissolve fine for me but the cleaning job is not as good as I was expecting.  I bought these for my son&#x27;s retainers and I still have to scrub pretty hard to get the tartar (or whatever it is) out of the nooks and crannies.  I feel like the retainers are cleaner than brushing alone, though.  I may try a different type that takes longer since this one says to only leave the retainers in the solution for three minutes.</li>
            <li> Quitr a few packets.  Works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a marketer&#x27;s dream!  I love the cheap thrill of trying new products.  New is not always better, this is certainly the case for Efferdent Power Clean Crystals.  I use denture cleaners to keep retainers clean.  Here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging is difficult to open.  The packaging is like a ketchup packet.  There&#x27;s a tiny slit in the corner to help you tear the packaging apart.  The slit is usually useless, therefore requires scissors.&lt;br /&gt;-The powder clumps together at the bottom of the glass.&lt;br /&gt;-The crystals take longer to dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;-The blue dye sticks to my retainers and requires a toothbrush to clean (versus a good rinse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the old!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0076K5PC0 Efferdent Power Clean Crystals, 48 Count]] works just fine. Personally, that little denture cup sitting on the counter of my bathroom sink, with my small partial bridge, is the first thing that&#x27;s made me feel...not-so-young! Well, all my teeth made it for 60 years, thanks to a little paint-and-paper (cavities filled, caps, etc.), but a few gave up the ghost this past year. When looking online to find the best denture soaking cleanser, denture toothpaste, and denture adhesive, Efferdent is the only one that won the \\&quot;ADA Seal\\&quot; (from the American Dental Association). That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Ease of use - better than tablets!  Recommend to everyone with dentures who want to keep their dentures clean and worry free from odor.</li>
            <li> Im not a microbiologist so I wont comment on cleanliness or effectiveness. But the pouches are much more convenient.</li>
            <li> I have Invisalign and I needed something inexpensive to keep my trays clean and clear. This did the trick. No need to pay $80 bucks for some &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; dentist cleaning system or fancy cleaning machine when all you need is a cup, small container or denture bath and some water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always recommend letting them soak for 15min minimum but in some cases I&#x27;ll leave them in for up to an hour hour n a half and then brush them with a separate toothbrush and dish washing liquid soap to ensure the stubborn debris left behind is removed..</li>
            <li> Cleaning of dentures is a challenge to many individuals, but Efferdent gets the job done. You probably will not elsewhere beat Amazon&#x27;s price. Delivery was quick. Well recommended. Everyone who wears dentures needs clean ones.</li>
            <li> I have been using this to clean my retainers for the last year and I love it. It works great, and my retainers always feel clean. I don&#x27;t have any trouble tearing the packets open. This stuff is quick, convenient and works great. I will continue to use it as long as I am wearing retainers.</li>
            <li> This is a very quick and easy and effective means of cleaning dentures. This is a  product that I will be in the future.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using this product for my night guard</li>
            <li> This stuff is noxious!  I bought a pack months ago and still haven&#x27;t finished it because of the horrible, cough-inducing fumes that come out of the packet once you open it.  It burns the throat and eyes, AND it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean better than regular efferdent.  Only advantage is that it does it in 3 minutes instead of 15.  Avoid.</li>
            <li> This product works the same as their tablets, or should I say DOES NOT WORK, does not whiten dentures, does not remove any stains (even mild stains) in the least.  If you want clean, white dentures I DO NOT recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I love these. I was a Polident user for many years and assumed that my dentures were the cleanest they could get. I had a few stains that just wouldn&#x27;t come off, no matter how long I soaked them how hard I brushed them. First time I used these crystals I was amazed. My dentures were CLEAN, the stains were gone. I threw the Polident in the trash and now use only these.</li>
            <li> used &amp;#34;Efferdent&amp;#34; for many years - just be sureto rinse well!</li>
            <li> Did what they said they would do.</li>
            <li> works well. takes up little space in the cupboard.  I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product, I have used Efferdent tablets for a long time and thought this would be great.  Wrong!!!  First I couldn&#x27;t open the packet-had to use scissors, then there sure wasn&#x27;t much \\&quot;fizz\\&quot;  I only bought this because I had a coupon and thought I&#x27;d try it.  For me, it&#x27;s back to the dependable tablets!!!!!</li>
