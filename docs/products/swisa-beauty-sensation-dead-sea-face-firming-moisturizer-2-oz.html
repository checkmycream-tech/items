            <li>This is the most awesome product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I guess it would be in the companies best interest to make it more organic ingredients</li>

            <li>it works well and feels good on the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just wish I could always find it for a good price.</li>
            <li>, i have noticed my makeup stays on longer and looks more even with this!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I am 28 years old and many people think I look like a teenager :) this product is awesome!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite Swisa beauty products.</li>
            <li>It works better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I discovered this cream some time ago but was paying a lot more for it.</li>
            <li>I will explore what more this brand has to offer.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love how this product feels on my face.</li>
            <li>Product arrived super quick, great seller.</li>
            <li>Just OK, doesn&#x27;t work that well for fine lines.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell and leaves your skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>So far, this product feels great.</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>It smells slightly of oranges and i find it delightful...</li>
            <li>Wrinkles are less noticeable and I am very happy with the  results.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is light and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>The other products were ok, but I absolutely LOVED this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good cream for firming facial skin, is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been using Swisa Beauty Dead Sea Firming moisturizer for years now and have been super impressed with it.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer has a cool, light citrus scent and moisturizes my face without greasiness.</li>
            <li>This was not anything special at all.  </li>
            <li>I have a normal non-oily skin type and wasn&#x27;t aware that so many improvements could have been made simply by using a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li>This facial firiming moisturizer helped me reduced the wrinkles and helps me look and feel more healthy.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and keeps my face soft and feeling good.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel smooth but didn&#x27;t cause my naturally oily skin to build excess oil through the day, and it worked well under foundation since many of my moisturizers for acne cause a lot of flaking or over drying.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years and look like a 35 year old, this product is the best, I recomend to anyone who wants to have younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>This product took years off my face in just the first application!</li>
            <li>Goes on clean, feels clean and light, not heavy like some feel.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed when I opened this product was the light citrus scent - very yummy!</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>can no longer use this product because it priced itself right out of my budget.</li>
            <li>I like to use this right after shaving my face.</li>
            <li>The jar is full and the content looks and smells like the real stuff, but I can&#x27;t help wondering if somebody has already put her fingers in it</li>
            <li>I received the product very fast and will buy again.</li>
            <li>If that isn&#x27;t enough, I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>I used it and its okay, not that fancy actually.</li>
            <li>It will temporarily hydrate and that&#x27;s pretty well about it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many products and did not think to look on Amazon until recently.</li>
            <li>Of course it could just be that the original box somehow got damaged or it was removed to fit the jar in a smaller shipping box, in which case a little note would have been nice.</li>
            <li>, I did not see any firming or anything else positive.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product in the past from Amazon and loved it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and react to most facial products.</li>
            <li>also, even though i did not purchase this necessarily for the firming it has firmed my face up nicely and withing 2 days i noticed a smoother complexion, it left my pores noticeably smaller which was a great added bonus, and my skin extremely brighter!  </li>
            <li>The product is so gentle, I use on my five-year-old daughter&#x27;s face for her occassional eczema breakouts in the evening and by morning the breakouts are gone.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of moisturizers, but I love Swisa Dead Sea Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I now see it for as much as $75.00 with the cheapest price at $45.00.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I suffer from Psoriasis, an auto immune disease and many other health problems.</li>
            <li>The light citrus fragrance was ok, but seemed to be masking a more unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used it, it made my skin beautifully soft, and now, four weeks on,the firming effect has kicked in too.</li>
            <li>The loose skin under my chin and on my neck completely firmed up, it was a huge change!</li>
            <li>and I did not want to chance paying that much for a new product line.</li>
            <li>I recommend this moisturizer wholeheartedly and will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>You use very little of this light moisturizer for soft smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I dont know why it is ranking so high in the beauty products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>hadnt noticed much of a difference at all as far as wrinkles, softness of skin etc..  </li>
            <li>I had great hopes of seeing improvement in the texture of my skin, but unfortunately I had to stop using it after a week.  </li>
            <li>I want something that penetrates more, but I use this everyday</li>
            <li>I keep buying it as soon as I run out,absolutely can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I tried this at my grandmothers house actually and fell in love, it soaks right into your skin immediately making your skin feel so unbelievably hydrated, then it leaves your face feeling so soft!  </li>
            <li>Having used this product off and on now for some time, I have to say that I have developed a new appreciation for this skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is amazing to say the least!</li>
            <li>and it is worth EVERY single penny!</li>
            <li>First time for purchasing the Swisa Sensation Dead Sea Face Firming Moisturizer and it works great with the other  Swisa Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean and slightly of citrus.</li>
            <li>and my skin is now clear again.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Instead, the moiturizer leaves my face feeling dewy and young.</li>
            <li>my face feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I am 25 years old</li>
            <li>Your face feels so soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product after seeing reviews, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s properties are not as noticeable at first, unless you are using other products that claim to accomplish the same results.</li>
            <li>The Swisa Mud soap, Facial Peel and Firming Moisturizer have completely cleared up any rashes or red blotches.</li>

            <li> The Swisa Mud soap, Facial Peel and Firming Moisturizer have completely cleared up any rashes or red blotches.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny dab of the moisturizer goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The product lasts a long time and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Wow, and it was half the price I paid before!</li>
            <li> I started to notice spots appearing above and below the surface of my skin and that&#x27;s when I went back to my previous moisturizer</li>
            <li> My face feels softer and better exfoliated than it ever has - even after expensive facials!</li>
            <li> It also helps for sunburned and dry skin and speeds the healing process.  </li>
            <li> It feels creamy, not oily going on my face and my face doesn&#x27;t get that dry feeling during the day.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, excema and almost 50.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing loose skin around my neck and chin.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this item again and in using the firming moisturizer only a few times  see a visible difference in the wrinkles on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month, and the pot is nearly empty.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this moisturizer from the kiosks at the local shopping malls where the salespeople approach you and pressure you to buy their Dead Sea salt product line.</li>
            <li> still have it dont use allot , A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Even with out those other products, its still works by it self.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first but tried it.  </li>
            <li> The first time I bought it was in  2007 with a variety of other products to help with my acne, and it was expensive (the moist user itself was $40).</li>
            <li> No matter how tight our budget gets, I will ALWAYS find the money to continue buying this</li>
            <li> I had used it for a little over a year until the kiosks changed companies</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and have received phenominal results.  </li>
            <li> It is subtle, but very firm as you apply it to dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has very little scent and it does not burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Instead of throwing it away though, I am using it as body lotion on my thighs and buttocks in the hope that it will firm and tighten the skin in that area!  </li>
            <li> Really no better than a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that has been breaking out with rosacea on cheeks and neck for the past year - but no more!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stated before I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 23 years.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference on your face as opposed to other products that merely layer a creme on your skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was not good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> made my eyes burn, but then again I have bad allergies and gave it to my daughter.</li>

            <li> This is the best moisturizer!  I have sensitive skin so it&#x27;s hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  You use very little of this light moisturizer for soft smooth skin.  It also helps for sunburned and dry skin and speeds the healing process.  Has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Swisa Beauty Dead Sea Firming moisturizer for years now and have been super impressed with it. It leaves my skin feeling like babies skin! I suffer from Psoriasis, an auto immune disease and many other health problems. Some of the medications I&#x27;ve been put on have wreaked havoc upon my hair, skin and nails.....EXCEPT for my face and neck, where I use this moisturizer!!! No matter how tight our budget gets, I will ALWAYS find the money to continue buying this and it is worth EVERY single penny!</li>
            <li> Sweet! This product took years off my face in just the first application! Goes on clean, feels clean and light, not heavy like some feel.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing to say the least! I could never use any store bought face moisturizers because they always made my skin feel oily irritated and slimy, and i don&#x27;t have oily skin.  I tried this at my grandmothers house actually and fell in love, it soaks right into your skin immediately making your skin feel so unbelievably hydrated, then it leaves your face feeling so soft!  It smells slightly of oranges and i find it delightful... also, even though i did not purchase this necessarily for the firming it has firmed my face up nicely and withing 2 days i noticed a smoother complexion, it left my pores noticeably smaller which was a great added bonus, and my skin extremely brighter!  This moisturizer even works great as a foundation primer, i have noticed my makeup stays on longer and looks more even with this!  All in all this Moisturizer is wonderful and i would have never know to try it if my grandmother did not have it.  I have a normal non-oily skin type and wasn&#x27;t aware that so many improvements could have been made simply by using a good moisturizer! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Just OK, doesn&#x27;t work that well for fine lines. it moisturizes. I didn&#x27;t purchase it again</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite Swisa beauty products. The moisturizer has a cool, light citrus scent and moisturizes my face without greasiness. Instead, the moiturizer leaves my face feeling dewy and young. The product is so gentle, I use on my five-year-old daughter&#x27;s face for her occassional eczema breakouts in the evening and by morning the breakouts are gone. This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of moisturizers, but I love Swisa Dead Sea Moisturizer.  It feels creamy, not oily going on my face and my face doesn&#x27;t get that dry feeling during the day.  My aesthetician even tells me she can feel a difference since I started using this moisturizer. If that isn&#x27;t enough, I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> First time for purchasing the Swisa Sensation Dead Sea Face Firming Moisturizer and it works great with the other  Swisa Dead Sea products.  I will purchase this item again and in using the firming moisturizer only a few times  see a visible difference in the wrinkles on my face.  Wrinkles are less noticeable and I am very happy with the  results. I received the product very fast and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product and it works well and feels good on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have it dont use allot , A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed when I opened this product was the light citrus scent - very yummy! And it feels wonderful. Gentle. Soothing. I have combination skin that has been breaking out with rosacea on cheeks and neck for the past year - but no more! The Swisa Mud soap, Facial Peel and Firming Moisturizer have completely cleared up any rashes or red blotches. My face feels softer and better exfoliated than it ever has - even after expensive facials! And the prices for this product on Amazon are the best I&#x27;ve seen anywhere. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week and I can already see the changes on my skin. I wake and my face feels so soft. Definitely will buy again when I finish with this jar.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old and I&#x27;m already seeing loose skin around my neck and chin. I purchased this product to replace my much cheaper moisturizer, and I was worried I may have wasted my money. I am very happy with this product and will be ordering again! Just a tiny dab of the moisturizer goes a long way. It smells clean and slightly of citrus. The moisturizer is light and spreads easily. I only used it for about two days before I saw results. The loose skin under my chin and on my neck completely firmed up, it was a huge change! The product lasts a long time and does what it says it will do. It is not greasy and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> This facial firiming moisturizer helped me reduced the wrinkles and helps me look and feel more healthy. I am a smoker and this seems to have help reduce the effects it has on me. I have been using this product for a year along with a weekly sea of life facial scrub and mud mask.  Even with out those other products, its still works by it self.  Its almost like a facelift without surgery.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer that works on my face. I have dry skin, excema and almost 50. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I used it and its okay, not that fancy actually. I dont know why it is ranking so high in the beauty products.</li>
            <li> very good for my face and neck areas and i used every day 2 times, morning and evening. Is excellenttttttttt</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month, and the pot is nearly empty. From the first time I used it, it made my skin beautifully soft, and now, four weeks on,the firming effect has kicked in too. Beautiful orangey smell, and not at all sticky. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first but tried it.  It works better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  It firms your face instantly.  It has very little scent and it does not burn my eyes.  Not oily just perfect for wearing under foundation.  I use it everyday and have received phenominal results.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a product that firms out pores.</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses this product will not regret. This is the most awesome product I have ever used. I am 55 years and look like a 35 year old, this product is the best, I recomend to anyone who wants to have younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> made my eyes burn, but then again I have bad allergies and gave it to my daughter. I guess it would be in the companies best interest to make it more organic ingredients</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was not good for my skin.  I had great hopes of seeing improvement in the texture of my skin, but unfortunately I had to stop using it after a week.  I started to notice spots appearing above and below the surface of my skin and that&#x27;s when I went back to my previous moisturizer and my skin is now clear again.  The light citrus fragrance was ok, but seemed to be masking a more unpleasant smell.  Instead of throwing it away though, I am using it as body lotion on my thighs and buttocks in the hope that it will firm and tighten the skin in that area!  Hey, one can only hope, right?  Product arrived super quick, great seller.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years paying $16.99 to $19.99. Logged in to purchase today and the price has tripled!!!! I now see it for as much as $75.00 with the cheapest price at $45.00.&lt;br /&gt;I can no longer use this product because it priced itself right out of my budget.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past from Amazon and loved it. This time the jar arrived in bubble wrap, with no box and no seal.The jar is full and the content looks and smells like the real stuff, but I can&#x27;t help wondering if somebody has already put her fingers in it (yes, I am that squeamish). Of course it could just be that the original box somehow got damaged or it was removed to fit the jar in a smaller shipping box, in which case a little note would have been nice. I will probably start using the cream as a hand moisturizer until I relax enough to put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I discovered this cream some time ago but was paying a lot more for it. It&#x27;s a very good cream for firming facial skin, is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stated before I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 23 years.It&#x27;s very good for my face.Not greasy and very good moisturizer</li>
            <li> This was not anything special at all.  Performed the same as a mid-priced discount store brand, so recommend saving yourself some money and going with one of those.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of years.  It is reasonably priced and keeps my face soft and feeling good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Just wish I could always find it for a good price.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product after seeing reviews, don&#x27;t waste your money.  It will temporarily hydrate and that&#x27;s pretty well about it, I did not see any firming or anything else positive.  Really no better than a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting at all. It does moisturizer. I want something that penetrates more, but I use this everyday &amp; it&#x27;s no problem under makeup.  I will explore what more this brand has to offer.</li>
            <li> This product is unavailable in Canada. I have very sensitive skin and react to most facial products. I do not to the Swisa line.Wish i could get this in Canada again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes my skin feel like silk.  No perfume smell to it. Have ordered this product multiple times.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and leaves your skin really soft.  I like to use this right after shaving my face.</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old and many people think I look like a teenager :) this product is awesome! I keep buying it as soon as I run out,absolutely can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> perfect.&lt;br /&gt;love it.</li>
            <li> Having used this product off and on now for some time, I have to say that I have developed a new appreciation for this skin moisturizer. It&#x27;s properties are not as noticeable at first, unless you are using other products that claim to accomplish the same results. THIS PRODUCT DOES WHAT IT SHOULD DO! It is subtle, but very firm as you apply it to dry skin. You can feel the difference on your face as opposed to other products that merely layer a creme on your skin. This feels as though it penetrates your pores and gives you a noticeable sensation that lasts. I recommend this moisturizer wholeheartedly and will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> So far, this product feels great. I would recommend it, as it provides a great deal of moisture to the face</li>
            <li> I used to buy this moisturizer from the kiosks at the local shopping malls where the salespeople approach you and pressure you to buy their Dead Sea salt product line. The first time I bought it was in  2007 with a variety of other products to help with my acne, and it was expensive (the moist user itself was $40). The other products were ok, but I absolutely LOVED this moisturizer! It made my skin feel smooth but didn&#x27;t cause my naturally oily skin to build excess oil through the day, and it worked well under foundation since many of my moisturizers for acne cause a lot of flaking or over drying. I had used it for a little over a year until the kiosks changed companies and I did not want to chance paying that much for a new product line. I&#x27;ve gone through many products and did not think to look on Amazon until recently. Wow, and it was half the price I paid before! Extremely happy...</li>
            <li> I love how this product feels on my face. Your face feels so soft and refreshed.  I would recommend this product.</li>
