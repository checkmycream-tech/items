    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They worked great!</li>
            <li>Great colors!</li>
            <li>These are a wonderful option to hold it in place while still looking like a grown up.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my baby fine hair!</li>
            <li>Perfect for fine haired woman, children</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to someone who doesn&#x27;t have good hand strength.</li>
            <li>Good quality hair clips.</li>
            <li>my hair is also very healthy</li>
            <li>they are nice, but just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>These are the barrettes I used when I was young, and they&#x27;re the ones I still like best.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a more factory glue-like texture, the kind that peels off of packages.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>Unless you have very fine hair</li>
            <li>If the plastic didn&#x27;t come to the point where the closure is,,, if it were tapered,,, it might be a better product.</li>
            <li>cute colors though.</li>
            <li>I love them :)</li>
            <li>I love the gripper thing--it makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>I removed the plastic sheath off one of them and it made things a bit better, but I gave up on them.</li>
            <li>They look great though, I have no regrets for having bought them, they are very stylish and sleek.</li>
            <li>If your hair is thinner, it may slip more.</li>
            <li>Maybe they will work better when I have thicker hair?</li>
            <li>If you have thicker hair make sure you get the ones without the plastic sheathe gripper.</li>
            <li>Thanks for another great purchase.</li>
            <li>I thought these new versions would be a great improvement, because they boasted a \\&quot;grip\\&quot; part and \\&quot;all day</li>
            <li>And my hair isn&#x27;t even particularly fine.  </li>
            <li>They hold the hair securely and are easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li>Gift for fine haired woman; she loves them.  </li>
            <li>If you feel the backs of both types of clips, they are almost equally smooth.  </li>
            <li>It it so smooth that it&#x27;s almost as if there isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;grip\\&quot; part at all.</li>
            <li>the no-slip grip seems nice for keeping hair in place, but it also makes it harder to get the barrette in your hair with it looking good.</li>
            <li>but it may be more effective for different hair types.</li>
            <li>Non slip soft plastic cover of the clasp bar is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>A good price and arrived in a short time.</li>
            <li>These would be perfect if only they would open and close without my breaking fingernails or bending a finger until it hurts!  </li>
            <li>These are perfect if you want to pull your hair back for a different look...</li>
            <li>So if you have very thick, curly hair, I&#x27;d say these would work best for you and anyone else will need to be patient with the product.</li>
            <li>I gave them two stars only because they look nice.  </li>
            <li>Now, this plastic grip lining is located around the bottom prong of the barrette and only kind of works.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is straight these are perfect for staying in place all day, and at the same time being discreet because they are flat.</li>
            <li>Despite the marketing, these barrettes slip right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>These seem to work a little better the more hair you clip.  </li>
            <li>They DO work pretty well too, just wish the \\&quot;grip\\&quot; was more effective, especially on a product from such a renown company/brand name.</li>
            <li>These might have worked better if they used a different material for the grip.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy any other brand now of this kind of clip without gripper.</li>
            <li>Great as long as they never get wet.</li>
            <li>They can hold a lot of hair and they open and close easily.</li>
            <li>These barrettes fall out of my fine hair after a short while.</li>
            <li>and they just don&#x27;t hold as much hair as I need them to</li>
            <li>These really don&#x27;t slip.  </li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li>When my hair is normal and dry, I still have to twist a bit of hair up first, but when my hair is smooth and straightened, I have to twist A LOT up, and even then it will slip out every now and then throughout the day</li>
            <li>I did a LOT of research on these barrettes, read many mixed reviews, and finally decided to just try them for myself.</li>
            <li>More than that, the grip helps a little.  </li>
            <li>You cannot just slide it up into your hair without twisting a large amount up first, especially if you straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>They stay in place really well, but with the added &amp;#34;no slip&amp;#34; guard on the back part of the clip, you can&#x27;t put very much hair in the barrette, otherwise it won&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li>a few are better than others.</li>
            <li>They seem like nice clips, but they just don&#x27;t work for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottom prong is almost \\&quot;U\\&quot; shaped and not much of it is flat against the top, no pancake effect, and your hair will spread into the looped areas, giving room to come loose.</li>
            <li>However, I recently got an agave keratin hair straightening treatment (which I really recommend!)</li>
            <li>Where I live these barrettes are hard to find, so I was pleased to find them here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old and my hands are getting arthritis</li>
            <li>For example, if you are just clipping bangs back into a pony tail, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of a difference between the two types of clips.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, medium-thick hair.</li>
            <li>So unless you gather a lot of hair and twist it around and really place the barrette tightly into your hair, it absolutely WILL slip out.</li>
            <li>i have very fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>i am a young woman and it took me forever to get some of them open!</li>
            <li>I find it hard to open and close these, but they do hold the hair well and stay secure in my short hair.</li>
            <li>i could barely get these barrettes open!</li>
            <li>My hair is somewhat thin and fine</li>

            <li> i could barely get these barrettes open!</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat thin and fine</li>
            <li> You have to put the hair in carefully and not drag across the hair for this to work for you.  </li>
            <li> and after that the barrettes totally slipped way back and my bangs fell loose in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Well I have extremely thick hair and while they do hold, they are too small to fit enough hair to actually be of any use.</li>
            <li> Long hair???  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really long</li>
            <li> They hold thick hair like mine very well.  </li>
            <li> The finish is slightly tarnished on most of them, and they are ridiculously difficult to use.</li>
            <li> The barrettes don&#x27;t slip, but they are little more difficult clip on than a barrette without the plastic sleeve on the clip.</li>
            <li> I can pull up a bit of hair, but with a big mane like mine, I need something a little bigger.</li>
            <li> just as expected.</li>
            <li> Well, not really...</li>
            <li> But they do what they say, clipping without slipping.</li>
            <li> They are simply not large enough to hold back my thick hair.</li>
            <li> The barrettes are about 2.5 inches long and 1/3 inch wide and come in pairs of silver, tortoise-shell brown, and black.</li>
            <li> and i can only use them to put my hair half up or less.</li>
            <li> It is hard to open and close the barrettes, and they don&#x27;t hold a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> The plastic sheathe doesn&#x27;t allow the barrette to hold much hair and makes it difficult to close.</li>
            <li> The no-slip grip is more annoying than anything.</li>
            <li> you cannot hold a lot of hair in these since they have the non-skip grip which makes it less \\&quot;flexible\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Functionally, they&#x27;re a one or less.</li>
            <li> I had bought some cheaper versions of these by Scunci previously, they were like bobby-pins with a barrette topper.</li>
            <li> Is not true that they are no-slip.</li>
            <li> They may stay tight if you can figure out how to get them to clip.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, they are a little hard to open and close, so I usually just use the clips without the grip.  </li>
            <li> Holds hair well (as long as it isn&#x27;t thin hair) but as soon as they get the slightest bit wet</li>
            <li> Maybe for a child or a person with moderate to thin hair.</li>
            <li> they are too narrow/small and too stiff which makes them difficult to open or close.</li>
            <li> They would not work well on thicker hair (but then again this style of clip usually doesn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> I have regrets for having bought them, my hair is thin</li>
            <li> The other reviewers say these don&#x27;t hold well in thin hair.</li>
            <li> Too small for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard for me to close them too.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thick and wavy</li>
            <li> Also, to finally clip it into the hair is difficult and awkward, you have to force the metal bottom part sideways and up.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s tough to get barrettes that hold my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have very thick hair</li>
            <li> These work well on my thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is rather thin as I&#x27;m growing it out, so there&#x27;s not a lot of hairs to grab onto in any one spot.</li>
            <li> It was extremely hard to close the clip once in your hair, and it hurt my thumb really bad.</li>
            <li> For me, these have been useless.</li>
            <li> When I use them, they fail to hold my hair in place and slip out of place.  </li>
            <li> By mid-day, my hair is falling out and is miserable.  </li>
            <li> Those were terrible, had no plastic \\&quot;grip\\&quot; part at all, so your hair had no reason to stay in place.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had a craft project, with these, for my three granddaughters.  They worked great!</li>
            <li> Holds hair well (as long as it isn&#x27;t thin hair) but as soon as they get the slightest bit wet they begin to rust and change color. Great as long as they never get wet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these had the plastic on the back of the clip.  While I get that it&#x27;s for keeping it on where you put it... it snags and breaks my hair.  You have to put the hair in carefully and not drag across the hair for this to work for you.  I&#x27;m old and my hands are getting arthritis so it&#x27;s hard for me to close them too.  If the plastic didn&#x27;t come to the point where the closure is,,, if it were tapered,,, it might be a better product.</li>
            <li> Too small for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Where I live these barrettes are hard to find, so I was pleased to find them here. They can hold a lot of hair and they open and close easily.</li>
            <li> These are not for me. But they are sturdy. I have thick hair and they just don&#x27;t hold as much hair as I need them to but they do stay in place.</li>
            <li> just as expected. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The finish is slightly tarnished on most of them, and they are ridiculously difficult to use. I would not recommend this to someone who doesn&#x27;t have good hand strength. But for the price, well, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair so it&#x27;s tough to get barrettes that hold my hair.  These would be perfect if only they would open and close without my breaking fingernails or bending a finger until it hurts!  Unless something is done to make opening and closing easier, I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> i could barely get these barrettes open! i am a young woman and it took me forever to get some of them open! a few are better than others. the no-slip grip seems nice for keeping hair in place, but it also makes it harder to get the barrette in your hair with it looking good. i have very fine and thin hair and i can only use them to put my hair half up or less. i was hoping to use them for a french twist. cute colors though.</li>
            <li> These do stay put - there is something (silicone?) over the lower part of the barrette. Holds my hair well.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife as a gift.  Cheaper than going to the store and spending time looking for something that may not be there.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is straight these are perfect for staying in place all day, and at the same time being discreet because they are flat. If you have very thick hair beware you cannot hold a lot of hair in these since they have the non-skip grip which makes it less \\&quot;flexible\\&quot;. Great colors!</li>
            <li> They hold thick hair like mine very well.  These are the barrettes I used when I was young, and they&#x27;re the ones I still like best.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking that they were larger than they are.  They are simply not large enough to hold back my thick hair.</li>
            <li> They may stay tight if you can figure out how to get them to clip.</li>
            <li> Despite the marketing, these barrettes slip right out of my hair.  And my hair isn&#x27;t even particularly fine.  For me, these have been useless.</li>

            <li> I have these both with and without the no-slip grip.  These seem to work a little better the more hair you clip.  For example, if you are just clipping bangs back into a pony tail, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of a difference between the two types of clips.  More than that, the grip helps a little.  Like others have said, they are a little hard to open and close, so I usually just use the clips without the grip.  If you feel the backs of both types of clips, they are almost equally smooth.  These might have worked better if they used a different material for the grip.  I posted a picture of the grips - hope that helps.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my baby fine hair!</li>
            <li> Good quality hair clips. They hold the hair securely and are easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li> Long hair???  These are perfect if you want to pull your hair back for a different look...I love them :)</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t slip.  My hair is very fine and I struggle to get it to stay in place.  These are a wonderful option to hold it in place while still looking like a grown up. Would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> These work well on my thin hair. They would not work well on thicker hair (but then again this style of clip usually doesn&#x27;t). I love the gripper thing--it makes all the difference. I won&#x27;t buy any other brand now of this kind of clip without gripper.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these. They seem like nice clips, but they just don&#x27;t work for my thick hair. they are too narrow/small and too stiff which makes them difficult to open or close. I was just trying to use them to hold up hair in the sides of my updo, like the picture of the lady on the package. they are nice, but just don&#x27;t work for me. Maybe for a child or a person with moderate to thin hair.</li>
            <li> Gift for fine haired woman; she loves them.  They stay in her hair, never falling out nor moving.  Perfect for fine haired woman, children</li>
            <li> I find it hard to open and close these, but they do hold the hair well and stay secure in my short hair.</li>
            <li> I have regrets for having bought them, my hair is thin and it just doesn&#x27;t work. Is not true that they are no-slip.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers say these don&#x27;t hold well in thin hair. Well I have extremely thick hair and while they do hold, they are too small to fit enough hair to actually be of any use. I can pull up a bit of hair, but with a big mane like mine, I need something a little bigger.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are not what I thought they would be.  When I use them, they fail to hold my hair in place and slip out of place.  By mid-day, my hair is falling out and is miserable.  I&#x27;ve tried them several times (just to give them a benefit of a doubt) but it is the same result every time.  I gave them two stars only because they look nice.  Functionally, they&#x27;re a one or less.</li>
            <li> The no-slip grip is more annoying than anything. It is hard to open and close the barrettes, and they don&#x27;t hold a lot of hair. I removed the plastic sheath off one of them and it made things a bit better, but I gave up on them.</li>
            <li> These clips stay on and don&#x27;t slide off my hair.</li>
            <li> I did a LOT of research on these barrettes, read many mixed reviews, and finally decided to just try them for myself. I had bought some cheaper versions of these by Scunci previously, they were like bobby-pins with a barrette topper. Those were terrible, had no plastic \\&quot;grip\\&quot; part at all, so your hair had no reason to stay in place. I thought these new versions would be a great improvement, because they boasted a \\&quot;grip\\&quot; part and \\&quot;all day hold\\&quot;. Well, not really... Now, this plastic grip lining is located around the bottom prong of the barrette and only kind of works. It it so smooth that it&#x27;s almost as if there isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;grip\\&quot; part at all. I was expecting a more factory glue-like texture, the kind that peels off of packages. I.e. something stickier. Also, the bottom prong is almost \\&quot;U\\&quot; shaped and not much of it is flat against the top, no pancake effect, and your hair will spread into the looped areas, giving room to come loose. So unless you gather a lot of hair and twist it around and really place the barrette tightly into your hair, it absolutely WILL slip out. You cannot just slide it up into your hair without twisting a large amount up first, especially if you straighten your hair. I have naturally wavy, medium-thick hair. When my hair is normal and dry, I still have to twist a bit of hair up first, but when my hair is smooth and straightened, I have to twist A LOT up, and even then it will slip out every now and then throughout the day and I must redo it. Also, to finally clip it into the hair is difficult and awkward, you have to force the metal bottom part sideways and up. So if you have very thick, curly hair, I&#x27;d say these would work best for you and anyone else will need to be patient with the product. They look great though, I have no regrets for having bought them, they are very stylish and sleek. They DO work pretty well too, just wish the \\&quot;grip\\&quot; was more effective, especially on a product from such a renown company/brand name. The barrettes are about 2.5 inches long and 1/3 inch wide and come in pairs of silver, tortoise-shell brown, and black.</li>
            <li> Non slip soft plastic cover of the clasp bar is a nice touch. You won&#x27;t have to keep adjusting it.</li>
            <li> I use barrettes to clip my bangs back when I workout. I got these hoping the rubber piece would help the hair stay in place. My hair is naturally thick and wavy so they worked well initially. However, I recently got an agave keratin hair straightening treatment (which I really recommend!) and after that the barrettes totally slipped way back and my bangs fell loose in my eyes. So in conclusion, I think whether these work will depend on your hair type. If your hair is thinner, it may slip more. Hope this helps you decide.</li>
            <li> They should not advertise these as No-slip. These barrettes fall out of my fine hair after a short while. I don&#x27;t like wasting money that are not as advertised.</li>
            <li> But they do what they say, clipping without slipping. My hair is rather thin as I&#x27;m growing it out, so there&#x27;s not a lot of hairs to grab onto in any one spot. Maybe they will work better when I have thicker hair?</li>
            <li> I have used these clips before but without the &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34;. It was extremely hard to close the clip once in your hair, and it hurt my thumb really bad.</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat thin and fine but it&#x27;s really long my hair is also very healthy so it is shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-economically friendly&lt;br /&gt;-variations of colors&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-this still slides out of my hair unless I also use bobby pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally won&#x27;t buy the product again but it may be more effective for different hair types.</li>
            <li> They stay in place really well, but with the added &amp;#34;no slip&amp;#34; guard on the back part of the clip, you can&#x27;t put very much hair in the barrette, otherwise it won&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these had a plastic sheath on it when I ordered it. Unless you have very fine hair these don&#x27;t work for thicker hair. The plastic sheathe doesn&#x27;t allow the barrette to hold much hair and makes it difficult to close. I tried taking the plastic sheathe off but couldn&#x27;t get it off and just gave up. In the trash they went. If you have thicker hair make sure you get the ones without the plastic sheathe gripper.</li>
            <li> I like these alot. I would buy these again if I needed too. A good price and arrived in a short time. Thanks for another great purchase.</li>
