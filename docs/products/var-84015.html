            <li>Extremely soft and nice quality, perfect to apply shinnings on the cheecks.</li>
            <li>The product also came with a cute freebie and a handwritten note, which was nice.</li>
            <li>This is a good, cheap stipple brush.</li>
            <li>Looks so nice and has a strong cover to keep it.</li>
            <li>Considering how often I clean the brush, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stipple brushes are great for covering a large area with a liquid color.</li>
            <li>I use it for my liquid and cream foundation (cream as in Revlon Whipped not the more compressed compacts) and it almost looks airbrushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how the make up comes on with this brush but it broke within a month.</li>
            <li>I love this stipple brush.</li>
            <li>I love the Stipple Brushes and this is cheap!</li>

            <li>I love elf products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love it a lot , it&#x27;s beautyyyyy .</li>
            <li>I bought two of them from their website for the price of 1 here :)</li>
            <li>But if your buying the brush alone you can get a better price else where.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Ive used ELF brushes before and was satisfied</li>
            <li>This stipple brush is okay</li>
            <li>and I love this.</li>
            <li>I am becoming a huge fan of the ELF line!</li>
            <li>I love most of the cheap e.l.f. products and this brush is no exception.</li>
            <li>its a good brush despite the shedding but other than that its great.</li>
            <li>It will feel light and you will feel confident with the coverage.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and it works great with poweder.</li>
            <li>my makeup looks FLAWLESS when i use this brush versus those sponge things , but however i did expect for the brush to be harder</li>
            <li>I loved it so much a</li>
            <li>Or if you are on a drugstore brushes real techniqes has a good one as well</li>
            <li>It could have easily been shipped in an envelope.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this brush it was amazing.</li>
            <li>love this product very much!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll definatley get great use of them, same quality of pro brushes, and extremely cheap price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was an accident or what, but I got a bronzing brush with it FOR FREE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight but</li>
            <li>great brush for putting on liquid foundation especially for matt foundations like matt velvet from makeup forever</li>
            <li>I am simply a cheap a</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually experienced with this with a lot of the ELF brushes, studio or essential brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Elf!!!</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a high quality amazing stippling brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I don&#x27;t always wear makeup when I do I want to make sure I&#x27;m getting nice even coverage without all the streaks that the flat head foundation brushes give me</li>
            <li>Yes, you can get the brush for cheaper at Target, but none of the Targets close to me carry the full sized version.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to have one for when I applied my wedding makeup, and was pleased to find someone who wasn&#x27;t over-pricing the item for profit.</li>
            <li>Not a bad brush.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay more on amazon, the brush is actually super soft, great quality, and doesn&#x27;t shed whatsoever, but you&#x27;ll definatley find it cheaper on the actual store, and E.L.F always has tons of promo codes, and 1 dollar brushes.</li>
            <li>but the hair from it come off pretty easily and gets stuck to your face.</li>
            <li>that is very cool and super and thanks for such a good service and quality.</li>
            <li>i am very happy with it and would recommend to every girl who actually uses foundation on daily bases.</li>
            <li>Yes, I wear makeup, bronzer to be more specific (more guys should try this in my opintion).  </li>
            <li>Anyways as far as the brush goes, sturdy handle, soft bristles, and very nice quality.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush, especially for the price, it&#x27;s not a top of the line, but the price is great and works good enough for me to want to save the money.</li>
            <li>theres barely any bristles in it, honestly.</li>
            <li>I have used alot of inexpensive brushes and that is exactly whay I got!</li>
            <li>Go to E.L.F and find it for way much cheaper, and google, a promo code and get free shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush for things you want to give a light touch too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and applies my makeup smoothly and evenly!</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth the price and comparable the brushes 2 to 3 times its price on the market.</li>
            <li>it came with all the bristels in place and is soft on my skin, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I found that this brush is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>and it came quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>you use less fondation so that saves you easy build , applies easier great brush going to buy another for a back up</li>
            <li>It puts on my liquid foundation smoothly and is soft!</li>
            <li>The first time I used a stipple brush was for a body painting.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t currently use this for body painting but it is the reason I love this brush dearly.</li>
            <li>THE WHOLE PURPOSE!</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>I almost paid quadruple the $$ for this exact brush from Sephora.</li>
            <li>Product arrived intact but the head and handle separated on its first use.</li>
            <li>I read some of the not so hot reviews and decided to order this brush anyways.</li>
            <li>It broke during the first use.</li>
            <li>Nothing a hot glue gun can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li>but nonetheless it was the first use</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a brush to give you smooth and natural looking makeup coverage you have found it...</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re going to be using these brushes everyday, why not invest in a good, quality set?</li>
            <li>it needs way more bristles in it and its a little to light for me.</li>
            <li>I love the low price and the high quality!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent stippling brush for my use, but I think if it was for someone who uses it every day they would be better off spending the extra money for a higher end product.</li>
            <li>I used a makeup brush to apply my foundation recently and fell in love with the way this particular brush&#x27;s application works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the brush is inexpensive but very high quality, brissles don&#x27;t come out if you give it a quit wash before using.  </li>
            <li>They shipped it in this HUGE box, with only my title brush inside.</li>
            <li>but alas, also do not have the skin to brave the world without it</li>
            <li>i dont understand why they raised it up soooo much</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>and i really like it .</li>
            <li>I received this in a fast manner.</li>
            <li>I use it for my foundation &amp; works very well.</li>
            <li>You may not expect much from this brush, but let me tell you.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t want to waste product and have it in the brush and not on my face and super easy to blend with.</li>
            <li>The top of the brush looked slightly discolored, but after washing/conditioning the brush and further inspecting it, it seems fine.</li>
            <li>this brush originally in stores is only 3 dollars!!!</li>
            <li>They normally cost $3-$4, not $7-$8!</li>
            <li>I find that this brush really helps to stipple my foundation into my face whenever I use it, making it look real natural.</li>
            <li>The handle is wooden and the top part holding the bristles is plastic that is glued onto the wooden handle.</li>
            <li>for the price it&#x27;s a decent brush</li>
            <li>I mainly use it with my highlighter or blush.</li>
            <li>It works very well and it is very soft.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive, but high quality.</li>
            <li>If you buy it alone, of course its going to cost a little more when you factor in shipping.</li>
            <li>Great for makeup artist and the everyday woman!!!!</li>
            <li>I really had high expectations for these brushes but after I received them I noticed how soft the bristles are on the stippling brush.</li>
            <li>The fibers are soft, easy to clean and the handle is thick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen so many other stipple brushes that will make your wallet weep with how empty they are, but not only is this one cheap it also works like a charm for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure why this brush is being sold for like $7...just go to eyeslipsface.com and get it for $3 :)</li>
            <li>Nothing super-glue couldn&#x27;t fix but still unexpected from a brand new item..</li>
            <li>I was being painted blue with gold designs for an indian promotional and we tried several different brushes and sponges before trying the stippling brush and by far, was the best at getting the base color of the blue body paint on me quickly while having full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The packages were taped shut w/ clear tape (WHO DOES THAT)???</li>
            <li>I had purchased another brush like this for double the price of this one and was very disapointed</li>
            <li>Too soft to use with liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>Either way for the value I would buy this brush again and just keep my glue near by.</li>
            <li>but idk if its supposed to be soft .</li>
            <li>Soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>But I think thats from packaging not the actual company, so yes I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone who enjoys professional styling</li>
            <li>but it is a bit soft for a stippling brush.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a non expensive brush this is good choice.</li>
            <li>This brush isn&#x27;t as good as their other brushes, it is soft, but a bit too soft, the bristles fold in which makes it hard to use for stippling .</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to use for liquid foundation, i think its a little too flimbsy for foundation</li>
            <li>you could easily get this at a local target for less.</li>
            <li>As I used it more and more the brush became too soft and leaves makeup a bit streaky :(</li>
            <li>Just put a tiny amount of your foundation on the back of your hand (like seriously, a 4th of the amount you&#x27;d usually use) and dip the brush in there, swirl it around real good, and voila!</li>
            <li>I loved how soft this brush was, the only negative thing I have to say about it is when I got it out the box some of the bristles was bent back and could not be bended back.</li>
            <li>I bought it for foundation, but it is way so soft and not dense enough.</li>
            <li>It does not loose bristles when you apply products or even when you wash it.</li>
            <li>I then pulled it out of the plastic holder and the black handle fell completely off!!!</li>

            <li> I bought two of them from their website for the price of 1 here :)</li>
            <li> But if your buying the brush alone you can get a better price else where.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Ive used ELF brushes before and was satisfied</li>
            <li> This stipple brush is okay</li>
            <li> and I love this.</li>
            <li> I am becoming a huge fan of the ELF line!</li>
            <li> I love most of the cheap e.l.f. products and this brush is no exception.</li>
            <li> its a good brush despite the shedding but other than that its great.</li>
            <li> It will feel light and you will feel confident with the coverage.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and it works great with poweder.</li>
            <li> my makeup looks FLAWLESS when i use this brush versus those sponge things , but however i did expect for the brush to be harder</li>
            <li> I loved it so much a</li>
            <li> Or if you are on a drugstore brushes real techniqes has a good one as well</li>
            <li> It could have easily been shipped in an envelope.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this brush it was amazing.</li>
            <li> love this product very much!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definatley get great use of them, same quality of pro brushes, and extremely cheap price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was an accident or what, but I got a bronzing brush with it FOR FREE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight but</li>
            <li> great brush for putting on liquid foundation especially for matt foundations like matt velvet from makeup forever</li>
            <li> I am simply a cheap a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually experienced with this with a lot of the ELF brushes, studio or essential brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Elf!!!</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a high quality amazing stippling brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I don&#x27;t always wear makeup when I do I want to make sure I&#x27;m getting nice even coverage without all the streaks that the flat head foundation brushes give me</li>
            <li> Yes, you can get the brush for cheaper at Target, but none of the Targets close to me carry the full sized version.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to have one for when I applied my wedding makeup, and was pleased to find someone who wasn&#x27;t over-pricing the item for profit.</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay more on amazon, the brush is actually super soft, great quality, and doesn&#x27;t shed whatsoever, but you&#x27;ll definatley find it cheaper on the actual store, and E.L.F always has tons of promo codes, and 1 dollar brushes.</li>
            <li> but the hair from it come off pretty easily and gets stuck to your face.</li>
            <li> that is very cool and super and thanks for such a good service and quality.</li>
            <li> i am very happy with it and would recommend to every girl who actually uses foundation on daily bases.</li>
            <li> Yes, I wear makeup, bronzer to be more specific (more guys should try this in my opintion).  </li>
            <li> Anyways as far as the brush goes, sturdy handle, soft bristles, and very nice quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush, especially for the price, it&#x27;s not a top of the line, but the price is great and works good enough for me to want to save the money.</li>
            <li> theres barely any bristles in it, honestly.</li>
            <li> I have used alot of inexpensive brushes and that is exactly whay I got!</li>
            <li> Go to E.L.F and find it for way much cheaper, and google, a promo code and get free shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush for things you want to give a light touch too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and applies my makeup smoothly and evenly!</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth the price and comparable the brushes 2 to 3 times its price on the market.</li>
            <li> it came with all the bristels in place and is soft on my skin, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I found that this brush is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> and it came quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> you use less fondation so that saves you easy build , applies easier great brush going to buy another for a back up</li>
            <li> It puts on my liquid foundation smoothly and is soft!</li>
            <li> The first time I used a stipple brush was for a body painting.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t currently use this for body painting but it is the reason I love this brush dearly.</li>
            <li> THE WHOLE PURPOSE!</li>
            <li> ;D</li>
            <li> I almost paid quadruple the $$ for this exact brush from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Product arrived intact but the head and handle separated on its first use.</li>
            <li> I read some of the not so hot reviews and decided to order this brush anyways.</li>
            <li> It broke during the first use.</li>
            <li> Nothing a hot glue gun can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> but nonetheless it was the first use</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a brush to give you smooth and natural looking makeup coverage you have found it...</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re going to be using these brushes everyday, why not invest in a good, quality set?</li>
            <li> it needs way more bristles in it and its a little to light for me.</li>
            <li> I love the low price and the high quality!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent stippling brush for my use, but I think if it was for someone who uses it every day they would be better off spending the extra money for a higher end product.</li>
            <li> I used a makeup brush to apply my foundation recently and fell in love with the way this particular brush&#x27;s application works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the brush is inexpensive but very high quality, brissles don&#x27;t come out if you give it a quit wash before using.  </li>
            <li> They shipped it in this HUGE box, with only my title brush inside.</li>
            <li> but alas, also do not have the skin to brave the world without it</li>
            <li> i dont understand why they raised it up soooo much</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> and i really like it .</li>
            <li> I received this in a fast manner.</li>
            <li> I use it for my foundation &amp; works very well.</li>
            <li> You may not expect much from this brush, but let me tell you.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t want to waste product and have it in the brush and not on my face and super easy to blend with.</li>
            <li> The top of the brush looked slightly discolored, but after washing/conditioning the brush and further inspecting it, it seems fine.</li>
            <li> this brush originally in stores is only 3 dollars!!!</li>
            <li> They normally cost $3-$4, not $7-$8!</li>
            <li> I find that this brush really helps to stipple my foundation into my face whenever I use it, making it look real natural.</li>
            <li> The handle is wooden and the top part holding the bristles is plastic that is glued onto the wooden handle.</li>
            <li> for the price it&#x27;s a decent brush</li>
            <li> I mainly use it with my highlighter or blush.</li>
            <li> It works very well and it is very soft.</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive, but high quality.</li>
            <li> If you buy it alone, of course its going to cost a little more when you factor in shipping.</li>
            <li> Great for makeup artist and the everyday woman!!!!</li>
            <li> I really had high expectations for these brushes but after I received them I noticed how soft the bristles are on the stippling brush.</li>
            <li> The fibers are soft, easy to clean and the handle is thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen so many other stipple brushes that will make your wallet weep with how empty they are, but not only is this one cheap it also works like a charm for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why this brush is being sold for like $7...just go to eyeslipsface.com and get it for $3 :)</li>
            <li> Nothing super-glue couldn&#x27;t fix but still unexpected from a brand new item..</li>
            <li> I was being painted blue with gold designs for an indian promotional and we tried several different brushes and sponges before trying the stippling brush and by far, was the best at getting the base color of the blue body paint on me quickly while having full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The packages were taped shut w/ clear tape (WHO DOES THAT)???</li>
            <li> I had purchased another brush like this for double the price of this one and was very disapointed</li>
            <li> Too soft to use with liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> Either way for the value I would buy this brush again and just keep my glue near by.</li>
            <li> but idk if its supposed to be soft .</li>
            <li> Soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> But I think thats from packaging not the actual company, so yes I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone who enjoys professional styling</li>
            <li> but it is a bit soft for a stippling brush.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a non expensive brush this is good choice.</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t as good as their other brushes, it is soft, but a bit too soft, the bristles fold in which makes it hard to use for stippling .</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to use for liquid foundation, i think its a little too flimbsy for foundation</li>
            <li> you could easily get this at a local target for less.</li>
            <li> As I used it more and more the brush became too soft and leaves makeup a bit streaky :(</li>
            <li> Just put a tiny amount of your foundation on the back of your hand (like seriously, a 4th of the amount you&#x27;d usually use) and dip the brush in there, swirl it around real good, and voila!</li>
            <li> I loved how soft this brush was, the only negative thing I have to say about it is when I got it out the box some of the bristles was bent back and could not be bended back.</li>
            <li> I bought it for foundation, but it is way so soft and not dense enough.</li>
            <li> It does not loose bristles when you apply products or even when you wash it.</li>
            <li> I then pulled it out of the plastic holder and the black handle fell completely off!!!</li>
            <li> It works very well and in other reviews other said it sheds</li>
            <li> Both brushes are deformed flat one one side</li>
            <li> It occasionally will leave one hair on my face appose to eight from the other more expensive brush in ONE use!</li>
            <li> I was already buying other things, so it wasnt that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this brush is that after a few uses and deep cleans, the metal part that attaches the fibers to the handle starts to come loose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too soft for me but other than that it applies the liquid foundation with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this brush, first at all i had problems because the whole thing isn,t well fixed, besides that the hair is very poor.</li>
            <li> In fact that&#x27;s the only reason why I&#x27;m giving it an average review.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried everything to reform them back into a round form.</li>
            <li> I would give it 3 stars because its a fixable problem but just not a problem you should have to fix by pulling the hair off your wet makeup.</li>
            <li> But little or no difference noted compared to other leading brushes I would use for the same purpose.  </li>
            <li> I have other ELF products and will continue to purchase their products.</li>
            <li> but i guess with this you take is as it is and get the other.</li>
            <li> The brush is extremely flimsy.</li>
            <li> And in response to the other posts about the bristles coming out...</li>
            <li> I am throwing my other brushes away.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not too mad because I added it on to my order to get the super saver shipping</li>
            <li> After a couple uses the top part came off which was annoying.</li>
            <li> just saying they should lower down the price to 4 dollars atleast</li>
            <li> The handle on the other hand unglued its self day TWO!</li>
            <li> Covers a lot of ared making my bronzing time less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> Let me say that this is NOT a cheap brush.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really heavy handed  with my brush.</li>
            <li> but like I said I use it everyday to blend in my blush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist, and i can say that this brush is a very poor quality tool.</li>
            <li> no splotches with using silly little white sponges...</li>
            <li> For less than $10 (MAC costs $22 at least)</li>
            <li> The bristles are staggered and when you apply your foundation it makes the product go onto your skin like velvet...with not problems...using a stippling motion as well as a little swirling motion the finish will astound you!</li>
            <li> The bristles fall off one at a time and get stuck to my face when applying my foundation, but not enough to be completely useless.</li>
            <li> This is a total rip-off!</li>
            <li> then i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one :/</li>
            <li> I usually purchase them in target</li>
            <li> lazy buti feel like it should&#x27;ve lasted a lot longer than that.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush every day for the past 2 months</li>
            <li> I have a hard time cleaning it though.</li>
            <li> It applies just enough color without making me look like a crazy baby doll.</li>
            <li> Save you&#x27;re money and don&#x27;t even bother with this cheap crap!</li>
            <li> AS WELL BUY IT AT AN EXPENSIVE MAKEUP LINE STORE.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t suck up product into the brush like crazy</li>
            <li> but it sheds :(</li>
            <li> BAD IDEA!</li>
            <li> Also the smell of the brushes them-selves is ridiculously awful...</li>
            <li> but i also dont hate it!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For less than $10 (MAC costs $22 at least) it&#x27;s a great brush!! I use it for my liquid and cream foundation (cream as in Revlon Whipped not the more compressed compacts) and it almost looks airbrushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stipple brushes are great for covering a large area with a liquid color. The first time I used a stipple brush was for a body painting. I was being painted blue with gold designs for an indian promotional and we tried several different brushes and sponges before trying the stippling brush and by far, was the best at getting the base color of the blue body paint on me quickly while having full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t currently use this for body painting but it is the reason I love this brush dearly. I will buy again if anything happens to the one I currently have.</li>
            <li> I have used alot of inexpensive brushes and that is exactly whay I got! This one is great for the money!! I reccomend it.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY ELF ONLINE IT TRULY BEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE! iN THE STORE YOU CAN GET THIS FOR 3 BUCKS.. AFTER PAYING SHIPPING AND HANDLING YOU MIGHT AS WELL BUY IT AT AN EXPENSIVE MAKEUP LINE STORE. ELF WORKS GREAT, WHAT YOU PAY FOR IT ON AMAZON ISNT GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW- GREAT BRUSH!! ;D</li>
            <li> Extremely soft and nice quality, perfect to apply shinnings on the cheecks. It does not loose bristles when you apply products or even when you wash it. Looks so nice and has a strong cover to keep it. I&#x27;ll buy it again!!!!</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this brush. It&#x27;s soft and applies my makeup smoothly and evenly! I loved it so much a I bought a second one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The E.L.F. Stipple Brush is a wonder to have in your makeup brush collection!</li>
            <li> The hand written note they send is amazing, and I don&#x27;t know if this was an accident or what, but I got a bronzing brush with it FOR FREE. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to use for liquid foundation, i think its a little too flimbsy for foundation but it works, i am now using it for my blush &amp; it works amazing .</li>
            <li> I love how the make up comes on with this brush but it broke within a month. The head separated and became wobbly after only a couple of uses. I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months and the hairs are coming out. Almost every time I use it it leaves hair on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. i am very happy with it and would recommend to every girl who actually uses foundation on daily bases. that is very cool and super and thanks for such a good service and quality.</li>
            <li> Thanks Elf!!! I love this stipple brush. It&#x27;s light weight but great built. Looks expensive (better than my Mac brush).</li>
            <li> I had purchased another brush like this for double the price of this one and was very disapointed so i decided since this product is so affordable, that i should give it a try. I am very, very happy with it. It occasionally will leave one hair on my face appose to eight from the other more expensive brush in ONE use! I have other ELF products and will continue to purchase their products. I haven&#x27;t ran into one yet that ive had problems with.</li>
            <li> I am becoming a huge fan of the ELF line! This one is a winner too! I almost paid quadruple the $$ for this exact brush from Sephora. Let me say that this is NOT a cheap brush. It was inexpensive, but high quality. It is magical!!! perfect for liquid foundation, but what I use it for is my blush and I adore it. It applies just enough color without making me look like a crazy baby doll.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent stippling brush for my use, but I think if it was for someone who uses it every day they would be better off spending the extra money for a higher end product. The bristles fall off one at a time and get stuck to my face when applying my foundation, but not enough to be completely useless.</li>
            <li> I love the Stipple Brushes and this is cheap! I bought mine from MAC for a lot! But ELF sells it for cheaper than 3.75! On their website it&#x27;s 3.00! This is a total rip-off!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in good condition. The top of the brush looked slightly discolored, but after washing/conditioning the brush and further inspecting it, it seems fine. The product also came with a cute freebie and a handwritten note, which was nice. Yes, you can get the brush for cheaper at Target, but none of the Targets close to me carry the full sized version. I was already buying other things, so it wasnt that big of a deal. If you buy it alone, of course its going to cost a little more when you factor in shipping.</li>
            <li> I found elf&#x27;s brush to be too sparse. It wasn&#x27;t dence enough to apply liquid or cream foundation. I use it for applying blush. Works better with blush but not foundation...</li>
            <li> great brush for putting on liquid foundation especially for matt foundations like matt velvet from makeup forever but it sheds :( i don&#x27;t like the shedding but i guess with this you take is as it is and get the other. it doesn&#x27;t suck up product into the brush like crazy which is good bc i don&#x27;t want to waste product and have it in the brush and not on my face and super easy to blend with. its a good brush despite the shedding but other than that its great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too soft for me but other than that it applies the liquid foundation with no problems at all.I have several dupes of this same brush!Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Product arrived intact but the head and handle separated on its first use. I&#x27;ll have to repair it. The brush head itself works, but I&#x27;m not looking forward to constantly regluing the handle so I can actually use it.</li>
            <li> 1st - No, I don&#x27;t work for or have &#x27;stock&#x27; in this product...I am simply a cheap a** that can&#x27;t part with my make-up goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually stipple brushes are used for bronzers and highlight products; BUT this brush is actually really great for liquid foundation. That&#x27;s right. For those of us who can&#x27;t stand the feeling of foundation but alas, also do not have the skin to brave the world without it - this is a nice solution. Just put a tiny amount of your foundation on the back of your hand (like seriously, a 4th of the amount you&#x27;d usually use) and dip the brush in there, swirl it around real good, and voila! Put that sh*t on your face! It will feel light and you will feel confident with the coverage.</li>
            <li> I really had high expectations for these brushes but after I received them I noticed how soft the bristles are on the stippling brush. Too soft to use with liquid foundations. Both brushes are deformed flat one one side and I&#x27;ve tried everything to reform them back into a round form. Also the smell of the brushes them-selves is ridiculously awful... The packages were taped shut w/ clear tape (WHO DOES THAT)??? Maybe some1 bought them b4 and returned them IDK. I gave it 1 star for the shipping time. I ordered the Monday and got them today.(Thursday)</li>
            <li> This is a good brush, especially for the price, it&#x27;s not a top of the line, but the price is great and works good enough for me to want to save the money.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. The bristles are so soft and it works great with poweder.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for putting on my liquid foundation. It gives it that airbrushed look without a hefty price tag.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I find that this brush really helps to stipple my foundation into my face whenever I use it, making it look real natural. Lovely brush!</li>
            <li> this brush originally in stores is only 3 dollars!!! i dont understand why they raised it up soooo much you could easily get this at a local target for less. just saying they should lower down the price to 4 dollars atleast</li>
            <li> My local Target has been out of stock of this brush for MONTHS. I really wanted to have one for when I applied my wedding makeup, and was pleased to find someone who wasn&#x27;t over-pricing the item for profit.</li>
            <li> Go to E.L.F and find it for way much cheaper, and google, a promo code and get free shipping. Don&#x27;t pay more on amazon, the brush is actually super soft, great quality, and doesn&#x27;t shed whatsoever, but you&#x27;ll definatley find it cheaper on the actual store, and E.L.F always has tons of promo codes, and 1 dollar brushes. You&#x27;ll definatley get great use of them, same quality of pro brushes, and extremely cheap price. But the brush is a great buy.</li>
            <li> The hair end of this brush works really good.. even blending and smooth hair free strokes. The handle on the other hand unglued its self day TWO! Nothing super-glue couldn&#x27;t fix but still unexpected from a brand new item.. Either way for the value I would buy this brush again and just keep my glue near by.</li>
            <li> I read some of the not so hot reviews and decided to order this brush anyways. BAD IDEA! When I got the package and opened it, the brush already had some hair shedding from it. I then pulled it out of the plastic holder and the black handle fell completely off!!! I put it back together, then tried to use it... all of the hair came out and stuck to my face!!! Save you&#x27;re money and don&#x27;t even bother with this cheap crap!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing to create a flawless finish. Defiantly worth the price and comparable the brushes 2 to 3 times its price on the market. Love ELF</li>
            <li> This is a good, cheap stipple brush. The fibers are soft, easy to clean and the handle is thick so you get a good grip on it. The only downside to this brush is that after a few uses and deep cleans, the metal part that attaches the fibers to the handle starts to come loose. I&#x27;ve actually experienced with this with a lot of the ELF brushes, studio or essential brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: they are good brushes for the price. You might have to replace them once in a while if you use them a lot. But if you&#x27;re going to be using these brushes everyday, why not invest in a good, quality set?</li>
            <li> this product is okay, i dont really love it but i also dont hate it! i guess it gets the job done if you put some work into it.... if you are looking for a high quality amazing stippling brush then i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one :/</li>
            <li> paid more than I would have in the store as I didn&#x27;t want to toll around to find one. The glue was not set properly and I had to reglue it when it fell apart. It works like champ now, but I don&#x27;t feel I should have had to fix it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a guy.  Yes, I wear makeup, bronzer to be more specific (more guys should try this in my opintion).  Anyway, the brush is inexpensive but very high quality, brissles don&#x27;t come out if you give it a quit wash before using.  Covers a lot of ared making my bronzing time less than a minute.  Dip it swipe it, done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this brush, first at all i had problems because the whole thing isn,t well fixed, besides that the hair is very poor. I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist, and i can say that this brush is a very poor quality tool. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it agan.</li>
            <li> i got this awhile ago and i stopped using it. it needs way more bristles in it and its a little to light for me. theres barely any bristles in it, honestly. i wish i got the sigma stipple brush. you get what you paid for i guess. i really don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. if you want something worth your money and has good quality, go for sigma!</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply my foundation and it does a great job. It gives an airbrushed look to your face.</li>
            <li> so i bought this brush because i figured i needed it after watching Youtube vids and i really like it . my makeup looks FLAWLESS when i use this brush versus those sponge things , but however i did expect for the brush to be harder but idk if its supposed to be soft . either way great buy ! but be sure to buy brush cleaner !</li>
            <li> Love It! this brush is great it came with all the bristels in place and is soft on my skin, easy to clean. and feels good in my hand</li>
            <li> you use less fondation so that saves you easy build , applies easier great brush going to buy another for a back up</li>
            <li> love this brush!! Great for makeup artist and the everyday woman!!!! Soft to the touch. I use it everyday!!&lt;br /&gt;Love!!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this brush it was amazing. As I used it more and more the brush became too soft and leaves makeup a bit streaky :( I&lt;br /&gt;Still use it often, along with a blending sponge or different brush to get rid of streakiness.</li>
            <li> I love elf products. I usually purchase them in target but I couldn&#x27;t find this there. It&#x27;s okay. But it was shedding even before i started using it.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for blending, stippling , everything lol . I love it a lot , it&#x27;s beautyyyyy . (:</li>
            <li> Not sure why this brush is being sold for like $7...just go to eyeslipsface.com and get it for $3 :)&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush! I bought two of them from their website for the price of 1 here :)</li>
            <li> I received this in a fast manner. It works very well and in other reviews other said it sheds but I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding with mines.</li>
            <li> I found that this brush is worth the money. The shipping only took three day. It works very well and it is very soft. If your looking for a non expensive brush this is good choice.</li>
            <li> I loved how soft this brush was, the only negative thing I have to say about it is when I got it out the box some of the bristles was bent back and could not be bended back. But I think thats from packaging not the actual company, so yes I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I bought this item from a company called soap. They shipped it in this HUGE box, with only my title brush inside. It could have easily been shipped in an envelope. Anyways as far as the brush goes, sturdy handle, soft bristles, and very nice quality. even comes with a brush cover! love this product very much!</li>
            <li> I love the low price and the high quality! It puts on my liquid foundation smoothly and is soft! I definitely would tell my friends to buy this.</li>
            <li> I like ELF&#x27;s brushes, just wish I would&#x27;ve done my research before buying this one. Target carries ELF, so before you buy it here, go check it their! They normally cost $3-$4, not $7-$8! In fact that&#x27;s the only reason why I&#x27;m giving it an average review.</li>
            <li> The brush is good, works well. I have a hard time cleaning it though. If I was just rating the brush I would give it four stars but I gave it one star because of the price. I paid $6.99 for this, and it sells in the stores and at the elf site for $3. It&#x27;s my own fault. But I&#x27;m not too mad because I added it on to my order to get the super saver shipping so I guess it all worked out. But if your buying the brush alone you can get a better price else where.</li>
            <li> The brush is extremely flimsy. You get what you pay for so it&#x27;s whatever. The handle is wooden and the top part holding the bristles is plastic that is glued onto the wooden handle. After a couple uses the top part came off which was annoying. I haven&#x27;t glued it back on because I&#x27;m lazy buti feel like it should&#x27;ve lasted a lot longer than that. I still use it even though the handle isn&#x27;t on at the moment. When using the brush for foundation it&#x27;s not that great. Doesn&#x27;t blend well at all. And in response to the other posts about the bristles coming out... Mine haven&#x27;t and I&#x27;m really heavy handed  with my brush.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected&lt;br /&gt;Perfect.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys professional styling</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush.  But little or no difference noted compared to other leading brushes I would use for the same purpose.  Priced moderately.</li>
            <li> for the price it&#x27;s a decent brush but it is a bit soft for a stippling brush. It&#x27;s still very usable but for me it does take a few moments longer for application. I still would recommend it !</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself...but I wound up giving it away because the person who saw it wanted it! They love it!! So in turn I ordered another one for myself...I used a makeup brush to apply my foundation recently and fell in love with the way this particular brush&#x27;s application works. It looks like my skin is airbrushed! The bristles are staggered and when you apply your foundation it makes the product go onto your skin like velvet...with not problems...using a stippling motion as well as a little swirling motion the finish will astound you! No lines on the chin...no splotches with using silly little white sponges...I threw them all away! THIS IS THE BOMB!!!  Order them ASAP...I say &#x27;them&#x27; because I know people will be asking for this brush! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It broke during the first use. Nothing a hot glue gun can&#x27;t fix but nonetheless it was the first use</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a brush to give you smooth and natural looking makeup coverage you have found it... I am throwing my other brushes away. this is the only one i need. great brush...</li>
            <li> I really like this brush for things you want to give a light touch too.  I mainly use it with my highlighter or blush. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It is a very good brush, but it does need more bristles on it. still I like it alot and it came quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It worked well for applying mineral makeup. The price was very reasonable and it was shipped quickly. Would recommend a good brush to try.</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t as good as their other brushes, it is soft, but a bit too soft, the bristles fold in which makes it hard to use for stippling .</li>
            <li> Deff a 3 dollar brush. Ive used ELF brushes before and was satisfied but this brush does not serve a good purpouse. Not dense at all. It you are looking for a good stippling brush try Sigma or Sedona Lace. Or if you are on a drugstore brushes real techniqes has a good one as well</li>
            <li> I bought it for foundation, but it is way so soft and not dense enough. I use it for my bronzer and blush and it works great.</li>
            <li> I use it for my foundation &amp; works very well. i would recommend this to any one looking for a brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for almost a year now, and it still looks and works great. You may not expect much from this brush, but let me tell you. This stippling brush is great for applying and blending liquid foundation. I definitely would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This stipple brush is okay but the hair from it come off pretty easily and gets stuck to your face. I would give it 3 stars because its a fixable problem but just not a problem you should have to fix by pulling the hair off your wet makeup.</li>
            <li> I love most of the cheap e.l.f. products and this brush is no exception. I&#x27;ve seen so many other stipple brushes that will make your wallet weep with how empty they are, but not only is this one cheap it also works like a charm for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I don&#x27;t always wear makeup when I do I want to make sure I&#x27;m getting nice even coverage without all the streaks that the flat head foundation brushes give me and I love this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush every day for the past 2 months and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding or chipping of the handle. Considering how often I clean the brush, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush for my liquid blushes and stick blushes.  It&#x27;s super soft.  Didn&#x27;t do great on my foundation but like I said I use it everyday to blend in my blush.</li>
