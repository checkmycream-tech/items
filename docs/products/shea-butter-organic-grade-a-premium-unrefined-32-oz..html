            <li>It seems to me that the unrefined butter is best for your skin; however, if you strongly dislike the smell of shea, go ahead and purchase refined.  </li>

            <li>This is a wonderful all natural product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Organic is important, so I was delighted to find this product.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to massage it in the skin a bit but who doesn&#x27;t enjoy a good massage.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this easy to use Shea butter, product arrived quickly and in a very good container.overall very pleased.</li>
            <li>Im so ready for beautiful and yummy smelling  skin.</li>

            <li>Great product and a really large jar for the money.</li>
            <li>Authentic Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>Love the product but the SMELL...</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>I use in making body butter, love how it whipped up.</li>
            <li>, this is a definite keeper, the smell isnt the best  </li>
            <li>and they love it too.  </li>
            <li>Seems more sticky too.</li>
            <li>Love the price .</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it at this price.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I still love this product, but because of how I described it I find it best to use as a night time moisturizer ONLY.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better that they don&#x27;t add perfume in it.</li>
            <li>I love most</li>
            <li>The unrefined Shea is a lot better for your skin.</li>
            <li>I use this in my hair and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>One thing to remember like any nut butters you eat, there will be a layer of oil on top.</li>
            <li>Make sure you stir this into the Shea butter to even out the consistency before use.</li>
            <li>This organic, refined Shea Butter smells much better, absorbs into the skin much better and is healthier for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This actually helped me to create the best whipped shea butter mixture of my life!!</li>
            <li>love the smell of this as well.</li>
            <li>The top of the jar was off and the seal was opened.</li>
            <li>The product smells great and appears to be real shea butter.</li>
            <li>love shea butter</li>
            <li>I use this for deodorant, and it works much better than coconut oil as it doesn&#x27;t melt during the summer months.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shea butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already shared it with many friends.</li>
            <li>I love this Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I love this shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I started off using another company, however, when they were out of stock I purchased this and cannot say enough wonderful things about it.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to latex though and would love to know if this product has latex in it.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they carried Mango Butter and Avocado Oil hint hint :-)  </li>
            <li>I Love Love This Product.</li>
            <li>Seemed to me to be great quality (but I don&#x27;t have much experience with shea butter).  </li>
            <li>The more sunflower oil you add the more liquid it is.</li>
            <li>The cost is perfect for the quality and quantity, the smell easily blends with essential oils I use so that is</li>
            <li>Excellent solution for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the best tx for rough heals, too.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, it leaves your skin soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>smell isn&#x27;t that strong either.</li>
            <li>The difference in my skin is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this butter for the last week, I find it to be absolutely the best hand/heel moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>got this for my soap ingredients and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft, absorbed very nicely.</li>
            <li>I make my own lotion and this one works very well when melting and conjuring up a recipe.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, nice even texture.  </li>
            <li>It does require some effort to smooth it into my skin.</li>
            <li>I also find it rather greasy and has a light nutty smell.</li>
            <li>Now I apply the shea butter a few times a day and my eczema is the best it has been in ages.</li>
            <li>I really love the  packaging ( jar w/ lid) which helps to keep it fresh and extend the life of the shea butter.</li>
            <li>Great for all over body, face and in hair when mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this oil.</li>
            <li>and I originally bought this to treat my lips.</li>
            <li>as usual its wonderful for hair.</li>
            <li>It has a unique earthy smell but it wears off after a bit.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has already use a chunk of it on her home made lipsticks and wants another supply! :)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered unrefined shea butter, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE at first use.</li>
            <li>This product is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Really great for dry skin</li>
            <li>It is has a nice, nutty almost smoky smell to it that is very natural.</li>
            <li>My hair and skin can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s not 100% unprocessed &amp; unrefined &amp; it made a great end product.  </li>
            <li>but my baby soft skin is loving it</li>
            <li>So glad I can get twice as much Shea butter for the price</li>
            <li>It has your skin soft and really nice</li>
            <li>I love this product you get so much for your money and its organic.</li>
            <li>full strength on callouses and heel cracks, duct tape them overnight and poof, baby feet.</li>
            <li>I will no doubt be ready to order more once I&#x27;ve used this up.</li>
            <li>Definitely buy from this company because they are fairly priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful because I live in the very hot &amp; dry climate of Texas.</li>
            <li>but my hair (I have superfine hair and am leary of putting anything in it that might weigh it down, but I might get brave one of these days).</li>
            <li>like a paste, which is good, because you can dilute it down as desired with olive or your favorite oil.  </li>
            <li>My shea arrived fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>leaves a nice sheen on bare legs.</li>
            <li>My kids don&#x27;t like the smell, so I mix it with essential oils which cover up the original scent and make it smell really nice.</li>
            <li>How rare and special it is to get real undiluted creams!</li>
            <li>I love all natural product, eat all organic, buy organic makeup etc.</li>
            <li>I have to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; it out with fingers and rub it on my palms to make it even out, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>I love slathering this on my feet after a pedicure, it keeps my feet soft.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have any additives whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>love how soft it makes my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Whipped with some of my favorite oils like coconut, argan, castor and a little peppermint oil, it creates an even more moisture rich &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; that can be used for skin and hair.</li>
            <li>My clients love it and my hands feel much better afterwards then with any other massage lotion, gel, etc.</li>
            <li>It made a very nice ingredient for the heavy face lotion and sunscreen I made with it.</li>
            <li>Essential depot, kakosi, and mountian rose herbs (not on amazon) all have high quality, genuine, and certified organic product.</li>
            <li>You can use it right out of the jar...</li>
            <li>so of course I opened this right away.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to odors, and don&#x27;t find this strong or objectionable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s practically ready to use right out of the jar!</li>
            <li>It is very grainy, but if you rub your hands together quickly it turns very smooth like regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Delivery / date&lt;br /&gt;Price / higher than average&lt;br /&gt;Packaging</li>
            <li>Exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>This product however is the real deal!</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture and whips up just like real shea butter should!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>so I buy this bigger jar this tima as this is more cheaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that something had to be done to it to get it from natural chunk form to smooth &amp; creamy in a container.</li>
            <li>Melting this shea and adding a small amount of liquid oils makes for a nice, smooth cream.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit grainy at first; both the smell and the grains disappear immediately once the butter is worked into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future!!!!</li>
            <li>Also the cocoa butter is real!</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing Shea butter</li>
            <li>Our dollar is our vote in a totalitarian economy (&amp;#34;Wendell berry&amp;#34;)...  </li>
            <li>I have ordered other products from this company and liked them.</li>
            <li>have been using it for pretty much everything</li>
            <li>I was able to scoop it right out of the jar and into my mixing bowl to add my other ingredients and it made the fluffiest, smoothest hair lotion I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>The butter has a mild smell that does seem natural.  </li>
            <li>So just be cautioned that this may not have all the nutrients intact as pure, straight-from-the-shea-nut butter might.</li>
            <li>32 oz of pure shea butter we use to make hair creams and for skin care.</li>
            <li>All I had to do was purchase pure Shea oil to mix with the butter.</li>
            <li>This is a large amount of Shea Butter for the price.</li>
            <li>The yellow one is not shea butter and is usually more oily when emulsified than true ivory/off white shea butter.</li>
            <li>The butter is a tiny bit oily at first, but quickly absorbs and keeps skin moisturized even after hand washings--a first in my experience.  </li>
            <li>While the shea butter does a good job in moisturizing my skin, it&#x27;s hard and time-consuming to apply on skin.</li>
            <li>If your hair is fine, you may be better off with the yellow &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; that is really African butter because it is more oily and lighter than creamy and heavy.</li>
            <li>Plus it got here wicked fast.</li>
            <li>I go through so much Shea butter</li>
            <li>Very sticky.</li>
            <li>This does not stain my clothes or leave greasy marks (depends on how much you use).  </li>
            <li>This shea butter is the real deal;</li>
            <li>Have made so much with this jar</li>
            <li>Was really iffy about ordering stuff like this, for you always read some reviews about rancid or chemical smells coming from so called organic products.</li>
            <li>The quality of the shea butter is more than I ever expected considering I knew nothing of the vendor.  </li>
            <li>and I was really amazed by the result.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Really like this Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I used some in my whipped body butter and it just melted right into my skin and left it feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The first week i used it i saw some good results, my pores were smaller and my skin was less flaky.</li>
            <li>The next day I had creamy smooth Shea butter rich with essential oils!  </li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about ordering without trying the product first, since quality for many of the shea butters seems to be uneven.  </li>
            <li>This came super fast and is the only thing me and my family use now for our hair, skin, etc.  </li>
            <li>It has a light strange smell to it</li>
            <li>First of all the container is clear;</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to get a new jar of shea butter!</li>
            <li>This shea butter beats my former favorite, Aveda&#x27;s Hand Relief (currently $21 for 4.2 oz.)</li>
            <li>It appears to be high quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As we support goodness we get high quality goodness, and that&#x27;s what this Shea butter is.</li>
            <li>Because of that, I didn&#x27;t think it would work that great for my homemade whipped shea butter (the main reason why I purchase), but I was SO wrong.</li>
            <li>I never had to use much lotion or moisturizer when I lived near the beach.  </li>
            <li>It came out so smooth and creamy (as opposed to a whipped cream look/texture like the harder shea butter</li>
            <li>I started doing the whole natural thing</li>
            <li>They shipped so fast and it keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth all day long and alittle goes so far</li>
            <li>but i can tell that my skin is better off than before, especially when it comes to dry patchy flaky areas.</li>
            <li>If you have thick or dry hair, this will be great for you as a sealant.</li>
            <li>The jar that I receive contained darker shades of the shea butter mixed with a normal light yellow shade.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t imagine ordering anything from Africa uncertified as the chance of wage slavery and abuse is too high for me to justify supporting financially.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a butter you would expect it to be heavy, but I found the level of moisturizing to be medium, not enough for a dry Colorado winter, maybe too much for a humid beach environment, but perfect for all other conditions.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter is raw and authentic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for the cream I make for my dry hands, for the cream I made for my daughter to prevent stretchmarks when she was pregnant and for my mum&#x27;s foot</li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft.</li>
            <li>No fake yellow tinge.</li>
            <li>The key to not getting gritty cream is to put sealed jars in your refrigerator, or preferrably freezer, as soon as they are full.  </li>
            <li>product left my skin super soft and it didn&#x27;t fade off my skin like the regular store bought lotions.  </li>
            <li>I like that this product is natural and versatile.</li>
            <li>I am not completely out of my first jar , but I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li>it really has evened out my skin tone after using it daily .</li>
            <li>I have been buying from them directly for about 2 years.</li>
            <li>is that it is so soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of organic shea butters, and so far I am happiest with this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is definitely organic and the real thing.</li>
            <li>But I use this as a natural hair styling product.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old niece loves the smell of Shea butter</li>
            <li>I make body butters and soaps using shea butter as one of the natural oils.</li>
            <li>Soft creamy melts to a cream when rubbing your hands together.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose and the smell seemed strange at first too, almost like latex gloves.</li>
            <li>I love that this comes in a very large size and is the natural, unrefined Shea that&#x27;s so difficult to find.</li>
            <li>This shea butter has a slight nutty fragrance which dissipates rather quickly after application.........</li>
            <li>First, I must clarify that I&#x27;m unsure if this is indeed raw, unrefined, unprocessed shea butter because it was sent in the container just as pictured &amp; is smooth &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil only and wanted to try some ting new.</li>
            <li>When my hands get really dry in the winter I put on straight shea butter and cotton gloves before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>I will use this as long as I live!</li>
            <li>It is grainy and an odd texture for those of us used to super refined commercially produced lotions, but this melts when you rub it between your hands and absorbs beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All of Essential Depot&#x27;s products are of a high standard.  </li>
            <li>I recently moved to the desert and my skin did a complete 180.  </li>
            <li>yes when you first apply it - may seem thick but it melts into your skin fast.  </li>
            <li>thick Creamy smoothness, with an oppression free product.</li>
            <li>AS it says it is in the raw, I took it and mixed it with some other essential oils and made my own massage oil, hand cream, and foot cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other shea butters but this one, while it is organic, smells much more than the one I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>Very dry, coarse, and did not feel like the real Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it in the morning, I struggled to put on my tight pants.</li>
            <li>It feels a little grainy at first</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It seems to me that the unrefined butter is best for your skin; however, if you strongly dislike the smell of shea, go ahead and purchase refined.  </li>

            <li> This is a wonderful all natural product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Organic is important, so I was delighted to find this product.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to massage it in the skin a bit but who doesn&#x27;t enjoy a good massage.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this easy to use Shea butter, product arrived quickly and in a very good container.overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> Im so ready for beautiful and yummy smelling  skin.</li>

            <li> Great product and a really large jar for the money.</li>
            <li> Authentic Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the SMELL...</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I use in making body butter, love how it whipped up.</li>
            <li> , this is a definite keeper, the smell isnt the best  </li>
            <li> and they love it too.  </li>
            <li> Seems more sticky too.</li>
            <li> Love the price .</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it at this price.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I still love this product, but because of how I described it I find it best to use as a night time moisturizer ONLY.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better that they don&#x27;t add perfume in it.</li>
            <li> I love most</li>
            <li> The unrefined Shea is a lot better for your skin.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> One thing to remember like any nut butters you eat, there will be a layer of oil on top.</li>
            <li> Make sure you stir this into the Shea butter to even out the consistency before use.</li>
            <li> This organic, refined Shea Butter smells much better, absorbs into the skin much better and is healthier for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This actually helped me to create the best whipped shea butter mixture of my life!!</li>
            <li> love the smell of this as well.</li>
            <li> The top of the jar was off and the seal was opened.</li>
            <li> The product smells great and appears to be real shea butter.</li>
            <li> love shea butter</li>
            <li> I use this for deodorant, and it works much better than coconut oil as it doesn&#x27;t melt during the summer months.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already shared it with many friends.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I started off using another company, however, when they were out of stock I purchased this and cannot say enough wonderful things about it.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to latex though and would love to know if this product has latex in it.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they carried Mango Butter and Avocado Oil hint hint :-)  </li>
            <li> I Love Love This Product.</li>
            <li> Seemed to me to be great quality (but I don&#x27;t have much experience with shea butter).  </li>
            <li> The more sunflower oil you add the more liquid it is.</li>
            <li> The cost is perfect for the quality and quantity, the smell easily blends with essential oils I use so that is</li>
            <li> Excellent solution for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the best tx for rough heals, too.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, it leaves your skin soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> smell isn&#x27;t that strong either.</li>
            <li> The difference in my skin is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this butter for the last week, I find it to be absolutely the best hand/heel moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li> got this for my soap ingredients and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft, absorbed very nicely.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotion and this one works very well when melting and conjuring up a recipe.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, nice even texture.  </li>
            <li> It does require some effort to smooth it into my skin.</li>
            <li> I also find it rather greasy and has a light nutty smell.</li>
            <li> Now I apply the shea butter a few times a day and my eczema is the best it has been in ages.</li>
            <li> I really love the  packaging ( jar w/ lid) which helps to keep it fresh and extend the life of the shea butter.</li>
            <li> Great for all over body, face and in hair when mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this oil.</li>
            <li> and I originally bought this to treat my lips.</li>
            <li> as usual its wonderful for hair.</li>
            <li> It has a unique earthy smell but it wears off after a bit.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has already use a chunk of it on her home made lipsticks and wants another supply! :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered unrefined shea butter, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> LOVE at first use.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Really great for dry skin</li>
            <li> It is has a nice, nutty almost smoky smell to it that is very natural.</li>
            <li> My hair and skin can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s not 100% unprocessed &amp; unrefined &amp; it made a great end product.  </li>
            <li> but my baby soft skin is loving it</li>
            <li> So glad I can get twice as much Shea butter for the price</li>
            <li> It has your skin soft and really nice</li>
            <li> I love this product you get so much for your money and its organic.</li>
            <li> full strength on callouses and heel cracks, duct tape them overnight and poof, baby feet.</li>
            <li> I will no doubt be ready to order more once I&#x27;ve used this up.</li>
            <li> Definitely buy from this company because they are fairly priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful because I live in the very hot &amp; dry climate of Texas.</li>
            <li> but my hair (I have superfine hair and am leary of putting anything in it that might weigh it down, but I might get brave one of these days).</li>
            <li> like a paste, which is good, because you can dilute it down as desired with olive or your favorite oil.  </li>
            <li> My shea arrived fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> leaves a nice sheen on bare legs.</li>
            <li> My kids don&#x27;t like the smell, so I mix it with essential oils which cover up the original scent and make it smell really nice.</li>
            <li> How rare and special it is to get real undiluted creams!</li>
            <li> I love all natural product, eat all organic, buy organic makeup etc.</li>
            <li> I have to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; it out with fingers and rub it on my palms to make it even out, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I love slathering this on my feet after a pedicure, it keeps my feet soft.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have any additives whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> love how soft it makes my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Whipped with some of my favorite oils like coconut, argan, castor and a little peppermint oil, it creates an even more moisture rich &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; that can be used for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> My clients love it and my hands feel much better afterwards then with any other massage lotion, gel, etc.</li>
            <li> It made a very nice ingredient for the heavy face lotion and sunscreen I made with it.</li>
            <li> Essential depot, kakosi, and mountian rose herbs (not on amazon) all have high quality, genuine, and certified organic product.</li>
            <li> You can use it right out of the jar...</li>
            <li> so of course I opened this right away.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to odors, and don&#x27;t find this strong or objectionable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically ready to use right out of the jar!</li>
            <li> It is very grainy, but if you rub your hands together quickly it turns very smooth like regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Delivery / date&lt;br /&gt;Price / higher than average&lt;br /&gt;Packaging</li>
            <li> Exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> This product however is the real deal!</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture and whips up just like real shea butter should!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> so I buy this bigger jar this tima as this is more cheaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that something had to be done to it to get it from natural chunk form to smooth &amp; creamy in a container.</li>
            <li> Melting this shea and adding a small amount of liquid oils makes for a nice, smooth cream.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit grainy at first; both the smell and the grains disappear immediately once the butter is worked into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future!!!!</li>
            <li> Also the cocoa butter is real!</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing Shea butter</li>
            <li> Our dollar is our vote in a totalitarian economy (&amp;#34;Wendell berry&amp;#34;)...  </li>
            <li> I have ordered other products from this company and liked them.</li>
            <li> have been using it for pretty much everything</li>
            <li> I was able to scoop it right out of the jar and into my mixing bowl to add my other ingredients and it made the fluffiest, smoothest hair lotion I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> The butter has a mild smell that does seem natural.  </li>
            <li> So just be cautioned that this may not have all the nutrients intact as pure, straight-from-the-shea-nut butter might.</li>
            <li> 32 oz of pure shea butter we use to make hair creams and for skin care.</li>
            <li> All I had to do was purchase pure Shea oil to mix with the butter.</li>
            <li> This is a large amount of Shea Butter for the price.</li>
            <li> The yellow one is not shea butter and is usually more oily when emulsified than true ivory/off white shea butter.</li>
            <li> The butter is a tiny bit oily at first, but quickly absorbs and keeps skin moisturized even after hand washings--a first in my experience.  </li>
            <li> While the shea butter does a good job in moisturizing my skin, it&#x27;s hard and time-consuming to apply on skin.</li>
            <li> If your hair is fine, you may be better off with the yellow &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; that is really African butter because it is more oily and lighter than creamy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Plus it got here wicked fast.</li>
            <li> I go through so much Shea butter</li>
            <li> Very sticky.</li>
            <li> This does not stain my clothes or leave greasy marks (depends on how much you use).  </li>
            <li> This shea butter is the real deal;</li>
            <li> Have made so much with this jar</li>
            <li> Was really iffy about ordering stuff like this, for you always read some reviews about rancid or chemical smells coming from so called organic products.</li>
            <li> The quality of the shea butter is more than I ever expected considering I knew nothing of the vendor.  </li>
            <li> and I was really amazed by the result.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Really like this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used some in my whipped body butter and it just melted right into my skin and left it feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The first week i used it i saw some good results, my pores were smaller and my skin was less flaky.</li>
            <li> The next day I had creamy smooth Shea butter rich with essential oils!  </li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about ordering without trying the product first, since quality for many of the shea butters seems to be uneven.  </li>
            <li> This came super fast and is the only thing me and my family use now for our hair, skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> It has a light strange smell to it</li>
            <li> First of all the container is clear;</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to get a new jar of shea butter!</li>
            <li> This shea butter beats my former favorite, Aveda&#x27;s Hand Relief (currently $21 for 4.2 oz.)</li>
            <li> It appears to be high quality.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As we support goodness we get high quality goodness, and that&#x27;s what this Shea butter is.</li>
            <li> Because of that, I didn&#x27;t think it would work that great for my homemade whipped shea butter (the main reason why I purchase), but I was SO wrong.</li>
            <li> I never had to use much lotion or moisturizer when I lived near the beach.  </li>
            <li> It came out so smooth and creamy (as opposed to a whipped cream look/texture like the harder shea butter</li>
            <li> I started doing the whole natural thing</li>
            <li> They shipped so fast and it keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth all day long and alittle goes so far</li>
            <li> but i can tell that my skin is better off than before, especially when it comes to dry patchy flaky areas.</li>
            <li> If you have thick or dry hair, this will be great for you as a sealant.</li>
            <li> The jar that I receive contained darker shades of the shea butter mixed with a normal light yellow shade.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t imagine ordering anything from Africa uncertified as the chance of wage slavery and abuse is too high for me to justify supporting financially.</li>
            <li> Even though it is a butter you would expect it to be heavy, but I found the level of moisturizing to be medium, not enough for a dry Colorado winter, maybe too much for a humid beach environment, but perfect for all other conditions.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is raw and authentic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the cream I make for my dry hands, for the cream I made for my daughter to prevent stretchmarks when she was pregnant and for my mum&#x27;s foot</li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft.</li>
            <li> No fake yellow tinge.</li>
            <li> The key to not getting gritty cream is to put sealed jars in your refrigerator, or preferrably freezer, as soon as they are full.  </li>
            <li> product left my skin super soft and it didn&#x27;t fade off my skin like the regular store bought lotions.  </li>
            <li> I like that this product is natural and versatile.</li>
            <li> I am not completely out of my first jar , but I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> it really has evened out my skin tone after using it daily .</li>
            <li> I have been buying from them directly for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> is that it is so soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of organic shea butters, and so far I am happiest with this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is definitely organic and the real thing.</li>
            <li> But I use this as a natural hair styling product.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old niece loves the smell of Shea butter</li>
            <li> I make body butters and soaps using shea butter as one of the natural oils.</li>
            <li> Soft creamy melts to a cream when rubbing your hands together.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose and the smell seemed strange at first too, almost like latex gloves.</li>
            <li> I love that this comes in a very large size and is the natural, unrefined Shea that&#x27;s so difficult to find.</li>
            <li> This shea butter has a slight nutty fragrance which dissipates rather quickly after application.........</li>
            <li> First, I must clarify that I&#x27;m unsure if this is indeed raw, unrefined, unprocessed shea butter because it was sent in the container just as pictured &amp; is smooth &amp; creamy.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil only and wanted to try some ting new.</li>
            <li> When my hands get really dry in the winter I put on straight shea butter and cotton gloves before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I will use this as long as I live!</li>
            <li> It is grainy and an odd texture for those of us used to super refined commercially produced lotions, but this melts when you rub it between your hands and absorbs beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All of Essential Depot&#x27;s products are of a high standard.  </li>
            <li> I recently moved to the desert and my skin did a complete 180.  </li>
            <li> yes when you first apply it - may seem thick but it melts into your skin fast.  </li>
            <li> thick Creamy smoothness, with an oppression free product.</li>
            <li> AS it says it is in the raw, I took it and mixed it with some other essential oils and made my own massage oil, hand cream, and foot cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other shea butters but this one, while it is organic, smells much more than the one I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Very dry, coarse, and did not feel like the real Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it in the morning, I struggled to put on my tight pants.</li>
            <li> It feels a little grainy at first</li>
            <li> Is soft and melts well for mixing with other oils.</li>
            <li> So hard you have to soften it in the microwave first.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is much softer than the one I usually purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become increasingly impossible as I get older to find a moisturizer that keeps my hands smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the smell of it but its not so overpowering if other oils and essential oil are added to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really sticky and hard.</li>
            <li> NOW, I use this everyday and the shea butter keeps my skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter was grey and had an almost sand like texture.</li>
            <li> There are other shea butters on sale on Amazon, but they look like they have a yellow dye in them.  </li>
            <li> I use this Shea Butter for my homemade deodorant and hopefully for other hygiene products in the future.  </li>
            <li> and I suspect this is the main problem in why it doesn&#x27;t behave like other raw organic shea butters.  </li>
            <li> i have dry lips that are always peeling</li>
            <li> It also has the characteristic smell of shea butter but does well with scented oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to melt it down and add essential oils to it and hope that helps the stickiness situation.</li>
            <li> bought lots of different kinds, this one will probably last forever as very little is needed.  </li>
            <li> I melted half and added some essential oils to it then put it in the frig.  </li>
            <li> jar for my daughter as she has very dry skin</li>
            <li> Smell is very earthy and consistency is very thick.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using organic, unrefined Shea Butter, previously, I used the less expensive, yellow, refined Shea Butter and I must say that I can definitely tell a difference between the two!  </li>
            <li> but I prefer oil that remains in the same state year round.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin that over the years has become pretty much impossible.</li>
            <li> live in a dry, cold climate, cook every day and wash my hands frequently.  </li>
            <li> The price is up a few dollars from the last time I ordered , but a lot of products seem to change prices up and down.</li>
            <li> This one has a stron g smell but not nutty as the other kinds I&#x27;ve tried .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember that from other shea butter I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> At first I was really skeptical because it came out the jar feeling sticky to my hands.</li>
            <li> (The other product that I purchased was the Argan Oil.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I look forward to trying their other lines of products as well.</li>
            <li> well sort of and have already purchased several shea butter products in the past from other sellers</li>
            <li> I use raw shea butter for a lot of my homemade products and usually buy from other websites that have far more expensive shipping &amp; handling after multiple disappointing purchases on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it had hard balls or grain in it and it was open when it came.</li>
            <li> I find it a bit difficult to spread, you really need to work it into your skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what to do with it now, I will try to melt this down and add some scent oils?</li>
            <li> The scent is the expected nutty odor of raw shea &amp; didn&#x27;t overpower or overwhelm my added scent oils.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is not at all what I expected from a raw organic shea butter.  </li>
            <li> that was supposedly raw &amp; contained impurities &amp; foreign material.  </li>
            <li> Convenient container and air tight.</li>
            <li> so I can just keep some shea butter in a little jar and use it like that.</li>
            <li> It is a little grainy, but after I whipped it up</li>
            <li> I do not like oily moisturizers, though I have resorted to using straight olive and almond oils when I was desperate to protect my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell was that of shea butter, nutty but not strong putrid smell.</li>
            <li> I have a very serious medical condition and sometimes skin problems occur, but this stuff does wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Leaves behind little bits, like wet sand.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the jar (HDPE) and because it is organic and raw.  </li>
            <li> They say its unrefined so not sure why it smells like chemicals when they say its supposed to have a nutty smell</li>
            <li> I usually purchase one pound shea butter that comes in a plastic bag and is grade A .</li>
            <li> I usually get one pound for.</li>
            <li> My natural hair desperately needed this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it has been used.</li>
            <li> also have eczema on my hands that gets worse in the winter and getting them wet or getting salt or anything like that on them can be excruciating.</li>
            <li> I usually buy for a wholesale oil supply but have to buy at least a gallon</li>
            <li> I did not like the shea butter because the butter is hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I had to give it a 1 star rating... Should be a negative star...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap for a reason, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> but it is way to thick and sticky</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t overly greasy or thick like another shea I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> Its not soft and creamy but like wax with lumps in it, asked doctor and was told to ad water and use wisk to whip it, haven&#x27;t done it yet but hope it works, was a disappointment</li>
            <li> The shape of the bottle makes that a little difficult.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out</li>
            <li> it is so so so bad, when other people tell you it smells earthy</li>
            <li> In the cold weather this stuff is really hard and grainy.  </li>
            <li> Also I tried using it on my lips and no results unfortunately...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> they are nuts, this smells like old feet, so bad, very bad!</li>
            <li> Used for cold process soap making.</li>
            <li> I do not complain about the color or fragrance of natural/organic products because that is what I am after, products without artificially created smells, colors, etc.  </li>
            <li> It was bad wont ever order this again</li>
            <li> neither product have not been disappointed with either product.  </li>
            <li> i hate this product...</li>
            <li> but it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I make soap with the shea butter and this stuff was horrible...</li>
            <li> Anything I use causes horrible breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I just couldn&#x27;t deal with that awful smell</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! Great quality!</li>
            <li> This product is really great and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I use Shea Butter on my entire body, including my face. I love that this comes in a very large size and is the natural, unrefined Shea that&#x27;s so difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Delivery / date&lt;br /&gt;Price / higher than average&lt;br /&gt;Packaging / Good&lt;br /&gt;Notes / I was expecting yellow color of butter, but it turns out it holds white color with a turbidity of the bottom of the packaging&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for Amazon</li>
            <li> Excellent product just as described</li>
            <li> Like the Shea butter but it smells  like chemicals when I opened the jar. They say its unrefined so not sure why it smells like chemicals when they say its supposed to have a nutty smell</li>
            <li> Great! Authentic Shea Butter. I make my own lotion and this one works very well when melting and conjuring up a recipe.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this oil. I use coconut oil only and wanted to try some ting new. Well I guess you should stick with what you know... Love the product but the SMELL... it is so so so bad, when other people tell you it smells earthy they are nuts, this smells like old feet, so bad, very bad! I love all natural product, eat all organic, buy organic makeup etc. this one I can not use, I would smell like garbage. Don&#x27;t know what to do with it now, I will try to melt this down and add some scent oils?</li>
            <li> Used for cold process soap making.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really sticky and hard. The first week i used it i saw some good results, my pores were smaller and my skin was less flaky. It works well from what I can tell, I want to use it on my body but it is way to thick and sticky, you need to microwave it. It gives me a greasy feeling but i can tell that my skin is better off than before, especially when it comes to dry patchy flaky areas. Also I tried using it on my lips and no results unfortunately...i have dry lips that are always peeling and I originally bought this to treat my lips.</li>
            <li> Great product! Exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> Love their Shea butter! One of my favorite products. I have a very serious medical condition and sometimes skin problems occur, but this stuff does wonders for me. All natural healing products are the best 💚 . Great service, best price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This Shea is wonderful! Works great in my homemade body butters. Love how it smells!</li>
            <li> AMAZING. I use raw shea butter for a lot of my homemade products and usually buy from other websites that have far more expensive shipping &amp; handling after multiple disappointing purchases on Amazon. This product however is the real deal! It looks exactly like the picture and whips up just like real shea butter should! Plus it got here wicked fast. I&#x27;m in love with this product/retailer! Definitely going to be buying again when it comes time to restock!</li>
            <li> Great quality as always!</li>
            <li> Product  meets all of my expectations.  Is soft and melts well for mixing with other oils.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, nice even texture.  I use in making body butter, love how it whipped up. Leaves my skin very soft, absorbed very nicely. Definitely will be buying again</li>
            <li> They shipped so fast and it keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth all day long and alittle goes so far, this is a definite keeper, the smell isnt the best  but my baby soft skin is loving it</li>
            <li> Its not soft and creamy but like wax with lumps in it, asked doctor and was told to ad water and use wisk to whip it, haven&#x27;t done it yet but hope it works, was a disappointment</li>
            <li> I like that this product is natural and versatile. It does require some effort to smooth it into my skin. I have to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; it out with fingers and rub it on my palms to make it even out, but the results are worth it. For my face, I have learned to pat it on after I have rubbed it elsewhere, so I am not stretching the skin. Great for elbows and soles of feet. It does not seem to leave a greasy stain after washing socks and shirts.</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter for years, and this product has to be the best yet....bought some for my friends to try and they love it too.  Shipping was also prompt.</li>
            <li> I am going to try this as a body lotion and see how it goes. I usually purchase one pound shea butter that comes in a plastic bag and is grade A . This one has a stron g smell but not nutty as the other kinds I&#x27;ve tried . Seems more sticky too. Since it does not say grade A on the description I&#x27;m going to assume it&#x27;s not and that is why it&#x27;s differnt . Love the price . Hopefully will work well enough to bug again. I am definatley buying another brand to use as my face moisturizer though.  I have ordered other products from this company and liked them. I would like to know if it is in fact grade A or not      Just ordered this again ! Love the product it moisturizes great. I use it on my toddlers and myself . So glad I can get twice as much Shea butter for the price I usually get one pound for. The price is up a few dollars from the last time I ordered , but a lot of products seem to change prices up and down. I am not completely out of my first jar , but I don&#x27;t want to run out. I use this as my body and face lotion it really has evened out my skin tone after using it daily . I go through so much Shea butter I am so glad I found it at this price.</li>
            <li> This is great for DIY body butters and creams.  It whips up well and is of good quality.  I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I already bought its 16 oz. jar for my daughter as she has very dry skin and she was so happy and comfertable adter using it in winter so I buy this bigger jar this tima as this is more cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter says that softness remains even if she forget to apply it on next day.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well for my homemade body butter</li>
            <li> I use shea butter to make soaps and loved the end results , but when I used it to make body butter I dont like the smell . It has your skin soft and really nice but it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Item was as described. It was packaged in a sturdy container and arrived on time. Smell is very earthy and consistency is very thick. It made a very nice ingredient for the heavy face lotion and sunscreen I made with it. I will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> Very sticky. I don&#x27;t remember that from other shea butter I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;m going to try to melt it down and add essential oils to it and hope that helps the stickiness situation.</li>
            <li> All of Essential Depot&#x27;s products are of a high standard.  I have been buying from them directly for about 2 years. Beautiful fresh creamy shea!&lt;br /&gt;  Doctoral Candidate P. Roulier</li>
            <li> second time buying this product. as usual its wonderful for hair. will buy again.</li>
            <li> First, I must clarify that I&#x27;m unsure if this is indeed raw, unrefined, unprocessed shea butter because it was sent in the container just as pictured &amp; is smooth &amp; creamy. I know that something had to be done to it to get it from natural chunk form to smooth &amp; creamy in a container. It&#x27;s practically ready to use right out of the jar! So just be cautioned that this may not have all the nutrients intact as pure, straight-from-the-shea-nut butter might. It&#x27;s infinitely easier to work with though because there&#x27;s no straining to remove impurities or melting/softening needed. I was able to scoop it right out of the jar and into my mixing bowl to add my other ingredients and it made the fluffiest, smoothest hair lotion I&#x27;ve ever had. The scent is the expected nutty odor of raw shea &amp; didn&#x27;t overpower or overwhelm my added scent oils. It wasn&#x27;t overly greasy or thick like another shea I&#x27;ve purchased that was supposedly raw &amp; contained impurities &amp; foreign material.  Essentially, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. My hair and skin can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s not 100% unprocessed &amp; unrefined &amp; it made a great end product.  I would (and will) buy this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I love it but it&#x27;s not perfect. It is very grainy, but if you rub your hands together quickly it turns very smooth like regular lotion. I find it a bit difficult to spread, you really need to work it into your skin. I also find it rather greasy and has a light nutty smell. I still love this product, but because of how I described it I find it best to use as a night time moisturizer ONLY. The first day I used it in the morning, I struggled to put on my tight pants. It also moisturized my clothes. I&#x27;ve had the best results after my night shower. I put on my pajamas and just let it moisturize my skin over night.</li>
            <li> Sticky for some reason.  I usually buy for a wholesale oil supply but have to buy at least a gallon and this was easier.  I probably will go back to that.</li>
            <li> Works  well, no scent, just Shea Butter.  Excellent solution for dry winter skin.  Skin warmth melts the Shea Butter, allow for eventual even application.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry skin. At first I was really skeptical because it came out the jar feeling sticky to my hands. I have a sensitive nose and the smell seemed strange at first too, almost like latex gloves. After using this for a week, I can definitely notice a glow in my skin complexion as well as the decrease of scars from acne and stretch marks on my legs.</li>
            <li> Very dry, coarse, and did not feel like the real Shea Butter. I ended up returning the product and bought it from the different company.</li>
            <li> The jar that I receive contained darker shades of the shea butter mixed with a normal light yellow shade. I hope it&#x27;s not mole. While the shea butter does a good job in moisturizing my skin, it&#x27;s hard and time-consuming to apply on skin. It has a light strange smell to it but it&#x27;s better that they don&#x27;t add perfume in it.</li>
            <li> excellent product. 32 oz of pure shea butter we use to make hair creams and for skin care. will last forever.</li>
            <li> Great for the price! I make lotion with it.</li>
            <li> I just placed my third order from Essential Depot for their Shea Butter and I love it!  I&#x27;ve been using it for the cream I make for my dry hands, for the cream I made for my daughter to prevent stretchmarks when she was pregnant and for my mum&#x27;s foot cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most is that it is so soft so I can just keep some shea butter in a little jar and use it like that. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it being gritty. The unrefined Shea is a lot better for your skin. When my hands get really dry in the winter I put on straight shea butter and cotton gloves before I go to bed. When I take off the gloves in the morning my hands are still a bit creamy from the shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mum has had diabetes for over 30 years and she has been using my foot cream for her feet for about 6 years by now. When she went to the podiatrist he told her that he wanted to know what foot cream she was using because her feet looked like they were 10 years younger compared to last time he saw her lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to get a new jar of shea butter!</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and I love it.  I recently moved to the desert and my skin did a complete 180.  I never had to use much lotion or moisturizer when I lived near the beach.  NOW, I use this everyday and the shea butter keeps my skin soft and moisturized.  I love slathering this on my feet after a pedicure, it keeps my feet soft.  It has a unique earthy smell but it wears off after a bit.  There are other shea butters on sale on Amazon, but they look like they have a yellow dye in them.  This does not stain my clothes or leave greasy marks (depends on how much you use).  I love this product.</li>
            <li> The smell was that of shea butter, nutty but not strong putrid smell. The package itself looked as the display pictures, which I was happy about. I also purchased Almond Oil from Life Flo to mix with my shea butter. Im so ready for beautiful and yummy smelling  skin.</li>
            <li> I like this butter, it has a nutty smell and melts well into your skin. Even though it is a butter you would expect it to be heavy, but I found the level of moisturizing to be medium, not enough for a dry Colorado winter, maybe too much for a humid beach environment, but perfect for all other conditions. One thing to remember like any nut butters you eat, there will be a layer of oil on top. Make sure you stir this into the Shea butter to even out the consistency before use.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Good consistency and no discoloration. I&#x27;m just wondering how I&#x27;m going to get out the shea butter in the buttom of the bottle. The shape of the bottle makes that a little difficult.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using organic, unrefined Shea Butter, previously, I used the less expensive, yellow, refined Shea Butter and I must say that I can definitely tell a difference between the two!  This organic, refined Shea Butter smells much better, absorbs into the skin much better and is healthier for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second Essential Depot product that I have purchased and neither product have not been disappointed with either product.  (The other product that I purchased was the Argan Oil.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase from Essential Depot again and I look forward to trying their other lines of products as well.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is awesome!  I melted half and added some essential oils to it then put it in the frig.  The next day I had creamy smooth Shea butter rich with essential oils!  It&#x27;s wonderful because I live in the very hot &amp; dry climate of Texas. My natural hair desperately needed this Shea butter. I really do love it!</li>
            <li> Shea butter !! If you know shea butter then you can agree this is amazing so buttery and soothing to the skin will be buying again .</li>
            <li> Good quality butter, works well in my CP soap</li>
            <li> This came super fast and is the only thing me and my family use now for our hair, skin, etc.  It really is great, we love it!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face at night and under my makeup. No breakouts, and i am on my third jar. I do not like putting chemicals on my skin. This is the best tx for rough heals, too. Just put a pea size glob on your palm, rub hands together briskly to melt, and apply.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, well packaged.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is the real deal; great price considering the amount and organic and super moiturizing. Also, it&#x27;s great if you like to make your own lip balm.</li>
            <li> I received my items today  they are nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of organic shea butters, and so far I am happiest with this.  It seems to me that the unrefined butter is best for your skin; however, if you strongly dislike the smell of shea, go ahead and purchase refined.  Melting this shea and adding a small amount of liquid oils makes for a nice, smooth cream.  The key to not getting gritty cream is to put sealed jars in your refrigerator, or preferrably freezer, as soon as they are full.  Rapid cooling keeps the unrefined shea smoother than it would otherwise be.  Everyone loves the butters I have made with this shea.</li>
            <li> Great product and a really large jar for the money.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is much softer than the one I usually purchase. Because of that, I didn&#x27;t think it would work that great for my homemade whipped shea butter (the main reason why I purchase), but I was SO wrong. This actually helped me to create the best whipped shea butter mixture of my life!! It came out so smooth and creamy (as opposed to a whipped cream look/texture like the harder shea butter I was using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this as well. Using it alone, it truly helps to soften skin and keep my hair moisturized. Whipped with some of my favorite oils like coconut, argan, castor and a little peppermint oil, it creates an even more moisture rich &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; that can be used for skin and hair. I&#x27;ve even shared it with my Mother and Mother-in-law and they love it too! I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again, so I hope they never stop selling it!</li>
            <li> My shea arrived fairly quickly.  The top of the jar was off and the seal was opened. I am not sure if it has been used. The product smells great and appears to be real shea butter.</li>
            <li> love shea butter this is my second buy from this company ...I love this product you get so much for your money and its organic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. I received this hat and opened it. The shea butter was grey and had an almost sand like texture. I make soap with the shea butter and this stuff was horrible...I had to give it a 1 star rating... Should be a negative star... My husband and I have always been happy shopping on Amazon, not this time...</li>
            <li> Karen&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely organic and the real thing. I bought it for my face,as it peels and gets so chapped in the winter. All I had to do was purchase pure Shea oil to mix with the butter. I heated the butter in the microwave, added oil, stirred and now it&#x27;s perfect! ALOT for your money!</li>
            <li> I have used this product to make hair and body butters and like it&#x27;s performance but not the smell. It requires a stronger fragrant oil to hide the smell.</li>
            <li> But I use this as a natural hair styling product. I also use it on my legs and on cracked heels.</li>
            <li> It works good for my recipe</li>
            <li> Very good quality stuff.  I use this for deodorant, and it works much better than coconut oil as it doesn&#x27;t melt during the summer months.</li>
            <li> I use this to make body butter and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful all natural product. You can use it right out of the jar... it may seem a bit gritty but once you start rubbing it into your skin or hair it melts. It also melts well for use in homemade lotions, soaps, body bars, etc... A must have ingredient for homemade skin care product.</li>
            <li> I use this Shea Butter for my homemade deodorant and hopefully for other hygiene products in the future.  It appears to be high quality.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  My deodorant is wonderful and I have a couple friends hooked on it now.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it to create my own body butter. I am not a big fan of the smell of it but its not so overpowering if other oils and essential oil are added to it. My 5 year old niece loves the smell of Shea butter and she cannot resist to smell it.</li>
            <li> good quality shea butter. I have been making lotions with it and it is amazing</li>
            <li> Works great for my soaps, awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> got this for my soap ingredients and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> like a paste, which is good, because you can dilute it down as desired with olive or your favorite oil.  leaves a nice sheen on bare legs. so good for your skin.  bought lots of different kinds, this one will probably last forever as very little is needed.  full strength on callouses and heel cracks, duct tape them overnight and poof, baby feet.</li>
            <li> Good quality Works great</li>
            <li> Love it! Have made so much with this jar</li>
            <li> Just received my shea butter today (1/16/13).  It arrived quickly and was well packaged.  I am having a blast trying 100% organic products so of course I opened this right away.  It is solidified, yes, but as soon as you put it in your palm it melts - almost like solidified coconut oil does - well it is a bit on the grittier side and takes a bit longer to melt in palms but I don&#x27;t mind.  I do not complain about the color or fragrance of natural/organic products because that is what I am after, products without artificially created smells, colors, etc.  This shea butter has a slight nutty fragrance which dissipates rather quickly after application.........I tried some on my skin which immediately made it feel softer........yes when you first apply it - may seem thick but it melts into your skin fast.  Shea butter gives my hair brilliant shine and a wonderful softness.  I am in love with this product and happy with Amazon for making so many wonderful products available for purchase.  I will no doubt be ready to order more once I&#x27;ve used this up.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. It is has a nice, nutty almost smoky smell to it that is very natural. It is grainy and an odd texture for those of us used to super refined commercially produced lotions, but this melts when you rub it between your hands and absorbs beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for pretty much everything but my hair (I have superfine hair and am leary of putting anything in it that might weigh it down, but I might get brave one of these days). The difference in my skin is pretty amazing. I have really sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin that over the years has become pretty much impossible. Anything I use causes horrible breakouts. This feels soothing and wonderful to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have eczema on my hands that gets worse in the winter and getting them wet or getting salt or anything like that on them can be excruciating. I wash my hands a lot so this was causing horrid itching, cracking, and even bleeding. Now I apply the shea butter a few times a day and my eczema is the best it has been in ages. My almost 2-year-old daughter has eczema as well and I have been using this on her with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From reading up on shea butter, this seems like it is an excellent quality and a great price. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and with this seller (I got some glycerine from them as well). I plan on trying their cocoa butter next.</li>
            <li> I have never ordered this before, so I don&#x27;t know what to compare it to. I used it in my homemade body butter and everyone loves it. It does have a sort of nutty smell to it.</li>
            <li> I can only echo Laura Wilson&#x27;s review.  I was apprehensive about ordering without trying the product first, since quality for many of the shea butters seems to be uneven.  Also, the fact that the reviews are all dated around the same time raises questions for me.  But now I see why people are commenting on this butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter I received from Essential Depot. Inc. at the end of February 2013 arrived intact, with a sealed foil sheet under the lid.  The butter has a mild smell that does seem natural.  I am very sensitive to odors, and don&#x27;t find this strong or objectionable.  It is a bit grainy at first; both the smell and the grains disappear immediately once the butter is worked into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a dry, cold climate, cook every day and wash my hands frequently.  It&#x27;s become increasingly impossible as I get older to find a moisturizer that keeps my hands smooth.  This shea butter beats my former favorite, Aveda&#x27;s Hand Relief (currently $21 for 4.2 oz.) out of the ball park.  I imagine this butter would work into the skin even faster in a warmer climate. The butter is a tiny bit oily at first, but quickly absorbs and keeps skin moisturized even after hand washings--a first in my experience.  I do not like oily moisturizers, though I have resorted to using straight olive and almond oils when I was desperate to protect my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic is important, so I was delighted to find this product.  The fact it has no added scent is good for me and the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this butter for the last week, I find it to be absolutely the best hand/heel moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  I&#x27;m not related/employed in any way by the supplier, or Amazon, but am very happy to have discovered this product.  I&#x27;ve already shared it with many friends.</li>
            <li> Was really iffy about ordering stuff like this, for you always read some reviews about rancid or chemical smells coming from so called organic products. Plus the fact that is was a super great price when I ordered it. A part of me was worried I would get jipped on this deal. But to my delight, the shea butter and has a good texture. My daughter has already use a chunk of it on her home made lipsticks and wants another supply! :)</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the jar (HDPE) and because it is organic and raw.  I use it for my massage practice.  My clients love it and my hands feel much better afterwards then with any other massage lotion, gel, etc.</li>
            <li> Great product for soap makers, bath products</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter. I have read about the differences between this creamy ivory shea butter and the African butter which is yellow in color but is marketed in the Western part of the world as Shea butter. The yellow one is not shea butter and is usually more oily when emulsified than true ivory/off white shea butter. This one is perfect because it melts easily into creamy goodness in my palms. It also has the characteristic smell of shea butter but does well with scented oils. Definitely buy from this company because they are fairly priced. This one can be used on the skin especially during the winter months. If you have thick or dry hair, this will be great for you as a sealant. If your hair is fine, you may be better off with the yellow &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; that is really African butter because it is more oily and lighter than creamy and heavy.</li>
            <li> I used this in making body lotions &amp; lotion bars!&lt;br /&gt;It is really a great mix with the coconut oil I used.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t that strong either.</li>
            <li> Really great for dry skin</li>
            <li> Great product!  I am mixing it with some coconut oil and lavender.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter.  When I opened the jar and smelled it, I knew instantly that this was the &amp;#34;REAL DEAL&amp;#34; Shea Butter.  I really love the  packaging ( jar w/ lid) which helps to keep it fresh and extend the life of the shea butter. I also like that you place an expiration date on each jar.  I used some in my whipped body butter and it just melted right into my skin and left it feeling soft and smooth.  Awesome product.  I will be purchasing more in the future!!!!</li>
            <li> AS it says it is in the raw, I took it and mixed it with some other essential oils and made my own massage oil, hand cream, and foot cream.  This is the perfect thing for what I need.  It is a little grainy, but after I whipped it up it is great, and I love it.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is raw and authentic. I have had experience with various shea butters for over 10 years, and I know when I am using &amp;#34;real stuff&amp;#34; based on how my skin reacts. This butter is amazing.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this easy to use Shea butter, product arrived quickly and in a very good container.overall very pleased. Would by again.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is absolutely amazing.  It is initially grainy but once you rub it together, it melts in the hands and onto the skin.  Great moisturizer, it leaves your skin soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> Convenient container and air tight. The product works great. My skin feels amazing and no unnatural ingredients. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. I&#x27;m really happy with it. Makes skin very soft. My kids don&#x27;t like the smell, so I mix it with essential oils which cover up the original scent and make it smell really nice. I have used this product every day for over a year and I still have over a third left. I wish I could give it more stars, though it would be perfect if it were sold in a glass jar rather than having chemicals seep through with a plastic one. I would pay extra for the cost.</li>
            <li> Best shea I have ordered from anywhere! Container fully packed. Weight without lid 2 lbs 17oz.  Better than plastic bags! No fake yellow tinge. I am Happy with you! Please stay in business I need you. Also the cocoa butter is real! So hard you have to soften it in the microwave first. How rare and special it is to get real undiluted creams! You people just don&#x27;t know!  And at this price too! Praise God!</li>
            <li> This heavenly substance has changed my night facial routine. Just rub it between your palms and it&#x27;ll melt and slather it everywhere. You&#x27;ll have to massage it in the skin a bit but who doesn&#x27;t enjoy a good massage.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing Shea butter and I did a lot of research before choosing Essential Depot. It arrived on time and i immediately used it to make bug repellant lotion. It worked great. Will definitely Purchase ED products again.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is not at all what I expected from a raw organic shea butter.  First of all the container is clear; which compromises the shea butter and I suspect this is the main problem in why it doesn&#x27;t behave like other raw organic shea butters.  It&#x27;s cheap for a reason, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> This product is very gritty. it&#x27;s like rubbing sand on your body, it does not desolve. i didnt need an exfoliater. i hate this product...i will not buy it agine</li>
            <li> This is a large amount of Shea Butter for the price. This is great for creating  my body and hair butters.</li>
            <li> It was bad wont ever order this again it had hard balls or grain in it and it was open when it came.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I make body butters and soaps using shea butter as one of the natural oils. I started off using another company, however, when they were out of stock I purchased this and cannot say enough wonderful things about it. The cost is perfect for the quality and quantity, the smell easily blends with essential oils I use so that is does not over power the essential oils. I have now switched to this product.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly and was packaged well. I did not like the shea butter because the butter is hard to blend. Leaves behind little bits, like wet sand.</li>
            <li> Just writing in to speak to the Shea butter debate in the reviews. I got three different orders from certified organic sellers. I wouldn&#x27;t imagine ordering anything from Africa uncertified as the chance of wage slavery and abuse is too high for me to justify supporting financially. Our dollar is our vote in a totalitarian economy (&amp;#34;Wendell berry&amp;#34;)...  This is what I want everyone to know. Essential depot, kakosi, and mountian rose herbs (not on amazon) all have high quality, genuine, and certified organic product. They are all white colored, not too smelly (all Shea has a smell) and of perfect consistency for moisturizer, sunscreen, and balm for the organic people out there. I&#x27;m just writing to call you folks in to the blessed simplicity of knowing our purchase supports good community and ecology and economy, from the producer all the way through. As we support goodness we get high quality goodness, and that&#x27;s what this Shea butter is. thick Creamy smoothness, with an oppression free product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product - great smell...awesome price....</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered unrefined shea butter, and I love it.  I just have to mix it with some oils and make it whipped.  I love the fact it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t have any additives whatsoever.  I am allergic to latex though and would love to know if this product has latex in it.  I haven&#x27;t broken out so that&#x27;s a good sign.  I read that some shea butter can contain latex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product left my skin super soft and it didn&#x27;t fade off my skin like the regular store bought lotions.  I will only purchase this type of shea butter from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like this product and plan to make lotions out of it.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again. I started doing the whole natural thing well sort of and have already purchased several shea butter products in the past from other sellers and I just couldn&#x27;t deal with that awful smell and it wasn&#x27;t nutty either but at last this product worked well for me and did have that nutty smell I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  The quality of the shea butter is more than I ever expected considering I knew nothing of the vendor.  I use it to prepare my own hair and body butters.  No complaints from me!  I will be adding Essential Depot to my trusted sources/resources list.  I just wish they carried Mango Butter and Avocado Oil hint hint :-)  Have a wonderful Morning/Day/Evening everyone!</li>
            <li> I Love Love This Product. I have been using if from day 1.. using it on my Hair love how soft it makes my skin feels.</li>
            <li> This shea butter was packaged well and was perfect for my body butters.  Seemed to me to be great quality (but I don&#x27;t have much experience with shea butter).  Worked well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin after showers.  I have cracked heels and it does wonders for them.  Great on skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other shea butters but this one, while it is organic, smells much more than the one I&#x27;ve used in the past.  But it still does the job of healing and softening.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shea butter about on January and I really loved, I use if for lipbalms, moisturizers, etc. and I was really amazed by the result. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was as described, I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Worked great in my lip balm. Great product.</li>
            <li> I will use this as long as I live! Soft creamy melts to a cream when rubbing your hands together. Great for all over body, face and in hair when mixed with coconut oil. LOVE at first use.</li>
            <li> Really like this Shea butter. It feels a little grainy at first but when you melt it on your palms and apply it to you skin it becomes very smooth and moisturizing. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this but I prefer oil that remains in the same state year round.  I don&#x27;t want to have to switch containers with the seasons - jar in the cooler weather then squeeze bottle in the warmer weather.  In the cold weather this stuff is really hard and grainy.  I let it melt in the sun and mixed some sunflower oil with it so it would be softer.  The more sunflower oil you add the more liquid it is.</li>
