            <li>It *seems* good, but for a product I use often, I would like to check the ingredients list myself.</li>

            <li>It works as advertised and I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I bought this along with an ultrasound device of my own ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Very easy to pour into plastic bottle that came with it.                                                        </li>
            <li>Great value for the money, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Iam truly satisfied, served its purpose.</li>
            <li>Sincerely,                                             \\&quot;One Satisfied Customer\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Great stuff, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This product is good enough, good quality and inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li>Good product at reasonable price.</li>
            <li>No odor, doesn&#x27;t stain fabric, and cleans up easily.    </li>
            <li>Cleans up easy as well.</li>
            <li>It was shipped on time, is colorless, odorless, and is easily removed with water.  </li>
            <li>This gel worked fine with my therapeutic home ultrasound machine on my sore muscles.  </li>
            <li>I use this with my ultra sound machine and after wiping off residue, my skin is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel for an ultra sound</li>
            <li>Arrived here quickly&amp; was able to use it right away.</li>
            <li>Despite the product seeming entirely adequate for the task, I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because there is no indication on this online product description or on the product itself of the constituent ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Came quick, no problems.</li>
            <li>I will be loyal to this brand.</li>
            <li>Hard to get excited about gel, but if you want a good volume of quality transmission gel, this should work for you!</li>
            <li>It was packed just fine as well and arrived in a reasonable time.    </li>
            <li>Cleans up well with water, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, pretty much ultra sound gel.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product, was what I expected and recommend it to others for use with conductor ultrasound.  </li>
            <li>Product exactly as described and the price is cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>fast and exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li>This gel is very high quality.  </li>
            <li>They shipped really fast and the product has worked well.</li>
            <li>Compared with purchasing this product in smaller quantities, it is dirt cheap using this source.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the cheaper product because I&#x27;m a prime member.</li>
            <li>This is a rare enough occurrence to not be a real concern, so the Conductor brand still gets 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to love ultrasound gel, but it works the way that it is supposed to and was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have enough for at least 1 more month.</li>
            <li>It came with a small squeeze bottle applicator that is just right for its use.  </li>

            <li> I want to thank you for offering this product. Iam truly satisfied, served its purpose. Great value for the money, it was worth it. Arrived here quickly&amp; was able to use it right away. Very easy to pour into plastic bottle that came with it.                                                        Sincerely,                                             \\&quot;One Satisfied Customer\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product and would recommend to others. They shipped really fast and the product has worked well.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that my Physical Therapist used for ultrasound. I bought this along with an ultrasound device of my own ([[ASIN:B000IVEW96 Sonic Relief Portable Ultrasound]]) and it&#x27;s been great. No odor, doesn&#x27;t stain fabric, and cleans up easily.    One tiny complaint - it&#x27;s thinner and not as slippery as the gel Sonic Relief provided with their device, so the device sometimes \\&quot;catches\\&quot; on my skin. This is a rare enough occurrence to not be a real concern, so the Conductor brand still gets 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> For the price and I got a dispenser bottle with mine, this is just the ticket for my ultrasound units. With shipping included, you can&#x27;t go wrong.    This is the same basic gel your doctor or physical therapist will use.  Cleans up easy as well. It was packed just fine as well and arrived in a reasonable time.    What I received, the Box said it&#x27;s Chattanooga gel which I&#x27;ve also rated the same which you can find also on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I use it for my micro-current and ultrasound facial treatments</li>
            <li> I have conductor gel that came with my ultrasound unit and it has no odor.  Purchase this gel and it smells musty and moldy.  Not sure if I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> This gel worked fine with my therapeutic home ultrasound machine on my sore muscles.  When it dries it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; residue feeling which is good.  It has a small and barely noticeable smell.    Despite the product seeming entirely adequate for the task, I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because there is no indication on this online product description or on the product itself of the constituent ingredients.  It *seems* good, but for a product I use often, I would like to check the ingredients list myself.</li>
            <li> great price, and comes with a re-fillable container. Best price I&#x27;ve found yet at a buyer with no catalogue for vendors</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to increase the reliability of a sport&#x27;s heart monitor I use regularly.  It was shipped on time, is colorless, odorless, and is easily removed with water.  It works as advertised and I am very satisfied.  It came with a small squeeze bottle applicator that is just right for its use.  Compared with purchasing this product in smaller quantities, it is dirt cheap using this source.  The 5 Liter jug should last me for years and years.</li>
            <li> I use this with my ultra sound machine and after wiping off residue, my skin is not sticky at all. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> The delivery is unlike none other. Fastest delivery ever. Great product also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to love ultrasound gel, but it works the way that it is supposed to and was a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised</li>
            <li> fast and exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> This conductive gel performs just as was implied and instructed. It turned out to be a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Good product at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Works like gel should</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money. It&#x27;s VERY hard to get the gel out of the container into the small bottle. When you do manage to get some into the little bottle. You have to use the bottle when the cover off. IT&#x27;S NOT EVEN A SQUEEZE BOTTLE. HOW CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is what I expected.  It&#x27;s a gel for an ultra sound and that&#x27;s what I needed.  Thanks for the cheaper product because I&#x27;m a prime member.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described and the price is cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Works well with my ultrasound. Hard to get excited about gel, but if you want a good volume of quality transmission gel, this should work for you! Cleans up well with water, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, pretty much ultra sound gel.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Came quick, no problems. I would say buy this product. No hassels. It&#x27;s a good price, for the money. So I think it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Just as I ordered ,however not pleased with the way it was packed-came in the same box as the monster high dolls so they were all crushed(they were a Christmas present present)</li>
            <li> This product is good enough, good quality and inexpensive price.  The same product of other suppliers in this site. Just a little late to deliverer it.</li>
            <li> This gel is very high quality.  I&#x27;ve ordered other brands in the past, and sometimes they seem watery-perhaps they were expired?  I will be loyal to this brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 5 liter. I use the gel for my ultrasonic cavitation machine, on the arms, stomach, legs, butt, hip and back. I have used the gel every 3 days since 1/1/13 and it is currently 4/1/13.  I have enough for at least 1 more month. So all and all it&#x27;ll last for 5 months.  Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product, was what I expected and recommend it to others for use with conductor ultrasound.  As usual the product arrived within three days from Amazon.</li>
