            <li>Amazon has the best price anywhere.</li>
            <li>My nose happens to think this is the best perfume ever invented.</li>

            <li>One of Lancome&#x27;s classics and a favorite of the Ladies.</li>

            <li>I used this fragrance for many years.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>The smell is so sophisticated</li>
            <li>I feel grown and sexy when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li>It has such a pleasant scent and I am often complimented on it being pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>When I used it the first time, so many people complimented me on how good I smelled.  </li>
            <li>buy at a fair price on Amazon to make sure qwe get the real thing</li>
            <li>This will sound strange, but this perfume&#x27;s inside cap smells absolutely WONDERFUL.  </li>
            <li>Perfume arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Strongly frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be significant, but worth it!</li>
            <li>One of my absolute favorite scents!</li>
            <li>and my husband purchased this huge 3.4 ounce bottle from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper than duty free.</li>
            <li>I am a guy and know that it doesn&#x27;t matter how much I enjoy the smell of something.  </li>
            <li>Beware of cheap copies sold on the internet.</li>
            <li>As for the fragrance itself, Tre&#x27;sor is a lovely soft floral and wood fragrance which is advertised as containing notes of Apricot Blossom, Rose, Lilac, Iris, Peach, Amber, Sandalwood, Musk and Vanilla.</li>
            <li>When I grew up and could afford my own perfume, I decided to purchase a big bottle of my own.</li>
            <li>My best friend in high school had a tiny sample bottle on her vanity</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for more: the product was received faster than promised and was exactly as ordered</li>
            <li>It was many years ago when I first came across this scent.</li>
            <li>Arrived in brand new condition without damage or defect of any kind.</li>
            <li>Different flowers weave in and out, and I remain delighted and enthralled by Tresor as I wear it.</li>
            <li>I receive frequent compliments from friends and co-workers about how nice it smells.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for the wife expecting the same good fragance</li>
            <li>scent is a sweet smell, and it lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The smell is delicate perfect for a women.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery even with a \\&quot;Free Shipping\\&quot; option.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>It is heavy, great for evening wear.</li>
            <li>The perfume was not sealed in package and it did not smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>A more modern, contemporary (and recently opened box) vintage is peach juice, easy to wear, but lighter &amp; more fleeting.</li>
            <li>And the price was right.</li>
            <li>and she likes it very much.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like the Tre&#x27;sor EDP by Lancome my Sister once gave to me as a gift</li>
            <li>The last time I tried to buy Tresor for my wife, I am pretty sure I got a counterfiet.</li>
            <li>This time, I got the real deal!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for Tresor&#x27;s opening, and I resist wrist inhaling for the first 10-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>The first time I smelled it was from a friend who used this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t purchase parfum without ever testing it first.</li>
            <li>I still love it as much as I did back then.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have the beautiful Tresor fragrance - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s outdated or what,</li>
            <li>Great Deal on a hard to find perfume!  </li>
            <li>But when sprayed (and even the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot;) its just too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>, this scent too strong and too flowery for me personally.  </li>
            <li>This is a classic!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t so much cheaper than buying it at a retail location to make it work buying something close to \\&quot;turning.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tresor is a cozy, comforting &amp; warm fragrance without intending to be one, I think.</li>
            <li>Then it started getting very costly at the department store</li>
            <li>The product size and cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li>and i want the last version, but is original and worthed.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells great, but you must keep in mind that just a little bit goes a very long way...</li>
            <li>Bottle was only 75% full.  </li>
            <li>The problem is, it is only available at pricey department stores in my area so, as usual, Amazon has come through with making my favorite things affordable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li>Allergic reactions are possible, like with other products of this kind.</li>
            <li>It may have taken me a few years, but I am so glad that I continued to give Tresor a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>help me pick up two new boy friends&lt;</li>
            <li>Thank so much happy new year 2012 will see you next year, and mi english is not very good looking</li>
            <li>This was my first and will be my last time to order fragrance online.</li>
            <li>My other products I just use a touch of and many hours later will still comment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first and will be my last time to order fragrance online.</li>
            <li>But never the less this scent is crisp and clean smelling with greens mixed in with a hint of apricot.  </li>
            <li>This is sophisicated and mature.  </li>
            <li>So it may be really based on your personal body type</li>
            <li>I am surprised that this product is sold by Amazon whom I trust.</li>
            <li>The box it came in, the bottle, all labeling and especially the scent is exactly the same with one exception, the price tag.</li>
            <li>and I know for a fact that she purchases all of her fragrances from a high end department store located in her local mall.</li>
            <li>It brings back memories of being in high school and hanging out in my friend&#x27;s room after school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I cannot emphasize enough that we make certain all fragrance purchases clearly state the following: \\&quot;Ships from and Sold by Amazon.com\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>As a result, I did not receive this Christmas present until a week after New Year&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on recommendation from her and other positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Excelente compra, el producto llego en buen estado y a tiempo, de manera general podria recalcar que es una fragancia exquisita</li>
            <li>Long live Tresor.</li>
            <li>Why pay department store prices when one may purchase the exact same fragrance through Amazon.com for so much less?</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The perfume was not sealed in package and it did not smell fresh.  </li>
            <li> A more modern, contemporary (and recently opened box) vintage is peach juice, easy to wear, but lighter &amp; more fleeting.</li>
            <li> And the price was right.</li>
            <li> and she likes it very much.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like the Tre&#x27;sor EDP by Lancome my Sister once gave to me as a gift</li>
            <li> The last time I tried to buy Tresor for my wife, I am pretty sure I got a counterfiet.</li>
            <li> This time, I got the real deal!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for Tresor&#x27;s opening, and I resist wrist inhaling for the first 10-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled it was from a friend who used this perfume.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase parfum without ever testing it first.</li>
            <li> I still love it as much as I did back then.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have the beautiful Tresor fragrance - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s outdated or what,</li>
            <li> Great Deal on a hard to find perfume!  </li>
            <li> But when sprayed (and even the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot;) its just too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> , this scent too strong and too flowery for me personally.  </li>
            <li> This is a classic!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so much cheaper than buying it at a retail location to make it work buying something close to \\&quot;turning.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tresor is a cozy, comforting &amp; warm fragrance without intending to be one, I think.</li>
            <li> Then it started getting very costly at the department store</li>
            <li> The product size and cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li> and i want the last version, but is original and worthed.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great, but you must keep in mind that just a little bit goes a very long way...</li>
            <li> Bottle was only 75% full.  </li>
            <li> The problem is, it is only available at pricey department stores in my area so, as usual, Amazon has come through with making my favorite things affordable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li> Allergic reactions are possible, like with other products of this kind.</li>
            <li> It may have taken me a few years, but I am so glad that I continued to give Tresor a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> help me pick up two new boy friends&lt;</li>
            <li> Thank so much happy new year 2012 will see you next year, and mi english is not very good looking</li>
            <li> This was my first and will be my last time to order fragrance online.</li>
            <li> My other products I just use a touch of and many hours later will still comment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first and will be my last time to order fragrance online.</li>
            <li> But never the less this scent is crisp and clean smelling with greens mixed in with a hint of apricot.  </li>
            <li> This is sophisicated and mature.  </li>
            <li> So it may be really based on your personal body type</li>
            <li> I am surprised that this product is sold by Amazon whom I trust.</li>
            <li> The box it came in, the bottle, all labeling and especially the scent is exactly the same with one exception, the price tag.</li>
            <li> and I know for a fact that she purchases all of her fragrances from a high end department store located in her local mall.</li>
            <li> It brings back memories of being in high school and hanging out in my friend&#x27;s room after school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I cannot emphasize enough that we make certain all fragrance purchases clearly state the following: \\&quot;Ships from and Sold by Amazon.com\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> As a result, I did not receive this Christmas present until a week after New Year&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on recommendation from her and other positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Excelente compra, el producto llego en buen estado y a tiempo, de manera general podria recalcar que es una fragancia exquisita</li>
            <li> Long live Tresor.</li>
            <li> Why pay department store prices when one may purchase the exact same fragrance through Amazon.com for so much less?</li>
            <li> Fragrant, long lasting, yummy!</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I dont give it a 5 stars since it doesnt stay on me for too long, but then again one of my friend has this perfume and it stays on her.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one down side to Tresor.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black which makes it difficult to see where the hole is so that I can spray in the right direction.</li>
            <li> but it smells like it was watered down.</li>
            <li> It was stale and obviously very old..</li>
            <li> It was stale and obviously very old..</li>
            <li> Its little bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Am a little bummed out about that.  </li>
            <li> I discovered this fragrance a few years ago and got hooked on the scent.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s difficult to not want to stand next to other women that are wearing it.</li>
            <li> Product quality is consistent every time I buy it, I have never been disappointed and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> May be they are past the expiration date.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after purchasing this I have found that the scent doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used Tresor for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing, especially as I had to return to Macy&#x27;s and shell out $90.00 to replace.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing, especially as I had to return to Macy&#x27;s and shell out $90.00 to replace.</li>
            <li> As usual, it was still cheaper than getting it at the store!</li>
            <li> Its a serious scent not funny and silly like the bubbly stuff the kids like like Paris Hilton.</li>
            <li> Trust me, the scent can&#x27;t get worse..</li>
            <li> Trust me, the scent can&#x27;t get worse..</li>
            <li> I know, weird.  </li>
            <li> this is the ticket because the chance of offending anyone with over powering scents is unlikely with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is a bad odor, it is five minutes away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previous aficionado ..  :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I actually bought this for a friend. Best price on the Internet, and that even includes the shipping. As usual, it was still cheaper than getting it at the store!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for years. It has such a pleasant scent and I am often complimented on it being pleasant and not overpowering. It lasts a long time too. The price was below retail, and I was happy to find it on sale.</li>
            <li> Product quality is consistent every time I buy it, I have never been disappointed and would recommend it to others. Allergic reactions are possible, like with other products of this kind.</li>
            <li> My Wife loves this frangrence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We buy 2 at time so we NEVER run out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We buy at a fair price on Amazon to make sure qwe get the real thing</li>
            <li> I have been using Tresor for more years than I can recall.  When I used it the first time, so many people complimented me on how good I smelled.  That is still happening.  I also like the fact that I cannot smell the scent on myself.  I can&#x27;t stand it when I feel a perfume overpowers me.  I purchased this from Amazon this time because they had the best price.</li>
            <li> Tre&#x27;sor By Lancome For Women Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.4 Ounces: Tre&#x27;sor by Lancome is absolutely my favorite fragrance and my husband purchased this huge 3.4 ounce bottle from Amazon.com. It smells exactly like the Tre&#x27;sor EDP by Lancome my Sister once gave to me as a gift and I know for a fact that she purchases all of her fragrances from a high end department store located in her local mall. The box it came in, the bottle, all labeling and especially the scent is exactly the same with one exception, the price tag. Why pay department store prices when one may purchase the exact same fragrance through Amazon.com for so much less? I cannot comment about the quality of fragrances from different vendors selling on Amazon. However, I cannot emphasize enough that we make certain all fragrance purchases clearly state the following: \\&quot;Ships from and Sold by Amazon.com\\&quot;. Otherwise, we do not make the purchase. We have never had a problem with Amazon.com making good on on item that we did receive either damaged or defective. As for the fragrance itself, Tre&#x27;sor is a lovely soft floral and wood fragrance which is advertised as containing notes of Apricot Blossom, Rose, Lilac, Iris, Peach, Amber, Sandalwood, Musk and Vanilla. I had been out of it for some time as we could not afford to purchase it from any of our local department stores. My husband recommended that I check Amazon.com. To both our surprise we found that Amazon.com had it in stock at an exceptional price and he purchased it as a gift for our Thirty-Eighth Wedding Anniversary! I am as thrilled with my Tre&#x27;sor as my husband is thrilled with the great deal he procured from Amazon.com. Very fast delivery even with a \\&quot;Free Shipping\\&quot; option. Arrived in brand new condition without damage or defect of any kind. Thank you Amazon.com for a great Anniversary gift at a great price!</li>
            <li> This will sound strange, but this perfume&#x27;s inside cap smells absolutely WONDERFUL.  But when sprayed (and even the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot;) its just too overwhelming.  I do not like all of the \\&quot;notes\\&quot; in this one, but the perfect perfume would smell how its cap does.  I know, weird.  Other than that, this scent too strong and too flowery for me personally.  This perfume could be smelled with a stopped up nose.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for more: the product was received faster than promised and was exactly as ordered</li>
            <li> Looked in a ton of stores over the holidays, and did not want to buy the package deals with all the extras my wife doesn&#x27;t use. Wife loves the perfume. I loved the price.</li>
            <li> Its always cheaper to buy perfume in bulk.  My mom loves this stuff, I get it every Christmas!</li>
            <li> This perfume is  one of my favorite.  I wear it quiet often. Its little bit pricey. But smells  very elegant.</li>
            <li> Love how this perfume smells on me. Also, very attractive bottle. Only change I would make is the color of the atomizer. It&#x27;s black which makes it difficult to see where the hole is so that I can spray in the right direction.</li>
            <li> This is a very popular fragrance.    I bought this for my wife for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume over 18 years. I love it. Never want to change to anything else.</li>
            <li> Amazon was terrific about letting me return the item.  The perfume was not sealed in package and it did not smell fresh.  It wasn&#x27;t so much cheaper than buying it at a retail location to make it work buying something close to \\&quot;turning.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.Amazon has the best price anywhere. Plus no tax! It doesn&#x27;t get much better.</li>
            <li> Everyone has a different nose. My nose happens to think this is the best perfume ever invented. The last time I tried to buy Tresor for my wife, I am pretty sure I got a counterfiet. It smelled like baby powder instead of the glorious swirl of delightful scents that is Tresor. I guess I got what I paid for! If the deal seems to good to be true...    This time, I got the real deal! Fragrant, long lasting, yummy! If I could find a way to sit at home all day and sniff my wifes neck while she&#x27;s wearing Tresor, I might just do it.    There&#x27;s only one down side to Tresor. It smells so nice, it&#x27;s difficult to not want to stand next to other women that are wearing it. I wonder what it would cost to buy the exclusive rights to wear Tresor for my wife? I&#x27;m sure it would be significant, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for Tresor&#x27;s opening, and I resist wrist inhaling for the first 10-20 minutes. After that, Tresor is all about the apricot &amp; amber on me. Different flowers weave in and out, and I remain delighted and enthralled by Tresor as I wear it. What more could I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresor is a cozy, comforting &amp; warm fragrance without intending to be one, I think. Tresor suggests its intent, it doesn&#x27;t shout it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from disliking Tresor, to liking it, to loving it. It may have taken me a few years, but I am so glad that I continued to give Tresor a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vintage matters. I have two different vintages of Tresor. A more modern, contemporary (and recently opened box) vintage is peach juice, easy to wear, but lighter &amp; more fleeting. A used, darker vintage is more difficult to wear at the opening but lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chemistry is not always cooperative. I find it best to do a mist walk through, preferably clothed. Tresor also blends well with Tabu (vintage). I often find myself using Tresor for day, Tabu for evening, or vice versa. :D</li>
            <li> Bottle was only 75% full.  Am a little bummed out about that.  Guess I should expect that considering it was a bargain?</li>
            <li> Never seem to have same scent as the products in dept. stores. May be they are past the expiration date.</li>
            <li> Delivery of this item was promised between Dec 23rd and Dec 29th; however, the seller (CP Cosmetics) did not have the item in stock, and did not inform me of this (via email msg) until Dec 28th. As a result, I did not receive this Christmas present until a week after New Year&#x27;s Day. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I love this scent because It reminds me of when I lived in Houston Texas.  But never the less this scent is crisp and clean smelling with greens mixed in with a hint of apricot.  Its a serious scent not funny and silly like the bubbly stuff the kids like like Paris Hilton. This is sophisicated and mature.  It does not have a wollop of a scent when applied, it always stays low keyed.  For the exec working in a people environment this is the ticket because the chance of offending anyone with over powering scents is unlikely with this stuff.  It is beautiful and classic and always will be.</li>
            <li> Lancome Tresor.  What can I say --  it smells really good.     Great price.</li>
            <li> Spray pump stopped pumping after about 3 uses love to know if anything the manufacture/or sales can do? Will determine if purchased again.</li>
            <li> This was my first and will be my last time to order fragrance online. The box/bottle was in good shape, but the fragrance had turned. It was stale and obviously very old.. Will probable sell it in a garage sale next Spring. Trust me, the scent can&#x27;t get worse..&lt;br /&gt;Burn me once, shame on you, won&#x27;t get the chance to burn me twice. Extremely disappointing, especially as I had to return to Macy&#x27;s and shell out $90.00 to replace.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered in a good condition and send it very quickly. Will recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  The first time I smelled it was from a friend who used this perfume.  I asked her what she was wearing and she told me it was Tresor.  I bought this product based on recommendation from her and other positive reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I did because it makes me feel good!!!  I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed designer fragrances for many years now. I remember years ago using Tresor. Unfortunately after purchasing this I have found that the scent doesn&#x27;t last. My other products I just use a touch of and many hours later will still comment. With this purchase I haven&#x27;t had one comment. Not too happy. Love lancome, , don&#x27;t love Tresor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous aficionado ..  :(</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have the beautiful Tresor fragrance - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s outdated or what, but I&#x27;m not pleased.</li>
            <li> This is products really great smelling awwwwwwsome ...help me pick up two new boy friends&lt;br /&gt; good price great services ..</li>
            <li> I like her. But I buy 3 Box  It is a bad odor, it is five minutes away. If you like what I do not need a $ 184 refund for the money I think, however, you turn on the catering. Strongly frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first and will be my last time to order fragrance online. The box/bottle was in good shape, but the fragrance had turned. It was stale and obviously very old.. Will probable sell it in a garage sale next Spring. Trust me, the scent can&#x27;t get worse..&lt;br /&gt;Burn me once, shame on you, won&#x27;t get the chance to burn me twice. Extremely disappointing, especially as I had to return to Macy&#x27;s and shell out $90.00 to replace.</li>
            <li> I have used Tresor for the past 3 years.  I love it and I get alot of comments  from many people.  Try it you&#x27;ll love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  KZ</li>
            <li> I discovered this fragrance a few years ago and got hooked on the scent.  I receive frequent compliments from friends and co-workers about how nice it smells.  The problem is, it is only available at pricey department stores in my area so, as usual, Amazon has come through with making my favorite things affordable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the wife expecting the same good fragance but it smells like it was watered down.I will return for it for my refund.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and undamaged!  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It was many years ago when I first came across this scent. My best friend in high school had a tiny sample bottle on her vanity and I took a spray and loved it. When I grew up and could afford my own perfume, I decided to purchase a big bottle of my own. I still love it as much as I did back then. It brings back memories of being in high school and hanging out in my friend&#x27;s room after school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a sweet smell, and it lingers throughout the day. I love to spritz it on my wrists and neck. One of my absolute favorite scents!</li>
            <li> Present for my mother. Nice price. She always orders this perfume when someone travels abroad. It is cheaper than duty free.</li>
            <li> I put four stars because this no is the last version and i want the last version, but is original and worthed. The smell is delicate perfect for a women.</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of reviews about this product offering opinions on the scent. I am a guy and know that it doesn&#x27;t matter how much I enjoy the smell of something.  It is all about keeping the boss happy because she is wearing it, not me. My wife likes the scent of this Parfum and has for several years. Don&#x27;t purchase parfum without ever testing it first. This is pricey parfum for me, but the price was better than Macy&#x27;s and she likes it very much. I would/will purchase again. The seller was prompt and the package arrived timely and in retail packaging.</li>
            <li> Thank so much happy new year 2012 will see you next year, and mi english is not very good looking</li>
            <li> This has been my all time favorite wife smell for many years. I will cry if and when they ever quit making it. There will be no reason to want to smell my wife if she isn&#x27;t wearing Tresor. Long live Tresor.</li>
            <li> All very good excellent, recommended. I a m  l o v  e d  L a n c o m e</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. I dont think this is fruity or flowery to me this is just something so light and beautiful. I abs love it. I dont give it a 5 stars since it doesnt stay on me for too long, but then again one of my friend has this perfume and it stays on her. So it may be really based on your personal body type but oh well I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great, but you must keep in mind that just a little bit goes a very long way...respect others...do not douse yourself!</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years and I get loads of compliments on it.  I have received it as gifts from people close to me who love it too.  My husband alyways says it is the nicest sent I have ever worn and he says it works with my chemestry well to be my scent.</li>
            <li> Perfume arrived very quickly.  Great Deal on a hard to find perfume!  I highly recommend this vendor. A + +</li>
            <li> One of Lancome&#x27;s classics and a favorite of the Ladies. One of those fragrances which continue to please Women all over the world since its introduction, many years ago.Beware of cheap copies sold on the internet. Amazon had the best price for the genuine product!</li>
            <li> I used this fragrance for many years.  Then it started getting very costly at the department store I would purchase it from.  When I found it on Amazon I couldn&#x27;t believe the price.  I had always loved the fragrance, &amp; had continued shopping around for it.  When I saw Amazons price - that was it for me.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I have had this perfume for 2 years.  It has a nice scent but is on the strong side.  If you purchase this, consider purchasing a smaller size.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite scent. The product size and cost was reasonable. It was received in a timely and satisfactory manner.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. My husband makes comments about how great I smell. I will not hesitate purchasing perfume again. And the price was right.</li>
            <li> Excelente compra, el producto llego en buen estado y a tiempo, de manera general podria recalcar que es una fragancia exquisita</li>
            <li> I sent this perfume to my mother for mother&#x27;s day.  she says that the perfume burns on contact and is not like the Tresor she has used for years.  DISAPPOINTED AND EMBARRASSED. I am surprised that this product is sold by Amazon whom I trust.</li>
            <li> I received this perfume as a birthday gift from my mom. The smell is so sophisticated It&#x27;s clean and fresh. I feel grown and sexy when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a classic!  It lasts all day, smells wonderful!  I consider it a \\&quot;fall\\&quot; or \\&quot;winter\\&quot; scent.  It is heavy, great for evening wear.</li>
