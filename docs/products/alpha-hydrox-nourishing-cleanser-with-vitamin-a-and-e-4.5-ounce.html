            <li>I love the Alpha Hydrox products and will continue to purchase them, however I will NEVER buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup easily.  </li>
            <li>I was able to return for a full refund</li>
            <li>Product vendor often has online specials and/or free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, thoroughly cleans my face and is squeeky clean upon rinsing.</li>
            <li>This product gets my make-up off and leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after use.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I flipped the lid, a bunch of cleanser ran right out!  </li>
            <li>In the end, I had to toss and almost full container in the trash.  </li>
            <li>What I received was NOT the normal product!!!</li>
            <li>It takes only a dime-sized amount, mixed with water to clean my face and neck, which is a great value.  </li>
            <li>I very much like Alpha Hydrox Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for several years and am familiar with how it should be -- rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year now due to an earlier onset of adult acne and I can attest that this product is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>This cleanser makes my face feel so soft and clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li>when i first got this it worked really well after that</li>
            <li>It will not dry your face and will leave it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented and seems gentle, as well.  </li>
            <li>well, though I hope they change the container to a dispenser or something because the the cleanser is really watery</li>
            <li>Despite shaking this product, it comes out very watery.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cleanser itself, but as others have commented it&#x27;s very watery.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase this from the manufacturer but decided to get 2 since I was placing an order with Amazon anyway.</li>
            <li>I also normally order directly from the manufacturer, but decided to go the \\&quot;Add</li>
            <li>and they were exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I normally have clear yet sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Due to the dispenser, when I simply flip the top up, without squeezing the tube, more comes out than necessary and is wasted.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is going straight back, and I&#x27;m sticking to the manufacturer version from now on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised no one else mentioned this, so perhaps they&#x27;ve modified their formula.  </li>
            <li>Gets your skin clean, but no fantastic results like it used to.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product left my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I bought this facial cleanser because my old fav was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>that is not what I received, I can barely get this cleanser to stay in my hands</li>
            <li>My face feels softer,and old red scars are fading.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin, but thoroughly cleans.  </li>
            <li>Very watered down scrub.</li>
            <li>I sometimes have acne, and it doesn&#x27;t really help with that, but it does make my face feel less oily throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and neither greasy nor dry.</li>

            <li> It leaves my skin soft and neither greasy nor dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the consistency but due to the flip top lid, it&#x27;s impossible to control how much is dispensed.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and this dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> At 49, I have relatively dry skin, and use anti-aging products always.  </li>
            <li> Unlike Cetaphil it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>

            <li> It seemed to be watered down.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY‼</li>
            <li> It seems like there were some issues because people who were sensitive failed to follow the test procedures</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now, and can feel and see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Face wash should be thick like a gel.</li>
            <li> but this experience has made me shy away from purchasing items like this from anyone other than the manufacturer...</li>
            <li> I used this one several times and each time, my face ended up extremely dry with horrible breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It was watered down and unable to lather!</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product</li>
            <li> VERY disappointing.  </li>

            <li> when i first got this it worked really well after that it didnt work like it did from the start.</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox Nourishing Cleanser is an excellent buy for the cost.  It does not dry my skin, but thoroughly cleans.  It takes only a dime-sized amount, mixed with water to clean my face and neck, which is a great value.  I have purchased this product now twice and just love it!</li>
            <li> I broke out from this product.</li>
            <li> I use this with Clarisonic facial brush twice daily.  The combination is very effective.  Product vendor often has online specials and/or free shipping.  [...]</li>
            <li> I am on about my fifth or sixth bottle of this and always buy it two bottles at a time.  At 49, I have relatively dry skin, and use anti-aging products always.  This product gets my make-up off and leaves my skin feeling clean.  It&#x27;s unscented and seems gentle, as well.  What more can you ask for in a cleanser?</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and this dried out my skin.  I like the foaming face wash.  It&#x27;s awesome and does not dry out my face.  Minimizes my freckles.</li>
            <li> I very much like Alpha Hydrox Cleanser.  It is so concentrated that I need to use only one drop at a time.  It goes on smoothly, thoroughly cleans my face and is squeeky clean upon rinsing. I use it morning and night.  It removes makeup easily.  I have not had any breakouts since using it.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It will not dry your face and will leave it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This cleanser makes my face feel so soft and clean after I use it.  I sometimes have acne, and it doesn&#x27;t really help with that, but it does make my face feel less oily throughout the day.  I would recommend this face wash to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite facial cleanser. It foams well and you only need a little. Unlike Cetaphil it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It leaves my skin soft and neither greasy nor dry.</li>
            <li> I normally have clear yet sensitive skin.  I bought this facial cleanser because my old fav was discontinued.  I used this one several times and each time, my face ended up extremely dry with horrible breakouts.  In the end, I had to toss and almost full container in the trash.  WASTE OF MONEY‼</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  My face feels so clean after use.  I have ordered it several times and will continue to do so.  It is my favorite cleanser and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> It seems like there were some issues because people who were sensitive failed to follow the test procedures and they changed what could be put in alpha hydroxy products.  Maybe I just think that&#x27;s what happened.  Who knows...either way, this stuff is nothing like the Alpha Hydrox cleanser I remember from my teen years.  VERY disappointing.  Gets your skin clean, but no fantastic results like it used to.</li>
            <li> Same as other reviewers here!  I also normally order directly from the manufacturer, but decided to go the \\&quot;Add On\\&quot; route since I too was already placing an order.  The product I got was extremely watery.  As soon as I flipped the lid, a bunch of cleanser ran right out!  I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for several years and am familiar with how it should be -- rich and creamy.  This stuff is going straight back, and I&#x27;m sticking to the manufacturer version from now on. The manufacturer version is five stars.</li>
            <li> I like the cleanser--because its fragrance-free. It cleanse the face(skin is combination) well, though I hope they change the container to a dispenser or something because the the cleanser is really watery that is almost one you open this thing it&#x27;ll drip instantly--guess that the only negative about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this one!  :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now due to an earlier onset of adult acne and I can attest that this product is absolutely wonderful. I have sensitive skin and this product left my skin feeling soft and supple. Such a great product that I order three at a time!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love it! Never dries my skin out. I use it every night.</li>
            <li> Despite shaking this product, it comes out very watery.  Due to the dispenser, when I simply flip the top up, without squeezing the tube, more comes out than necessary and is wasted.  I&#x27;m surprised no one else mentioned this, so perhaps they&#x27;ve modified their formula.  If so, they should modify the packaging.  I still like the product, but wish it was creamier.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, it removes all makeup in the first wash, and doesn&#x27;t leave a drying feeling. The only problem I had was with the seller, when the cleanser arrived it was too watery, and smelled rancid. I couldn&#x27;t find any expiration date on the bottle, but I knew it was way past it by the consistency and smell of the actual product. I love the Alpha Hydrox products and will continue to purchase them, however I will NEVER buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Very watered down scrub.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase this from the manufacturer but decided to get 2 since I was placing an order with Amazon anyway. What I received was NOT the normal product!!! It was watered down and unable to lather! I tried both and they were exactly the same. I was able to return for a full refund but this experience has made me shy away from purchasing items like this from anyone other than the manufacturer...</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that this face wash is supposed to be gel-like in consistency--that is not what I received, I can barely get this cleanser to stay in my hands it is so runny.</li>
            <li> Face wash should be thick like a gel. It seemed to be watered down. I was unable to use this product</li>
            <li> This cleanser works miracles for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the cleanser itself, but as others have commented it&#x27;s very watery. I don&#x27;t mind the consistency but due to the flip top lid, it&#x27;s impossible to control how much is dispensed. It should be sold in a pump container.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now, and can feel and see a difference in my skin. My face feels softer,and old red scars are fading.Good product,great price.</li>
