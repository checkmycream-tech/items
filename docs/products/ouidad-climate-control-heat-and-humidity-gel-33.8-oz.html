            <li>:) Thank you!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even own a comb.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and people on the street comment on how nice my curls are.</li>

            <li>My favorite all time product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a good curly hair gel for a long time and finally found the perfect one!</li>
            <li>I use my fingers to comb a nickel-sized amount of gel through each section until that section is smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this gel since before it was even available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Frizz Free.</li>
            <li>My hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use the gel described here with the Botanical Boost spray in the rake fashion explained on the ouidad website, and my curls look fabulous.</li>
            <li>Amazing Live in Fl and there is nothing else that keeps my hair under control</li>
            <li>Need to use a lot of the product and make individual curls so it looks good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much alcohol and its more like a liquid.</li>
            <li>my hair only looks really good the day of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a year and it far exceeds the greasy type products, Even for a couple of days after washing, all I have to do is spray some water mist on my hair and it will dry perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair never used to look this amazing when I was younger.</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite product for my curls.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Whether done as the Ouidad technique or less product and blown dry - I love, love, love the results from this product!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair frizz free with soft bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>The way I use it is, I wash my hair at night first.</li>
            <li>the next morning I add a bit more gel to freshen it up.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Super excited to buy a larger bottle that has a pump!!</li>
            <li>once a week when I shampoo, I use the Ouidad Deep Treatment once or twice every month, and this is my absolute favorite hairstyling product.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Ouidad fan -- I only visit salons that offer the Ouidad Carve &amp; Slice haircut, I use the Ouidad Superfruit Clarifying Cream shampoo</li>
            <li>Too much time to get hair looking well.</li>
            <li>This gel contains silicones, but if you are looking for a silicone-free styling product, Curly Girl has lots of recommendations, or I also really like Kinky-Curly Curling Custard.   </li>
            <li>and its thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I have used many, many products- professional salon quality to the cheapest drugstore types- and have never liked anything as much as this line.</li>
            <li>They are touchable and soft yet very defined and not frizzy!</li>
            <li>If you play with your hair a tiny bit if it DOES get crunchy, the overly shiny factor from the crunchy hair issue goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Then I &amp;#34;glaze&amp;#34; the top of my hair with a little bit of gel so the crown of my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz out.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve done each section, I use an old t-shirt or a microfiber towel to gently scrunch my curls and blot out excess water.</li>
            <li>After dried, scrunch it a few times and all crunchy feeling goes away to reveal beautiful, frizz-free curls.</li>
            <li>I live in Sath Florida</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and many are too heavy on my fine hair or too hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li>Buying the large bottle was a big savings.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair soft with lots of movement.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and it really works....</li>
            <li>I bought it directly from the salon in Manhattan.</li>
            <li>and I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>but it does last a long time because you don&#x27;t need much.</li>

            <li> If you use too much your hair can get crunchy, but for me that&#x27;s a small price to pay for non-frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have found it a long time ago</li>
            <li> I blow-dry with a T3 featherweight tourmaline ionic hairdryer using a diffuser attachment until my hair is 50% - 80% dry.</li>
            <li> Just shake your hair and let dry.</li>

            <li> I dont dry my hair or comb it ever.</li>
            <li> This finishing product is the only one I have found that does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I start out with soaking wet hair and I drape a towel around my neck.</li>
            <li> It turns my hair from frizzy to ringlets with absolutely no fuss.</li>

            <li> I have tried literally dozens of other products, yet nothing compares to Ouidad Heat &amp; Humidity gel.</li>
            <li> For such a highly rated product I can&#x27;t believe I have such bad results.</li>
            <li> I have cut down on my shampooing to combat dryness - like every other day now.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> It has very little scent, which I like.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair</li>
            <li> Black cap is broken.</li>
            <li> I have very thick type</li>
            <li> hold curl beautifully, no frizz at all even in humid weather.</li>
            <li> That said, it tends to be expensive in stores.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased from a recommendation from a friend. Need to use a lot of the product and make individual curls so it looks good. Too much time to get hair looking well.</li>
            <li> This is my #1 styling product so it makes sense for me to buy it by the liter and refill my 8-ounce bottle and my 2-ounce travel bottle. I am a huge Ouidad fan -- I only visit salons that offer the Ouidad Carve &amp; Slice haircut, I use the Ouidad Superfruit Clarifying Cream shampoo once a week when I shampoo, I use the Ouidad Deep Treatment once or twice every month, and this is my absolute favorite hairstyling product. I style my hair using the Rake &amp; Shake technique (Ouidad has videos on YouTube showing how this works), and this gel is second to none. It works in any climate and controls frizz. It has very little scent, which I like. It leaves my hair shiny and looking sleek. I get a ton of compliments on my hair. This gel contains silicones, but if you are looking for a silicone-free styling product, Curly Girl has lots of recommendations, or I also really like Kinky-Curly Curling Custard.   I have tried literally dozens of other products, yet nothing compares to Ouidad Heat &amp; Humidity gel. I have Sicilian/Anglo heritage, and my curl pattern varies. It is 2b close to the nape of my neck, and the texture gets coarser and more curly towards the crown of my head. I would say that I have a mix of textures from 2b to 3b/c curl types.  I start out with soaking wet hair and I drape a towel around my neck. I divide my hair into sections, and work my way up starting at the nape of my neck. I use my fingers to comb a nickel-sized amount of gel through each section until that section is smooth. After I&#x27;ve done each section, I use an old t-shirt or a microfiber towel to gently scrunch my curls and blot out excess water. Then I &amp;#34;glaze&amp;#34; the top of my hair with a little bit of gel so the crown of my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz out. I blow-dry with a T3 featherweight tourmaline ionic hairdryer using a diffuser attachment until my hair is 50% - 80% dry. Then I let it air-dry the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this is by far my favorite product for my curls. It hold them all day and doesn&#x27;t make my hair crispy or look like it is wet like some other products do. It is a little pricey but it does last a long time because you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Ouidad Climate Control gel is the best product on the market for curly hair. Keeps my hair frizz free with soft bouncy curls.</li>

I have been trying to find a good curly hair gel for a long time and finally found the perfect one!</li>
            <li> Ouidad has changed my life! this is a curly hair girls dream! I have used this product for several years and it really works....hold curl beautifully, no frizz at all even in humid weather.</li>
            <li> The Best Gel for curly hair. I live in Sath Florida And this gel works the best owl of the thousands of products that I have tried</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!  Works and works and works!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this product before and bought from the hair salon, after seeing the price on Amazon I switched over.  Super excited to buy a larger bottle that has a pump!!</li>
            <li> Great buy for those of us curly-haired types who use a lot of it! I saved my smaller bottle and just refill when needed.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and works great! Wish I would have found it a long time ago :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years - it&#x27;s the best on the market.  I have yet to find another product that even comes close to competing with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel since before it was even available on Amazon. I bought it directly from the salon in Manhattan. My curls get compliments EVERY DAY. My hair never used to look this amazing when I was younger. It&#x27;s bouncy. Frizz Free. Its sexy. I love it. and its thanks to this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t have much alcohol and its more like a liquid. The way I use it is, I wash my hair at night first. I detangle it in the shower with conditioner. Then when I&#x27;m out of the shower, with still damp/wet hair, I add the gel. I dont dry my hair or comb it ever. I don&#x27;t even own a comb. Then I sleep with it and the next morning I add a bit more gel to freshen it up. My hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have very thick type A 3 hair so I have to use a generous squeeze of the product. Excellent curl definition leaving curls that are not brittle. I have cut down on my shampooing to combat dryness - like every other day now. And I use tons of conditioner every day after I rinse my hair. Very happy with it</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and I had such high hopes for this product. Not sure why it doesn&#x27;t work on my hair but it leaves it frizzy and the curls separated. The vendor won&#x27;t even accept the return so I&#x27;m out a lot of money. For such a highly rated product I can&#x27;t believe I have such bad results.</li>
            <li> Amazing Live in Fl and there is nothing else that keeps my hair under control</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. My favorite all time product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Black cap is broken. Some gel leaked out/ not all - so suppose I could live with the fact that I lost a bit of gel if I had a replacement black cap. Going through the hassle of returning and reordering is a pain in this situation.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many products- professional salon quality to the cheapest drugstore types- and have never liked anything as much as this line. I use the gel described here with the Botanical Boost spray in the rake fashion explained on the ouidad website, and my curls look fabulous. They are touchable and soft yet very defined and not frizzy! Nothing is perfect, of course- my hair only looks really good the day of. The next day it&#x27;s tricky to get it to do anything without started over. But I&#x27;ve always had that problem. Pricier than the drugstore brands but for unmanageable coarse, frizzy hair it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
