            <li>Even  though it shaves quite good, the inferior head keeps me from giving it five stars.</li>

            <li>Very easy to install.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I got the replacement and I am once again good to go.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for a young man.</li>
            <li>This frame is naturally a good fit as a replacement.</li>
            <li>Very safe and secure.</li>
            <li>Hating to throw away otherwise useful objects, I decided on the screen and was delighted with the renewal.</li>
            <li>Love this product.    </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>As much as I love the Braun razors, this foil/frame is a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my favorite for my face.</li>
            <li>So if you love your cheap Braun foil shaver, then this foil &amp; Frame fits and keeps it going forever?</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the shaver that this foil and frame belongs to works very well.  </li>
            <li>Very quick delivery</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>So I bought this foil to make mine as good as new.</li>
            <li>The shaver now runs much quieter and shaves more smoothly, so I could not be more pleased, unless of course, the price was more reasonable.</li>
            <li>Fit my Braun pocket go 370.</li>
            <li>It fit the razor as indicated.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because it was so cheap, and figured to give a foil style shaver a chance.  </li>
            <li>Free shipping</li>
            <li>How to tell if this is original thing?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s is not the original Braun brand&lt;</li>
            <li>I got about 2 years of use out of the original foil, so I&#x27;ll replace it once a year from now on whether I notice that it needs it, or not.</li>
            <li>Right part for the job!</li>
            <li>I absolute love it</li>
            <li>Nice fit but fragile.</li>
            <li>It is better buy new one</li>
            <li>A brand new shaver isn&#x27;t but about nine more dollars.  </li>
            <li>Replaced broken one, works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement with full quality that was expected!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It was exactly the part</li>
            <li>exactly what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement foil &amp; frame for Braun electric shaver.</li>
            <li>(I liked this little shaver so much, I bought two.</li>
            <li>We buy practically everything from Amazon-love the fast service,quality,and prices.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>We need this in a hurry and it came to us fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very thankful item was offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Much easier to obtain from Amazon that anywhere else I tried</li>
            <li>fast delivery, also.</li>
            <li>Call me crazy, but the PocketGo has been the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying the whole shaver again.</li>
            <li>After several years, the original wore out.</li>
            <li>Previously this was unavailable; there are many internet complaints that this item was not sold by Braun, I myself inquired at a Braun outlet and was rebuffed in person before finding it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Not fault of Amazon just an older shaver.</li>
            <li>If they offered a better head - perhaps from a more expensive model that  fits and lasts - that would induce me to continue using it.</li>
            <li>Unscrupulous vendors might charge $ for parts for the newer (M-90) model and $$$ for parts for the older (P-70) model, even though they are identical.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this service.</li>
            <li>Other wise it goes into the trash once my new one breaks; they loose a customer.</li>
            <li>It was a good way to get a replacement for a broken mesh.</li>
            <li>Since my chrome housing was just fine (it&#x27;s not the part that wears out), I would have preferred that for the same price Braun package multiple replacement foils with no chrome housing.</li>
            <li>foil was okay maybe a little old, it chipped after 3 uses</li>
            <li>This is like having to buy new rims for your car every time you replace your tires.</li>
            <li>My old foil just wore through, with a 1/2&amp;#34; gap right in the middle, so there was no question about replacing it.  </li>
            <li>The Braun Pocket Go is a well designed shaver that answers the first issue with removable batteries; I use NiMH rechargeables for low operating cost.</li>
            <li>His original one lasted a long time but it finally broke.</li>
            <li>This design reduces the foil integrity as supposed to the old circular or elliptical foil pattern.</li>
            <li>To spend a major fraction of the shaver&#x27;s cost on a new screen or simply opt for a new shaver?</li>
            <li>Based on the plain packaging my replacement part came in, I have no idea if this was a genuine OEM part or one made by a third party.</li>
            <li>The new foil makes the little M90 shave like new.  </li>
            <li>Braun foil and head was exact replacement for my missing 5609 shaver.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this little foil cover isn&#x27;t more accessible and less expensive.  </li>

            <li> Apparently, at some point I had pressed too hard and bent the old screen, degrading performance long before the hole appeared.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time..</li>
            <li> I use a norelco three blade rotary style for my neck, but it takes too long to do my face.  </li>
            <li> But the foil also has a different texture than the original on my shaver that seems to make it stronger and less likely to break while still cutting as well.</li>
            <li> My previous one was starting to wear out after almost two years.</li>
            <li> Who would think a simple little foil could be so integral to the function of my Braun travel shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement part that can be hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> I never before realized that the foil would actually get dull before wearing through.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it fits and my little travel shaver works again.</li>
            <li> Does NOT fit Braun 370.</li>
            <li> I was sad when the foil on mine starting breaking after 4+ years.</li>
            <li> But, at an Amazon retail of $14 (for a shaver that costs only $18), it is also a badly overpriced item for the number of uses you receive.  </li>
            <li> too expensive for repair parts.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Came in generic packaging but item was as discribed</li>
            <li> This is a replacement part that can be hard to find in local stores. It was a good way to get a replacement for a broken mesh.</li>
            <li> Often two things do in an otherwise serviceable shaver, batteries that no longer accept charge and a hole in the screen. The Braun Pocket Go is a well designed shaver that answers the first issue with removable batteries; I use NiMH rechargeables for low operating cost. That leaves the screen.   Screen wear out caused some head scratching. To spend a major fraction of the shaver&#x27;s cost on a new screen or simply opt for a new shaver? Hating to throw away otherwise useful objects, I decided on the screen and was delighted with the renewal. Apparently, at some point I had pressed too hard and bent the old screen, degrading performance long before the hole appeared. The shaver now runs much quieter and shaves more smoothly, so I could not be more pleased, unless of course, the price was more reasonable.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and performance.</li>
            <li> Love this product.    Braun gives the best and closest shave.  no irritation.. very easy to use. It lasts a long time.. We buy practically everything from Amazon-love the fast service,quality,and prices.Very safe and secure.</li>
            <li> Item fits perfectly.  My previous one was starting to wear out after almost two years.</li>
            <li> My face likes the product. It came as a foil mounted to a chrome housing. Since my chrome housing was just fine (it&#x27;s not the part that wears out), I would have preferred that for the same price Braun package multiple replacement foils with no chrome housing. The foils very simply snap into place. This is like having to buy new rims for your car every time you replace your tires.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> foil was okay maybe a little old, it chipped after 3 uses so it gave him cuts in his face.  He has gone to a different shaver now.  Not fault of Amazon just an older shaver.</li>
            <li> It was exactly the part thank needed.  It only took a couple of days to arrive. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> exactly what the doctor ordered. Fits and works great. Got it on time as well. If I need another, I&#x27;ll know where to get one</li>
            <li> Fit my Braun pocket go 370. Excellent shave</li>
            <li> Exact replacement foil &amp; frame for Braun electric shaver. Excellent product that gives a close shave. Nice portable shaver that runs on AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Good service, good product.  What&#x27;s to say, it either works or it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> fits perfect does not come with blade</li>
            <li> Even  though it shaves quite good, the inferior head keeps me from giving it five stars. If they offered a better head - perhaps from a more expensive model that  fits and lasts - that would induce me to continue using it. Other wise it goes into the trash once my new one breaks; they loose a customer.</li>
            <li> My Braun travel razor is working perfectly again!!</li>
            <li> This item was totally incorect for my shaver.  I have a 5 series but this item is too short for the head ov my razor</li>
            <li> This shaver outperforms my 135.00 3 head razor. I bought a second one to keep in my car!</li>
            <li> Does NOT fit Braun 370.</li>
            <li> Item fits perfectly with my travel razor. Very easy to install. Great Pricing too. I highly recommend using this service.</li>
            <li> It is very good, it is new and works perfect! I can&#x27;t believe I got this for that price.&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Package received without shown printing. Only a white cardboard with a Braun sticker. How to tell if this is original thing?</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery and it was  just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Replaced broken one, works perfectly. I would have liked to have the cutting block sold with the screen.</li>
            <li> Braun foil and head was exact replacement for my missing 5609 shaver. Good price and free shipping! Thanks</li>
            <li> His original one lasted a long time but it finally broke. We need this in a hurry and it came to us fast.</li>
            <li> Right part for the job!</li>
            <li> The foil has the Braun newer honeycomb pattern. This design reduces the foil integrity as supposed to the old circular or elliptical foil pattern. Fitted Perfectly on PocketGo 370.</li>
            <li> Item just as described.  Prompt shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> This part is about $15.00 when you include shipping.  You can buy the entire razor for $15.00.</li>
            <li> This is the replacement foil for the Braun PocketGo 370; a 2XAA-powered washable electric shaver for travel (or regular use).  Previously this was unavailable; there are many internet complaints that this item was not sold by Braun, I myself inquired at a Braun outlet and was rebuffed in person before finding it here on Amazon.  Now I can use my travel shaver again, great!</li>
            <li> Who would think a simple little foil could be so integral to the function of my Braun travel shaver. After several years, the original wore out. Fortunately, I got the replacement and I am once again good to go.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s is not the original Braun brand&lt;br /&gt;cheap copy</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, and the refill is great for when the blades wear out.  I have tried many, and the Braun shaver is the best.</li>
            <li> It fit the razor as indicated.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Perfect product - delivered as promised. Very thankful item was offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Much easier to obtain from Amazon that anywhere else I tried</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exact replacement with full quality that was expected!&lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery, also.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but the PocketGo has been the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I was sad when the foil on mine starting breaking after 4+ years. I tried using a rotary razor but it couldn&#x27;t cut as close as the PocketGo. So I bought this foil to make mine as good as new. About 1 year in and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> As a replacement for my travel Braun M-90, it fits and work sperfectly well.</li>
            <li> As much as I love the Braun razors, this foil/frame is a piece of junk.  It deserves NO stars using Amazon&#x27;s rating scale...the quality is simply unacceptable.  I have had to purchase this specific Braun foil several times because they always rip and develop holes shortly after I begin using them...despite all the precautions I take.  If the foil was inexpensive, the lack of quality might be understandable.  But, at an Amazon retail of $14 (for a shaver that costs only $18), it is also a badly overpriced item for the number of uses you receive.  Shame on Braun for allowing this inferior product to compromise its well known brand name.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for a young man.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the shaver that this foil and frame belongs to works very well.  I think I only paid between 10-20 dollar for the initial shaver at Walmart.  I bought it because it was so cheap, and figured to give a foil style shaver a chance.  I absolute love it, it&#x27;s my favorite for my face. I use a norelco three blade rotary style for my neck, but it takes too long to do my face.  So if you love your cheap Braun foil shaver, then this foil &amp; Frame fits and keeps it going forever? Maybe.</li>
            <li> too expensive for repair parts. It is better buy new one</li>
            <li> It looks like an after market product.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT! EXFELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELL ENT  EX EX EX EX EX EX EX EX EXCX DD</li>
            <li> These work well.  I often freshen up on the road, and it lasts a lot longer than I had imagined without battery changes.</li>
            <li> It fits both my Braun PocketGo P-70 and my Braun MobileShave M-90. (I liked this little shaver so much, I bought two. However, Braun changed the name.) I bring this up because you may want to search for parts under both names. Unscrupulous vendors might charge $ for parts for the newer (M-90) model and $$$ for parts for the older (P-70) model, even though they are identical.&lt;br /&gt;The actual packaging I received was not identical to the retail-friendly packaging in the sales photo. Based on the plain packaging my replacement part came in, I have no idea if this was a genuine OEM part or one made by a third party. Nevertheless, it fits and my little travel shaver works again.</li>
            <li> My old foil just wore through, with a 1/2&amp;#34; gap right in the middle, so there was no question about replacing it.  The new foil makes the little M90 shave like new.  I never before realized that the foil would actually get dull before wearing through.  I got about 2 years of use out of the original foil, so I&#x27;ll replace it once a year from now on whether I notice that it needs it, or not.</li>
            <li> Nice fit but fragile.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised.  This was all that was required to get my shaver working again.  A brand new shaver isn&#x27;t but about nine more dollars.  I don&#x27;t understand why this little foil cover isn&#x27;t more accessible and less expensive.  Free shipping so it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  Cheaper than buying the whole shaver again.</li>
            <li> This frame is naturally a good fit as a replacement. But the foil also has a different texture than the original on my shaver that seems to make it stronger and less likely to break while still cutting as well.</li>
