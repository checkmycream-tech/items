    <ol>
            <li> My very favorite hair spray.  I have been using Nioxin products for several years.</li>
            <li> just as i expected. Great product.</li>
            <li> Holds hair nicely.  Doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel.  Really like the way it holds my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I like and it has been discontinued. What&#x27;s wrong with it Nioxin?</li>
            <li> This is a good hairspray. It has moderate holding power and I love the fact that you can still re-comb or touch up  your hair after spraying it without a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> Only use this product as it does not get sticky.  I definitely recommend this spray. I use this after shampooing and maybe once during the week.</li>
            <li> Love it, it is clean feeling and it holds especially during humid days and it is not sticky feeling at all.</li>
            <li> It may work, but the odor is so unpleasant (and lingers) that I had to throw away the two bottles I purchased. I have never found any other hairspray that smells this bad (and I&#x27;ve tried plenty).</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. It leaves my hair soft to the touch but hold my style all day and is shiny!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; version of a great product just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  It is supposed to be the same formula as before repackaging......no it&#x27;s not.  I&#x27;ve used the previous product for 6+ years, the new product mats hair.  Yuck!</li>
            <li> Gives my fine hair body, after I dry my hair I spray it all over and then brush it out and then use the curling iron. I gives my hair body and help hold the style.</li>
            <li> i love this product couse it help me a lot with my hair i don not loose more hair</li>
            <li> Light, nice scent and really holds hair, yet is easy to comb through if you wish.</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> This will definitely hold your style and add body where you need it. Great!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product. Works well with fine hair</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. It is light but holds perfectly. No build up and doesn&#x27;t  feel like your wearing a helmet. Definitely recommend for fine hair.</li>
            <li> the best hair volumizing product I&#x27;ve yet to use.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend both vendor and product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a single hairspray in all my twenty five years, but now I have! I have thin, fine, colored hair, and Nioxin is awesome on my hair. My hair holds curl and style all day at work!</li>
            <li> All Nioxin products are great.</li>
            <li> Ok hold, but with fine hair, isn&#x27;t as strong of a hold as other extra hold brands I have used.</li>
            <li> 90 year old aunt in a nursing home wont use anything else.... If she is happy what can I say..</li>
            <li> Excellent product....I have ordered 2 more because it is so convenient, and a non sticky spray. I also love the natural scent!</li>
            <li> This hair spray has enough hold without breaking off my hair.  Its the only kind I use.  I am glad I found it.</li>
