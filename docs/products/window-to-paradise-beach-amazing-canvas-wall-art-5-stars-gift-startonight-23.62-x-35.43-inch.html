            <li>This Pic is great n the day light and glows at night casting a moonlight glow affect</li>
            <li>What a nice effect at night..</li>
            <li>It looks perfect by my canopy bed &amp; really makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the beach.</li>
            <li>Love the picture</li>
            <li>my favorite thing about the picture..really looks like you are looking at the sea</li>
            <li>May have to invest in a winter scene as well... :)</li>
            <li>I wish it had more texture, but I still love it regardless.</li>
            <li>It would have been ok at $40.00 maybe.</li>
            <li>I could not have received better customer service from family or a friend.  </li>
            <li>Love this painting but there was some damage on the edge.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for making a room look like it has an extra window with the subsequent beautiful view of the ocean.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, such a clear and an amazing canvas!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the vibrant colors and stunning details of the picture.</li>
            <li>Simply exquisite glows in the dark</li>
            <li>The texture of the picture is like fine sandpaper which I assume causes the magnificent glow in dark effect.  </li>
            <li>I also wonder if the light source would have any effect on the illumination.  </li>
            <li>you can smell the fresh paint love it</li>
            <li>I would recommend this canvas to anyone who like a night light.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li>It is totally unique and I would say something that must be seen to be believed.</li>
            <li>I recommend those with a unique taste in decorating will find this piece irresistible.</li>
            <li>The next day the shipper contacted me via email, and assured me another painting would be sent, if I received two paintings then good for me.  </li>
            <li>I posted my new picture on Face Book and had so many people comment on it.  </li>
            <li>The cool images in Amazon showing it in daylight and in darkness really got me.  </li>
            <li>The noticeable glow effect from my LED pendants comes when your first turn out the lights, and it truly does draw your eye toward it as you are leaving the room.</li>
            <li>I love the color and especially how it glows at night.  </li>
            <li>It looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>It was delivered damaged, but I was able to fix it enough to hang in my 15 year olds room.</li>
            <li>work is authentic as you can smell the paint thinner and oils as you open the shipping package.  </li>
            <li>If you love the tropics, you will love this canvas!!&lt;br /&gt;The glow in the dark is so true, and not overwhelming, it does light up the whole room causing you&lt;br</li>
            <li>So when you combine the beauty of the art with the lights on and off, it is a really winner in my book.</li>
            <li>This picture is a real talking point with our guests.</li>
            <li>It really looks like you&#x27;re looking out of a window at a resort.</li>
            <li>Feel like your really there.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a last star just because the pairing in the picture shown is turquoise but when I got it it is more of a lavender blue tone  which is pretty as well.</li>
            <li>love how it looks in the dark,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and large enough to fill the large blank wall I had in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I tend to gravitate toward the unusual and unexpected which this product provides.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the amount of money it&#x27;s being sold for.  </li>
            <li>The glow-in-the-dark is pretty subtle, but still looks pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I tried shining a very high intensity work light on it for a long time, the best I could get was half of the boat would slightly glow along with a very small portion of the boardwalk, that&#x27;s it, and it only lasted about five minutes, woopdy doooooooo.  </li>
            <li>The painting was lost during shipment; as it is shipped from Brasov Romania,  at first I thought,  &amp;#34;great, I have been ripped off&amp;#34;, a week after the expected delivery date I simply replied to Amazon that I was still waiting,  </li>
            <li>giving it 3 stars just because it has just a little to much purple, if the window was white that would be great.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a neat picture, not a painting, it fits the room I wanted it for, I just won&#x27;t be telling anyone that it&#x27;s supposed to glow in the dark.</li>

            <li> I tend to gravitate toward the unusual and unexpected which this product provides. The bathroom dressing room where I have this hung has no window at all. However, this &amp;#34;view&amp;#34; gives me the feeling that I am looking out over a serene pier and can almost hear the water lapping up against the pier. It does not provide the long period of subtle illumination that the photos show, but I don&#x27;t sit in the dressing room in the dark. I also wonder if the light source would have any effect on the illumination.  I will have to experiment to the see the effect the incandescent vs the LED vs the CFL have. The noticeable glow effect from my LED pendants comes when your first turn out the lights, and it truly does draw your eye toward it as you are leaving the room. So when you combine the beauty of the art with the lights on and off, it is a really winner in my book.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It&#x27;s light weight and large enough to fill the large blank wall I had in the bathroom.  I posted my new picture on Face Book and had so many people comment on it.  I love the color and especially how it glows at night.  This picture gives me serenity every time I look at it.</li>
            <li> I was really afraid it would show up damaged but it is in perfect condition. Only the box it showed up in was damaged. I can&#x27;t wait to show it off!</li>
            <li> Love the picture it is just what we needed</li>
            <li> This Pic is great n the day light and glows at night casting a moonlight glow affect I recommend this to all</li>
            <li> Simply exquisite glows in the dark you can smell the fresh paint love it</li>
            <li> I loved this painting  I didn&#x27;t give it a last star just because the pairing in the picture shown is turquoise but when I got it it is more of a lavender blue tone  which is pretty as well.</li>
            <li> giving it 3 stars just because it has just a little to much purple, if the window was white that would be great.&lt;br /&gt;really love how it looks in the dark, my favorite thing about the picture..really looks like you are looking at the sea&lt;br /&gt;in the moonlight.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!  What a nice effect at night.. I also am using a (3) portable track lights above them and covered the lights with valance ... Make the picture come to life as well... May have to invest in a winter scene as well... :)</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as pictured. The glow-in-the-dark is pretty subtle, but still looks pretty cool. I wish it had more texture, but I still love it regardless. It looks perfect by my canopy bed &amp; really makes me feel like I&#x27;m at the beach. I&#x27;m probably going to buy a frame to put it in though. Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the vibrant colors and stunning details of the picture. I have a Florida home and it&#x27;s perfect for making a room look like it has an extra window with the subsequent beautiful view of the ocean.  The texture of the picture is like fine sandpaper which I assume causes the magnificent glow in dark effect.  This picture is a real talking point with our guests. It is totally unique and I would say something that must be seen to be believed. I recommend those with a unique taste in decorating will find this piece irresistible.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this canvas to anyone who like a night light.  It looks beautiful at night, as well as during the day. I am very happy with this masterpiece.</li>
            <li> It was delivered damaged, but I was able to fix it enough to hang in my 15 year olds room. It would have been ok at $40.00 maybe.</li>
            <li> Awesome, such a clear and an amazing canvas!  If you love the tropics, you will love this canvas!!&lt;br /&gt;The glow in the dark is so true, and not overwhelming, it does light up the whole room causing you&lt;br /&gt;to stay awake.  I just have not figured out how to use the hardware mounting kit to hang it on the wall,&lt;br /&gt;but don&#x27;t let that stop you with the purchase.  I love it!!  Well worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> The painting was lost during shipment; as it is shipped from Brasov Romania,  at first I thought,  &amp;#34;great, I have been ripped off&amp;#34;, a week after the expected delivery date I simply replied to Amazon that I was still waiting,  The next day the shipper contacted me via email, and assured me another painting would be sent, if I received two paintings then good for me.  I only received one painting and my wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She works in an office with no windows,  her eyes often are strained through out the day looking at computer screens and paperwork.  This glow Canvas allows her to turn the lights off and take a mental 10 min break during the day where she can rest her eyes and focus on a place she would like to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work is authentic as you can smell the paint thinner and oils as you open the shipping package.  With a potential disastrous order during the Christmas season, ordering from a former Soviet Bloc country, who&#x27;s region is hosting the worlds winter olympics and dealing with a possible civil war.  I could not have received better customer service from family or a friend.  These folks are committed to their business and jump through hoops for the customer.  I will be another ordering a piece for my office soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful painting at night. It really looks like you&#x27;re looking out of a window at a resort. Three stars because the colors seem to be a little off in the daylight. Too much blue on the french windows. It&#x27;s a good conversation piece.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Picture.  Feel like your really there.  I get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> Love this painting but there was some damage on the edge.</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s a neat picture, that&#x27;s it.  I personally don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the amount of money it&#x27;s being sold for.  It&#x27;s supposed to be luminous.  The cool images in Amazon showing it in daylight and in darkness really got me.  Yeah, it got me.  I tried shining a very high intensity work light on it for a long time, the best I could get was half of the boat would slightly glow along with a very small portion of the boardwalk, that&#x27;s it, and it only lasted about five minutes, woopdy doooooooo.  It&#x27;s a neat picture, not a painting, it fits the room I wanted it for, I just won&#x27;t be telling anyone that it&#x27;s supposed to glow in the dark.</li>
