            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with the epilator.</li>
            <li>It’s great for trimming around the bikini area.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy I have this product to take with me instead of taking the shaving cream and razor.  </li>
            <li>Still, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>it always gets all my makeup off and leaves my face feeling great when I&#x27;m done using it to me its like a mini clarisonic at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I was brave and tried it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I purchased this epilator.</li>
            <li>Power through it, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>Great Epilator.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator!!</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>Very nice kit</li>
            <li>I received the my very own epilator from Braun to try out.  </li>
            <li>Very nice grip, look and delivered as advertised.</li>
            <li>The results were so amazing!</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>This was amazing!</li>
            <li>One of the greatest features, along with the fact that it has sparkles in the design :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay a dime for this great experience and amazing product because I #gotitfree.</li>
            <li>Another thing I loved about the Silk-épil</li>
            <li>The trimmer/razor also works wonderfully removing hair and leaving a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>Had one for years which I loved.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about this product is that hair remains gone for up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I liked this product because the results were great.</li>
            <li>, It is really a good product, save me time and money.</li>
            <li>if you can tolerate pain, good for you.</li>
            <li>works good</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to rip hair out of your body, probably best to get a device in a trusted brand that&#x27;s commited to making the product as comfortable aspossible. </li>
            <li>Over all the Braun Silk-épil 9 is an excellent product and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed and would pay full price for these products in a heartbeat</li>
            <li>It also has a very bright LED light that helps you see around your ankle bone and knee caps.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this epilator.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be aimed at the area you are working on, but it still shines everywhere and is a bit bright, so you still kind of have to look at it.</li>
            <li>right?And to top it off, I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li>Best tip is to do it before going to sleep after warm shower, as shower will make epilation easier and your skin will calm overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Painful at the beginning, have been using the item for about a month</li>
            <li>My face is too sensitive for this product, but it works great on my legs and is awesome on underarms.</li>
            <li>After I got over the fear, I am a huge fan of it!!  </li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product!</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product!</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love your products!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it !</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I will be telling clients about this nifty gadget for sure!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it!  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this Epilator!</li>
            <li>I am able to go days without shaving!</li>
            <li>However my favorite part is the very bright light that shines on all the hair you&#x27;re about to get rid of.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing..</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will feel amazing till all said and done.</li>
            <li>Braun Silk Epil 9 is amazing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel any pain epilating my arms and my bikini line, which makes the product simply amazing.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>Honestly I will advise anyone who is thinking of going with this method of hair removal to do some research.</li>
            <li>I tried both ways, and both were equally effective.</li>
            <li>Had I known the effectiveness, I would have ordered it on my own.</li>
            <li>It can be fully cleaned under water too, which is handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already told a bunch of friends &amp; family about how awesome this product is &amp; how much of a fan I&#x27;ve become of it since I received it to try out about a month ago.</li>
            <li>Honestly I will advise anyone who is thinking of going with this method of hair removal to do some research.</li>
            <li>Another pro is that you can do it in the privacy of your own home, when ever you feel like it.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>And each and every time while getting my underarms done honestly speaking I get tears in my eyes.</li>
            <li>and he really liked it alot</li>
            <li>Scrub doesn&#x27;t have to be pricey, there are really nice items for under $10.00 in target, but I am not talking about body wash with scrub, it would not do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The exfoliating brush was nice.  </li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t have that kind of bravery.  </li>
            <li>I wouldmuch rather use my handy razor.</li>
            <li>It is very bright, points right at your leg and shows you what you are aiming for.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Braun Silk-epil 9!!</li>
            <li>Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>and this is the best new beauty tool I&#x27;ve discovered since razors!</li>
            <li>If you have a high pain tolerance, it&#x27;s a great choice for you!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use , and gives good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with this acquisition</li>
            <li>It works great and quick.</li>
            <li>I was able to test the Silk-épil 9 for free!!</li>
            <li>I love that this product has a very bright light attached to it that allows you to easily see the areas that you may have missed.  </li>
            <li>It comes with so many great attachments,that can be easily switched on and off, anyone should be able to find one they like to use.</li>
            <li>this product is cheap compared to how good it is.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it takes out the smallest hair pieces but the only problem if you want a great result</li>
            <li>I was able to test the Silk-épil 9 for free, but if I&#x27;d have know how good of a job</li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>My first impression on the Braun Silk was great because it looked like they took pride in the product.  </li>
            <li>The good thing I got used to it that I realized that is not painful anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t catch fine hairs like the Braun did!</li>
            <li>Very important tip:</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This was a free product from BRAUN!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product and will be using it more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li>The addition of the facial brush is an awesome bonus!  </li>
            <li>you gotta go over the area more than ones...</li>
            <li>I love everything about this epilator</li>
            <li>I was able to try this epilator for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Overall I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li>Looks authentic</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine something better.  </li>
            <li>This is better suited for land.&lt;br /&gt;FACIAL</li>
            <li>&amp; I absolutely love the results.  </li>
            <li>What I really liked was that after using the product, it doesn’t just leave your skin smooth</li>
            <li>Overall, best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7, but better.</li>
            <li>I was able to do both my legs and still have plenty of charge.</li>
            <li>I love the design-</li>
            <li>I love that it has a wider epilating head, that makes it faster.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with so many attachments-</li>
            <li>Did I mention I love the sparkles?</li>
            <li>It got more hairs than I saw in my mirror.  </li>
            <li>like I&#x27;ve done most often.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many epilators, waxing and laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>and it is still smooth!</li>
            <li>I love that the one attachment is on  a pivot</li>
            <li>I would imagine the more</li>
            <li>However, I am always looking for better options than shaving.</li>
            <li>I also love the light feature!</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product</li>
            <li>BUT, I absolutely am in love with the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li>I have been getting my legs and underarms waxed for many years now.</li>
            <li>am pleased with the Braun Silk Epil 9</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow directions.</li>
            <li>This product is Awesome and all the different heads that come with</li>
            <li>So if you know that you will be able to handle this</li>
            <li>, more done at once.</li>
            <li>Lotion after to soften them more</li>
            <li>Kudos to the creator for putting the light on it as well!</li>
            <li>Free of charge!</li>
            <li>love how skin feels.</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun for giving me the opportunity to try this great product.</li>
            <li>so unfortunately many of them break off rather than remove from the root.  </li>
            <li>It did do a much better job on that hair though as it is coarser than my legs.  </li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s the perfect female grooming tool.</li>
            <li>This time - PAIN FREE!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that many people consider exfoliating the rest of their bodies so I feel as if it brings this to our attention and reminds us not to neglect our  skin all over.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Great product , fast shipping</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with the results .</li>
            <li>Also, the more times you go over the area, the more that area seems to be used to it.</li>
            <li>I think that the more I used the epilator, the more I would get used to the feeling of it.</li>
            <li>I am trying this product out for free!</li>
            <li>They say it is supposed to get better with time</li>
            <li>The shaver that came with the epilitor is ok.</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy to have received all additional attached caps that my braun epil 7 not had and could not get them to buy them separately, but this package is very complete and has everything needed to make a happy woman in relation to facial and body hair.</li>
            <li>Nice product, free shipping is nice and as quoted to the last day lol.</li>
            <li>I am soooo happy I can try something new and have it be a way better experience every time I epilate now.</li>
            <li>once I tried it on my legs, I found it pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is a really good epilator, I recommend it, I really liked the light because is very</li>
            <li>Had I paid more, I would expect better performance on my fine leg hairs.</li>
            <li>I read the pamphlet, although not enthusiastically as I was excited to try out the product!</li>
            <li>I was so excited because I had been waiting for the Braun Aquila Silk-Epil 9 to arrive!  </li>
            <li>It works best dry for lighter hairs.</li>
            <li>The manual indicates it best to use dry and not on your face.  </li>
            <li>I honestly have not used the facial brush, so I can&#x27;t speak to how great it is or isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to change caps and to clean the epilator.</li>
            <li>I found out that I couldn&#x27;t jump in and use it on the mane I had been growing on my legs while waiting for it to come, I could trim the hair with the very cool trimming head that comes with it, or shave it and wait for it to regrow.</li>
            <li>While it provided a good clean &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; that has lasted longer than shaving with a razor, I am incredibly wimpy and the pain is not worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>I also need to mention that the epilator is made in Germany which is a huge plus compared to most of the products that are made in China.</li>
            <li>I believe the epilator works best wet for thicker and darker hairs.</li>
            <li>Bonus gifts are usually my bestie&#x27;s, but if you own a Clarisonic (as I do) then this freebie will make an excellent gift.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>far it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>I received this from BzzAgent for free to try and I&#x27;m in LOVE.</li>
            <li>I would still reccommend trying both and seeing what&#x27;s more comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li>Quick hair removal suitable for every day use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also handy is the bright light which makes sure you don&#x27;t miss any tiny hairs.</li>
            <li>This is my first Epilator, and it&#x27;s outstanding!</li>
            <li>But it IS true!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited for summer and to be worry free about my bikini line too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a variety of attachments that would make it more worth the money as you could use it on many parts of your body.  </li>
            <li>It is cordless with an easy grip handle which makes it easier to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>I was so confident that I will never be brave enough to torture myself and epilate my armpits on my own.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Easy to change the attachments.</li>
            <li>After I was done reading the easy manual and after charging the epilator I started looking over the attachments.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can’t say enough good things about this epilator.</li>
            <li>but well worth it by reducing how often you have to use the device and leaving your legs or where ever you did it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I epilated 4 days ago and still going strong.</li>
            <li>It has a built-in light that is very useful as you can see the area better.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are exfoliating, specially if you are prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>am very pleased with this product and absolutely recommend it to the others.</li>
            <li>I was able to charge the device in about an hour and finished both full legs before it ran out of power.</li>
            <li>Beautiful design and white pearly</li>
            <li>Beautiful design and white pearly</li>
            <li>and this is my true feeling about this lovely product.</li>
            <li>but once I got going it was fine.  </li>
            <li>and it STILL didn&#x27;t get all of the fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Things seemed to move much more quickly.</li>
            <li>I did not have to go over it more than once for my hair to be removed and being pregnant</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, I was selected as a candidate to test out the latest Braun by BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my two favorite things about the Silk-Epil 9  is that it&#x27;s rechargeable, as opposed to using batteries, or needing to be plugged in, and even using it straight out of the box, I managed to do both underarms and legs, and it&#x27;s still going strong without re-charging yet!</li>
            <li>It really does get better!</li>
            <li>The facial brush is also great and makes my face feel super smooth!</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is probably the light near the head, because without it I wouldn’t be able to see a thing!</li>
            <li>Perfect for in the shower where dark shadows can get in the way!</li>
            <li>I was so excited at the idea of never having to shave again and having super smooth, stubble-free underarms!</li>

            <li>The epilated underarm is still smooth while the shaved one needs to be shaved again.</li>

            <li>The speed with good and the bristles were not harsh.  </li>
            <li>Received the Braun Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9 for free for testing purposes (but my opinion is my own) and so far it has not disappointed!</li>
            <li>The truth is that I was happy with my other because I did not know any better.</li>

            <li>and I love the new design MORE.</li>
            <li>I haven’t tried it yet, since my face is super sensitive, but I’m thinking it may even be good for exfoliating my legs.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to start epilating again when I got this.</li>
            <li>Instead, I increase my mirror magnification with the original head (and</li>
            <li>I am so excited to use this one anywhere-</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the instructions because they are very helpful!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying if you are looking for an  epilator!</li>
            <li>The light comes in handy for this, especially if using a magnifying mirror or using in the shower, probably my favorite feature.</li>
            <li>This product is worth it for that!</li>
            <li>it is just a fun website!</li>
            <li>It was almost fun!</li>
            <li>but I would totally buy this on my own!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my Silk-epil 9 -</li>
            <li>I have to start off by saying I have never been so excited to receive a package in the mail, every day I would come home and ask my boyfriend &amp;#34;Did</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to charge, powerful, easy to handle and it whisks the hair away quickly.</li>
            <li>but you also get the facial brush which is my new favorite product to use in the morning!!!</li>
            <li>Love the trimmer and shaving setting for those areas that are more sensitive.</li>
            <li>I was able to test this product thanks to BzzAgent.com and a free sample from Braun.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s one for wide epilation (legs/arms), a very slim epilator cap that is best for underarms/bikini line/upper lip, epilator cap with massager, and shaver cap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does hurt a bit, the backs of my legs were much more sensitive than the top shin.</li>
            <li>With the Braun Silk-epil 9, I only had to go over my legs once, and it has been seven days and still no stubble, and they are still nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>After I was done, I continued to clean the epilator.  </li>
            <li>It do the job amazing and leave my skin very soft .</li>
            <li>I was one of the lucky people who was able to test this product thanks to bzzagent!</li>
            <li>I was able to take it right out of the package when I received it and turn it right on and start using it.</li>
            <li>love how large it is</li>
            <li>So, I was super excited to get to try the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9.</li>
            <li>kit is so easy to use and is quick to charge up even right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try it on my more sensitive areas</li>
            <li>It was not painful at all.</li>
            <li>This one spins in a full circle, has 2 settings and does not have a timer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Painful at first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the epilator and it makes shaving so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still stubble free, which I love, especially as the weather is beginning to get warmer and my legs will be showing more</li>
            <li>I love it sooo much</li>
            <li>it was not painful..</li>
            <li>On a full charge the epilator lasted for about an hour of non-stop working.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Painful at first&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the epilator and it makes shaving so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>The brush cleans out your pores and exfoliates your skin, leaving it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The added charging stand was a cool bonus, too.</li>
            <li>The set I received also came with an exfoliating face brush, which is cool.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product thanks to Braun.</li>
            <li>Better than wax and so much quicker too.&lt;br /&gt;today</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent, I got to try this for free!</li>
            <li>I absolute love using this for miscellaneous areas</li>
            <li>: - Worth the investment for smooth silky skin.</li>
            <li>: - Worth the investment for smooth silky skin.</li>
            <li>Coming to Facial brush, I felt lot cleaner as I use make up almost every day and Loved</li>
            <li>Loved the massaging cap and the included facial brush.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice and sturdy and everything was clearly marked on the package.  </li>
            <li>This is really cool because you have the ability to change the cover on the Epilator, this will increase the space between your leg and the moving parts of the Epilator.</li>
            <li>So, for the last year or so I have been doing laser hair removal treatments on my underarms and have loved the results.</li>
            <li>Love it ,fast shipping 👍🏻</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the best way to make the annoying hairs to disappear, you can be free of hair for 8 days or more!!</li>
            <li>I really liked how easy it was to use with two different speeds.</li>
            <li>It comes with many attachments and the intsructions are clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>opened the box (which was so organized and easy to open) and turned the epilator on, it even sounded kind of scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing I found that I thought was super cool was the brush attachment to help exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>I had the privilege to try this product for free thanks to Braun,which is amazing because normally, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of going over 50 for a product like this.</li>
            <li>And the other great thing that comes with this kit, is the shaver head.</li>
            <li>I went back with the Epilator over the short hairs and it worked wonderfully and was almost painless.  </li>
            <li>I recently was able to try this product for free courtesy of Braun through BzzAgent.com!</li>
            <li>This particular epilator worked fantastic!</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and can be used for up to 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and can be used for up to 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I tried a couple of different brands before this one (Beurer, Emjoi, even the Braun Facial) and this brand and model is in my opinion the best yet.</li>
            <li>I can do my legs and underarms without running out of power, and it recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>the facial cleansing brush - such an awesome perk!</li>
            <li>There are also multiple different wonderful attachments that are included.</li>
            <li>As a general overview, I think this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I am quite the hairy person and my hair grows quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>and my favorite is the high frequency massage cap.</li>
            <li>Light feature comes very much in handy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Light feature comes very much in handy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I got to try it for free thanks to Braun!</li>
            <li>For those that may be curious, you cannot use the device while it is plugged in (to prevent electric shock, I&#x27;m sure), but this is not an issue with the fast charging and good battery life.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time 3 wks ago and my legs are still unbelievably smooth..</li>
            <li>Gets all of the hair on the first sweep, and stays smooth for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>and I had to go over the same spot a few times to get most of the hair, but the trimmer is great and gets everything in its path!!  </li>
            <li>I am overall way satisfied with this product and I am excited to tell my friends all about it!</li>
            <li>and it seemed to give me a nice deep clean.</li>
            <li>It also came with a nice motorized face brush with 2 speeds to get your face extra clean and to help exfoliate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the Braun silk epil 9 free to review.&lt;br /&gt;First off the packaging was very easy to open, that was great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>no mess to clean up thank you again Braun for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li>Previously, I was using the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7, and had great results.</li>
            <li>I thought my previous epilator was great until I used this.  </li>
            <li>It also has a cool light that helps you really see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>I use this epilator pretty much for all areas (legs, arms, underarms, bikini line) but mostly for underarms and bikini line.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and has two settings, a gentle speed and an efficient speed.  </li>
            <li>There is no question that the product does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>Great long lasting results, so much better than shaving.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in in bzz agent please go to the website and sign up yourself!</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li>Thanks alot BzzAgent for introducing me to this new amazing product.</li>
            <li>The Braun Silk-épil 9 is amazing, it has 2 speeds and a light for seeing those little fine hairs</li>
            <li>I tried this product for free thanks to the Braun company</li>
            <li>MicroGrip hair removal is much smoother and accurate.</li>
            <li>So I had the chance to review this product for free thanks to Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the opportunity to try the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9 for free, thanks to Braun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying the Braun  Silk-Epil 9 for free thanks to Braun.</li>
            <li>Thank you Braun for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I did receive this item for free thanks to Braun</li>
            <li>It is SO worth it.</li>
            <li>also the facial brush takes away the dirt from your face making it feel nice a fresh ....</li>
            <li>; for underarms and bikini, the facial cap, electric razor and trimmer cap help to provide the most comfortable and optimal hair trim/removal, no matter what specifically you want.</li>
            <li>which is rare for me.</li>
            <li>It also came with nice a facial cleanser!  </li>
            <li>At the same time, I&#x27;m glad the light is there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>And I noticed how much better in pulls the hair out compared to my old one.</li>
            <li>I looked at all the exciting caps that came with the set  and charging stand with electric cord ,the cleaning brush, it even came with a pouch, to keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and Wow I&#x27;m glad I had the pleasure of doing so,</li>
            <li>but if you have ever had any thing waxed its the same kind of pain, which is tolerable.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked the Braun Silk epil9.  </li>
            <li>My favorite feature is the light because it allows you to see any hairs you might have missed, even when your upper body is casting a shadow.  </li>
            <li>cause it&#x27;s pulling hair out from your skin but after use it will leave your skin soft and smooth up to a month!</li>
            <li>My shaved and depilated areas are very smooth and beautiful, growing slowly and soft by longer.  </li>
            <li>There was a slight pain actually more of an annoyance at first but after consistently using it for awhile, I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It is not unbearable to use, beauty is pain right?</li>
            <li>and I was literally pulling the hair right out.</li>
            <li>So I ripped it out of the box and since it was already charged I used it right away.</li>
            <li>tried it out right away</li>
            <li>then i started my right arm as i stopped to see hows it going</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>It helps guide you and let&#x27;s you see right away</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to use an epilator for a very long time and thanks to Braun, I was able to try this one for free!</li>
            <li>Even though I felt my face was reasonable clean, after using the product my face felt smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>High quality  and cheap price</li>
            <li>arm.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure with more usage it would be less painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) This kit comes with a pore deep cleansing brush- which is a super bonus-</li>
            <li>My legs aren&#x27;t used to being removed in this fashion so that did hurt a bit more, went back and forth three times like a razor and everything was removed rather quickly to my surprise.</li>
            <li>I’ve recommended epilating to a number of my friends, and I’ll certainly be recommending the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9 as well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the equipment is very complete&lt;br /&gt;in terms of shaving, leaves my skin soft and if hairs and hair takes more days in&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li>This is a great set too, because it&#x27;s got a shaver/trimmer included, along with attachments to do facial hair, and has a separate device that&#x27;s a facial brush.</li>
            <li>Having epilated in the past,  but not been too completely thrilled, I was ecstatic to be able to try the Silk-Epil 9, thanks to Braun and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I was able to go up to the second speed right away.</li>
            <li>, normally I wax my legs but with the braun it was fast easy and</li>
            <li>Okay - unlike the majority of the other reviews, I did NOT receive this item free.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin however, this tool would probably be a great addition to your routine due to its ease of use.</li>
            <li>I think dry worked better and it was quick without any need for precision.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing, I was able to clear my little hairs from my armpits.</li>
            <li>I used the massage cap first, which is the one that came on it.</li>
            <li>Tweezing my eyebrows actually hurts more than this did.</li>
            <li>I also tried the facial brush that came in the kit and was pleased.</li>
            <li>AND it was so fast!</li>
            <li>It did still hurt the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I saw that a lot of people recommend waxing first and then using an epilator to remove regrowth.</li>
            <li>I would rather shave more regularly than experience the pulling of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Even better, it comes with a drawstring bag to keep everything in so nothing gets lost- a simple but appreciated bonus!</li>
            <li>The first day I received this</li>
            <li>I first epilated my legs with the attachment that was already on.</li>
            <li>After a while when the water had softened up and opened up the pores, I epilated the first underarm.</li>
            <li>I thought the pain would be unbearable but it was more psychological.</li>
            <li>I tried the smaller epilator heads that have more access without the massage head and didn&#x27;t care for them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the facial brush.</li>
            <li>first I thought it was just like a razor</li>
            <li>Included are enough attachments to make sure you can do legs, arms, underarms, face and bikini.</li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts at first</li>
            <li>Thank you SO much Bzzagent for providing me with this prodigious product for the cost of my opinion!</li>
            <li>At first, I was nervous to use it because of the fact that I had never epilated before.  </li>
            <li>I started off using the Silk-epil 9 about 4 times the first week.  </li>
            <li>I like to soak my legs first for about 5 mins &amp; then put a shaving cream or gel on before I epilate.  </li>
            <li>It did still hurt the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I saw that a lot of people recommend waxing first and then using an epilator to remove regrowth.</li>
            <li>However, I would love for the facial cleansing brush to have been rechargeable instead of battery operated, (like the epilator).</li>
            <li>Love the bonus facial brush.</li>
            <li>For any first time epilator users, I would suggest using this in the shower the first time.</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>The charge lasts about 45 minutes so more then enough time to remove all your unwanted hair before needing to charge again.</li>
            <li>After charging for an hour I turned it on and first tried the body exfoliating brush in the shower with some body gel.</li>
            <li>So I tried it first on my arm and MAN</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used products similar to this in the past, but no where as great as he Braun brand!</li>
            <li>While buying the Braun Silk Epil 9, I was sure I will use it only for my legs.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it multiple times, but I just couldn&#x27;t.grow to love</li>
            <li>also really enjoyed the facial cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>It feels like exactly what it is, having your hairs ripped from your body.</li>
            <li>this is your first time using this</li>
            <li>I am a first timer for epilation.</li>
            <li>I would want to understand exactly how this product works before I bought it.</li>
            <li>and at first it hurt but</li>
            <li>I was SO scared first time trying it</li>
            <li>I only gave it 3 stars because I wish it worked better on my legs.</li>
            <li>the after feeling as skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the Braun Silk-Epil i thought to myself</li>
            <li>I love the different options this epilator comes with.</li>
            <li>I really love the extra exfoliating brush too!</li>
            <li>However, this was the first time I&#x27;ve used an epilator.</li>
            <li>so I made sure to wear pants that day, but the desk day the red was all gone and</li>
            <li>Since that time, my legs have been incredibly smooth and I no longer have to shave frequently.  </li>
            <li>However, the pain was too much for me!</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun epilators(2, one in India and the other i bought here in USA) for over 22 years, and this does not even come close in performance although the cost is 3 times more!</li>
            <li>This is my first bzz campaign</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I thought I was doing myself a favor putting it on the lower setting.</li>
            <li>But when I finally switched to the higher setting, I felt like it was slightly more bearable.</li>
            <li>For instance, when I finally worked up the bravery to use it, I started on the top of my legs.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that you don&#x27;t have to do it everyday.</li>
            <li>After using this epilator a few times, I have to admit that it does a relatively good job with hair removal.</li>
            <li>on my face, this would help make my skin especially smooth and less sensitive if I use it</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this product free through a promotion from Braun.</li>
            <li>The pros,you get no razor bumps, no ingrown hairs, smooth skin,comes with a small brush to clean the epilator thoroughly which is pretty easy to do.</li>
            <li>I thought the second best option would be to try an epilator for long lasting results at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>if you have a decent pain threshold, then definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>You definitely will have to set a good amount of time if you&#x27;re doing your entire body.</li>
            <li>, It charged in one hour and last for many times, I used a lot, and I still don’t have to charge again, because is really fast that I didn’t spend a lot of my time.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have received the new Braun Silk-épil 9 Cordless Wet &amp; Dry Epilator, to test for free, thanks to Braun through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While I did receive the item for free to try it thanks to Braun, I&#x27;ve done  research on epilators and it seems like Braun would be worth it to shell out the extra couple of bucks.</li>
            <li>Not going to lie, it hurts so much if you are doing it for the first time...</li>
            <li>on to my review I was very scared at first as I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before</li>
            <li>The facial brush with 2 speeds seemed too soft to do any good, but after using it my skin was so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>but the results are so amazing its totally worth the small discomfort..</li>
            <li>I have tried both and prefer the dry one better.</li>
            <li>better on dry skins.</li>
            <li>, I would definitely recommend this product vs other Braun epilators, because of all the additional accessories, and for the facial cleansing brush, which was the best part of the whole package.rotate the circle.</li>
            <li>, I would definitely recommend this product vs other Braun epilators, because of all the additional accessories, and for the facial cleansing brush, which was the best part of the whole package.</li>
            <li>The flexible, massaging head helps guide the epilator along the skin &amp; covers a large area with each swoop.</li>
            <li>I pretty much kept running it back and forth until all the sensations of hair being zapped out were gone and everything was baby smooth.</li>
            <li>, at first It hurts really bad, I had to be very brave to tried it but worth it.</li>
            <li>Love the new larger head and attachments.</li>
            <li>The manual was easy to read, it wasn&#x27;t confusing or didn&#x27;t have too many instructions.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time using an epilator, I was excited and a little scare, I know for a fact that any depilation cause pain, I took my time to use it, and after 4 weeks, I feel comfortable given my opinion.</li>
            <li>I didn’t see a big difference I prefer dry just because is more comfortable to do in my room than in the shower</li>
            <li>i have a very high pain tolerance so to me</li>
            <li>I will be a loyal customer lifetime, I loved the new Braun Silk-épil 9 Cordless Wet &amp; Dry Epilator.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for free thanks to Braun!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used an epilator once before</li>
            <li>I tried this product for free thanks to Braun!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used an epilator once before</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun</li>
            <li>Anyway, the point is I was really scared to use this epilator, but</li>
            <li>and if I were to epilate (is that a real word?)</li>
            <li>Thanks to its accessories</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun</li>
            <li>I always seem to miss, and a wide head for more coverage.</li>
            <li>Also I won&#x27;t have to epilate as much as when I&#x27;m just shaving.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun and BzzAgent</li>
            <li>the epilator takes me about 30 mins to do my whole body every 2-3wks!!so</li>
            <li>much $</li>
            <li>so you dont really feel it much anymore</li>
            <li>The head is really wide which assures better coverage.</li>
            <li>hairy legs!&lt;br /&gt;It went really fast.</li>
            <li>I was really worried about the pain</li>
            <li>I get really itchy for about a 2 hour period.</li>
            <li>So gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to save me so much money since I won&#x27;t have to wax again!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really did not know which one.</li>
            <li>I really like the Braun company-</li>
            <li>if you have seen the Xelle, you will notice how much of a difference in design happened-</li>
            <li>I think it will be much easier to use while away from home.  </li>
            <li>My legs and under arms feel so much smoother than when shaved.</li>
            <li>I forgot to mention as a bonus I&#x27;m getting to try the facial scrubber which does fabulous job.</li>
            <li>It works really well and gets the job done even for someone who is getting used to epilating.</li>
            <li>Thanks to braun</li>
            <li>I absolutely believed the foil razor attachment.</li>
            <li>Have yet to use it on my bikini line, it just hurts so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun</li>
            <li>I used the shaver for the bikini area, this product do the job well done and fast .</li>
            <li>And for me it works really, really well.</li>
            <li>it works great on thin hair and not so well on course hair.</li>
            <li>got this product as a promotional offer from BzzAgent, and I am really grateful.</li>
            <li>it are very helpful</li>
            <li>Very ergonomic, and the handle has glitter in for an added touch.</li>
            <li>It pulls out hair very well</li>
            <li>and it really gets easier.</li>
            <li>Again, the pain was minimal and I was able to finish epilating my legs with no problem.  </li>
            <li>but now it doesnt run as fast as it did.</li>
            <li>it works really well .</li>
            <li>I have very fine/thin hairs on my legs,</li>
            <li>I am not kidding-my hair grows really fast.</li>
            <li>And it glides very well with the contour of my legs.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t even have much hair on my body.</li>
            <li>It goes much quicker.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun</li>
            <li>I have gotten goosebumps numerous times since I epilated and my legs are still smooth, in addition I don&#x27;t need to give my underarm</li>
            <li>I was able to completely clear those tiny hairs!</li>
            <li>and I still had a decent amount of batty life left and it has a light that shines on you while turned on to make it easier to see what your doing.</li>
            <li>and I did notice that it picks up more hair than my other epilator.</li>
            <li>The pain actually reminds me of a tattoo needle, so if you are familiar with that feeling, you&#x27;ll know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I was excited but nervous, because I have a low tolerance for pain.  </li>
            <li>The attachments come off (of course) and break down even further, so getting all of the hair out was very easy and quick.</li>
            <li>I love that this epilator has the skin contour adaptation and the pulsating active vibrations.</li>
            <li>whole product is easy to setup, ergonomic and easy to handle it, I used the epilator wet and dry</li>
            <li>So I read the pamphlet front to back and got started right away!</li>
            <li>Now, if you are not used to waxing or tweezing, I would not try the sensitive areas first.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was apprehensive as I remember the old epilators from the 90’s</li>
            <li>When the hair grows back is slower and finer and is not painful anymore.</li>
            <li>but I just grit my teeth and bare it because I know the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>The facial cleaner machine also works really good,  I poured some of my exfoliating cleanser into my face, and massaged a little</li>
            <li>It felt more like a slight tugging if anything.</li>
            <li>have been consuming all my life Braun products and about epilators I still owns two previous models that bought more than 2 and 5 years ago and still working perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;Braun silk epil</li>
            <li>Upon opening the box, I noticed that there were more accessories included as opposed to previous Braun silk epilators which tend to include up to 3 accessories.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to spending less time keeping my legs smoother and more time in the sun.</li>
            <li>I was able to do both my arms and both my legs in less than an hour.</li>
            <li>I use it throughout the body, mainly on the face: eyebrows, cheeks, mustache.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a better way to do smaller areas though like your underarms and bikini line, definitely consider Braun epilators!</li>
            <li>It was simple to use and made my face feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Text instructions are also often helpful, but you won&#x27;t get that here - justa series of semi-unclear drawings - this causes confusion mainly with regard to the caps.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this product through BZZ AGENT</li>
            <li>I think the trick is that you need to prepare yourself in hot shower first and pull you skin to the opposite direction before epilating, as suggested by another reviewer.</li>
            <li>This product is SUPER quiet.</li>
            <li>(I only did one, more on that later)</li>
            <li>well is too long a process (waiting 1-2 weeks of being hairy to get a good wax) to me it is not worth it.</li>
            <li>As for the epilator, (which came fully charged right out of the box), I really like the design and color, as it is a royal purple and white with sparkles on the body of the epilator.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new Braun Silk-épil 9 Cordless Wet &amp; Dry Epilator is very similar to its predecessor 7 model, but enhanced with many more accessories that excites me.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to whom ever will try it.</li>
            <li>I suggest a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance to pain</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both products to every women out there.</li>
            <li>, I have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I want to add that I have exceptionally sensitive skin - typically very dry with patches of eczema and slight keratosis pilari (basically gooseflesh that never goes away) on my arms and the back of my legs, and this did not irritate my skin AT ALL, which was a very pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>but WOW!!</li>
            <li>The facial cleansing brush that it came with was amazing, before this I just used my fingers to scrub my face with my regular scrub, but this get in deeper and you can definitely feel the difference,plus as stated you can use in the shower.</li>
            <li>I used it with an exfoliating scrub as well as my normal face wash</li>
            <li>I used razors from the time I was old enough to slave my legs until about 8 years ago when my dad said my legs had so many red bumps it looked like I had a disease.</li>
            <li>The pain is definitely worth it, I didn&#x27;t have to use the epilator again on my underarms for a week, whereas with shavers you&#x27;d see hair the next day.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely manageable and worth it.</li>
            <li>I normally go to the salon for waxing, but when BzzAgent sent me this, I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>And I was skeptic if it was worth the investment only for the legs.</li>
            <li>finally grabbed it off the charging dock right before bed and said &amp;#34;ok, lady</li>
            <li>I had some initial redness right after using but then applied some Philosophy body butter</li>
            <li>Plus the facial cleansing brush is really soft and gently, works well in the shower, left my skin smooth and no redness at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light that helps you see even the tiniest of hairs which I find extremely helpful.</li>
            <li>For those new to apilating</li>
            <li>I ordered new device</li>
            <li>which is something new for me.</li>
            <li>the key to using this product is to READ THE BOOKLET FIRST,as it really helped me alot,I was going way to fast atfirst</li>
            <li>, i was in shock this even happened very unexpected.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box and five minutes later my legs were hairless, completely hairless.</li>
            <li>- I certainly found it didn&#x27;t take too long to get my legs done, and they felt wonderfully smooth for a long time afterwards, something my disposable razors never fully achieved.</li>
            <li>It is suitable for wet and dry skin.</li>
            <li>So, I recommend you use it on short hairs first if you are very sensitive to pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a charging stand for the epilator, and a storage bag which is pretty basic but does the job</li>
            <li>as I was using the Braun epilator, i did my left arm first to remove the hair</li>
            <li>and this one seems exactly the same</li>
            <li>Never have my legs been this soft!</li>
            <li>No messy wax residue and you are not sticky!</li>
            <li>When I did my underarms, I switched to the small attachment and that was more like a knives and razor blades experience.  </li>
            <li>what female wouldn&#x27;t be excited about a way to not have to shave multiple times a week?</li>
            <li>Thankfully i did not trash the old one!</li>
            <li>My first personal depilatory system.</li>
            <li>Had little irritation the first time with slight bruising, but that is due to my extremely sensitive skin, so, for example, you epilate your legs, if you aren&#x27;t sure how your skin will react, make sure to wear pants.</li>
            <li>I bought exfoliating gloves on here very cheap and just rub my legs down before/after shower daily.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for smooth legs that last a long time!</li>
            <li>I was able to use it both wet and dry.</li>
            <li>and I was able to use everywhere in less than 40 minutes and still have a charge left on it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Braun I am getting to try Braun Silk-epil 9 wet and dry cordless epilator free.</li>
            <li>When the Braun Silk-epil 9  wet and dry epilator arrived I was very excited to try it out .</li>
            <li>So I got little comfortable and thought to give my under arms a try.</li>
            <li>was excited of receiving it to try and compare it with my previous braun epilators models 5 and 7.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>Who wants to be stuck next to a wall outlet?!</li>
            <li>My ankles are sensitive and epilating always hurt but not with the Braun Silk-épil 9.</li>
            <li>The only con I can really think of is time.</li>
            <li>my 20 year old daughter tried this.</li>
            <li>Your face becomes just so soft, like those fleece blankets for babies.</li>
            <li>my legs and underarms are still smooth, give or take a few hairs here</li>
            <li>For $175, I find much to be desired in the included white vinyl &amp;#34;tote&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:  </li>
            <li>but after getting used to it, my skin is not as sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li>I have only tried the gentle speed.  </li>
            <li>My knee area was a bit sensitive</li>
            <li>My bikini area which I was myself regularly using wax strips was used to hair removal, so it didn&#x27;t hurt too much</li>
            <li>Leaves skin baby soft after using and for longer than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My opinions are completely my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its just like a whole bunch of tweezers plucking at the same time.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun Soft Perfection for over 10 years, and it&#x27;s still working, but I moved to the U.S. 2 years ago</li>
            <li>am really sensitive to pain</li>
            <li>it can make you cry if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>my whole body was covered in red bumps.</li>
            <li>and I actually didn&#x27;t feel that much pain.</li>
            <li>Charged completely within an hour</li>
            <li>hair grew back as fast as if I had shaved it....</li>
            <li>Epilating is much faster with the larger head size.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see all of the attachments.  </li>
            <li>Slowly but surely I am adjusting to this method of hair removal.</li>
            <li>I waited a few weeks until I felt like I needed to shave/epilate again, but this time I found this very useful link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really enjoyed the colors of the Epilator, I mean come on, purple</li>
            <li>Read the other reviews and was ready for pain... but as far as that goes it was &amp;#34;Meh.&amp;#34; Now I&#x27;m not the hairiest gal out there, but this device really did the trick.</li>
            <li>Overall I love the product,  especially because I am able to clear my face and arm pits of little tiny hairs in a little bit of time, with no pain at all.</li>
            <li>and I used the little brush that came with it to clean the tweezers.  </li>
            <li>for the other times, I haven’t really used them except for the brush which makes it easier to clean the epilator and the facial cap, which makes it easier to remove hair from the philtrum and upper lip areas.</li>
            <li>for the other times, I haven’t really used them except for the brush which makes it easier to clean the epilator and the facial cap, which makes it easier to remove hair from the philtrum and upper lip areas.</li>
            <li>The Braun Silk &amp;eacute;pil 9 package (product number 9-579), received free thanks to BzzAgent and Braun, comes with an wet and dry epilator with 12 additional items, which are the shaver head and high frequency massage head (already attached to the epilator), an additional shaver head with a trimmer cap, a skin contact cap, a facial cap, a charging stand, a facial cleansing brush, batteries, a charger, an epilator cover and a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>I make use of most of the accessories that came with it, excluding only the cap for the shaver that leaves a small bit of your hair attached.</li>
            <li>I had an older, smaller epilator</li>
            <li>This was a deal as it was listed as the same price as older models.</li>
            <li>It also came with high frequency massage cap, facial cap, skin contact cap, and shaver head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used epilators before and been annoyed by the results -- or lack thereof -- but this glorious gadget is my new favorite thing in the world.</li>
            <li>Compared to my past epilator (which was a cheap one that I got to see how I felt about it-</li>
            <li>I decided to epilate one underarm and shave the other to gauge how long each stayed smooth.</li>
            <li>Normally I would have shaved with a regular razor twice by now.</li>
            <li>epilator is of no use whereas when using this epilator on wet body works little better .</li>
            <li>I consider myself so lucky because I normally have to shave my legs or use the hair remover products which we all know doesn&#x27;t last but a few days</li>
            <li>I recently tried the new Braun Silk Epil courtesy of Braun in return for my review.</li>
            <li>If the epilator is too painful or uncomfortable in spots, you just easily swap out that head with the shaver/trimmer head and still get a nice smooth shave!</li>
            <li>While using dry, which is usually how I go about things, I was able to get just about all of my hair out in a few passes (far better than my experience with my other [cheaper] epilator).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have the occasional pull to down right pain if you are not used to using an epilator or have very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also comes with a very soft facial brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hurts far less now than it did the first time couple of times</li>
            <li>Disabled thirty-something (my hands and arms spontaneously malfunctioned) who also suffers from Late Stage (or Chronic) Lyme Disease which has greatly effected my skin and therefore, I epilate from forehead to toenails</li>
            <li>And definitely better than the depilatory creams as it pulls hairs from the root so less frequency and henceforth less hassle.</li>
            <li>but once I pulled my skin tight I breezed right threw.</li>
            <li>but I still had to go back with tweezers and a flashlight to get the job complete.</li>
            <li>my bikini and under arm area are just barely now showing a lil&#x27; stubble..</li>
            <li>, it leaves it feeling velvety and soft, similar to a baby’s skin.</li>
            <li>Another con is that it may pinch if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>Let alone the fact that my old one was a plug in, so I always HAD to be next to a plug.</li>
            <li>and it left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>With my old epilator I would get constant ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>The pain is similar to someone pulling on a sensitive strand of hair, then add heat.</li>
            <li>a little right before going over it with the epilator.</li>
            <li>The other favorite thing is that it can be used both wet and dry!</li>
            <li>Its saving me so much time now to do the things I truly enjoy not tweezing and shaving every other day for at least an hour..</li>
            <li>and I will use this as Long as I live</li>
            <li>Like you get a sharp pain while epilating your leg and your whole body reacts you feel it in your hand too.</li>
            <li>one thing I would warn about if you have sensitive skin, is that after I epilate (especially my lower legs, but also my upper legs)</li>
            <li>I am NEVER EVER going back to regular old razor shaving my legs ever.</li>
            <li>Based on my nays, I would personally love to see a few packaging tweaks or a reduction in price for surrendering a few of the  misfit items however,</li>
            <li>First tried arms, and was feeling a little pain, so moved to legs.</li>
            <li>I have to say at first I was a little intimidated</li>
            <li>It hurt a little at first, but now it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was a little too eager</li>
            <li>At first glance, this product can be a little intimidating-</li>
            <li>Since it does spin in a full circle, it did move around my face sort of fast and was hard to get in between my eyebrows and transition down my nose.</li>
            <li>The epilator works for 40 mins to an hour charge, and has a head that is 40% wider than traditional models apparently</li>
            <li>I read online to use it everyday for the first time which I forgot to do</li>
            <li>the first few times you use the epilator.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stink as the previous models, but does not give the silky smooth feel like the previous models either.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little upset, thinking that this would be my only time using it.</li>
            <li>Yes, using an epilator is painful at first, however being able to use it in the shower its helps to minimize the pain.</li>
            <li>I really did like using it, I just had to get over the slight pain it caused.</li>
            <li>I mention that because a previous epilator I had used was capable of doing that.</li>
            <li>it really reminded me of the first time I&#x27;d ever tweezed my eyebrows the more you pluck the less painful</li>
            <li>The cons, it will catch you off guard,I mean it looks terrifying,it does hurt quite a bit,it may leave what look like welts on your skin that last all day, so use the day before any special occasion</li>
            <li>, this one was much less painful and seemed to be more effective in less time.</li>
            <li>of what normally takes with other depilatories</li>
            <li>I have used an epilator previously maybe 10 years ago but it left much to be desired</li>
            <li>: easy, no more expensive razors,  hair free for long periods, over time hair becomes thinner</li>
            <li>Apart from my first 2 tries of using this product, the pain was very minimal.</li>
            <li>Over time, epilated hair comes back finer and stays away longer; your skin adapts, the whole process becomes less painful -- delivering more of a tingling or prickling sensation than real pain.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with the epilator.</li>
            <li> It’s great for trimming around the bikini area.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy I have this product to take with me instead of taking the shaving cream and razor.  </li>
            <li> Still, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> it always gets all my makeup off and leaves my face feeling great when I&#x27;m done using it to me its like a mini clarisonic at a fraction of the cost.</li>

            <li> Power through it, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>

            <li> Great Epilator.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Very nice kit</li>
            <li> I received the my very own epilator from Braun to try out.  </li>
            <li> Very nice grip, look and delivered as advertised.</li>
            <li> The results were so amazing!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> This was amazing!</li>
            <li> One of the greatest features, along with the fact that it has sparkles in the design :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay a dime for this great experience and amazing product because I #gotitfree.</li>
            <li> Another thing I loved about the Silk-épil</li>
            <li> The trimmer/razor also works wonderfully removing hair and leaving a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> Had one for years which I loved.  </li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is that hair remains gone for up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because the results were great.</li>
            <li> , It is really a good product, save me time and money.</li>
            <li> if you can tolerate pain, good for you.</li>
            <li> works good</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to rip hair out of your body, probably best to get a device in a trusted brand that&#x27;s commited to making the product as comfortable aspossible. </li>
            <li> Over all the Braun Silk-épil 9 is an excellent product and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed and would pay full price for these products in a heartbeat</li>
            <li> It also has a very bright LED light that helps you see around your ankle bone and knee caps.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this epilator.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be aimed at the area you are working on, but it still shines everywhere and is a bit bright, so you still kind of have to look at it.</li>
            <li> right?And to top it off, I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> Best tip is to do it before going to sleep after warm shower, as shower will make epilation easier and your skin will calm overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Painful at the beginning, have been using the item for about a month</li>
            <li> My face is too sensitive for this product, but it works great on my legs and is awesome on underarms.</li>
            <li> After I got over the fear, I am a huge fan of it!!  </li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product!</li>

            <li> and I absolutely love it !</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I will be telling clients about this nifty gadget for sure!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it!  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this Epilator!</li>
            <li> I am able to go days without shaving!</li>
            <li> However my favorite part is the very bright light that shines on all the hair you&#x27;re about to get rid of.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing..</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This was amazing.  </li>
            <li> Your skin will feel amazing till all said and done.</li>
            <li> Braun Silk Epil 9 is amazing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any pain epilating my arms and my bikini line, which makes the product simply amazing.</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> Honestly I will advise anyone who is thinking of going with this method of hair removal to do some research.</li>
            <li> I tried both ways, and both were equally effective.</li>
            <li> Had I known the effectiveness, I would have ordered it on my own.</li>
            <li> It can be fully cleaned under water too, which is handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already told a bunch of friends &amp; family about how awesome this product is &amp; how much of a fan I&#x27;ve become of it since I received it to try out about a month ago.</li>
            <li> Honestly I will advise anyone who is thinking of going with this method of hair removal to do some research.</li>
            <li> Another pro is that you can do it in the privacy of your own home, when ever you feel like it.</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> And each and every time while getting my underarms done honestly speaking I get tears in my eyes.</li>
            <li> and he really liked it alot</li>
            <li> Scrub doesn&#x27;t have to be pricey, there are really nice items for under $10.00 in target, but I am not talking about body wash with scrub, it would not do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The exfoliating brush was nice.  </li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t have that kind of bravery.  </li>
            <li> I wouldmuch rather use my handy razor.</li>
            <li> It is very bright, points right at your leg and shows you what you are aiming for.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Braun Silk-epil 9!!</li>
            <li> Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> and this is the best new beauty tool I&#x27;ve discovered since razors!</li>
            <li> If you have a high pain tolerance, it&#x27;s a great choice for you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use , and gives good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with this acquisition</li>
            <li> It works great and quick.</li>
            <li> I was able to test the Silk-épil 9 for free!!</li>
            <li> I love that this product has a very bright light attached to it that allows you to easily see the areas that you may have missed.  </li>
            <li> It comes with so many great attachments,that can be easily switched on and off, anyone should be able to find one they like to use.</li>
            <li> this product is cheap compared to how good it is.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it takes out the smallest hair pieces but the only problem if you want a great result</li>
            <li> I was able to test the Silk-épil 9 for free, but if I&#x27;d have know how good of a job</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> My first impression on the Braun Silk was great because it looked like they took pride in the product.  </li>
            <li> The good thing I got used to it that I realized that is not painful anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t catch fine hairs like the Braun did!</li>
            <li> Very important tip:</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This was a free product from BRAUN!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and will be using it more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product.</li>

            <li> I love everything about this epilator</li>

            <li> Overall I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Looks authentic</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine something better.  </li>
            <li> This is better suited for land.&lt;br /&gt;FACIAL</li>
            <li> &amp; I absolutely love the results.  </li>
            <li> What I really liked was that after using the product, it doesn’t just leave your skin smooth</li>
            <li> Overall, best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7, but better.</li>
            <li> I was able to do both my legs and still have plenty of charge.</li>
            <li> I love the design-</li>
            <li> I love that it has a wider epilating head, that makes it faster.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with so many attachments-</li>
            <li> Did I mention I love the sparkles?</li>
            <li> It got more hairs than I saw in my mirror.  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve done most often.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many epilators, waxing and laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> and it is still smooth!</li>
            <li> I love that the one attachment is on  a pivot</li>
            <li> I would imagine the more</li>
            <li> However, I am always looking for better options than shaving.</li>
            <li> I also love the light feature!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product</li>
            <li> BUT, I absolutely am in love with the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> I have been getting my legs and underarms waxed for many years now.</li>
            <li> am pleased with the Braun Silk Epil 9</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow directions.</li>
            <li> This product is Awesome and all the different heads that come with</li>
            <li> So if you know that you will be able to handle this</li>
            <li> , more done at once.</li>
            <li> Lotion after to soften them more</li>
            <li> Kudos to the creator for putting the light on it as well!</li>
            <li> Free of charge!</li>
            <li> love how skin feels.</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun for giving me the opportunity to try this great product.</li>
            <li> so unfortunately many of them break off rather than remove from the root.  </li>
            <li> It did do a much better job on that hair though as it is coarser than my legs.  </li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s the perfect female grooming tool.</li>
            <li> This time - PAIN FREE!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that many people consider exfoliating the rest of their bodies so I feel as if it brings this to our attention and reminds us not to neglect our  skin all over.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Great product , fast shipping</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with the results .</li>
            <li> Also, the more times you go over the area, the more that area seems to be used to it.</li>
            <li> I think that the more I used the epilator, the more I would get used to the feeling of it.</li>
            <li> I am trying this product out for free!</li>
            <li> They say it is supposed to get better with time</li>
            <li> The shaver that came with the epilitor is ok.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy to have received all additional attached caps that my braun epil 7 not had and could not get them to buy them separately, but this package is very complete and has everything needed to make a happy woman in relation to facial and body hair.</li>
            <li> Nice product, free shipping is nice and as quoted to the last day lol.</li>
            <li> I am soooo happy I can try something new and have it be a way better experience every time I epilate now.</li>
            <li> once I tried it on my legs, I found it pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is a really good epilator, I recommend it, I really liked the light because is very</li>
            <li> Had I paid more, I would expect better performance on my fine leg hairs.</li>
            <li> I read the pamphlet, although not enthusiastically as I was excited to try out the product!</li>
            <li> I was so excited because I had been waiting for the Braun Aquila Silk-Epil 9 to arrive!  </li>
            <li> It works best dry for lighter hairs.</li>
            <li> The manual indicates it best to use dry and not on your face.  </li>
            <li> I honestly have not used the facial brush, so I can&#x27;t speak to how great it is or isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to change caps and to clean the epilator.</li>
            <li> I found out that I couldn&#x27;t jump in and use it on the mane I had been growing on my legs while waiting for it to come, I could trim the hair with the very cool trimming head that comes with it, or shave it and wait for it to regrow.</li>
            <li> While it provided a good clean &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; that has lasted longer than shaving with a razor, I am incredibly wimpy and the pain is not worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> I also need to mention that the epilator is made in Germany which is a huge plus compared to most of the products that are made in China.</li>
            <li> I believe the epilator works best wet for thicker and darker hairs.</li>
            <li> Bonus gifts are usually my bestie&#x27;s, but if you own a Clarisonic (as I do) then this freebie will make an excellent gift.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> far it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li> I received this from BzzAgent for free to try and I&#x27;m in LOVE.</li>
            <li> I would still reccommend trying both and seeing what&#x27;s more comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li> Quick hair removal suitable for every day use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also handy is the bright light which makes sure you don&#x27;t miss any tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> This is my first Epilator, and it&#x27;s outstanding!</li>
            <li> But it IS true!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited for summer and to be worry free about my bikini line too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a variety of attachments that would make it more worth the money as you could use it on many parts of your body.  </li>
            <li> It is cordless with an easy grip handle which makes it easier to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was so confident that I will never be brave enough to torture myself and epilate my armpits on my own.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Easy to change the attachments.</li>
            <li> After I was done reading the easy manual and after charging the epilator I started looking over the attachments.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can’t say enough good things about this epilator.</li>
            <li> but well worth it by reducing how often you have to use the device and leaving your legs or where ever you did it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I epilated 4 days ago and still going strong.</li>
            <li> It has a built-in light that is very useful as you can see the area better.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are exfoliating, specially if you are prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> am very pleased with this product and absolutely recommend it to the others.</li>
            <li> I was able to charge the device in about an hour and finished both full legs before it ran out of power.</li>
            <li> Beautiful design and white pearly</li>
            <li> Beautiful design and white pearly</li>
            <li> and this is my true feeling about this lovely product.</li>
            <li> but once I got going it was fine.  </li>
            <li> and it STILL didn&#x27;t get all of the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Things seemed to move much more quickly.</li>
            <li> I did not have to go over it more than once for my hair to be removed and being pregnant</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, I was selected as a candidate to test out the latest Braun by BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my two favorite things about the Silk-Epil 9  is that it&#x27;s rechargeable, as opposed to using batteries, or needing to be plugged in, and even using it straight out of the box, I managed to do both underarms and legs, and it&#x27;s still going strong without re-charging yet!</li>
            <li> It really does get better!</li>
            <li> The facial brush is also great and makes my face feel super smooth!</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is probably the light near the head, because without it I wouldn’t be able to see a thing!</li>
            <li> Perfect for in the shower where dark shadows can get in the way!</li>
            <li> I was so excited at the idea of never having to shave again and having super smooth, stubble-free underarms!</li>
            <li> I got this product free to try through BzzAgent.</li>

            <li> And yes i get this product for free from a brand promotion.</li>
            <li> The epilated underarm is still smooth while the shaved one needs to be shaved again.</li>

            <li> Instead, I increase my mirror magnification with the original head (and</li>
            <li> I am so excited to use this one anywhere-</li>

            <li> This product is worth it for that!</li>
            <li> it is just a fun website!</li>

            <li> /&gt;It does hurt a bit, the backs of my legs were much more sensitive than the top shin.</li>
            <li> With the Braun Silk-epil 9, I only had to go over my legs once, and it has been seven days and still no stubble, and they are still nice and smooth!</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try it on my more sensitive areas</li>
            <li> It was not painful at all.</li>
            <li> This one spins in a full circle, has 2 settings and does not have a timer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Painful at first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the epilator and it makes shaving so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still stubble free, which I love, especially as the weather is beginning to get warmer and my legs will be showing more</li>
            <li> I love it sooo much</li>
            <li> it was not painful..</li>
            <li> On a full charge the epilator lasted for about an hour of non-stop working.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> : - Worth the investment for smooth silky skin.</li>
            <li> Coming to Facial brush, I felt lot cleaner as I use make up almost every day and Loved</li>
            <li> Loved the massaging cap and the included facial brush.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice and sturdy and everything was clearly marked on the package.  </li>
            <li> This is really cool because you have the ability to change the cover on the Epilator, this will increase the space between your leg and the moving parts of the Epilator.</li>
            <li> So, for the last year or so I have been doing laser hair removal treatments on my underarms and have loved the results.</li>
            <li> Love it ,fast shipping 👍🏻</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the best way to make the annoying hairs to disappear, you can be free of hair for 8 days or more!!</li>
            <li> I really liked how easy it was to use with two different speeds.</li>
            <li> It comes with many attachments and the intsructions are clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> opened the box (which was so organized and easy to open) and turned the epilator on, it even sounded kind of scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing I found that I thought was super cool was the brush attachment to help exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> I had the privilege to try this product for free thanks to Braun,which is amazing because normally, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of going over 50 for a product like this.</li>
            <li> And the other great thing that comes with this kit, is the shaver head.</li>
            <li> I went back with the Epilator over the short hairs and it worked wonderfully and was almost painless.  </li>
            <li> I recently was able to try this product for free courtesy of Braun through BzzAgent.com!</li>
            <li> This particular epilator worked fantastic!</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and can be used for up to 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and can be used for up to 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of different brands before this one (Beurer, Emjoi, even the Braun Facial) and this brand and model is in my opinion the best yet.</li>
            <li> I can do my legs and underarms without running out of power, and it recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> the facial cleansing brush - such an awesome perk!</li>
            <li> There are also multiple different wonderful attachments that are included.</li>
            <li> As a general overview, I think this is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I am quite the hairy person and my hair grows quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> and my favorite is the high frequency massage cap.</li>
            <li> Light feature comes very much in handy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Light feature comes very much in handy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I got to try it for free thanks to Braun!</li>
            <li> For those that may be curious, you cannot use the device while it is plugged in (to prevent electric shock, I&#x27;m sure), but this is not an issue with the fast charging and good battery life.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time 3 wks ago and my legs are still unbelievably smooth..</li>
            <li> Gets all of the hair on the first sweep, and stays smooth for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> and I had to go over the same spot a few times to get most of the hair, but the trimmer is great and gets everything in its path!!  </li>
            <li> I am overall way satisfied with this product and I am excited to tell my friends all about it!</li>
            <li> and it seemed to give me a nice deep clean.</li>
            <li> It also came with a nice motorized face brush with 2 speeds to get your face extra clean and to help exfoliate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the Braun silk epil 9 free to review.&lt;br /&gt;First off the packaging was very easy to open, that was great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> no mess to clean up thank you again Braun for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li> Previously, I was using the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7, and had great results.</li>
            <li> I thought my previous epilator was great until I used this.  </li>
            <li> It also has a cool light that helps you really see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> I use this epilator pretty much for all areas (legs, arms, underarms, bikini line) but mostly for underarms and bikini line.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and has two settings, a gentle speed and an efficient speed.  </li>
            <li> There is no question that the product does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> Great long lasting results, so much better than shaving.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in in bzz agent please go to the website and sign up yourself!</li>

            <li> Thanks alot BzzAgent for introducing me to this new amazing product.</li>
            <li> The Braun Silk-épil 9 is amazing, it has 2 speeds and a light for seeing those little fine hairs</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free thanks to the Braun company</li>
            <li> MicroGrip hair removal is much smoother and accurate.</li>
            <li> So I had the chance to review this product for free thanks to Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9 for free, thanks to Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying the Braun  Silk-Epil 9 for free thanks to Braun.</li>
            <li> Thank you Braun for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I did receive this item for free thanks to Braun</li>
            <li> It is SO worth it.</li>
            <li> also the facial brush takes away the dirt from your face making it feel nice a fresh ....</li>
            <li> ; for underarms and bikini, the facial cap, electric razor and trimmer cap help to provide the most comfortable and optimal hair trim/removal, no matter what specifically you want.</li>
            <li> which is rare for me.</li>
            <li> It also came with nice a facial cleanser!  </li>
            <li> At the same time, I&#x27;m glad the light is there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> And I noticed how much better in pulls the hair out compared to my old one.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the exciting caps that came with the set  and charging stand with electric cord ,the cleaning brush, it even came with a pouch, to keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and Wow I&#x27;m glad I had the pleasure of doing so,</li>
            <li> but if you have ever had any thing waxed its the same kind of pain, which is tolerable.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked the Braun Silk epil9.  </li>
            <li> My favorite feature is the light because it allows you to see any hairs you might have missed, even when your upper body is casting a shadow.  </li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s pulling hair out from your skin but after use it will leave your skin soft and smooth up to a month!</li>
            <li> My shaved and depilated areas are very smooth and beautiful, growing slowly and soft by longer.  </li>
            <li> There was a slight pain actually more of an annoyance at first but after consistently using it for awhile, I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It is not unbearable to use, beauty is pain right?</li>
            <li> and I was literally pulling the hair right out.</li>
            <li> So I ripped it out of the box and since it was already charged I used it right away.</li>
            <li> tried it out right away</li>
            <li> then i started my right arm as i stopped to see hows it going</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> It helps guide you and let&#x27;s you see right away</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to use an epilator for a very long time and thanks to Braun, I was able to try this one for free!</li>
            <li> Even though I felt my face was reasonable clean, after using the product my face felt smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> High quality  and cheap price</li>
            <li> arm.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure with more usage it would be less painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :) This kit comes with a pore deep cleansing brush- which is a super bonus-</li>
            <li> My legs aren&#x27;t used to being removed in this fashion so that did hurt a bit more, went back and forth three times like a razor and everything was removed rather quickly to my surprise.</li>
            <li> I’ve recommended epilating to a number of my friends, and I’ll certainly be recommending the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9 as well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the equipment is very complete&lt;br /&gt;in terms of shaving, leaves my skin soft and if hairs and hair takes more days in&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li> This is a great set too, because it&#x27;s got a shaver/trimmer included, along with attachments to do facial hair, and has a separate device that&#x27;s a facial brush.</li>
            <li> Having epilated in the past,  but not been too completely thrilled, I was ecstatic to be able to try the Silk-Epil 9, thanks to Braun and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I was able to go up to the second speed right away.</li>
            <li> , normally I wax my legs but with the braun it was fast easy and</li>
            <li> Okay - unlike the majority of the other reviews, I did NOT receive this item free.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin however, this tool would probably be a great addition to your routine due to its ease of use.</li>
            <li> I think dry worked better and it was quick without any need for precision.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, I was able to clear my little hairs from my armpits.</li>
            <li> I used the massage cap first, which is the one that came on it.</li>
            <li> Tweezing my eyebrows actually hurts more than this did.</li>
            <li> I also tried the facial brush that came in the kit and was pleased.</li>
            <li> AND it was so fast!</li>
            <li> It did still hurt the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I saw that a lot of people recommend waxing first and then using an epilator to remove regrowth.</li>
            <li> I would rather shave more regularly than experience the pulling of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Even better, it comes with a drawstring bag to keep everything in so nothing gets lost- a simple but appreciated bonus!</li>
            <li> The first day I received this</li>
            <li> I first epilated my legs with the attachment that was already on.</li>
            <li> After a while when the water had softened up and opened up the pores, I epilated the first underarm.</li>
            <li> I thought the pain would be unbearable but it was more psychological.</li>
            <li> I tried the smaller epilator heads that have more access without the massage head and didn&#x27;t care for them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the facial brush.</li>
            <li> first I thought it was just like a razor</li>
            <li> Included are enough attachments to make sure you can do legs, arms, underarms, face and bikini.</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts at first</li>
            <li> Thank you SO much Bzzagent for providing me with this prodigious product for the cost of my opinion!</li>
            <li> At first, I was nervous to use it because of the fact that I had never epilated before.  </li>
            <li> I started off using the Silk-epil 9 about 4 times the first week.  </li>
            <li> I like to soak my legs first for about 5 mins &amp; then put a shaving cream or gel on before I epilate.  </li>
            <li> It did still hurt the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I saw that a lot of people recommend waxing first and then using an epilator to remove regrowth.</li>
            <li> However, I would love for the facial cleansing brush to have been rechargeable instead of battery operated, (like the epilator).</li>
            <li> Love the bonus facial brush.</li>
            <li> For any first time epilator users, I would suggest using this in the shower the first time.</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> The charge lasts about 45 minutes so more then enough time to remove all your unwanted hair before needing to charge again.</li>
            <li> After charging for an hour I turned it on and first tried the body exfoliating brush in the shower with some body gel.</li>
            <li> So I tried it first on my arm and MAN</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products similar to this in the past, but no where as great as he Braun brand!</li>
            <li> While buying the Braun Silk Epil 9, I was sure I will use it only for my legs.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it multiple times, but I just couldn&#x27;t.grow to love</li>
            <li> also really enjoyed the facial cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> It feels like exactly what it is, having your hairs ripped from your body.</li>
            <li> this is your first time using this</li>
            <li> I am a first timer for epilation.</li>
            <li> I would want to understand exactly how this product works before I bought it.</li>
            <li> and at first it hurt but</li>
            <li> I was SO scared first time trying it</li>
            <li> I only gave it 3 stars because I wish it worked better on my legs.</li>
            <li> the after feeling as skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the Braun Silk-Epil i thought to myself</li>
            <li> I love the different options this epilator comes with.</li>
            <li> I really love the extra exfoliating brush too!</li>
            <li> However, this was the first time I&#x27;ve used an epilator.</li>
            <li> so I made sure to wear pants that day, but the desk day the red was all gone and</li>
            <li> Since that time, my legs have been incredibly smooth and I no longer have to shave frequently.  </li>
            <li> However, the pain was too much for me!</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun epilators(2, one in India and the other i bought here in USA) for over 22 years, and this does not even come close in performance although the cost is 3 times more!</li>
            <li> This is my first bzz campaign</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I thought I was doing myself a favor putting it on the lower setting.</li>
            <li> But when I finally switched to the higher setting, I felt like it was slightly more bearable.</li>
            <li> For instance, when I finally worked up the bravery to use it, I started on the top of my legs.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that you don&#x27;t have to do it everyday.</li>
            <li> After using this epilator a few times, I have to admit that it does a relatively good job with hair removal.</li>
            <li> on my face, this would help make my skin especially smooth and less sensitive if I use it</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product free through a promotion from Braun.</li>
            <li> The pros,you get no razor bumps, no ingrown hairs, smooth skin,comes with a small brush to clean the epilator thoroughly which is pretty easy to do.</li>
            <li> I thought the second best option would be to try an epilator for long lasting results at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> if you have a decent pain threshold, then definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> You definitely will have to set a good amount of time if you&#x27;re doing your entire body.</li>
            <li> , It charged in one hour and last for many times, I used a lot, and I still don’t have to charge again, because is really fast that I didn’t spend a lot of my time.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have received the new Braun Silk-épil 9 Cordless Wet &amp; Dry Epilator, to test for free, thanks to Braun through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While I did receive the item for free to try it thanks to Braun, I&#x27;ve done  research on epilators and it seems like Braun would be worth it to shell out the extra couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, it hurts so much if you are doing it for the first time...</li>
            <li> on to my review I was very scared at first as I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before</li>
            <li> The facial brush with 2 speeds seemed too soft to do any good, but after using it my skin was so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> but the results are so amazing its totally worth the small discomfort..</li>
            <li> I have tried both and prefer the dry one better.</li>
            <li> better on dry skins.</li>
            <li> , I would definitely recommend this product vs other Braun epilators, because of all the additional accessories, and for the facial cleansing brush, which was the best part of the whole package.rotate the circle.</li>
            <li> , I would definitely recommend this product vs other Braun epilators, because of all the additional accessories, and for the facial cleansing brush, which was the best part of the whole package.</li>
            <li> The flexible, massaging head helps guide the epilator along the skin &amp; covers a large area with each swoop.</li>
            <li> I pretty much kept running it back and forth until all the sensations of hair being zapped out were gone and everything was baby smooth.</li>
            <li> , at first It hurts really bad, I had to be very brave to tried it but worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the new larger head and attachments.</li>
            <li> The manual was easy to read, it wasn&#x27;t confusing or didn&#x27;t have too many instructions.  </li>
            <li> It was my first time using an epilator, I was excited and a little scare, I know for a fact that any depilation cause pain, I took my time to use it, and after 4 weeks, I feel comfortable given my opinion.</li>
            <li> I didn’t see a big difference I prefer dry just because is more comfortable to do in my room than in the shower</li>
            <li> i have a very high pain tolerance so to me</li>
            <li> I will be a loyal customer lifetime, I loved the new Braun Silk-épil 9 Cordless Wet &amp; Dry Epilator.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Braun!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used an epilator once before</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Braun!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used an epilator once before</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun</li>
            <li> Anyway, the point is I was really scared to use this epilator, but</li>
            <li> and if I were to epilate (is that a real word?)</li>
            <li> Thanks to its accessories</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun</li>
            <li> I always seem to miss, and a wide head for more coverage.</li>
            <li> Also I won&#x27;t have to epilate as much as when I&#x27;m just shaving.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun and BzzAgent</li>
            <li> the epilator takes me about 30 mins to do my whole body every 2-3wks!!so</li>
            <li> much $</li>
            <li> so you dont really feel it much anymore</li>
            <li> The head is really wide which assures better coverage.</li>
            <li> hairy legs!&lt;br /&gt;It went really fast.</li>
            <li> I was really worried about the pain</li>
            <li> I get really itchy for about a 2 hour period.</li>
            <li> So gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to save me so much money since I won&#x27;t have to wax again!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really did not know which one.</li>
            <li> I really like the Braun company-</li>
            <li> if you have seen the Xelle, you will notice how much of a difference in design happened-</li>
            <li> I think it will be much easier to use while away from home.  </li>
            <li> My legs and under arms feel so much smoother than when shaved.</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention as a bonus I&#x27;m getting to try the facial scrubber which does fabulous job.</li>
            <li> It works really well and gets the job done even for someone who is getting used to epilating.</li>
            <li> Thanks to braun</li>
            <li> I absolutely believed the foil razor attachment.</li>
            <li> Have yet to use it on my bikini line, it just hurts so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun</li>
            <li> I used the shaver for the bikini area, this product do the job well done and fast .</li>
            <li> And for me it works really, really well.</li>
            <li> it works great on thin hair and not so well on course hair.</li>
            <li> got this product as a promotional offer from BzzAgent, and I am really grateful.</li>
            <li> it are very helpful</li>
            <li> Very ergonomic, and the handle has glitter in for an added touch.</li>
            <li> It pulls out hair very well</li>
            <li> and it really gets easier.</li>
            <li> Again, the pain was minimal and I was able to finish epilating my legs with no problem.  </li>
            <li> but now it doesnt run as fast as it did.</li>
            <li> it works really well .</li>
            <li> I have very fine/thin hairs on my legs,</li>
            <li> I am not kidding-my hair grows really fast.</li>
            <li> And it glides very well with the contour of my legs.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t even have much hair on my body.</li>
            <li> It goes much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun</li>
            <li> I have gotten goosebumps numerous times since I epilated and my legs are still smooth, in addition I don&#x27;t need to give my underarm</li>
            <li> I was able to completely clear those tiny hairs!</li>
            <li> and I still had a decent amount of batty life left and it has a light that shines on you while turned on to make it easier to see what your doing.</li>
            <li> and I did notice that it picks up more hair than my other epilator.</li>
            <li> The pain actually reminds me of a tattoo needle, so if you are familiar with that feeling, you&#x27;ll know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I was excited but nervous, because I have a low tolerance for pain.  </li>
            <li> The attachments come off (of course) and break down even further, so getting all of the hair out was very easy and quick.</li>
            <li> I love that this epilator has the skin contour adaptation and the pulsating active vibrations.</li>
            <li> whole product is easy to setup, ergonomic and easy to handle it, I used the epilator wet and dry</li>
            <li> So I read the pamphlet front to back and got started right away!</li>
            <li> Now, if you are not used to waxing or tweezing, I would not try the sensitive areas first.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was apprehensive as I remember the old epilators from the 90’s</li>
            <li> When the hair grows back is slower and finer and is not painful anymore.</li>
            <li> but I just grit my teeth and bare it because I know the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> The facial cleaner machine also works really good,  I poured some of my exfoliating cleanser into my face, and massaged a little</li>
            <li> It felt more like a slight tugging if anything.</li>
            <li> have been consuming all my life Braun products and about epilators I still owns two previous models that bought more than 2 and 5 years ago and still working perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;Braun silk epil</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box, I noticed that there were more accessories included as opposed to previous Braun silk epilators which tend to include up to 3 accessories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to spending less time keeping my legs smoother and more time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I was able to do both my arms and both my legs in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> I use it throughout the body, mainly on the face: eyebrows, cheeks, mustache.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a better way to do smaller areas though like your underarms and bikini line, definitely consider Braun epilators!</li>
            <li> It was simple to use and made my face feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Text instructions are also often helpful, but you won&#x27;t get that here - justa series of semi-unclear drawings - this causes confusion mainly with regard to the caps.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product through BZZ AGENT</li>
            <li> I think the trick is that you need to prepare yourself in hot shower first and pull you skin to the opposite direction before epilating, as suggested by another reviewer.</li>
            <li> This product is SUPER quiet.</li>
            <li> (I only did one, more on that later)</li>
            <li> well is too long a process (waiting 1-2 weeks of being hairy to get a good wax) to me it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> As for the epilator, (which came fully charged right out of the box), I really like the design and color, as it is a royal purple and white with sparkles on the body of the epilator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new Braun Silk-épil 9 Cordless Wet &amp; Dry Epilator is very similar to its predecessor 7 model, but enhanced with many more accessories that excites me.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to whom ever will try it.</li>
            <li> I suggest a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance to pain</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both products to every women out there.</li>
            <li> , I have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I want to add that I have exceptionally sensitive skin - typically very dry with patches of eczema and slight keratosis pilari (basically gooseflesh that never goes away) on my arms and the back of my legs, and this did not irritate my skin AT ALL, which was a very pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> but WOW!!</li>
            <li> The facial cleansing brush that it came with was amazing, before this I just used my fingers to scrub my face with my regular scrub, but this get in deeper and you can definitely feel the difference,plus as stated you can use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I used it with an exfoliating scrub as well as my normal face wash</li>
            <li> I used razors from the time I was old enough to slave my legs until about 8 years ago when my dad said my legs had so many red bumps it looked like I had a disease.</li>
            <li> The pain is definitely worth it, I didn&#x27;t have to use the epilator again on my underarms for a week, whereas with shavers you&#x27;d see hair the next day.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely manageable and worth it.</li>
            <li> I normally go to the salon for waxing, but when BzzAgent sent me this, I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> And I was skeptic if it was worth the investment only for the legs.</li>
            <li> finally grabbed it off the charging dock right before bed and said &amp;#34;ok, lady</li>
            <li> I had some initial redness right after using but then applied some Philosophy body butter</li>
            <li> Plus the facial cleansing brush is really soft and gently, works well in the shower, left my skin smooth and no redness at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a light that helps you see even the tiniest of hairs which I find extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> For those new to apilating</li>
            <li> I ordered new device</li>
            <li> which is something new for me.</li>
            <li> the key to using this product is to READ THE BOOKLET FIRST,as it really helped me alot,I was going way to fast atfirst</li>
            <li> , i was in shock this even happened very unexpected.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box and five minutes later my legs were hairless, completely hairless.</li>
            <li> - I certainly found it didn&#x27;t take too long to get my legs done, and they felt wonderfully smooth for a long time afterwards, something my disposable razors never fully achieved.</li>
            <li> It is suitable for wet and dry skin.</li>
            <li> So, I recommend you use it on short hairs first if you are very sensitive to pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a charging stand for the epilator, and a storage bag which is pretty basic but does the job</li>
            <li> as I was using the Braun epilator, i did my left arm first to remove the hair</li>
            <li> and this one seems exactly the same</li>
            <li> Never have my legs been this soft!</li>
            <li> No messy wax residue and you are not sticky!</li>
            <li> When I did my underarms, I switched to the small attachment and that was more like a knives and razor blades experience.  </li>
            <li> what female wouldn&#x27;t be excited about a way to not have to shave multiple times a week?</li>
            <li> Thankfully i did not trash the old one!</li>
            <li> My first personal depilatory system.</li>
            <li> Had little irritation the first time with slight bruising, but that is due to my extremely sensitive skin, so, for example, you epilate your legs, if you aren&#x27;t sure how your skin will react, make sure to wear pants.</li>
            <li> I bought exfoliating gloves on here very cheap and just rub my legs down before/after shower daily.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for smooth legs that last a long time!</li>
            <li> I was able to use it both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> and I was able to use everywhere in less than 40 minutes and still have a charge left on it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun I am getting to try Braun Silk-epil 9 wet and dry cordless epilator free.</li>
            <li> When the Braun Silk-epil 9  wet and dry epilator arrived I was very excited to try it out .</li>
            <li> So I got little comfortable and thought to give my under arms a try.</li>
            <li> was excited of receiving it to try and compare it with my previous braun epilators models 5 and 7.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> Who wants to be stuck next to a wall outlet?!</li>
            <li> My ankles are sensitive and epilating always hurt but not with the Braun Silk-épil 9.</li>
            <li> The only con I can really think of is time.</li>
            <li> my 20 year old daughter tried this.</li>
            <li> Your face becomes just so soft, like those fleece blankets for babies.</li>
            <li> my legs and underarms are still smooth, give or take a few hairs here</li>
            <li> For $175, I find much to be desired in the included white vinyl &amp;#34;tote&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:  </li>
            <li> but after getting used to it, my skin is not as sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the gentle speed.  </li>
            <li> My knee area was a bit sensitive</li>
            <li> My bikini area which I was myself regularly using wax strips was used to hair removal, so it didn&#x27;t hurt too much</li>
            <li> Leaves skin baby soft after using and for longer than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My opinions are completely my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its just like a whole bunch of tweezers plucking at the same time.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun Soft Perfection for over 10 years, and it&#x27;s still working, but I moved to the U.S. 2 years ago</li>
            <li> am really sensitive to pain</li>
            <li> it can make you cry if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> my whole body was covered in red bumps.</li>
            <li> and I actually didn&#x27;t feel that much pain.</li>
            <li> Charged completely within an hour</li>
            <li> hair grew back as fast as if I had shaved it....</li>
            <li> Epilating is much faster with the larger head size.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see all of the attachments.  </li>
            <li> Slowly but surely I am adjusting to this method of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks until I felt like I needed to shave/epilate again, but this time I found this very useful link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really enjoyed the colors of the Epilator, I mean come on, purple</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews and was ready for pain... but as far as that goes it was &amp;#34;Meh.&amp;#34; Now I&#x27;m not the hairiest gal out there, but this device really did the trick.</li>
            <li> Overall I love the product,  especially because I am able to clear my face and arm pits of little tiny hairs in a little bit of time, with no pain at all.</li>
            <li> and I used the little brush that came with it to clean the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> for the other times, I haven’t really used them except for the brush which makes it easier to clean the epilator and the facial cap, which makes it easier to remove hair from the philtrum and upper lip areas.</li>
            <li> for the other times, I haven’t really used them except for the brush which makes it easier to clean the epilator and the facial cap, which makes it easier to remove hair from the philtrum and upper lip areas.</li>
            <li> The Braun Silk &amp;eacute;pil 9 package (product number 9-579), received free thanks to BzzAgent and Braun, comes with an wet and dry epilator with 12 additional items, which are the shaver head and high frequency massage head (already attached to the epilator), an additional shaver head with a trimmer cap, a skin contact cap, a facial cap, a charging stand, a facial cleansing brush, batteries, a charger, an epilator cover and a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> I make use of most of the accessories that came with it, excluding only the cap for the shaver that leaves a small bit of your hair attached.</li>
            <li> I had an older, smaller epilator</li>
            <li> This was a deal as it was listed as the same price as older models.</li>
            <li> It also came with high frequency massage cap, facial cap, skin contact cap, and shaver head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators before and been annoyed by the results -- or lack thereof -- but this glorious gadget is my new favorite thing in the world.</li>
            <li> Compared to my past epilator (which was a cheap one that I got to see how I felt about it-</li>
            <li> I decided to epilate one underarm and shave the other to gauge how long each stayed smooth.</li>
            <li> Normally I would have shaved with a regular razor twice by now.</li>
            <li> epilator is of no use whereas when using this epilator on wet body works little better .</li>
            <li> I consider myself so lucky because I normally have to shave my legs or use the hair remover products which we all know doesn&#x27;t last but a few days</li>
            <li> I recently tried the new Braun Silk Epil courtesy of Braun in return for my review.</li>
            <li> If the epilator is too painful or uncomfortable in spots, you just easily swap out that head with the shaver/trimmer head and still get a nice smooth shave!</li>
            <li> While using dry, which is usually how I go about things, I was able to get just about all of my hair out in a few passes (far better than my experience with my other [cheaper] epilator).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have the occasional pull to down right pain if you are not used to using an epilator or have very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also comes with a very soft facial brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hurts far less now than it did the first time couple of times</li>
            <li> Disabled thirty-something (my hands and arms spontaneously malfunctioned) who also suffers from Late Stage (or Chronic) Lyme Disease which has greatly effected my skin and therefore, I epilate from forehead to toenails</li>
            <li> And definitely better than the depilatory creams as it pulls hairs from the root so less frequency and henceforth less hassle.</li>
            <li> but once I pulled my skin tight I breezed right threw.</li>
            <li> but I still had to go back with tweezers and a flashlight to get the job complete.</li>
            <li> my bikini and under arm area are just barely now showing a lil&#x27; stubble..</li>
            <li> , it leaves it feeling velvety and soft, similar to a baby’s skin.</li>
            <li> Another con is that it may pinch if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Let alone the fact that my old one was a plug in, so I always HAD to be next to a plug.</li>
            <li> and it left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> With my old epilator I would get constant ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> The pain is similar to someone pulling on a sensitive strand of hair, then add heat.</li>
            <li> a little right before going over it with the epilator.</li>
            <li> The other favorite thing is that it can be used both wet and dry!</li>
            <li> Its saving me so much time now to do the things I truly enjoy not tweezing and shaving every other day for at least an hour..</li>
            <li> and I will use this as Long as I live</li>
            <li> Like you get a sharp pain while epilating your leg and your whole body reacts you feel it in your hand too.</li>
            <li> one thing I would warn about if you have sensitive skin, is that after I epilate (especially my lower legs, but also my upper legs)</li>
            <li> I am NEVER EVER going back to regular old razor shaving my legs ever.</li>
            <li> Based on my nays, I would personally love to see a few packaging tweaks or a reduction in price for surrendering a few of the  misfit items however,</li>
            <li> First tried arms, and was feeling a little pain, so moved to legs.</li>
            <li> I have to say at first I was a little intimidated</li>
            <li> It hurt a little at first, but now it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was a little too eager</li>
            <li> At first glance, this product can be a little intimidating-</li>
            <li> Since it does spin in a full circle, it did move around my face sort of fast and was hard to get in between my eyebrows and transition down my nose.</li>
            <li> The epilator works for 40 mins to an hour charge, and has a head that is 40% wider than traditional models apparently</li>
            <li> I read online to use it everyday for the first time which I forgot to do</li>
            <li> the first few times you use the epilator.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stink as the previous models, but does not give the silky smooth feel like the previous models either.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little upset, thinking that this would be my only time using it.</li>
            <li> Yes, using an epilator is painful at first, however being able to use it in the shower its helps to minimize the pain.</li>
            <li> I really did like using it, I just had to get over the slight pain it caused.</li>
            <li> I mention that because a previous epilator I had used was capable of doing that.</li>
            <li> it really reminded me of the first time I&#x27;d ever tweezed my eyebrows the more you pluck the less painful</li>
            <li> The cons, it will catch you off guard,I mean it looks terrifying,it does hurt quite a bit,it may leave what look like welts on your skin that last all day, so use the day before any special occasion</li>
            <li> , this one was much less painful and seemed to be more effective in less time.</li>
            <li> of what normally takes with other depilatories</li>
            <li> I have used an epilator previously maybe 10 years ago but it left much to be desired</li>
            <li> : easy, no more expensive razors,  hair free for long periods, over time hair becomes thinner</li>
            <li> Apart from my first 2 tries of using this product, the pain was very minimal.</li>
            <li> Over time, epilated hair comes back finer and stays away longer; your skin adapts, the whole process becomes less painful -- delivering more of a tingling or prickling sensation than real pain.</li>
            <li> and I did it on my dry bare skin</li>
            <li> maybe I have a large face, but I find the facial attachment to be pointless.  </li>
            <li> Im assuming one of them is for sensitive skin, and the other is for not-so-sensistive skin.</li>
            <li> The battery life lasts long enough to use it on both legs and still have battery left over.  </li>
            <li> Using it a few days in a row got all of the little hairs and desensitized my skin even more to the little prickling sensation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned another epilator in the past and this one blew that older one out of the water!</li>
            <li> Painful at first, but well worth the results!</li>
            <li> But I have really small hairs, so, the pain was not that much.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little red and irritated afterward, but the instructions state that this is natural and is the reason epilation should be done at night time.  </li>
            <li> I tried my new epilator tonight while taking a shower, and I can firmly state</li>
            <li> You can use this in the shower or with dry skin which I think is great!There are several attachments that come with this like the exfoliating attachment.</li>
            <li> I have only used it dry and have not tried it in the water.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely use it again and I will try it wet the next time.&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree</li>
            <li> Then instead of giving up on this product I tried the other head attachment and got a closer shave to make my leg hair barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a brush to help clean the tough to get to places, just be careful when cleaning the innards of the shaver attachment</li>
            <li> This is a little different if your a person who generally uses a razor to shave.</li>
            <li> I especially like how I do not have bumps left behind in certain areas</li>
            <li> and it was kind of like a pins and needles experience - not too bad at all.  </li>
            <li> I was very nervous trying this for the first time because I was afraid that it will hurt me, and of course it did.  </li>
            <li> Being a chicken I shaved to buy myself more time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried it on my leg hair and it was about 1/8 inch long</li>
            <li> Epilating pulls the hair from the root, and the results lasts as long as a wax.</li>
            <li> I think that was because some of the hairs were too long.</li>
            <li> There are less &amp; less hairs on my legs &amp; the ones that are there are very soft - not coarse like when I used to shave EVERY.</li>
            <li> The only down side to the brush is that its not intended for facial use.</li>
            <li> The down fall is, can I bare the pain to do both of my underarms......</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet, but I would imagine it&#x27;s about the same as using it dry.</li>
            <li> The second time hurts much less and by the third</li>
            <li> I mean, let&#x27;s get real.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on I expected it to be as loud as other razors and such I have tried, but this one just makes a slight humming noise</li>
            <li> Unlike other epilators, you dont have to go over areas multiple times.</li>
            <li> It doesnt feel overly scrubbed like other brushes have left my face, and I use it on the strongest setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to save in the long run instead of buying shaving supplies!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to anything other</li>
            <li> I would chose the epilator, you pay only once and not every other week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tall and slim, as compared to the short and fat other one.</li>
            <li> &gt; - Comes with two other attachments and for precision and a body exfoliating brush which all fits in a white waterproof drawstring bag.</li>
            <li> I tried it dry on one arm</li>
            <li> I fired it up just about as soon as the package arrived and tried it out on my legs - dry.</li>
            <li> ,I did this DRY no water</li>
            <li> It came with an exfoliating brush head that you can use dry or in the shower.  </li>
            <li> However, it definitely was more painful.  </li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin, the epilator did hurt leaving my arms red for at least 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> LIMITED LUSTER:  </li>
            <li> SINGLE.</li>
            <li> If you use it with warm water your pores will open a little and it will not hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> I read the manual completely before trying and tried at night because it said that there is usually a lot of redness</li>
            <li> Then, it went down to 2-3 times the next couple weeks</li>
            <li> One of them is used to shave the hair down to the proper height for maximum for epilation.</li>
            <li> I put it on high and slowly ran the wide head up my legs and the hair disappeared.</li>
            <li> wet or dry</li>
            <li> Xelle 549 and Braun silk epil wet &amp; dry 7-5377.</li>
            <li> shaving, I typically have some stubble by the next day, but it&#x27;s been about a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited that I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive packs of razors every other month now.</li>
            <li> wet or dry</li>
            <li> When I received the Braun Silk Epil 9 (wet &amp; dry epilator)</li>
            <li> Can be used dry or wet for in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Can be used dry or wet for in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It works well with both wet and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a confession to make, after my first attempt with the Braun epilator, I harshly judged all those who complained of the pain.</li>
            <li> recharge.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used in shower also as it works for both dry and wet skin.&lt;br /&gt;Saves</li>
            <li> It can be used wet and dry.</li>
            <li> , it also started coming back in only a few days, so it was not worth the time it took to use.</li>
            <li> There was no actual pain, just a little pinpoint here and there.</li>
            <li> My legs were a little red after</li>
            <li> how could this possibly be any better then shaving, but I was shocked to not have to repeat the process for a little over two weeks.</li>
            <li> it was painful but ok.</li>
            <li> I think that area was probably the most painful for me</li>
            <li> but my underarm hair totally disappears and doesn&#x27;t come back for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I use the Clarisonic Mia 2 everyday and this is a much different brush than that one.</li>
            <li> I had never even heard of such a device until she told me about hers a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I owned the silk epil 7 last year and it stopped working after a few months</li>
            <li> It comes with quite a few different caps-</li>
            <li> WET NOODLE:  </li>
            <li> but after several attempts, I stand firm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is absolutely not the case with the Braun Silk-Épil.</li>
            <li> It can also be used wet or dry!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts longer than I expected with minimal</li>
            <li> but I went over my body again todsy and really no pain.</li>
            <li> I placed the head of the epilator onto my skin, and to my surprise, the pain was minimal.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft, but can be irritating if not used properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an epilator in the past, but this Braun was more painful and left little red bumps and splotches all over my legs immediately after each use.</li>
            <li> Since this is a wet dry epilator, it works in the shower, and that can cut down the the pain.</li>
            <li> However, I found that when I stretched my skin while using the product that the pain was significantly less.</li>
            <li> A few days later I tried  the Braun epilator wet on my other arm with less pain than the dry</li>
            <li> The only slight downside is that using it while wet does create a little bit of a drag, but the fact that using it while showering makes clean-up practically non-existent makes up for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I backed down and decided I&#x27;d do that maybe a few days later.</li>
            <li> so they disappear beforehand,and if your hair length is a little of the long side it wont efficiently pull from the root,just break it on the surface.</li>
            <li> have only one very minor complaint.</li>
            <li> Other than that I did like it and will be using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like other shavers do.</li>
            <li> From shaving, the hairs would only be dimished into a small size and could still  be visible, but with Silk-épil 9</li>
            <li> And even after a week, it was only small hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and the skin doesn&#x27;t get torn up like with other non-Braun brand epilators.</li>
            <li> You are warned that the first couple of times you use it, it may be uncomfortable and produce redness.</li>
            <li> so I switched to other methods.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to forget the facial brush I&#x27;ve been using the Olay one for the past 4Years</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak as to other lady areas because I am NOT using this where the sun doesn&#x27;t shine</li>
            <li> attention every other day anymore.</li>
            <li> It has a wide head so that means less strokes</li>
            <li> I read the directions carefully, seeing how I was a little apprehensive about anticipated pain that could be associated by using this product.  </li>
            <li> As for my legs, the Silk-épil 9 did an average job.</li>
            <li> It misses hairs, you have to at least go over the same area twice.</li>
            <li> I have really dark hair</li>
            <li> going slow was the key I had no problems whatsoever removing the hair.</li>
            <li> I love the results but hate the pain.  </li>
            <li> I found that going over the area quickly first (to pull out a bunch of hairs) , then going over that same area again (slowly, in the proper way) made it less painful for me.</li>
            <li> &amp; I am down to epilating about 1-2 times a week.  </li>
            <li> so I smoothed on some soothing lotion afterwards and it calmed down by dinner time.</li>
            <li> I will break down my pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s for you</li>
            <li> my epilator arrive yet?!&amp;#34; I hate everything about shaving, I cut myself almost every single time and my legs stay smooth for about an hour.</li>
            <li> It also swivels in such a way that it grabs those obnoxious little hairs in hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad at all to clean.  </li>
            <li> And I am not a baby about this stuff typically.</li>
            <li> I guess it hurts less that way.</li>
            <li> I guess it hurts less that way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The larger head means hair removal goes much faster, so it&#x27;s less painful.</li>
            <li> The wider head gets the job done quicker in less time which lets face it ladies that what we want when using an epilator.</li>
            <li> I have used another epilator before, and it was uncomfortable and left big swatches of hair on my legs</li>
            <li> I still feel slight stubble on my legs</li>
            <li> and I feel that the quantity of hair on my legs is decreasing, and maybe my technique is improving because I seem to have less &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; hairs.  </li>
            <li> My previous epilator died so I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> On the bottom half of my leg</li>
            <li> the hair is slightly coarser and it had no problem taking the hair off.</li>
            <li> There was a little less pain than my previous epilator, which I was not expecting.</li>
            <li> but I know after a few weeks it will hurt less and less.</li>
            <li> (less a few brow</li>
            <li> Less messy than waxing, and lasts way longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> but I can still feel little hairs,</li>
            <li> Just know, you are pulling the hair out by the root with this machine and it feels like a million little needle pricks.</li>
            <li> I used the machine a little over a week ago</li>
            <li> Even though I used to epilate before it hurt a little.</li>
            <li> Now the attachable parts for the epilator were a little confusing,they all kinda looked the same,and I felt no difference in results for the skin contact cap and the purple one,and I&#x27;ve yet to use the rest of them,especially the bikini trimmer cap.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these torture machines from other makers in the past.</li>
            <li> It felt like little rubberbands being plucked on my leg,</li>
            <li> This is what I did for my armpits, because it was a little too</li>
            <li> had never used an epilator before this, so I was a little scared.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nifty little brush</li>
            <li> You ARE ripping hair out of your body with a bunch of little tweezers.</li>
            <li> I use this the less irritating it would get as my bikini zone did not get red.</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, some of the areas on your legs you will find are less sensitive than others.</li>
            <li> I usually have to shave everyday to every other day.</li>
            <li> You will have a painful experience the first time you use it!</li>
            <li> It gets the dead skin off my face well</li>
            <li> After a few seconds the pain was manageable and</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> Another problem I encountered was that I had trouble attaching the shaving head and cap to the epilator, even though there were arrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another problem I encountered was that I had trouble attaching the shaving head and cap to the epilator, even though there were arrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going on vacation in a few weeks</li>
            <li> Now I did not enjoy Epilator head.</li>
            <li> Well, my tail is between my legs and my foot is firmly in my mouth after today&#x27;s experience with epilating post-shower.</li>
            <li> Save time and money (going for waxing is not cheap).</li>
            <li> I shave everyday</li>
            <li> Before using this product I would shave my legs and underarms a few times a week to keep my hair at bay.</li>
            <li> The epilators that I have tried in the past did not remove the hair from the roots, they just tore the hair in half.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: little painful at first, but bearable</li>
            <li> It was pretty painful.</li>
            <li> Indeed, painful at first.</li>
            <li> It can be used wet or dry, I used it wet to help make it a less painful experience, but I&#x27;ve used it dry since and it didn&#x27;t feel significantly worse.</li>
            <li> Being new to this, it does hurt but not as painful as I remember with the other brands I used.</li>
            <li> I have always hated that my underarms look discolored due to my dark hair, but with this epilator it removes the hair and my armpits are so much lighter now!</li>
            <li> I have epilated in the past before and stopped bc</li>
            <li> I tried a small section of my underarm and yelped.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the epilator only comes with 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> It also came with a face cleansing brush that resembled something expensive currently on the market today.</li>
            <li> For reference, I usually shave my legs, but wax my bikini area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend using it while in the bathtub and with a small amount of shower gel.</li>
            <li> However, it usually takes me some efforts to pull all the hair off</li>
            <li> - I hadn&#x27;t just showered nor had I exfoliated in at least a few days.</li>
            <li> it has a swivel head with small tweezers covering a surface that spins-  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a machine that will pluck out all of your hairs individually instead of just cutting them down like a razor.</li>
            <li> Worse than the other brand that I use.</li>
            <li> it hurt a little, but definitely faster and much less painful than using wax or wax strips</li>
            <li> The epilator is little disappointing  dry  </li>
            <li> On the contrary, some cons of the epilator is that it is a bit hard to turn on the epilator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i wasent pressing hard</li>
            <li> every part of your skin where you use the product), this will prevent from ingrown hair, I learned it the hard way.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went very slow with a few breaks in between.</li>
            <li> I used that sucker constantly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This time, I used it in the shower (after being in there for at least 5 minutes)</li>
            <li> and you need at least 10 sessions to start seeing permanent results.</li>
            <li> Legs are not as painful as underarms but both bring considerable pain.</li>
            <li> So I forced myself to try this one.</li>
            <li> So I was a bit slow to try this when I received it as a promotion from Braun and Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I forced myself to try this one.</li>
            <li> I mean if you do the math, between waxing and this epilator.</li>
            <li> hat I have used in the past!</li>
            <li> : It can be painful Epilating takes a long time, but this device has quite a few things going for it.</li>
            <li> No more investing in razors, and no more shaving every couple of days!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles</li>
            <li> But legs are definitely not that bad for me.</li>
            <li> I will admit its definitely not painless but its not as bad if you have the habit of wax.</li>
            <li> The only thing about this and every product like it is it hurts really bad.</li>
            <li> I tried hers out and it was soooooo painful and left my skin irritated to the point where I had to apply neosporin on my underarms for 5 days!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t painful, the discomfort was only that it was ticklish.</li>
            <li> The cons it is painful, but if you are use to waxing it hurts the same.</li>
            <li> I also found every time I used it the pain got a little less painful.</li>
            <li> and it hurt very bad, so much</li>
            <li> Goes very slowly takes lots of time</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too painful as I had expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> I have had razor burn that hurt worse than that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great at pulling out finer hairs.</li>
            <li> I switched it over to the other body cap that came in the kit and it hurt sooo bad.</li>
            <li> BUT with time it will get less painful.</li>
            <li> significantly less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> No, but it&#x27;s less painful than waxing, so it&#x27;s going to become my go-to.</li>
            <li> It makes everything less painful.</li>
            <li> It is a little painful</li>
            <li> However, this is not for the faint of hearts.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but close !&lt;</li>
            <li> Its not that anything is wrong with it.</li>
            <li> And it thook away the annoying grief of having to shave every other day and buy expensive razor blades.</li>
            <li> I tried 3 times and had to stop because it hurt too bad to keep going.</li>
            <li> and it hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> But I just tried it again and it wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>

            <li> And it was not that bad.</li>
            <li> And while it wasn&#x27;t like a thousand butterflies dancing on my legs, I thought, &amp;#34;this isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> so I tried it on some arm hairs and it wasn&#x27;t so bad</li>
            <li> , it hurts like #%$€# under the arms, bikini line and tighs, not that bad on lower legs.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> it was so painful</li>
            <li> For those of you wondering, yes it is painful.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Cons: painful</li>
            <li> PERFECTLY PAINFUL:  </li>
            <li> and so it wasn’t as painful to use.  </li>
            <li> It is about as painful as it sounds</li>
            <li> it was still not as painful as the others</li>

            <li> I hate devices that include instructions that don&#x27;t differentiate between models.</li>
            <li> I found that this product can be extremely PAINFUL!</li>
            <li> Give it a try - you will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Very painful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;m definitely very happy with this epilator&lt;br /&gt;I caught this promotion on  bzzagent and I&#x27;m very happy&lt;br /&gt;the equipment is very complete&lt;br /&gt;in terms of shaving, leaves my skin soft and if hairs and hair takes more days in&lt;br /&gt;out of what normally takes with other depilatories&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. This was a free product from BRAUN! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got this product free to try through BzzAgent. I have used another brand epilator before so I sort of had an idea of what to expect. I used the massage cap first, which is the one that came on it. It was not painful at all. It felt more like a slight tugging if anything. Tweezing my eyebrows actually hurts more than this did. I switched it over to the other body cap that came in the kit and it hurt sooo bad. Worse than the other brand that I use. I tried 3 times and had to stop because it hurt too bad to keep going. And I am not a baby about this stuff typically. I then tried the facial cap on my &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; area. This also hurt to the point where I did not fully get rid of the hair because I had to stop from pain. I also tried the facial brush that came in the kit and was pleased. I use the Clarisonic Mia 2 everyday and this is a much different brush than that one. This one spins in a full circle, has 2 settings and does not have a timer. I used it with an exfoliating scrub as well as my normal face wash and it seemed to give me a nice deep clean. Since it does spin in a full circle, it did move around my face sort of fast and was hard to get in between my eyebrows and transition down my nose. Other than that I did like it and will be using it. I can not give this kit 5 stars because of the pain factor I got from the body cap and the facial cap but since the massage cap and face brush worked so well, I did give it 4 stars. I would recommend this product and will be using it more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt; I received it in my bzzagent campaign. My skin has never felt so soft. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like other shavers do. I would recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I have epilated in the past before and stopped bc it was so painful and it wasn&#x27;t giving me the results I longed for. This Braun epilator has made me go back to epilating. For those of you wondering, yes it is painful. BUT with time it will get less painful. The wider head of the braun epilator give you a faster epilation and I did notice that it picks up more hair than my other epilator. It also has a cool light that helps you really see what you&#x27;re doing. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for smooth legs that last a long time! Thank you bzzagent for letting me try this for free</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun I was able to test the Silk-épil 9 for free!! My best friend has used an epilator for years and swears by it. I had never even heard of such a device until she told me about hers a few months ago. I was so excited at the idea of never having to shave again and having super smooth, stubble-free underarms! I tried hers out and it was soooooo painful and left my skin irritated to the point where I had to apply neosporin on my underarms for 5 days! Anyway, the point is I was really scared to use this epilator, but OMG! It is soooooo good!! Unlike other epilators, you dont have to go over areas multiple times. It zapped my underarm hair with perfect precision and literally NO discomfort! AND it was so fast! Another thing I loved about the Silk-épil 9 is that it is rechargeable AND cordless! Who wants to be stuck next to a wall outlet?! You don&#x27;t have to be with this one! All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this product. It is SO worth it. I&#x27;m stubble-free and wont have hair growth for about 2 weeks. Buy this epilator!</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, I was able to clear my little hairs from my armpits. From shaving, the hairs would only be dimished into a small size and could still  be visible, but with Silk-épil 9 I was able to completely clear those tiny hairs! Now my armpits are completely free of hair.  The facial cleaner machine also works really good,  I poured some of my exfoliating cleanser into my face, and massaged a little and then I used the facial cleaner machine, and now my face feels softer.  As for my legs, the Silk-épil 9 did an average job. I shaved my legs but I can still feel little hairs, my legs do not feel smooth so I am going to shave with another razor.  Overall I love the product,  especially because I am able to clear my face and arm pits of little tiny hairs in a little bit of time, with no pain at all. I got to try it for free thanks to Braun!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Braun!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used an epilator once before and it hurt so bad. I&#x27;ve never waxed my legs, and don&#x27;t care for tweezing eyebrows. So I forced myself to try this one. It did still hurt the first time I used it. But I just tried it again and it wasn&#x27;t as bad. I think it is something you just get used to over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Comes with different heads&lt;br /&gt;Use wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable battery&lt;br /&gt;Facial brush&lt;br /&gt;Super smooth legs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Painful at first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the epilator and it makes shaving so much easier and faster. I am a mom of two (a toddler and an infant). So I can&#x27;t spend a lot of time shaving every day. Honestly I will advise anyone who is thinking of going with this method of hair removal to do some research. I saw that a lot of people recommend waxing first and then using an epilator to remove regrowth. I guess it hurts less that way. Also read the instructions!!!! It recommends to use at night before going to bed. That way you are not going out with red irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product. This product has changed my hair removal routine for life. I don&#x27;t think I would go back to regular shaving or waxing after using this product.  Reasons why I like this product: 1. It&#x27;s easy and convenient to use. 2. Easy to clean. 3. The results from epilating last longer than shaving. Epilated 7 days ago and I&#x27;m still hair free. 4. significantly less painful than waxing. 5. Love the trimmer and shaving setting for those areas that are more sensitive. 6. Facial cleansing brush.  The thing I did not like about this product: 1.  It was time consuming. it took me about 30 minutes to epilate both legs.  This product was send to me to review by bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> I was able to test this product thanks to BzzAgent.com and a free sample from Braun.  While it provided a good clean &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; that has lasted longer than shaving with a razor, I am incredibly wimpy and the pain is not worth it to me.  I would rather shave more regularly than experience the pulling of the hair.  That being said, the product itself works well.  It also comes with a variety of attachments that would make it more worth the money as you could use it on many parts of your body.  The addition of the facial brush is an awesome bonus!  It gets the dead skin off my face well and if I were to epilate (is that a real word?) on my face, this would help make my skin especially smooth and less sensitive if I use it the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a decent pain threshold, then definitely worth the purchase.  If you have a low pain tolerance like myself, you may want to pass.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it takes out the smallest hair pieces but the only problem if you want a great result you gotta go over the area more than ones...besides that is great for facial hair....u don&#x27;t have hair show up for a a couple days ...also the facial brush takes away the dirt from your face making it feel nice a fresh ....I tried this product for free thanks to the Braun company</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have received the new Braun Silk-épil 9 Cordless Wet &amp; Dry Epilator, to test for free, thanks to Braun through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited of receiving it to try and compare it with my previous braun epilators models 5 and 7.&lt;br /&gt;I have been consuming all my life Braun products and about epilators I still owns two previous models that bought more than 2 and 5 years ago and still working perfectly:&lt;br /&gt;Braun silk epil Xelle 549 and Braun silk epil wet &amp; dry 7-5377. Wonderful products.&lt;br /&gt;The new Braun Silk-épil 9 Cordless Wet &amp; Dry Epilator is very similar to its predecessor 7 model, but enhanced with many more accessories that excites me. It&#x27;s a bit wider head allowing faster epilation and with tweezers technology MicroGrip hair removal is much smoother and accurate. Thanks to its accessories I use it throughout the body, mainly on the face: eyebrows, cheeks, mustache. And also in the body: armpits, legs and bikini area. My shaved and depilated areas are very smooth and beautiful, growing slowly and soft by longer.  I am very happy to have received all additional attached caps that my braun epil 7 not had and could not get them to buy them separately, but this package is very complete and has everything needed to make a happy woman in relation to facial and body hair. And a plus, this kit have a bonus free face massager and cleansing brush.  Wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Braun. I will be a loyal customer lifetime, I loved the new Braun Silk-épil 9 Cordless Wet &amp; Dry Epilator. It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun I was able to test the Silk-épil 9 for free, but if I&#x27;d have know how good of a job it does I would have purchased it myself.  I love this epilator!! I used razors from the time I was old enough to slave my legs until about 8 years ago when my dad said my legs had so many red bumps it looked like I had a disease. So out went the razors. I&#x27;ve tried several different wax systems and at lease 5 different epilators since then. All did an alright job but I still had to go back with tweezers and a flashlight to get the job complete. That was until the Braun Silk-épil 9. Seriously, I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but WOW!! Right out of the box and five minutes later my legs were hairless, completely hairless. The Braun Silk-épil 9 is amazing, it has 2 speeds and a light for seeing those little fine hairs I always seem to miss, and a wide head for more coverage. And did I mention no pain. My ankles are sensitive and epilating always hurt but not with the Braun Silk-épil 9. I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try it on my more sensitive areas yet but I might work up to that before swimsuit season gets here. Over all the Braun Silk-épil 9 is an excellent product and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Having epilated in the past,  but not been too completely thrilled, I was ecstatic to be able to try the Silk-Epil 9, thanks to Braun and BzzAgent. Compared to my past epilator (which was a cheap one that I got to see how I felt about it- and it showed), this one was much less painful and seemed to be more effective in less time. One of my two favorite things about the Silk-Epil 9  is that it&#x27;s rechargeable, as opposed to using batteries, or needing to be plugged in, and even using it straight out of the box, I managed to do both underarms and legs, and it&#x27;s still going strong without re-charging yet! The other favorite thing is that it can be used both wet and dry! I tried both ways, and both were equally effective. The only slight downside is that using it while wet does create a little bit of a drag, but the fact that using it while showering makes clean-up practically non-existent makes up for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With shaving, I typically have some stubble by the next day, but it&#x27;s been about a week and I&#x27;m still stubble free, which I love, especially as the weather is beginning to get warmer and my legs will be showing more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the extra accessories- the &amp;#34;skin contact cap&amp;#34; for underarms and bikini, the facial cap, electric razor and trimmer cap help to provide the most comfortable and optimal hair trim/removal, no matter what specifically you want. Even better, it comes with a drawstring bag to keep everything in so nothing gets lost- a simple but appreciated bonus!</li>
            <li> I received this machine on a trial basis for free through bzzagent. I was able to take it right out of the package when I received it and turn it right on and start using it. This machine is great! I really liked how easy it was to use with two different speeds. However, this is not for the faint of hearts. Just know, you are pulling the hair out by the root with this machine and it feels like a million little needle pricks. It is not unbearable to use, beauty is pain right? I noticed I only had to go over a spot one time and I was literally pulling the hair right out. I really did like using it, I just had to get over the slight pain it caused. I was very impressed with the result as well. I used the machine a little over a week ago and I have no hair growing back which is rare for me. I usually have to shave everyday to every other day. I would highly recommend this product to whom ever will try it. I suggest a high pain tolerance. Not only do you get the epilator but you also get the facial brush which is my new favorite product to use in the morning!!!</li>
            <li> I received this epilator from bzzagent to try out for free. I owned the silk epil 7 last year and it stopped working after a few months and I was so excited to start epilating again when I got this. Even though I used to epilate before it hurt a little. It was like starting all over but I know after a few weeks it will hurt less and less. Also I won&#x27;t have to epilate as much as when I&#x27;m just shaving. For those new to apilating i recommend aloe Vera for after epilation because your skin will be irritated. I love everything about this epilator you can use it in the shower I personally like to use it in the bath(under water) and it comes with a face brush. Very nice kit</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to use an epilator for a very long time and thanks to Braun, I was able to try this one for free! I am so in love with this product! I use this epilator pretty much for all areas (legs, arms, underarms, bikini line) but mostly for underarms and bikini line. It comes with quite a few different caps- there&#x27;s one for wide epilation (legs/arms), a very slim epilator cap that is best for underarms/bikini line/upper lip, epilator cap with massager, and shaver cap. It also came with nice a facial cleanser!  Now, if you are not used to waxing or tweezing, I would not try the sensitive areas first. For someone who is used to those things, I definitely still did experience some pain. It&#x27;s not unbearable though and especially if you use it in the shower. The pain is definitely worth it, I didn&#x27;t have to use the epilator again on my underarms for a week, whereas with shavers you&#x27;d see hair the next day.  And even after a week, it was only small hairs here and there. There is no question that the product does exactly what it says! The only con I can really think of is time. You definitely will have to set a good amount of time if you&#x27;re doing your entire body. The good thing is that you don&#x27;t have to do it everyday. For me, I only had to use it about once a week. I found it easier to just shave my legs sometimes, though. If you&#x27;re looking for a better way to do smaller areas though like your underarms and bikini line, definitely consider Braun epilators!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun and BzzAgent I was able to try this epilator for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this epilator. I make use of most of the accessories that came with it, excluding only the cap for the shaver that leaves a small bit of your hair attached. I was able to charge the device in about an hour and finished both full legs before it ran out of power. For those that may be curious, you cannot use the device while it is plugged in (to prevent electric shock, I&#x27;m sure), but this is not an issue with the fast charging and good battery life. I mention that because a previous epilator I had used was capable of doing that. There is a light a comes on while in use that helps to see the area you are working on. While using dry, which is usually how I go about things, I was able to get just about all of my hair out in a few passes (far better than my experience with my other [cheaper] epilator). There was a little less pain than my previous epilator, which I was not expecting. I also tried out the shaver attachment, which I had never used before, and was amazed by how close of a shave you get with it! Cleaning this device is a breeze. The attachments come off (of course) and break down even further, so getting all of the hair out was very easy and quick. It also comes with a brush to help clean the tough to get to places, just be careful when cleaning the innards of the shaver attachment (the manual describes this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only one very minor complaint. You cannot turn off the light while in use. It is supposed to be aimed at the area you are working on, but it still shines everywhere and is a bit bright, so you still kind of have to look at it. At the same time, I&#x27;m glad the light is there.</li>
            <li> I had a chance to test this product out for free as part of promotion from Braun. Had I known the effectiveness, I would have ordered it on my own. Thank goodness I got to try this. The first day I received this I tried it on my legs. I read the pamphlet, although not enthusiastically as I was excited to try out the product! I first epilated my legs with the attachment that was already on. I epilated without water. It wasn&#x27;t painful, the discomfort was only that it was ticklish. The process yielded great results. I tried a small section of my underarm and yelped. It had hurt. I backed down and decided I&#x27;d do that maybe a few days later. On the  second day I got up the nerve to epilate my underarms. I took my epilator to shower with me. After a while when the water had softened up and opened up the pores, I epilated the first underarm. I thought the pain would be unbearable but it was more psychological. Of course it hurt! The epilator pulls hair out from the root! After a few seconds the pain was manageable and a minute or two later I moved on to the next underarm. The results were so amazing! So great I would not mind the pain. It has been two weeks and Im still hair free.  I believe the epilator works best wet for thicker and darker hairs. It works best dry for lighter hairs. The only difficulty I had was having to go over the area I had epilated again. Maybe with experience I&#x27;ll learn how to properly epilate without having to go over a section. About the accessories, they&#x27;re all great. I prefer to use the attachment the epilator came with already on. The trimmer/razor also works wonderfully removing hair and leaving a smooth surface. I tried the smaller epilator heads that have more access without the massage head and didn&#x27;t care for them. I absolutely LOVE the facial brush. I love it sooo much I use it twice a day everyday. I feel like the spinning brush works deeper to get a better cleaning and my face feels so fresh, taut, and clean after use. It doesnt feel overly scrubbed like other brushes have left my face, and I use it on the strongest setting. It has two settings. Im assuming one of them is for sensitive skin, and the other is for not-so-sensistive skin. I am so glad I got to try this product for free by promotion because now I can recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> This is amazing..I didn&#x27;t even know that they made such thing as an epilator..but now that I&#x27;ve tried this i will never shave, wax, or manually tweeze again..I used it for the first time 3 wks ago and my legs are still unbelievably smooth.. my bikini and under arm area are just barely now showing a lil&#x27; stubble..I received the Braun silk epilator for free from Braun and buzz agent to try it out.at first I thought it was just like a razor but once I realized its an epilator(kinda like a lot of battery operated tweezers) it scared me a lil but the results are so amazing its totally worth the small discomfort..i have a very high pain tolerance so to me it was not painful..and this is the best new beauty tool I&#x27;ve discovered since razors! Its saving me so much time now to do the things I truly enjoy not tweezing and shaving every other day for at least an hour..the epilator takes me about 30 mins to do my whole body every 2-3wks!!so much $ I&#x27;m going to save in the long run instead of buying shaving supplies! I absolutely love it and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to anything other then this epilator now!!</li>
            <li> I received this Epilator free from BrAun and I absolutely love this product kit.  I was very nervous trying this for the first time because I was afraid that it will hurt me, and of course it did.  I tried it on my leg hair and it was about 1/8 inch long and it hurt very bad, so much so I had to stop.  Then instead of giving up on this product I tried the other head attachment and got a closer shave to make my leg hair barely noticeable.  I went back with the Epilator over the short hairs and it worked wonderfully and was almost painless.  I love this Epilator and I love how silky it makes my skin afterwards.  It also has a very bright LED light that helps you see around your ankle bone and knee caps.  Overall I am very happy with this product and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> While shavers and razors cut hair off at skin level, the Braun Silk epil 9 uses motorized tweezers that pluck it out at the root. I&#x27;m not gonna lie: It can be painful Epilating takes a long time, but this device has quite a few things going for it. Over time, epilated hair comes back finer and stays away longer; your skin adapts, the whole process becomes less painful -- delivering more of a tingling or prickling sensation than real pain. If you&#x27;re used to waxing, they say, making the switch to epilation is a cinch. Using the elipator can also save you money because you don&#x27;t have to pay for shaving cream or replacement blades&lt;br /&gt; The epilator works for 40 mins to an hour charge, and has a head that is 40% wider than traditional models apparently - I certainly found it didn&#x27;t take too long to get my legs done, and they felt wonderfully smooth for a long time afterwards, something my disposable razors never fully achieved. It can be used wet or dry, I used it wet to help make it a less painful experience, but I&#x27;ve used it dry since and it didn&#x27;t feel significantly worse. It can be fully cleaned under water too, which is handy. Also handy is the bright light which makes sure you don&#x27;t miss any tiny hairs. Included are enough attachments to make sure you can do legs, arms, underarms, face and bikini. It also came with a nice motorized face brush with 2 speeds to get your face extra clean and to help exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a charging stand for the epilator, and a storage bag which is pretty basic but does the job&lt;br /&gt;Me and my 20 year old daughter tried this. I have a high tolerance to pain and she does not. Yes, it hurts at first but you get used to it. My daughter couldn&#x27;t handle the pain and stopped after several tries.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: easy, no more expensive razors,  hair free for long periods, over time hair becomes thinner&lt;br /&gt;Cons: painful but it goes away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this product. This is my first Epilator, and it&#x27;s outstanding! I&#x27;m only 13, and I got used to it before I could even realize it.it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore, it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> Nice product, free shipping is nice and as quoted to the last day lol. Shipped arrived in 2 days but took 10 days to ship just because free shipping? Product is gr8. Looks authentic</li>
            <li> I had the privilege to try this product for free thanks to Braun,which is amazing because normally, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of going over 50 for a product like this.So at over 150 buckaroos,you&#x27;re going to want to make sure this is well worth the investment.So eager to rip out my hairs, and not have to worry about shaving 4 days later,I opened this baby up and gave it a shot. The cons, it will catch you off guard,I mean it looks terrifying,it does hurt quite a bit,it may leave what look like welts on your skin that last all day, so use the day before any special occasion so they disappear beforehand,and if your hair length is a little of the long side it wont efficiently pull from the root,just break it on the surface. The pros,you get no razor bumps, no ingrown hairs, smooth skin,comes with a small brush to clean the epilator thoroughly which is pretty easy to do. And after using the epilator for a while its like your body adapts to the pain so you dont really feel it much anymore and instead turns similar to a pinch.The facial cleansing brush that it came with was amazing, before this I just used my fingers to scrub my face with my regular scrub, but this get in deeper and you can definitely feel the difference,plus as stated you can use in the shower.Your face becomes just so soft, like those fleece blankets for babies. Now the attachable parts for the epilator were a little confusing,they all kinda looked the same,and I felt no difference in results for the skin contact cap and the purple one,and I&#x27;ve yet to use the rest of them,especially the bikini trimmer cap.Overall,I was amazed by this, two weeks in and my legs and underarms are still smooth, give or take a few hairs here and there but who will notice,right?And to top it off, I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t pay a dime for this great experience and amazing product because I #gotitfree.Thank you Braun!!</li>
            <li> Had one for years which I loved.  Lost it.  Finally bought this one.  This product is amazing.  Can&#x27;t imagine something better.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have received this product to try from Braun and I absolutely loved it! This cordless epilator comes with various caps for different body areas. The head is really wide which assures better coverage. It is suitable for wet and dry skin. I have tried both and prefer the dry one better. It has a built-in light that is very useful as you can see the area better. The result lasted about 3 weeks and the hair that grew back was thinner. I did not have any irritation or ingrown hair. It is very easy to change caps and to clean the epilator. On a full charge the epilator lasted for about an hour of non-stop working.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and absolutely recommend it to the others.</li>
            <li> I ordered new device but I received a device with damage box. I don&#x27;t like it because I bought this for birthday my wife.</li>
            <li> ABOUT ME:  Disabled thirty-something (my hands and arms spontaneously malfunctioned) who also suffers from Late Stage (or Chronic) Lyme Disease which has greatly effected my skin and therefore, I epilate from forehead to toenails (less a few brow hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE YAYS&lt;br /&gt;1.  HOLY HOLDNESS: The shape of this baby is SO suited for any girl&#x27;s grip, even that of a handicap!&lt;br /&gt;2.  PERFECTLY PAINFUL:  I don&#x27;t know about you all but if I didn&#x27;t feel it, it didn&#x27;t happen.  You feel me?&lt;br /&gt;3.  LIMITED LUSTER:  It&#x27;s all about ginormous gems these days that fall between a crack you can&#x27;t pick.  Not this girl, her glitter is gracious but governed.&lt;br /&gt;4.  VELOCIEPILATOR:  Velociraptor translates to &amp;#34;swift seizer&amp;#34;.  Need I say more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE NAYS&lt;br /&gt;1. WET NOODLE:  I probably need a lesson in wetepilating - but after several attempts, I stand firm.  This is better suited for land.&lt;br /&gt;FACIAL EPILATOR:  I admit it - I was hoping this model included the facial wand but be still my greedy heart ... maybe I have a large face, but I find the facial attachment to be pointless.  Instead, I increase my mirror magnification with the original head (and pray).&lt;br /&gt;2.  FACIAL CLEANSING BRUSH:  Bonus gifts are usually my bestie&#x27;s, but if you own a Clarisonic (as I do) then this freebie will make an excellent gift.&lt;br /&gt;3.  STORAGE BAG:  For $175, I find much to be desired in the included white vinyl &amp;#34;tote&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:  Based on my nays, I would personally love to see a few packaging tweaks or a reduction in price for surrendering a few of the  misfit items however, if I were to score the epilator alone, 5 stars.  Final Answer.  Thank you SO much Bzzagent for providing me with this prodigious product for the cost of my opinion!</li>
            <li> I have had two of these torture machines from other makers in the past. So I was a bit slow to try this when I received it as a promotion from Braun and Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;I read all the directions... DO that. I found out that I couldn&#x27;t jump in and use it on the mane I had been growing on my legs while waiting for it to come, I could trim the hair with the very cool trimming head that comes with it, or shave it and wait for it to regrow. Being a chicken I shaved to buy myself more time!&lt;br /&gt;I finally grabbed it off the charging dock right before bed and said &amp;#34;ok, lady, you have to do this eventually!&amp;#34; I grit my teeth and squinched my eyes shut AND... nothing. I have had razor burn that hurt worse than that.&lt;br /&gt;It does hurt a bit, the backs of my legs were much more sensitive than the top shin. It IS a thousand tiny tweezers! FYI You are going to have red legs from ripping your hair out. Lotion and a loofa in the shower help. (Directions!)&lt;br /&gt;But I am very happy with it. I hate to shave every day but I hate hairy legs!&lt;br /&gt;It went really fast. I put it on high and slowly ran the wide head up my legs and the hair disappeared. It is really smooth. Using it a few days in a row got all of the little hairs and desensitized my skin even more to the little prickling sensation. My favorite part (is silly) is the headlight on it. It is very bright, points right at your leg and shows you what you are aiming for.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Braun Silk-epil 9!! I received the my very own epilator from Braun to try out.  It&#x27;s been a few weeks &amp; I absolutely love the results.  At first, I was nervous to use it because of the fact that I had never epilated before.  After I got over the fear, I am a huge fan of it!!  I started off using the Silk-epil 9 about 4 times the first week.  Then, it went down to 2-3 times the next couple weeks &amp; I am down to epilating about 1-2 times a week.  It felt like little rubberbands being plucked on my leg, but after getting used to it, my skin is not as sensitive.  I like to soak my legs first for about 5 mins &amp; then put a shaving cream or gel on before I epilate.  There are less &amp; less hairs on my legs &amp; the ones that are there are very soft - not coarse like when I used to shave EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.  The flexible, massaging head helps guide the epilator along the skin &amp; covers a large area with each swoop. I&#x27;m excited that I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive packs of razors every other month now. I&#x27;ve already told a bunch of friends &amp; family about how awesome this product is &amp; how much of a fan I&#x27;ve become of it since I received it to try out about a month ago. I would highly recommend the Braun Silk-epil 9 as it is an effective &amp; efficient product. Give it a try - you will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free thanks to Braun!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used an epilator once before and it hurt so bad. I&#x27;ve never waxed my legs, and don&#x27;t care for tweezing eyebrows. So I forced myself to try this one. It did still hurt the first time I used it. But I just tried it again and it wasn&#x27;t as bad. I think it is something you just get used to over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Comes with different heads&lt;br /&gt;Use wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable battery&lt;br /&gt;Facial brush&lt;br /&gt;Super smooth legs&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Painful at first&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the epilator and it makes shaving so much easier and faster. I am a mom of two (a toddler and an infant). So I can&#x27;t spend a lot of time shaving every day. Honestly I will advise anyone who is thinking of going with this method of hair removal to do some research. I saw that a lot of people recommend waxing first and then using an epilator to remove regrowth. I guess it hurts less that way. Also read the instructions!!!! It recommends to use at night before going to bed. That way you are not going out with red irritated skin.</li>
            <li> The Braun Silk &amp;eacute;pil 9 package (product number 9-579), received free thanks to BzzAgent and Braun, comes with an wet and dry epilator with 12 additional items, which are the shaver head and high frequency massage head (already attached to the epilator), an additional shaver head with a trimmer cap, a skin contact cap, a facial cap, a charging stand, a facial cleansing brush, batteries, a charger, an epilator cover and a cleaning brush. The product also includes a manual for easier instruction and maintenance. Upon opening the box, I noticed that there were more accessories included as opposed to previous Braun silk epilators which tend to include up to 3 accessories. The facial cleansing brush was a bonus edition and was probably the best thing out of the whole package. The brush cleans out your pores and exfoliates your skin, leaving it nice and soft. However, I would love for the facial cleansing brush to have been rechargeable instead of battery operated, (like the epilator). As for the epilator, (which came fully charged right out of the box), I really like the design and color, as it is a royal purple and white with sparkles on the body of the epilator. I also like that the epilator comes with a light upon turning on the device making it easier to use. Unfortunately, the epilator only comes with 2 speeds. As someone with sensitive skin, the epilator did hurt leaving my arms red for at least 20 to 30 minutes. (I would recommend putting lotion on afterwards to ease the sensitivity). However, after using the product several times, my skin became use to it and so it wasn’t as painful to use.  The good thing about this product is that hair remains gone for up to 2 weeks. What I really liked was that after using the product, it doesn’t just leave your skin smooth, it leaves it feeling velvety and soft, similar to a baby’s skin. On the contrary, some cons of the epilator is that it is a bit hard to turn on the epilator. Instead of pressing a button, you have to rotate the circle. Another problem I encountered was that I had trouble attaching the shaving head and cap to the epilator, even though there were arrows.&lt;br /&gt;As for the other times, I haven’t really used them except for the brush which makes it easier to clean the epilator and the facial cap, which makes it easier to remove hair from the philtrum and upper lip areas. Furthermore, I have no idea what the skin contact cap is to be used for, as I found no use for it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product vs other Braun epilators, because of all the additional accessories, and for the facial cleansing brush, which was the best part of the whole package.rotate the circle.

            <li> So I had the chance to review this product for free thanks to Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with the epilator. It&#x27;s easy to use , and gives good results. Shaving with a razor did not give me a close shave, waxing- well is too long a process (waiting 1-2 weeks of being hairy to get a good wax) to me it is not worth it. Epilating pulls the hair from the root, and the results lasts as long as a wax. The cons it is painful, but if you are use to waxing it hurts the same. It does not last 4 weeks, it lasts about 2 weeks (depending on your hair growth). It misses hairs, you have to at least go over the same area twice. Another con is that it may pinch if you are not careful. Enough with the cons, the PROS it is quiet. Easy to clean, to use. I was really worried about the pain but it&#x27;s definitely manageable and worth it. I mean if you do the math, between waxing and this epilator. I would chose the epilator, you pay only once and not every other week. Another pro is that you can do it in the privacy of your own home, when ever you feel like it. You don&#x27;t have to wait in line, make appointments, you have there at your disposal. Also, it gives you peace of mind, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about someone not doing their job correctly. It will give you peace of mind that it is yours only, and it does not have some else&#x27;s germs. The only reason why I give it a found is for 3 simple reasons, it hurs, it pinches, and the facial brush have to have batteries. It would have been easier if the facial brush had the same electric outlet so you don&#x27;t have to spend money on batteries. Other than that I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with it. I am still getting used to the pain but I like the product and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I would warn about if you have sensitive skin, is that after I epilate (especially my lower legs, but also my upper legs) I get really itchy for about a 2 hour period. So if that would be a problem, I would think about considering another hair removal method.</li>
            <li> Terrific epilator. Great covers for reaching and working on different areas of the body. The tweezers don&#x27;t make contact with the skin, so going over the knees is a snap and the skin doesn&#x27;t get torn up like with other non-Braun brand epilators. Love the bonus facial brush. So gentle. Overall, best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> why there is no cleaning brush?</li>
            <li> It do the job amazing and leave my skin very soft . I love it</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I was sent this product for review by BzzAgent. My opinions are my own. Anyone can look at my review history and see that when I don&#x27;t like something, I just don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely not the case with the Braun Silk-Épil. I&#x27;ve used epilators before and been annoyed by the results -- or lack thereof -- but this glorious gadget is my new favorite thing in the world. I have sensitive skin when it comes to shaving. It itches and burns. It leaves welts. I just can&#x27;t. I normally go to the salon for waxing, but when BzzAgent sent me this, I figured I would give it a try. I&#x27;m so, so glad I did. It&#x27;s going to save me so much money since I won&#x27;t have to wax again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger head means hair removal goes much faster, so it&#x27;s less painful. It also swivels in such a way that it grabs those obnoxious little hairs in hard to reach places. Is it painless? No, but it&#x27;s less painful than waxing, so it&#x27;s going to become my go-to. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money. If you&#x27;re on the fence, grab it!</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9 for free, thanks to Braun. I have to say that this epilator exceeded my expectations. I’ve been epilating for almost a year now, and it’s definitely my go-to for hair removal. Less messy than waxing, and lasts way longer than shaving. Previously, I was using the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7, and had great results. So, I was super excited to get to try the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9. It works just as well as the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7, but better. I definitely see a difference in the 40% wider head. Things seemed to move much more quickly. It also seems like the charge lasts longer on the battery. I was able to do both my legs and still have plenty of charge. The added charging stand was a cool bonus, too. My favorite feature is probably the light near the head, because without it I wouldn’t be able to see a thing! I also like that there are two speed settings, as well as vibration. The vibration seems to help with the pain, I’m also a big fan of the shaving attachment. It’s great for trimming around the bikini area. The set I received also came with an exfoliating face brush, which is cool. I haven’t tried it yet, since my face is super sensitive, but I’m thinking it may even be good for exfoliating my legs. For any first time epilator users, I would suggest using this in the shower the first time. Since this is a wet dry epilator, it works in the shower, and that can cut down the the pain. Especially if you use it toward the end of your shower, or even afterward. I honestly can’t say enough good things about this epilator. I’ve recommended epilating to a number of my friends, and I’ll certainly be recommending the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9 as well!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product! It is absolutely amazing! I received this kit from BzzAgent and BRAUN to try it for free.... Oh my! A $150 perfectly perfect product! I used to use the Braun Silk Epil Xelle, that I bought 5 years ago, but it broke/died about a month ago. I knew I deffintitely wanted another epilator but I really did not know which one. I really like the Braun company- their are known in Europe for their quality products. When I received the Braun Silk Epil 9 (wet &amp; dry epilator) I could not wait to test it. So I ripped it out of the box and since it was already charged I used it right away. I was in love with every thing about it! I love the design- if you have seen the Xelle, you will notice how much of a difference in design happened- and I love the new design MORE. Way easier to maneuver! It&#x27;s tall and slim, as compared to the short and fat other one. The truth is that I was happy with my other because I did not know any better. Let alone the fact that my old one was a plug in, so I always HAD to be next to a plug. I am so excited to use this one anywhere- and I already used it anywhere in my house. I realized I can use it on the way to going places, in the car! That is perfect! It can be used in the shower- which is something new for me. I love that it can be cordless!!! One of the greatest features, along with the fact that it has sparkles in the design :) I love that it has a wider epilating head, that makes it faster. And I noticed how much better in pulls the hair out compared to my old one. I love that it comes with so many attachments- I tried all of the out and my favorite is the high frequency massage cap. I love that this epilator has the skin contour adaptation and the pulsating active vibrations. It makes everything less painful. I have used the epilator on my legs and underarms with the one charge it came with. There is nothing I would change about it. I am in love! I am soooo happy I can try something new and have it be a way better experience every time I epilate now. Did I mention I love the sparkles? :) This kit comes with a pore deep cleansing brush- which is a super bonus- I love it! I am overall way satisfied with this product and I am excited to tell my friends all about it! THANK YOU BRAUN! I love your products!</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Silk Epil 9 for free as a BzzAgent in exchange for my testing the product and giving an impartial review.  I LOVED IT!  The first time I used it, I was apprehensive as I remember the old epilators from the 90’s and that was torture.  This was amazing.  It was easy to use and has two settings, a gentle speed and an efficient speed.  I have only tried the gentle speed.  I followed the directions and used it at night.  My knee area was a bit sensitive but once I got going it was fine.  I have very fair and sensitive skin.  I did have red spots for a couple of days on my legs.  However, the next time I used it I had no red spots.  The directors do mention it might take a couple of times for your skin to become used to the process.  I am going on vacation in a few weeks and I am so happy I have this product to take with me instead of taking the shaving cream and razor.  I think it will be much easier to use while away from home.  I also tried the Skil Epil 9 on my chin area.  Again I loved it!  It got more hairs than I saw in my mirror.  It did not hurt and I did not have any redness on my chin area.  I think this product is wonderful and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone.</li>
            <li> If you have never used an epilator it&#x27;s a machine that will pluck out all of your hairs individually instead of just cutting them down like a razor. It is about as painful as it sounds but well worth it by reducing how often you have to use the device and leaving your legs or where ever you did it nice and smooth. It came with attachments and a charging station. It also came with a face cleansing brush that resembled something expensive currently on the market today. Make sure you read the instructions because they are very helpful! You can always to a test patch to see how it works with your skin. It&#x27;s going to react because it is plucking out the hairs. It is definitely worth trying if you are looking for an  epilator! I was able to try this product thanks to Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying the Braun  Silk-Epil 9 for free thanks to Braun. When the Braun Silk-epil 9  wet and dry epilator arrived I was very excited to try it out . I looked at all the exciting caps that came with the set  and charging stand with electric cord ,the cleaning brush, it even came with a pouch, to keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out right away I tried it dry on one arm it hurt a little, but definitely faster and much less painful than using wax or wax strips like I&#x27;ve done most often. A few days later I tried  the Braun epilator wet on my other arm with less pain than the dry arm.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure with more usage it would be less painful.&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s a great product.  Better than wax and so much quicker too.&lt;br /&gt;today May 13 2015 as I was using the Braun epilator, i did my left arm first to remove the hair it was painful but ok. then i started my right arm as i stopped to see hows it going i noticed some of my skin had been removed by the machine, i was in shock this even happened very unexpected. i went to wash my hands and it was burning since my some of my skin came off.&lt;br /&gt;i wasent pressing hard it just happened. i put a band aid to cover up.and put the epilator away. One arm hairy and and one hairless.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun I am getting to try Braun Silk-epil 9 wet and dry cordless epilator free. I believe this product lives up to it&#x27;s name. My legs and under arms feel so much smoother than when shaved. It is cordless with an easy grip handle which makes it easier to use in the shower. The wider head gets the job done quicker in less time which lets face it ladies that what we want when using an epilator. It has MicroGrip tweezers for the smaller hairs. I&#x27;m looking forward to spending less time keeping my legs smoother and more time in the sun. I forgot to mention as a bonus I&#x27;m getting to try the facial scrubber which does fabulous job.Thanks Braun and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I got to try this for free! I have blond hair and I have tried many epilators, waxing and laser hair removal. None have worked. The epilators that I have tried in the past did not remove the hair from the roots, they just tore the hair in half. Very painful! The MicroGrip tweezer technology does indeed deliver precision smoothness. It has been 1 week and my legs are silky smooth. You are warned that the first couple of times you use it, it may be uncomfortable and produce redness. I had no redness at all. There was no actual pain, just a little pinpoint here and there. I think that was because some of the hairs were too long. The facial brush with 2 speeds seemed too soft to do any good, but after using it my skin was so incredibly soft. The epilator comes with several attachments. One of them is used to shave the hair down to the proper height for maximum for epilation. I did use the facial attachment for my &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34;. It tickled, but didn&#x27;t hurt. 1 week later and it is still smooth! I have always trusted the Braun name, but now I want to shout it from the rooftops! Thank you Braun!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I recently was able to try this product for free courtesy of Braun through BzzAgent.com! It comes with so many great attachments,that can be easily switched on and off, anyone should be able to find one they like to use.It can also be used wet or dry!&lt;br /&gt;It does have the occasional pull to down right pain if you are not used to using an epilator or have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt; I have used another epilator before, and it was uncomfortable and left big swatches of hair on my legs so I needed to redo them several times to get it all, it also started coming back in only a few days, so it was not worth the time it took to use. With the Braun Silk-epil 9, I only had to go over my legs once, and it has been seven days and still no stubble, and they are still nice and smooth! Normally I would have shaved with a regular razor twice by now. I love that the one attachment is on  a pivot so it moves with the contour of your legs. And the other great thing that comes with this kit, is the shaver head. If the epilator is too painful or uncomfortable in spots, you just easily swap out that head with the shaver/trimmer head and still get a nice smooth shave! This is what I did for my armpits, because it was a little too painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came with a battery operated facial cleansing brush, which I have never used before. After using this one, I wonder why I never tried one before. It was simple to use and made my face feel soft and smooth. I used it with just water, but you can use cleanser with it too!&lt;br /&gt;This kit is so easy to use and is quick to charge up even right out of the box. The charge lasts about 45 minutes so more then enough time to remove all your unwanted hair before needing to charge again. I see myself using this product for years to come!!&lt;br /&gt;With the summer months and short/swimsuit season coming upon us, I would recommend this product for a smoother longer lasting shave!</li>
            <li> Received the Braun Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 9 for free for testing purposes (but my opinion is my own) and so far it has not disappointed! After charging for an hour I turned it on and first tried the body exfoliating brush in the shower with some body gel. This was amazing! I felt like I was giving a soothing massage and it left my skin feeling soft. Next I went to epilate my legs and my bikini areas. For reference, I usually shave my legs, but wax my bikini area. I have used an epilator previously maybe 10 years ago but it left much to be desired so I switched to other methods. This particular epilator worked fantastic! I am obsessed. My bikini area which I was myself regularly using wax strips was used to hair removal, so it didn&#x27;t hurt too much if any at all, and I was able to use it both wet and dry. I think dry worked better and it was quick without any need for precision. I pretty much kept running it back and forth until all the sensations of hair being zapped out were gone and everything was baby smooth. The light comes in handy for this, especially if using a magnifying mirror or using in the shower, probably my favorite feature. My legs aren&#x27;t used to being removed in this fashion so that did hurt a bit more, went back and forth three times like a razor and everything was removed rather quickly to my surprise. It did leave some red bumps so I smoothed on some soothing lotion afterwards and it calmed down by dinner time. I would imagine the more I use this the less irritating it would get as my bikini zone did not get red. I absolute love using this for miscellaneous areas I would have otherwise tweezed a well such as my stomach, toes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Comes with two other attachments and for precision and a body exfoliating brush which all fits in a white waterproof drawstring bag. There is also a brush provided for cleaning as well.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves skin baby soft after using and for longer than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;- Quick hair removal suitable for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;- Charges quickly and can be used for up to 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used dry or wet for in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;- Light feature comes very much in handy.&lt;br /&gt;- Beautiful design and white pearly color.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Need to do it several times or so for the skin to get used to epilation.&lt;br /&gt;- Takes an hour to charge, cannot be used with the cord.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: - Worth the investment for smooth silky skin. This is a product I will be using daily from now on to replace my waxing and shaving. A must have in my beauty arsenal.br /&gt;- Charges quickly and can be used for up to 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used dry or wet for in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;- Light feature comes very much in handy.&lt;br /&gt;- Beautiful design and white pearly color.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Need to do it several times or so for the skin to get used to epilation.&lt;br /&gt;- Takes an hour to charge, cannot be used with the cord.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: - Worth the investment for smooth silky skin. This is a product I will be using daily from now on to replace my waxing and shaving. A must have in my beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> The Braun silk epil 9 works great! For someone who has never used one before it does hurt but its nothing that I myself couldn&#x27;t handle. It comes with many attachments and the intsructions are clear and easy to understand. You can use this in the shower or with dry skin which I think is great!There are several attachments that come with this like the exfoliating attachment. Your skin will feel amazing till all said and done. I liked this product because the results were great. It has a wide head so that means less strokes and it pivots as you glide it. I epilated both my legs and I still had a decent amount of batty life left and it has a light that shines on you while turned on to make it easier to see what your doing. This product exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> It works really well and gets the job done even for someone who is getting used to epilating. I especially like how I do not have bumps left behind in certain areas like I would get from shaving</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion from Braun free of charge. My opinions are completely my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used an epilator before this, so I was a little scared. However, I am always looking for better options than shaving. So I tried it first on my arm and MAN did it hurt (and I wax regularly so I know!). I had some friends try it with me and some could tolerate it and some could not. However, the thing does work. Gets all of the hair on the first sweep, and stays smooth for about two weeks. Haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet, but I would imagine it&#x27;s about the same as using it dry. If you have a high pain tolerance, it&#x27;s a great choice for you!</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky people who was able to test this product thanks to bzzagent! This is an awesome product!! I&#x27;ve used products similar to this in the past, but no where as great as he Braun brand! I did not have to go over it more than once for my hair to be removed and being pregnant it was still not as painful as the others hat I have used in the past! I also love the light feature! Perfect for in the shower where dark shadows can get in the way! I definitely recommend this it&#x27;ll save you lots of time and money! No more investing in razors, and no more shaving every couple of days!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to braun I was able to try this product and I absolutely love it !, normally I wax my legs but with the braun it was fast easy and no mess to clean up thank you again Braun for letting me try this product for free!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve always wanted to try an epilator.. Not going to lie, it hurts so much if you are doing it for the first time... BUT, I absolutely am in love with the way it makes your skin feel. Its just like a whole bunch of tweezers plucking at the same time. I did it a couple times and now Im use to the feeling and can keep going. It works well with both wet and dry skin. It has two speeds. It also comes with a very soft facial brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but close !&lt;br /&gt;Works better on dry skins.</li>
            <li> This product is undoubtedly awesome. I have been getting my legs and underarms waxed for many years now. And each and every time while getting my underarms done honestly speaking I get tears in my eyes. There were times my underarms have had bleedings. But legs are definitely not that bad for me. While buying the Braun Silk Epil 9, I was sure I will use it only for my legs. And I was skeptic if it was worth the investment only for the legs. I was so confident that I will never be brave enough to torture myself and epilate my armpits on my own.&lt;br /&gt;But once I tried it on my legs, I found it pretty good. So I got little comfortable and thought to give my under arms a try. And yayyy I did it. I epilated my underarms myself. And it was not that bad. I will admit its definitely not painless but its not as bad if you have the habit of wax. It feels like a bunch of needles poking on your skin. I have never used a shaver so can&#x27;t say anything about that but if anyone is used to waxing than its definitely easier than that. And definitely better than the depilatory creams as it pulls hairs from the root so less frequency and henceforth less hassle.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun silk epil 9 free to review.&lt;br /&gt;First off the packaging was very easy to open, that was great.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the colors of the Epilator, I mean come on, purple an sparkles!!?&lt;br /&gt;  Now I did not enjoy Epilator head. Yes I had heard that it might me painful, but ouch! I tried to use it multiple times, but I just couldn&#x27;t.grow to love it.&lt;br /&gt; I absolutely believed the foil razor attachment. I used that sucker constantly.&lt;br /&gt;I also really enjoyed the facial cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> Very painful, tends to break some of the hairs but over all very good. Have yet to use it on my bikini line, it just hurts so much.</li>
            <li> Braun Silk Epil 9 is amazing. I had a Braun Soft Perfection for over 10 years, and it&#x27;s still working, but I moved to the U.S. 2 years ago and it&#x27;s charger was European so I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore. I decided to buy a Braun Silk Epil 9 after researching a lot online. I tried my new epilator tonight while taking a shower, and I can firmly state this product is cheap compared to how good it is. I didn&#x27;t feel any pain epilating my arms and my bikini line, which makes the product simply amazing. Thank you Braun for such an amazing product. I also need to mention that the epilator is made in Germany which is a huge plus compared to most of the products that are made in China. I&#x27;m super happy with this acquisition and I would definitely recommend this product to everybody!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun I received the Braun Silk Epil 9 to try and give my feedback. It was my first time using an epilator, I was excited and a little scare, I know for a fact that any depilation cause pain, I took my time to use it, and after 4 weeks, I feel comfortable given my opinion. I used the epilator for my arms, armpits, and legs&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;The whole product is easy to setup, ergonomic and easy to handle it, I used the epilator wet and dry I didn’t see a big difference I prefer dry just because is more comfortable to do in my room than in the shower, It charged in one hour and last for many times, I used a lot, and I still don’t have to charge again, because is really fast that I didn’t spend a lot of my time. When the hair grows back is slower and finer and is not painful anymore. Easy to change the attachments. I used the shaver for the bikini area, this product do the job well done and fast . Plus the facial cleansing brush is really soft and gently, works well in the shower, left my skin smooth and no redness at all.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I am really sensitive to pain, at first It hurts really bad, I had to be very brave to tried it but worth it. The good thing I got used to it that I realized that is not painful anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the Braun Silk Epil 9, It is really a good product, save me time and money. I don’t have to spend on waxing and razors anymore.</li>
            <li> I have a confession to make, after my first attempt with the Braun epilator, I harshly judged all those who complained of the pain. I fired it up just about as soon as the package arrived and tried it out on my legs - dry. And while it wasn&#x27;t like a thousand butterflies dancing on my legs, I thought, &amp;#34;this isn&#x27;t bad at all. What are these ladies talking about?&amp;#34;. Well, my tail is between my legs and my foot is firmly in my mouth after today&#x27;s experience with epilating post-shower. Good god almighty, that&#x27;s the pain you were talking about! It feels like exactly what it is, having your hairs ripped from your body. It hurts! But not unbearably so. It also works, which why would anyone do it if it didn&#x27;t, right? And for me it works really, really well. The pain actually reminds me of a tattoo needle, so if you are familiar with that feeling, you&#x27;ll know what to expect. I want to add that I have exceptionally sensitive skin - typically very dry with patches of eczema and slight keratosis pilari (basically gooseflesh that never goes away) on my arms and the back of my legs, and this did not irritate my skin AT ALL, which was a very pleasant surprise. I had some initial redness right after using but then applied some Philosophy body butter and it went away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;On a separate note, I have to say the directions suck. If possible, watch some Youtube videos or something. I hate devices that include instructions that don&#x27;t differentiate between models. Basically, the instructions are for a number of models and there are different check marks on a grid that are supposed to indicate what is included in your kit, but the way I interpreted it, it looks like I did not receive everything because there are a number of pictures for the facial epilator wand, which is not included in this. My feeling is that manufacturers should spring for individualized instructions for each product. Text instructions are also often helpful, but you won&#x27;t get that here - justa series of semi-unclear drawings - this causes confusion mainly with regard to the caps. Having never used an epilator, I felt like I needed a modicum of hand-holding and detailed directions, but alas, it was not to be. Thank goodness for Youtube. Still, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> it works great on thin hair and not so well on course hair. for course hair i would recommend emjoi 18. epil - 9 hurts like hell !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;if this is your first time using this it can make you cry if your skin is sensitive. if you can tolerate pain, good for you. update the day after using it . my whole body was covered in red bumps.</li>
            <li> I am a first timer for epilation. Apart from my first 2 tries of using this product, the pain was very minimal. Initially, I had to spend close to 40 minutes for my legs and arms. First tried arms, and was feeling a little pain, so moved to legs. And the pain is lesser and tolerable. It was like some one pulling the hair but one by one. But I have really small hairs, so, the pain was not that much. I used it on my husband&#x27;s legs as well. As his leg hairs were longer, he said he felt the pain. So, I recommend you use it on short hairs first if you are very sensitive to pain. Coming to Facial brush, I felt lot cleaner as I use make up almost every day and Loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: little painful at first, but bearable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts longer than I expected with minimal recharge.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used in shower also as it works for both dry and wet skin.&lt;br /&gt;Saves money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product as a promotional offer from BzzAgent, and I am really grateful. Thanks alot BzzAgent for introducing me to this new amazing product.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a free promotional product from BzzAgent. I would want to understand exactly how this product works before I bought it. This is a little different if your a person who generally uses a razor to shave. I have to say at first I was a little intimidated and it took some time to get us to. There was a slight pain actually more of an annoyance at first but after consistently using it for awhile, I LOVE it! Be sure to follow directions.</li>
            <li> I received this from BzzAgent for free to try and I&#x27;m in LOVE. It works great and quick. I had an older, smaller epilator and it doesn&#x27;t catch fine hairs like the Braun did! The facial brush is also great and makes my face feel super smooth!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product through BZZ AGENT and Wow I&#x27;m glad I had the pleasure of doing so,on to my review I was very scared at first as I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before so I tried it on some arm hairs and it wasn&#x27;t so bad so I preceded to do my legs,I did this DRY no water no soap and at first it hurt but the key to using this product is to READ THE BOOKLET FIRST,as it really helped me alot,I was going way to fast atfirst and if you do that it won&#x27;t grab all your hairs that&#x27;s why I had to go back twice on some areas once I realized going slow was the key I had no problems whatsoever removing the hair.I&#x27;m not going to lie to anyone it did hurt atfirst it really reminded me of the first time I&#x27;d ever tweezed my eyebrows the more you pluck the less painful it becomes also in the booklet they tell you to pull your skin taught that especially helped on my shin bones I think that area was probably the most painful for me but once I pulled my skin tight I breezed right threw.This product is Awesome and all the different heads that come with it are very helpful I obviously don&#x27;t shave my face so I let my son use the facial shaving attachment and he really liked it alot and I don&#x27;t want to forget the facial brush I&#x27;ve been using the Olay one for the past 4Years and this one seems exactly the same it&#x27;s a nifty little brush it always gets all my makeup off and leaves my face feeling great when I&#x27;m done using it to me its like a mini clarisonic at a fraction of the cost.I am very impressed and would pay full price for these products in a heartbeat I am NEVER EVER going back to regular old razor shaving my legs ever.I highly recommend both products to every women out there.</li>
            <li> Painful at first, but well worth the results!</li>
            <li> It is a really good epilator, I recommend it, I really liked the light because is very useful!!&lt;br /&gt;It is the best way to make the annoying hairs to disappear, you can be free of hair for 8 days or more!!😀😀😀</li>
            <li> I had no idea what this would do! So once I found out Braun wanted me to try it i started to look a lot online and man oh man did that scare me. There were horror story&#x27;s and tales or screams and bleeding and pinched skin it was awful!&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box (which was so organized and easy to open) and turned the epilator on, it even sounded kind of scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was brave and tried it. It hurt but not in a painful way... I know that does not make sense but you have to go into using this knowing what it is going to do. It plucks hair- no way could that ever be pain free. So if you know that you will be able to handle this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went very slow with a few breaks in between. I was able to do both my arms and both my legs in less than an hour. It has been about a week and im still not even prickly! I read online to use it everyday for the first time which I forgot to do but I went over my body again todsy and really no pain. I guess it makes the hair easier to pull out and not as many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how large it is, more done at once. However my favorite part is the very bright light that shines on all the hair you&#x27;re about to get rid of. It&#x27;s great!! It helps guide you and let&#x27;s you see right away what it&#x27;s doing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im a believer and I will use this as Long as I live</li>
            <li> I love it! I was SO scared first time trying it, it hurts like #%$€# under the arms, bikini line and tighs, not that bad on lower legs. But it IS true! It really does get better! And it thook away the annoying grief of having to shave every other day and buy expensive razor blades.</li>
            <li> My face is too sensitive for this product, but it works great on my legs and is awesome on underarms. It hurt a little at first, but now it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I still feel slight stubble on my legs but my underarm hair totally disappears and doesn&#x27;t come back for at least 2 weeks. This product is worth it for that! I only gave it 3 stars because I wish it worked better on my legs. I have to go over the same area numerous times to get the smoothness I want.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased this epilator. Great long lasting results, so much better than shaving. Please Note: You will have a painful experience the first time you use it! Power through it, you&#x27;ll be happy you did. The second time hurts much less and by the third you&#x27;re totally accustomed to it. I&#x27;d recommend using it while in the bathtub and with a small amount of shower gel.</li>
            <li> Received my elip9 today from bzz angency.com and let me tell you, it&#x27;s just like waxing your legs!! I am a cosmetologist, and I have been waxing for about 6 years. Never have my legs been this soft! All the hair is gone! Lotion after to soften them more and you are done! No messy wax residue and you are not sticky! If you use it with warm water your pores will open a little and it will not hurt as bad. I will be telling clients about this nifty gadget for sure! The face brush doesn&#x27;t spin in a circular motion, it just vibrates the bristles. The brush is soft, but can be irritating if not used properly. this product blows my mind! It is great. Very ergonomic, and the handle has glitter in for an added touch. Kudos to the creator for putting the light on it as well! I will never shave or wax my legs again! If you are interested in in bzz agent please go to the website and sign up yourself! Free of charge! * you do not get paid for product reviews* it is just a fun website!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It pulls out hair very well and I actually didn&#x27;t feel that much pain. I think the trick is that you need to prepare yourself in hot shower first and pull you skin to the opposite direction before epilating, as suggested by another reviewer. However, it usually takes me some efforts to pull all the hair off and I have to go back and forth on my armpits.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews and was ready for pain... but as far as that goes it was &amp;#34;Meh.&amp;#34; Now I&#x27;m not the hairiest gal out there, but this device really did the trick. It was almost fun! This is a great set too, because it&#x27;s got a shaver/trimmer included, along with attachments to do facial hair, and has a separate device that&#x27;s a facial brush. I only wish I&#x27;d had one of these decades ago.</li>
            <li> Save time and money (going for waxing is not cheap). love how skin feels. Had little irritation the first time with slight bruising, but that is due to my extremely sensitive skin, so, for example, you epilate your legs, if you aren&#x27;t sure how your skin will react, make sure to wear pants. Best tip is to do it before going to sleep after warm shower, as shower will make epilation easier and your skin will calm overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Painful at the beginning, have been using the item for about a month and it really gets easier. Very important tip: exfoliate (every part of your skin where you use the product), this will prevent from ingrown hair, I learned it the hard way. Scrub doesn&#x27;t have to be pricey, there are really nice items for under $10.00 in target, but I am not talking about body wash with scrub, it would not do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the after feeling as skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work for men.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of different brands before this one (Beurer, Emjoi, even the Braun Facial) and this brand and model is in my opinion the best yet. Charged completely within an hour and I was able to use everywhere in less than 40 minutes and still have a charge left on it. Being new to this, it does hurt but not as painful as I remember with the other brands I used. This was a deal as it was listed as the same price as older models. Loved the massaging cap and the included facial brush. This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product free through a promotion from Braun. I consider myself so lucky because I normally have to shave my legs or use the hair remover products which we all know doesn&#x27;t last but a few days and then we have to repeat the process. The first time I tried the Braun Silk-Epil i thought to myself how could this possibly be any better then shaving, but I was shocked to not have to repeat the process for a little over two weeks. It is a little painful but if you have ever had any thing waxed its the same kind of pain, which is tolerable. I also found every time I used it the pain got a little less painful. I will definitely continue to use this and recommend this product to all my friends. Thanks Braun for giving me the opportunity to try this great product.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Silk-Epil 9 and immediately read the manual.  It said to plug and charge the epilator before using it for an hour.  The manual was easy to read, it wasn&#x27;t confusing or didn&#x27;t have too many instructions.  The manual was to the point and used numbers to label the attachments that came with the epilator.  After I was done reading the easy manual and after charging the epilator I started looking over the attachments.  It came with an exfoliating brush head that you can use dry or in the shower.  The manual indicates it best to use dry and not on your face.  It also came with high frequency massage cap, facial cap, skin contact cap, and shaver head.  It also came with a white bag to put all the attachments in to keep it all together.  My first impression on the Braun Silk was great because it looked like they took pride in the product.  The color is a pearly white with sparkle/glitter handle.  The packaging was nice and sturdy and everything was clearly marked on the package.  The charging light on the epilator indicated it was done charging.  I started using the Braun Silk on my arm pit to test it out before using on my legs.  It wasn&#x27;t too painful as I had expected it to be.  There was an initial shock but then I got used to it and the pain went away immediately.  After I was done with the arms, I continued with the legs.  Again, the pain was minimal and I was able to finish epilating my legs with no problem.  I then used the exfoliating brush.  The exfoliating brush was nice.  The speed with good and the bristles were not harsh.  I enjoyed it!  My legs and arms were smooth and hair-free.  After I was done, I continued to clean the epilator.  There was a lot of hair and I used the little brush that came with it to clean the tweezers.  It wasn&#x27;t bad at all to clean.  Overall I liked the Braun Silk epil9.  I will definitely use it again and I will try it wet the next time.&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree</li>
            <li> works good but now it doesnt run as fast as it did. Goes very slowly takes lots of time</li>
            <li> I have given 3 stars for the silicone face brush it works really well . The epilator is little disappointing  dry  epilator is of no use whereas when using this epilator on wet body works little better .</li>
            <li> Okay - unlike the majority of the other reviews, I did NOT receive this item free.  Though I did purchase it when it was on sale for just under $100.  I have very fine/thin hairs on my legs, so unfortunately many of them break off rather than remove from the root.  I can&#x27;t fault the machine for that though.  I have never epilated before this, so I started with the &amp;#34;massaging&amp;#34; head on my legs and it was kind of like a pins and needles experience - not too bad at all.  When I did my underarms, I switched to the small attachment and that was more like a knives and razor blades experience.  It did do a much better job on that hair though as it is coarser than my legs.  I purchased in June, but I waited to write my review after I had used this several times so I could give a thorough opinion.  I have switched to the regular head on my legs and I feel that the quantity of hair on my legs is decreasing, and maybe my technique is improving because I seem to have less &amp;#34;broken&amp;#34; hairs.  I have also gotten used to the underarm pain.  It hurts far less now than it did the first time couple of times and I even use the regular head there as well.  I can&#x27;t speak as to other lady areas because I am NOT using this where the sun doesn&#x27;t shine, I just don&#x27;t have that kind of bravery.  I honestly have not used the facial brush, so I can&#x27;t speak to how great it is or isn&#x27;t.  I can do my legs and underarms without running out of power, and it recharges quickly.  I have only used it dry and have not tried it in the water.  At the price point I paid, I feel like the product is an excellent value.  Had I paid more, I would expect better performance on my fine leg hairs.</li>
            <li> Love the new larger head and attachments. For me, it&#x27;s the perfect female grooming tool. after using it for awhile it doesn&#x27;t even hurt. Make sure you are exfoliating, specially if you are prone to ingrown hairs. I bought exfoliating gloves on here very cheap and just rub my legs down before/after shower daily.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on me..hair grew back as fast as if I had shaved it....it seems to cut the hair and not pull.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this Epilator! I&#x27;ve owned another epilator in the past and this one blew that older one out of the water! I did receive this item for free thanks to Braun but I would totally buy this on my own! I loved the fact that I can use it in the shower. Yes, using an epilator is painful at first, however being able to use it in the shower its helps to minimize the pain. This product does a great job at removing the hair and keeping it away! I love the different options this epilator comes with. You can adjust the speed and the size of the guard. I really love the extra exfoliating brush too! Its made such a difference in my skin. With my old epilator I would get constant ingrown hairs BUT I haven&#x27;t gotten any ingrown with this Braun Silk-Epil. I have really dark hair so I need to shave every day, This epilator has been life changing! I am able to go days without shaving! That&#x27;s such a treat for a mom of a toddler. I have always hated that my underarms look discolored due to my dark hair, but with this epilator it removes the hair and my armpits are so much lighter now! I&#x27;m excited for summer and to be worry free about my bikini line too! I would totally recommend this epilator!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my Silk-epil 9 - what female wouldn&#x27;t be excited about a way to not have to shave multiple times a week? However, this was the first time I&#x27;ve used an epilator. So I read the pamphlet front to back and got started right away! The first time I used it, I was a little too eager and I did it on my dry bare skin - I hadn&#x27;t just showered nor had I exfoliated in at least a few days. Bad idea. It was pretty painful. At first I was a little upset, thinking that this would be my only time using it. I waited a few weeks until I felt like I needed to shave/epilate again, but this time I found this very useful link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.braun.com/us/female-grooming/adviser/how-to-achieve-best-epilation-results.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also watched a couple videos on youtube. This time, I used it in the shower (after being in there for at least 5 minutes) and I pulled my skin with my opposite hand to stretch it out a little right before going over it with the epilator. This time - PAIN FREE! It was amazing. I was able to go up to the second speed right away. My legs were a little red after so I made sure to wear pants that day, but the desk day the red was all gone and my legs are so smooth. The best part about it, I can go weeks without having to shave or epilate again! Yayy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the facial cleansing brush - such an awesome perk! I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li> I recently tried the new Braun Silk Epil courtesy of Braun in return for my review. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I had never done this my self. I found that this product can be extremely PAINFUL! Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, some of the areas on your legs you will find are less sensitive than others. The pain is similar to someone pulling on a sensitive strand of hair, then add heat. However, I found that when I stretched my skin while using the product that the pain was significantly less. This product is SUPER quiet. When I turned it on I expected it to be as loud as other razors and such I have tried, but this one just makes a slight humming noise ( This does not include my moans and groans ). There are also multiple different wonderful attachments that are included. This is really cool because you have the ability to change the cover on the Epilator, this will increase the space between your leg and the moving parts of the Epilator. While I was using the product I found that I had to go over the same area multiple times in order to get all hairs in the area. One thing I found that I thought was super cool was the brush attachment to help exfoliate the skin. I don&#x27;t think that many people consider exfoliating the rest of their bodies so I feel as if it brings this to our attention and reminds us not to neglect our  skin all over. The only down side to the brush is that its not intended for facial use. I will break down my pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s for you below;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Hair stays away longer than a razor.&lt;br /&gt;-Various attachments included.&lt;br /&gt;-Minimal sound.&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliating brush included that attaches to Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Pain, I have a high pain tolerance. But, this is a nagging pain.&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliating brush is not intended for facial use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would probably not buy this product. Its not that anything is wrong with it. I just am not patient enough to tolerate the pain and time that this needs to get the job done. I wouldmuch rather use my handy razor. Hope this helps! Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I have to start off by saying I have never been so excited to receive a package in the mail, every day I would come home and ask my boyfriend &amp;#34;Did my epilator arrive yet?!&amp;#34; I hate everything about shaving, I cut myself almost every single time and my legs stay smooth for about an hour. I am not kidding-my hair grows really fast. So, for the last year or so I have been doing laser hair removal treatments on my underarms and have loved the results. I wanted to eventually move on to do LHR on my leg but I could not justify the cost, almost $600 per session and you need at least 10 sessions to start seeing permanent results. I thought the second best option would be to try an epilator for long lasting results at a fraction of the cost. Lucky for me, I was selected as a candidate to test out the latest Braun by BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it hurts.. but I just grit my teeth and bare it because I know the results are worth it.  Since that time, my legs have been incredibly smooth and I no longer have to shave frequently.  The gain definitely outweighs the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light that helps you see even the tiniest of hairs which I find extremely helpful. And it glides very well with the contour of my legs. I love this product and I recommended to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for a review as part of my partnership with BzzAgent. After using this epilator a few times, I have to admit that it does a relatively good job with hair removal. It&#x27;s easy to charge, powerful, easy to handle and it whisks the hair away quickly. However, the pain was too much for me! I&#x27;ve used an epilator in the past, but this Braun was more painful and left little red bumps and splotches all over my legs immediately after each use. The packaging said that this is normal for some (and gave some tips to minimize irritation - they didn&#x27;t work for me), but it&#x27;s not worth it to me - I&#x27;ll stick to shaving. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin however, this tool would probably be a great addition to your routine due to its ease of use.</li>
            <li> Best epil and shaver I have erer ha!</li>
            <li> Great product , fast shipping</li>
            <li> It is so comfortable and I am satisfied with the results .</li>
            <li> Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Braun provided one of these for me to try for free.  I was excited but nervous, because I have a low tolerance for pain.  I read the manual completely before trying and tried at night because it said that there is usually a lot of redness the first few times you use the epilator.  I am not going to lie.  It hurt!  Would the pain lessen over time?  Probably, but I am not one to put myself through pain if I do not have to.  This kit came with a shaver head as well, and that worked great!  It gave a close shave and no pain.  My favorite feature is the light because it allows you to see any hairs you might have missed, even when your upper body is casting a shadow.  I have used in and out of the shower and it works perfectly!  While I did not like that epilator, I am happy overall with the product and do recommend it!  #bzzagent  #gotitfree</li>
            <li> High quality  and cheap price</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stink as the previous models, but does not give the silky smooth feel like the previous models either. I have been using Braun epilators(2, one in India and the other i bought here in USA) for over 22 years, and this does not even come close in performance although the cost is 3 times more! Its like an electric shaver, the hair stubs appear the very next day and i don&#x27;t even have much hair on my body. Thankfully i did not trash the old one! Am going to try and return this....</li>
            <li> need to try different methods of removing my chest hair. this is simply not working.</li>
            <li> Great Epilator.  My previous epilator died so I bought this one.  I thought my previous epilator was great until I used this.  Epilating is much faster with the larger head size.  It goes much quicker.  The battery life lasts long enough to use it on both legs and still have battery left over.  I was surprised to see all of the attachments.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Love it ,fast shipping 👍🏻</li>
            <li> My first personal depilatory system. Indeed, painful at first. Slowly but surely I am adjusting to this method of hair removal. Very nice grip, look and delivered as advertised.</li>
            <li> When I got home from work today I had a package waiting on my front porch. I was so excited because I had been waiting for the Braun Aquila Silk-Epil 9 to arrive!  This is my first bzz campaign and I&#x27;ve been looking forward to the experience.  At first glance, this product can be a little intimidating- it has a swivel head with small tweezers covering a surface that spins-  which is how it removes unwanted hair.  It also has a brush attachment for exfoliation and several different attachments that can be used according to the selected area.  I read the directions carefully, seeing how I was a little apprehensive about anticipated pain that could be associated by using this product.  I decided to try what I assumed would be a &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; area on my body, so I selected to remove the hair on my arms.  I switched the product to the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position and the spinning tweezers started whirring.  I placed the head of the epilator onto my skin, and to my surprise, the pain was minimal.  In one stroke, I had removed an entire swatch of hair (there was fuzz flying).  I continued this process until I had completed both of my arms.  I love that this product has a very bright light attached to it that allows you to easily see the areas that you may have missed.  My skin is a little red and irritated afterward, but the instructions state that this is natural and is the reason epilation should be done at night time.  So far, so good!  I&#x27;m looking forward to using this device again soon!  Cheers to a hair-free life!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those who don&#x27;t like hair like me. And yes i get this product for free from a brand promotion. It does hurt a bit cause it&#x27;s pulling hair out from your skin but after use it will leave your skin soft and smooth up to a month! I shave everyday but now i don;t think so. I&#x27;m very happy to recieve  this product and try it out. This is my personal opinion and I don;t get anything for saying this and this is my true feeling about this lovely product. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> As a general overview, I think this is a pretty good product. I&#x27;ll start with the positives: 1. It can be used wet and dry. 2. You can definitely get used to the pain. I used it only on my legs (don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m daring to try it anywhere else yet). I found that going over the area quickly first (to pull out a bunch of hairs) , then going over that same area again (slowly, in the proper way) made it less painful for me. Also, the more times you go over the area, the more that area seems to be used to it. 3. I think that the more I used the epilator, the more I would get used to the feeling of it. 4. When I first started using it, I thought I was doing myself a favor putting it on the lower setting. But when I finally switched to the higher setting, I felt like it was slightly more bearable. I would still reccommend trying both and seeing what&#x27;s more comfortable for you.  Negatives: 1. It was painful. I mean, let&#x27;s get real. You ARE ripping hair out of your body with a bunch of little tweezers. Like you get a sharp pain while epilating your leg and your whole body reacts you feel it in your hand too. 2. It&#x27;s not great at pulling out finer hairs. For instance, when I finally worked up the bravery to use it, I started on the top of my legs. I had to go over the area multiple times and it STILL didn&#x27;t get all of the fine hairs. I know the hairs weren&#x27;t too short, because I hadn&#x27;t shaved that part of my leg in awhile and it also was grabbing onto the bottom leg hairs way easier which was basically stubble. On the bottom half of my leg the hair is slightly coarser and it had no problem taking the hair off. However, it definitely was more painful.  While I did receive the item for free to try it thanks to Braun, I&#x27;ve done  research on epilators and it seems like Braun would be worth it to shell out the extra couple of bucks. If you&#x27;re going to rip hair out of your body, probably best to get a device in a trusted brand that&#x27;s commited to making the product as comfortable aspossible. </li>
            <li> Thanks to Braun I am trying this product out for free! Before using this product I would shave my legs and underarms a few times a week to keep my hair at bay. I am quite the hairy person and my hair grows quite quickly.  This product has made my legs goosebumps proof(usually with shaving if I get goosebumps it makes my legs feel as though I hadn&#x27;t shaved) I have gotten goosebumps numerous times since I epilated and my legs are still smooth, in addition I don&#x27;t need to give my underarm (I only did one, more on that later) attention every other day anymore. The only thing about this and every product like it is it hurts really bad. Legs are not as painful as underarms but both bring considerable pain. I decided to epilate one underarm and shave the other to gauge how long each stayed smooth. The epilated underarm is still smooth while the shaved one needs to be shaved again. I epilated 4 days ago and still going strong. The down fall is, can I bare the pain to do both of my underarms...... They say it is supposed to get better with time so I am going to keep at it.... I love the results but hate the pain.  The shaver that came with the epilitor is ok. I have coarse african american hair and I had to go over the same spot a few times to get most of the hair, but the trimmer is great and gets everything in its path!!  With the face cleanser that came with it. Love love love it. Even though I felt my face was reasonable clean, after using the product my face felt smoother and softer. A+ in my book!!  All in all I would recommend this product. I just hope the pain lessens.</li>
