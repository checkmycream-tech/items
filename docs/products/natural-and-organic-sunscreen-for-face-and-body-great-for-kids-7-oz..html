            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky like many comparable lotions that I&#x27;ve tried and is perfect for kids/adults with skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li>The mosquitoes here love me because I&#x27;m delicious</li>
            <li>The scent is rather pleasant and not overbearing at all.</li>
            <li>in fact, it is fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is fairly pleasant, too.  </li>
            <li>It provides good moisture and sun protection.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a great discount for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It smells good compared to the chemical repellents.</li>
            <li>Definitely good for kids.</li>
            <li>My kids don&#x27;t like sunscreen and the spray stuff doesn&#x27;t give good coverage anyway.</li>
            <li>I loved that this product was non greasy.</li>
            <li>Over all, we loved this product.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smelling and effective.  </li>
            <li>Worth it, perfect for summer</li>
            <li>Got this for our Caribbean trip to protect my 4y/o daughter from mosquito bites, liked that it included SPF so used it liberally day and night with good results.</li>
            <li>Just used it on a very warm, mountain camping trip and was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be getting more!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am confident it will work well!</li>

            <li>It comes in a nice size tube and</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even commented on the nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I really had my fingers crossed that this cream would work - talk about a perfect combination!</li>
            <li>received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re fair skinned, ever sweat, and plan to be out in the sun for more than 20 minutes don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream, goes on well and</li>
            <li>had a good safety seal and a prominent expiration date sticker on it.  </li>
            <li>had a good safety seal and a prominent expiration date sticker on it.  </li>
            <li>This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>That it&#x27;s sunscreen and bug guard together is a handy thing, too.  </li>
            <li>(To my knowledge, no one burned, either, but as I said, my own kids wouldn&#x27;t have burned, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice that it&#x27;s a 3 in 1, saves time.</li>
            <li>Still its not 100% effective like deet for me</li>
            <li>I really liked the idea that instead of caring two bottles around (one with a  sunscreen and one with a bug spray) we could use just this product.</li>
            <li>The smell of this is pleasant and the lotion suspension should be easy to apply.</li>
            <li>very nice and clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wonderful product to throw in the travel bag or beach bag, and know that you&#x27;re protecting your skin, maybe not as much as if you were using three separate products, but as insurance, and significantly more space</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I burn very easily and this stuff has done the job.</li>
            <li>Love that it works, that it is safe and no chemicals!</li>
            <li>Nope, more like 90-95% effective for me, and it wears out in about 5 hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of products and this stuff works the best and has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>We used your natural sunscreen and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this product as is effective in steering off bugs and mosquitoes when my family is outdoor.</li>
            <li>It has a light and pleasant scent and not greasy at all, so we love it.</li>
            <li>When you rub it on your skin it absorbs very quickly and it is NOT greasy whatsoever!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, the non-toxic ingredients, pleasant scent and lack of the &amp;#34;freshly embalmed look&amp;#34; make this well worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The moisturizer component is very light, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be much more moisturizing than the standalone sunscreen products I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its ok, It smells more like a citronella candle than anything.</li>
            <li>and I am bringing this product for sure.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend more highly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the 3 in 1 concept and the smell.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to sit on my patio and enjoy the nice weather but the bloodsuckers kept running me inside.</li>
            <li>For me, with my skin, it would be better at 45 SPF equivalent as I did get a bit pinkish</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my skin once it is applied.</li>
            <li>I predict we&#x27;re going to love</li>
            <li>Ok as moisturizer, but not as bug repellant or sun block</li>
            <li>/&gt;This does have a citronella scent to it (I notice that more than the lemon).  </li>
            <li>The scent fades after maybe 5 or 6 hours, but it would probably have been time to apply more sunscreen before then, anyway.  </li>
            <li>Definitely glad I got to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely glad I got to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>What could be better for camping with my son?</li>
            <li>I wanted something safe and non-toxic that would do the job without deet.  </li>
            <li>One of my grand daughters seems to be a magnet for mosquitoes.</li>
            <li>With all the illnesses and diseases that mosquitoes carry I sure don&#x27;t want them biting her.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen, moisturizer, and insect repellant.</li>
            <li>I spend many hours every day in the sun...and this product helps protect my skin from the suns damaging rays.</li>
            <li>On top of that, mosquitoes and deer flies have been quite the nuisance this year.</li>
            <li>So one of my biggest concerns is the most organic sunscreen I can get them.</li>
            <li>What could be better?</li>
            <li>the magic word 3 in 1 got me to give a try</li>
            <li>and i am glad i did.</li>
            <li>The view was awesome, and the mosquitoes totally left us alone!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and if you love the smell of citronella you will love it too.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is an all-in-one product.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>product does not cause breakouts on my skin, something many SPF products do.  </li>
            <li>so be sure to reapply frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my grand daughter is allergic to mosquitoes.</li>
            <li>They love eating me</li>
            <li>so be sure to reapply frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stuff actually works, and it smells great too!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The cream is light and goes on very easy.</li>
            <li>But I would like to post a review on my first impressions of the product: the bottle is a good size and the smell is inoffensive.</li>
            <li>It has a certain smell and rated SPF 30 which is good.  </li>
            <li>Overall, good product!</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful not like some other repellants.</li>
            <li>This is a cool 3-in-1 product!</li>
            <li>lotion goes on easily, and leaves no trace.</li>
            <li>I found the smell to be quite clean and refreshing as well.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild and fades immediately (we can&#x27;t deal &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;/strong scent products.)</li>
            <li>Very mild smell and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>The 3 in 1 makes it easy.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and am glad to have it now that the warm summer weather is upon us.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It went on very easily and soaked right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Being natural/organic (and Deet free) this combo is an easy 4.5, rounded to 5, for me.</li>
            <li>If one bites her the bite turns into a huge itchy welt.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so important to wear sunscreen, I&#x27;m 38 and do not want to look 48.  </li>
            <li>It soaked into my skin and made it feel smooth.</li>
            <li>You just get a light hint of the citronella and lemon which is of course to keep the bugs away.  </li>
            <li>Very similar to Bullfrog, great suncreen and bug</li>
            <li>and I think the plant extracts are helpful by providing vitamins and antioxidants that should fight free radical damage from the sun.  </li>
            <li>and I think the plant extracts are helpful by providing vitamins and antioxidants that should fight free radical damage from the sun.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lightly lemongrassy.  </li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant, it goes on easily without white residue.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t particularly need this, it is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>It comes out easily and spreads and absorbs quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not take a lot to cover skin areas so be conservative when you apply it at first or you will have more than is needed.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this product.  </li>
            <li>Even if the product did not have all organic and natural ingredients, even if I have to pay more money for it, I would get it because it is much better to use it than getting something else cheaper filled with toxics and harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love this product as it really works well.</li>
            <li>The skeeters just love me too much.</li>
            <li>but I did not get red, so that was good.</li>
            <li>I no longer come home full of bites and being in Florida that is a plus.</li>
            <li>I feel safe using it on my whole family.  </li>
            <li>But as best we can tell, it works well -- at least for bugs.  </li>
            <li>I also notice that this will moisturize the skin and leave it cool.</li>
            <li>When you are applying it smells pretty strong but by the time you rub it in the smell is almost gone.  </li>
            <li>This came in a nicely packaged box and the product was wrapped to where the top would stay closed.</li>
            <li>a lot of times moisturizers make my skin feel super oily.  </li>
            <li>I suspect that should I have had a problem they would have been quick to rectify it.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many sunscreen products that leave residue on your skin or sometimes leave it sticky, this rubs in well and actually moisturizes your skin leaving it feeling better than before you applied any product.  </li>
            <li>The lemony smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>The very first thing that I want to touch on with this review is how this product came packaged.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this miracle cream for it&#x27;s functionality to anyone who cares about their skin and wants to use a highly effective skin product.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly to protect my 3-year old daughter from mosquito bites in Miami and so far it has worked very good.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!  </li>
            <li>Love that its natural and has sunscreen and repellant in one!</li>
            <li>It will be nice to go outside in the sun without looking greased up and stinking like a can of OFF!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 3 year old twin grand daughters.</li>
            <li>I love that this sunscreen is organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>We love this product, all natural organic ingredients we can trust.</li>
            <li>I have 3 year old twin grand daughters.</li>
            <li>and I feel it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>my whole family uses it and my friends just tried on a international global trip and it worked wonderful..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this works, but it does -- takes the sunscreen right out of the clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this works, but it does -- takes the sunscreen right out of the clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed a mosquito land right on my arm and start to bite me not 10 min after applying the product.  </li>
            <li>Although it has many oils like Apricot, Sweet Almond, tea tree, and essential oil of Citronella, it is not oily at all.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and it does leave a slight moisturizing feel...</li>
            <li>I also love that the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t feel thick and pasty, like some sunscreens; it&#x27;s very light and smooth.</li>
            <li>whether something like this is effective, because you can&#x27;t really test the same day, with all the identical factors, with and without it!  </li>
            <li>My husband and son took this on a camping trip last weekend, and it did great as a double duty SPF and bug spray.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs right away and leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li>This product is lovely in that you have to only apply IT</li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>First, lets discuss the feel.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I would love to see the same product with a higher SPF</li>
            <li>you want to try this on your next camping or river/lake trip, I&#x27;d be sure to bring backup sunscreen and insect repellant.</li>
            <li>It is white and creamy like most sunblocks.  </li>
            <li>As a sunscreen it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Sunblock worked well - no sign of burning and because it was so hot, the moisturizer was a bonus.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>first thing to note about this is that the SPF-providing ingredients are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li>Completely deet free and organic.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>I first picked this up because I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the junk it doesn&#x27;t have (DEET, parabens, etc.)  </li>
            <li>I love having only the one product to put on in the morning, as opposed to three!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to just have to flip the cap, unlike other creams where you have to fumble with the screw cap with oily moisturizer on your hands.  </li>
            <li>It was a great SPF and repellent, plus the added moisturizing is great.  </li>
            <li>At first the insect repellant smell was strong, so at first I only wore it doing yard work.</li>
            <li>All of these ingredients are healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>In hot buggy climates, who wants to juggle potions where there is a one-stop shopping solution?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it doesn’t contain chemical sun screen and all the other ingredients are all natural and good for skin.</li>
            <li>My kids and their friends all used this for a hot, sweaty summer afternoon in our backyard, when the sun was hot and the bugs were high.  </li>
            <li>I strongly prefer using a Citronella-based product like this instead of the other bug repellents on the market that are full of toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>I also like the all natural and organic aspect of the product because my skin is getting older and the natural products make it look and feel better.</li>
            <li>While the product certainly matches the images shown, what you can&#x27;t tell is that it is a flip cap squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ll soon be moving into a house with a large (1/2 acre?)</li>
            <li>While we got many mosquito bites, our son made it through the whole 2 weeks without one single bit.  </li>
            <li>It also has a handy little applicator sponge that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a nice little squeeze bottle with a flip cap.  </li>
            <li>I am getting ready for a trip to mexico</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This makes the product very convenient for wherever you choose to use it.</li>
            <li>so I really like the fact that they come all together, making it much easier for</li>
            <li>The thing I didn&#x27;t really like about this product is the smell, which is why I gave it a 4 out of 5</li>
            <li>To me, I didn&#x27;t really smell lemon in this product at all.</li>
            <li>All I could smell was straight up Citronella, which I really don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, the sunscreen works really well too.  </li>
            <li>But if it&#x27;s not going to offer much protection, what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin, no irritating aerosol.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of trying this out on a camping trip, no matter how much I slathered on myself or my children and even my olive skinned husband we all got burned and bit up by bugs.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it for when he wants to go fishing.</li>
            <li>This is an important concern for me because I have definitely gotten rashes from sunscreens before.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This product works very well, and is a one step and on your way solution.  </li>
            <li>However, the sunblock effect was not that much...</li>
            <li>This sunscreen/bug repellent/moisturizer really works.</li>
            <li>but I think that not all mosquitoes are scared off citronella plus they REALLY like eating me alive!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t spend much time in the ocean or sunbathing</li>
            <li>have not had a chance to really test it with bugs yet.</li>
            <li>It has a nice citrusy smell and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>But what I am most impressed about with this product is the fact that it is also a bug repellent.</li>
            <li>Without deet, i will be eaten alive (more then 5x bites in 15mins before running back inside!).</li>
            <li>Its super easy and there is no clean up, i.e.</li>
            <li>So I live in St Louis which is currently hot and humid weather...</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong and is a combination of Citronella and Lemon, which doesn’t stay on the body for long.</li>
            <li>backyard that is overgrown with all sorts of underbrush, so I&#x27;ll be outside among insects a lot as I try to clean that up.  </li>
            <li>In a more open area, especially where mosquitoes are the primary concern, this will almost certainly be enough.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my 2.5 year old son and it has not caused his super sensitive skin to break out.  </li>
            <li>We went sailing on a clear, hot, sunny day.</li>
            <li>Did not get burned at all though I sure got dark.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that I didn&#x27;t burn as it was really hot that day.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing what crazy ingredients are in so many products that we put on our skin or ingest every day.  </li>
            <li>I was especially happy that my daughter  didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to the smell as she is extremely sensitive to artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li>Instead you just flip open the top, squeeze what you need and flip it back.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how smooth Younger Yu&#x27;s Organic Sunscreen goes on and did not feel sticky on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I felt that this product also provided decent sun protection.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how smooth Younger Yu&#x27;s Organic Sunscreen goes on and did not feel sticky on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this sunblock to anyone.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>The Citronella smell is very strong but all Citronella types of things usually are as that</li>
            <li>Use it for the whole family including our 6 month old.</li>
            <li>As far as sunscreens go, the scent of this product is MUCH better than the typical plasticky-awful sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and the fact that it is a sunscreen and insect repellent is even better.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product mainly because it is marked as 3-in-1 product</li>
            <li>This one is actually worked well on me and my wife, not very oily, smell is ok.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and with this product I have no worries.</li>
            <li>My son and I are both very sensitive to sun exposure and bug bites.  </li>
            <li>It doesn’t leave a white film like many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>-- you never feel like slathering on multiple products when it&#x27;s already hot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since my little girl was 30 months of age, it has strong fragrance because of the citronella</li>
            <li>Down side is that we had to keep applying it every time after getting in the water and after 40 minutes to secure its affectivity.</li>
            <li>It is a light cream that goes on very smooth (not like other heavy creams that I need to rub on for minues to get the white mark off).  </li>
            <li>We live in Florida and mosquiotes are evrywhere, this truly helps my 14 month old stay protected.</li>
            <li>I also like that it has several organic ingredients such as Organic Sweet Almond Oil, Organic Usnea Extract and Organic Aloe Extract.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say for SURE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a sunscreen that works well and is safe for a toddler.</li>
            <li>I went out last week and didn&#x27;t put anything on - just to test the theory that the lotion really worked - and was eaten alive (I&#x27;m talking 18 mosquito bites in a 30 minute time frame).  </li>
            <li>so soft *cough</li>
            <li>This one, however, is natural and organic with bug guard and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>And of course, it has natural ingredients if chemical overload is a concern of yours.</li>
            <li>The smell is a natural citronella and lemon smell.</li>
            <li>(If you are really going to be in the middle of the woods or where there are ticks, you would still want to use something containing DEET.  </li>
            <li>I look for natural protection for my children.</li>
            <li>Like it so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly natural and not a chemical smell</li>
            <li>Friends commented that they saw mosquitos buzzing around my head but not coming near my skin.</li>
            <li>all honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t use this as an everyday product due to the Citronella smell alone.</li>
            <li>but, it does not specifies what types of insects and one would assume any insect specially one of the most common insects outdoors MOSQUITOES!!!</li>
            <li>I expect this to last me quite a long time (though that will vary depending on how much of your body you have covered with clothing versus how much is exposed).  </li>
            <li>I expect this to last me quite a long time (though that will vary depending on how much of your body you have covered with clothing versus how much is exposed).  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this product and the fact that it&#x27;s a sunscreen, moisturizer, and insect repellent is a dream come true for anyone who lives in a sunny, humid, and/or insect ridden environment!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not strong, but it&#x27;s strong enough to conflict with perfume, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li>First it felt like putting a thick sunscreen on but that quickly absorb and actually not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li>For small baby with such sensitive skin, make sure you apply enough of it before and after getting in the water.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is indeed citronella and lemon; it&#x27;s faint and not unpleasant, and it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; about the whole thing was that the company seemed to have sent me multiple requests for a review within a very short time of receiving the product</li>
            <li>My wife and I went ton a trip where we there would be lots of mosquitoes, and we wanted to protect our 13 month old as much as possible.  </li>
            <li>We only used it on him since we only had one tube and didn&#x27;t know if we had enough for the whole trip.  </li>
            <li>but if you the person that occasional get bitten rather then eaten alive like me</li>
            <li>First of all this sunscreen is all natural and not filled with toxic chemicals ( almost 75% of all sunscreens contain something toxic).  </li>
            <li>I can say without a doubt that this is an awesome sunscreen, bug repellent, and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This summer has been the worse in many years for mosquitoes, I dread going out in my yard for anything.</li>
            <li>I love this as a safe bug repellent and the sunscreen/lotion is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>Obviously smells are something that is very subjective to a lot of people due to sensitivities.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it&#x27;s been registered as such since 1948.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.</li>
            <li>It is non irritating and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I really like that because like I said, moisturizers are hard to get right, especially when other uses get involved such as that of ant-aging components.</li>
            <li>We tested it in the primary and secondary rainforests of Costa Rica and walked away without a single bite.</li>
            <li>(Although that would limit its usefulness for us to certain settings, as we don&#x27;t believe in everyday sunscreen use.)  </li>

            <li> The mosquitoes here love me because I&#x27;m delicious</li>
            <li> The scent is rather pleasant and not overbearing at all.</li>
            <li> in fact, it is fairly pleasant.</li>

            <li> It smells good compared to the chemical repellents.</li>
            <li> Definitely good for kids.</li>

            <li> Just used it on a very warm, mountain camping trip and was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be getting more!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I am confident it will work well!</li>

            <li> My boyfriend even commented on the nice smell.  </li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I really had my fingers crossed that this cream would work - talk about a perfect combination!</li>
            <li> received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re fair skinned, ever sweat, and plan to be out in the sun for more than 20 minutes don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream, goes on well and</li>
            <li> had a good safety seal and a prominent expiration date sticker on it.  </li>
            <li> had a good safety seal and a prominent expiration date sticker on it.  </li>
            <li> This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> That it&#x27;s sunscreen and bug guard together is a handy thing, too.  </li>
            <li> (To my knowledge, no one burned, either, but as I said, my own kids wouldn&#x27;t have burned, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice that it&#x27;s a 3 in 1, saves time.</li>
            <li> Still its not 100% effective like deet for me</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea that instead of caring two bottles around (one with a  sunscreen and one with a bug spray) we could use just this product.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is pleasant and the lotion suspension should be easy to apply.</li>
            <li> very nice and clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a wonderful product to throw in the travel bag or beach bag, and know that you&#x27;re protecting your skin, maybe not as much as if you were using three separate products, but as insurance, and significantly more space</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I burn very easily and this stuff has done the job.</li>
            <li> Love that it works, that it is safe and no chemicals!</li>
            <li> Nope, more like 90-95% effective for me, and it wears out in about 5 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of products and this stuff works the best and has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> We used your natural sunscreen and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this product as is effective in steering off bugs and mosquitoes when my family is outdoor.</li>
            <li> It has a light and pleasant scent and not greasy at all, so we love it.</li>
            <li> When you rub it on your skin it absorbs very quickly and it is NOT greasy whatsoever!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, the non-toxic ingredients, pleasant scent and lack of the &amp;#34;freshly embalmed look&amp;#34; make this well worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The moisturizer component is very light, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be much more moisturizing than the standalone sunscreen products I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its ok, It smells more like a citronella candle than anything.</li>
            <li> and I am bringing this product for sure.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend more highly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the 3 in 1 concept and the smell.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to sit on my patio and enjoy the nice weather but the bloodsuckers kept running me inside.</li>
            <li> For me, with my skin, it would be better at 45 SPF equivalent as I did get a bit pinkish</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my skin once it is applied.</li>
            <li> I predict we&#x27;re going to love</li>
            <li> Ok as moisturizer, but not as bug repellant or sun block</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does have a citronella scent to it (I notice that more than the lemon).  </li>
            <li> The scent fades after maybe 5 or 6 hours, but it would probably have been time to apply more sunscreen before then, anyway.  </li>
            <li> Definitely glad I got to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely glad I got to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> What could be better for camping with my son?</li>
            <li> I wanted something safe and non-toxic that would do the job without deet.  </li>
            <li> One of my grand daughters seems to be a magnet for mosquitoes.</li>
            <li> With all the illnesses and diseases that mosquitoes carry I sure don&#x27;t want them biting her.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, moisturizer, and insect repellant.</li>
            <li> I spend many hours every day in the sun...and this product helps protect my skin from the suns damaging rays.</li>
            <li> On top of that, mosquitoes and deer flies have been quite the nuisance this year.</li>
            <li> So one of my biggest concerns is the most organic sunscreen I can get them.</li>
            <li> What could be better?</li>
            <li> the magic word 3 in 1 got me to give a try</li>
            <li> and i am glad i did.</li>
            <li> The view was awesome, and the mosquitoes totally left us alone!  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of it and if you love the smell of citronella you will love it too.  </li>
            <li> I love that this is an all-in-one product.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> product does not cause breakouts on my skin, something many SPF products do.  </li>
            <li> so be sure to reapply frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my grand daughter is allergic to mosquitoes.</li>
            <li> They love eating me</li>
            <li> so be sure to reapply frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stuff actually works, and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The cream is light and goes on very easy.</li>
            <li> But I would like to post a review on my first impressions of the product: the bottle is a good size and the smell is inoffensive.</li>
            <li> It has a certain smell and rated SPF 30 which is good.  </li>
            <li> Overall, good product!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful not like some other repellants.</li>
            <li> This is a cool 3-in-1 product!</li>
            <li> lotion goes on easily, and leaves no trace.</li>
            <li> I found the smell to be quite clean and refreshing as well.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very mild and fades immediately (we can&#x27;t deal &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;/strong scent products.)</li>
            <li> Very mild smell and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> The 3 in 1 makes it easy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and am glad to have it now that the warm summer weather is upon us.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It went on very easily and soaked right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Being natural/organic (and Deet free) this combo is an easy 4.5, rounded to 5, for me.</li>
            <li> If one bites her the bite turns into a huge itchy welt.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so important to wear sunscreen, I&#x27;m 38 and do not want to look 48.  </li>
            <li> It soaked into my skin and made it feel smooth.</li>
            <li> You just get a light hint of the citronella and lemon which is of course to keep the bugs away.  </li>
            <li> Very similar to Bullfrog, great suncreen and bug</li>
            <li> and I think the plant extracts are helpful by providing vitamins and antioxidants that should fight free radical damage from the sun.  </li>
            <li> and I think the plant extracts are helpful by providing vitamins and antioxidants that should fight free radical damage from the sun.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lightly lemongrassy.  </li>
            <li> The smell was pleasant, it goes on easily without white residue.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t particularly need this, it is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> It comes out easily and spreads and absorbs quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not take a lot to cover skin areas so be conservative when you apply it at first or you will have more than is needed.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this product.  </li>
            <li> Even if the product did not have all organic and natural ingredients, even if I have to pay more money for it, I would get it because it is much better to use it than getting something else cheaper filled with toxics and harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it really works well.</li>
            <li> The skeeters just love me too much.</li>
            <li> but I did not get red, so that was good.</li>
            <li> I no longer come home full of bites and being in Florida that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I feel safe using it on my whole family.  </li>
            <li> But as best we can tell, it works well -- at least for bugs.  </li>
            <li> I also notice that this will moisturize the skin and leave it cool.</li>
            <li> When you are applying it smells pretty strong but by the time you rub it in the smell is almost gone.  </li>
            <li> This came in a nicely packaged box and the product was wrapped to where the top would stay closed.</li>
            <li> a lot of times moisturizers make my skin feel super oily.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that should I have had a problem they would have been quick to rectify it.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many sunscreen products that leave residue on your skin or sometimes leave it sticky, this rubs in well and actually moisturizes your skin leaving it feeling better than before you applied any product.  </li>
            <li> The lemony smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> The very first thing that I want to touch on with this review is how this product came packaged.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this miracle cream for it&#x27;s functionality to anyone who cares about their skin and wants to use a highly effective skin product.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to protect my 3-year old daughter from mosquito bites in Miami and so far it has worked very good.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more!  </li>
            <li> Love that its natural and has sunscreen and repellant in one!</li>
            <li> It will be nice to go outside in the sun without looking greased up and stinking like a can of OFF!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old twin grand daughters.</li>
            <li> I love that this sunscreen is organic and all natural.</li>
            <li> We love this product, all natural organic ingredients we can trust.</li>
            <li> I have 3 year old twin grand daughters.</li>
            <li> and I feel it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> my whole family uses it and my friends just tried on a international global trip and it worked wonderful..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this works, but it does -- takes the sunscreen right out of the clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this works, but it does -- takes the sunscreen right out of the clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed a mosquito land right on my arm and start to bite me not 10 min after applying the product.  </li>
            <li> Although it has many oils like Apricot, Sweet Almond, tea tree, and essential oil of Citronella, it is not oily at all.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and it does leave a slight moisturizing feel...</li>
            <li> I also love that the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t feel thick and pasty, like some sunscreens; it&#x27;s very light and smooth.</li>
            <li> whether something like this is effective, because you can&#x27;t really test the same day, with all the identical factors, with and without it!  </li>
            <li> My husband and son took this on a camping trip last weekend, and it did great as a double duty SPF and bug spray.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs right away and leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li> This product is lovely in that you have to only apply IT</li>
            <li> I really like it!  </li>
            <li> First, lets discuss the feel.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I would love to see the same product with a higher SPF</li>
            <li> you want to try this on your next camping or river/lake trip, I&#x27;d be sure to bring backup sunscreen and insect repellant.</li>
            <li> It is white and creamy like most sunblocks.  </li>
            <li> As a sunscreen it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Sunblock worked well - no sign of burning and because it was so hot, the moisturizer was a bonus.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> first thing to note about this is that the SPF-providing ingredients are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> Completely deet free and organic.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> I first picked this up because I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the junk it doesn&#x27;t have (DEET, parabens, etc.)  </li>
            <li> I love having only the one product to put on in the morning, as opposed to three!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to just have to flip the cap, unlike other creams where you have to fumble with the screw cap with oily moisturizer on your hands.  </li>
            <li> It was a great SPF and repellent, plus the added moisturizing is great.  </li>
            <li> At first the insect repellant smell was strong, so at first I only wore it doing yard work.</li>
            <li> All of these ingredients are healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> In hot buggy climates, who wants to juggle potions where there is a one-stop shopping solution?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it doesn’t contain chemical sun screen and all the other ingredients are all natural and good for skin.</li>
            <li> My kids and their friends all used this for a hot, sweaty summer afternoon in our backyard, when the sun was hot and the bugs were high.  </li>
            <li> I strongly prefer using a Citronella-based product like this instead of the other bug repellents on the market that are full of toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> I also like the all natural and organic aspect of the product because my skin is getting older and the natural products make it look and feel better.</li>
            <li> While the product certainly matches the images shown, what you can&#x27;t tell is that it is a flip cap squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ll soon be moving into a house with a large (1/2 acre?)</li>
            <li> While we got many mosquito bites, our son made it through the whole 2 weeks without one single bit.  </li>
            <li> It also has a handy little applicator sponge that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a nice little squeeze bottle with a flip cap.  </li>
            <li> I am getting ready for a trip to mexico</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This makes the product very convenient for wherever you choose to use it.</li>
            <li> so I really like the fact that they come all together, making it much easier for</li>
            <li> The thing I didn&#x27;t really like about this product is the smell, which is why I gave it a 4 out of 5</li>
            <li> To me, I didn&#x27;t really smell lemon in this product at all.</li>
            <li> All I could smell was straight up Citronella, which I really don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, the sunscreen works really well too.  </li>
            <li> But if it&#x27;s not going to offer much protection, what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin, no irritating aerosol.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of trying this out on a camping trip, no matter how much I slathered on myself or my children and even my olive skinned husband we all got burned and bit up by bugs.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it for when he wants to go fishing.</li>
            <li> This is an important concern for me because I have definitely gotten rashes from sunscreens before.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product works very well, and is a one step and on your way solution.  </li>
            <li> However, the sunblock effect was not that much...</li>
            <li> This sunscreen/bug repellent/moisturizer really works.</li>
            <li> but I think that not all mosquitoes are scared off citronella plus they REALLY like eating me alive!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t spend much time in the ocean or sunbathing</li>
            <li> have not had a chance to really test it with bugs yet.</li>
            <li> It has a nice citrusy smell and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> But what I am most impressed about with this product is the fact that it is also a bug repellent.</li>
            <li> Without deet, i will be eaten alive (more then 5x bites in 15mins before running back inside!).</li>
            <li> Its super easy and there is no clean up, i.e.</li>
            <li> So I live in St Louis which is currently hot and humid weather...</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong and is a combination of Citronella and Lemon, which doesn’t stay on the body for long.</li>
            <li> backyard that is overgrown with all sorts of underbrush, so I&#x27;ll be outside among insects a lot as I try to clean that up.  </li>
            <li> In a more open area, especially where mosquitoes are the primary concern, this will almost certainly be enough.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my 2.5 year old son and it has not caused his super sensitive skin to break out.  </li>
            <li> We went sailing on a clear, hot, sunny day.</li>
            <li> Did not get burned at all though I sure got dark.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that I didn&#x27;t burn as it was really hot that day.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing what crazy ingredients are in so many products that we put on our skin or ingest every day.  </li>
            <li> I was especially happy that my daughter  didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to the smell as she is extremely sensitive to artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li> Instead you just flip open the top, squeeze what you need and flip it back.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how smooth Younger Yu&#x27;s Organic Sunscreen goes on and did not feel sticky on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I felt that this product also provided decent sun protection.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how smooth Younger Yu&#x27;s Organic Sunscreen goes on and did not feel sticky on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this sunblock to anyone.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> The Citronella smell is very strong but all Citronella types of things usually are as that</li>
            <li> Use it for the whole family including our 6 month old.</li>
            <li> As far as sunscreens go, the scent of this product is MUCH better than the typical plasticky-awful sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and the fact that it is a sunscreen and insect repellent is even better.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product mainly because it is marked as 3-in-1 product</li>
            <li> This one is actually worked well on me and my wife, not very oily, smell is ok.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and with this product I have no worries.</li>
            <li> My son and I are both very sensitive to sun exposure and bug bites.  </li>
            <li> It doesn’t leave a white film like many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> -- you never feel like slathering on multiple products when it&#x27;s already hot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since my little girl was 30 months of age, it has strong fragrance because of the citronella</li>
            <li> Down side is that we had to keep applying it every time after getting in the water and after 40 minutes to secure its affectivity.</li>
            <li> It is a light cream that goes on very smooth (not like other heavy creams that I need to rub on for minues to get the white mark off).  </li>
            <li> We live in Florida and mosquiotes are evrywhere, this truly helps my 14 month old stay protected.</li>
            <li> I also like that it has several organic ingredients such as Organic Sweet Almond Oil, Organic Usnea Extract and Organic Aloe Extract.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say for SURE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a sunscreen that works well and is safe for a toddler.</li>
            <li> I went out last week and didn&#x27;t put anything on - just to test the theory that the lotion really worked - and was eaten alive (I&#x27;m talking 18 mosquito bites in a 30 minute time frame).  </li>
            <li> so soft *cough</li>
            <li> This one, however, is natural and organic with bug guard and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> And of course, it has natural ingredients if chemical overload is a concern of yours.</li>
            <li> The smell is a natural citronella and lemon smell.</li>
            <li> (If you are really going to be in the middle of the woods or where there are ticks, you would still want to use something containing DEET.  </li>
            <li> I look for natural protection for my children.</li>
            <li> Like it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly natural and not a chemical smell</li>
            <li> Friends commented that they saw mosquitos buzzing around my head but not coming near my skin.</li>
            <li> all honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t use this as an everyday product due to the Citronella smell alone.</li>
            <li> but, it does not specifies what types of insects and one would assume any insect specially one of the most common insects outdoors MOSQUITOES!!!</li>
            <li> I expect this to last me quite a long time (though that will vary depending on how much of your body you have covered with clothing versus how much is exposed).  </li>
            <li> I expect this to last me quite a long time (though that will vary depending on how much of your body you have covered with clothing versus how much is exposed).  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product and the fact that it&#x27;s a sunscreen, moisturizer, and insect repellent is a dream come true for anyone who lives in a sunny, humid, and/or insect ridden environment!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong, but it&#x27;s strong enough to conflict with perfume, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li> First it felt like putting a thick sunscreen on but that quickly absorb and actually not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li> For small baby with such sensitive skin, make sure you apply enough of it before and after getting in the water.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is indeed citronella and lemon; it&#x27;s faint and not unpleasant, and it dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; about the whole thing was that the company seemed to have sent me multiple requests for a review within a very short time of receiving the product</li>
            <li> My wife and I went ton a trip where we there would be lots of mosquitoes, and we wanted to protect our 13 month old as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> We only used it on him since we only had one tube and didn&#x27;t know if we had enough for the whole trip.  </li>
            <li> but if you the person that occasional get bitten rather then eaten alive like me</li>
            <li> First of all this sunscreen is all natural and not filled with toxic chemicals ( almost 75% of all sunscreens contain something toxic).  </li>
            <li> I can say without a doubt that this is an awesome sunscreen, bug repellent, and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This summer has been the worse in many years for mosquitoes, I dread going out in my yard for anything.</li>
            <li> I love this as a safe bug repellent and the sunscreen/lotion is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> Obviously smells are something that is very subjective to a lot of people due to sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it&#x27;s been registered as such since 1948.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.</li>
            <li> It is non irritating and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I really like that because like I said, moisturizers are hard to get right, especially when other uses get involved such as that of ant-aging components.</li>
            <li> We tested it in the primary and secondary rainforests of Costa Rica and walked away without a single bite.</li>
            <li> (Although that would limit its usefulness for us to certain settings, as we don&#x27;t believe in everyday sunscreen use.)  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to use anything with DEET in it and the smell of most insect repellants just makes me sick to my stomach</li>
            <li> Although it is not yet mosquito season here, the spring sun is intense on my winter pale skin.  </li>
            <li> These items are very far down on the ingredients list.  </li>
            <li> However, I would use it for when I&#x27;m going outside and working in the yard, exercising outside or doing any other outdoorsy related activity.</li>
            <li> What a great idea to have an equivalent SPF 30 sunscreen, moisturizer and bug repellent in the same product!</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone looking for a good smelling, natural sunblock and mosquito repellent.</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone looking for a good smelling, natural sunblock and mosquito repellent.</li>
            <li> But the smell didn&#x27;t linger too long</li>
            <li> My family and I went on a long hike in a mosquito infested area.  </li>
            <li> I used it several times when I mowed  2 acres and didn&#x27;t get sunburned or bitten by Mosquitos or any other bugs.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old got a little sun burn on her arms and chest, so be careful.</li>
            <li> and you are protected from the sun, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s all natural, hate spraying chemicals on my body to keep bugs off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone had a single bug bite.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight scent, but it dissipates almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> Within half an hour I had nine bites and went back in to apply insect repellant that works.</li>
            <li> I can hardly step out my front door without getting eaten alive by hundreds of hungry vampire bugs.</li>
            <li> We bought this product for being a 3 in 1 and it worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> I am careful not to use sunscreens because of the chemicals within them.</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money not cheap either, I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> It is not very waterproof / sweatproof</li>
            <li> It is not very waterproof / sweatproof</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and completely absorbs in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and a family history of skin cancer, so I definitely do what I can to protect against sun exposure and sunburn.  </li>
            <li> My little one still gets bites once in a while when he has been out too long</li>
            <li> I used to always apply some sort of sunscreen in addition to my other face creams every morning.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not obnoxious like some other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Maybe other people can distinguish between the two</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall seeing it phrased similarly on other products.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have that oily or greasy feel as with some other products.</li>
            <li> However, at a picnic or the beach or some other outdoor activity, it would not be overpowering.  </li>
            <li> but this has topped off other brand</li>
            <li> I tried this on my one and half year old 3 times, he got pretty bad rash every time.</li>
            <li> We needed it primarily as an insect repellent for our 19 month old baby.</li>
            <li> One problem I&#x27;ve previously had with mineral sunscreens is that they leave a white sheen on the skin (I&#x27;m pale, so it&#x27;s less noticeable with me, but I can see how it would be a problem for someone with even slightly darker skin).  </li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that mosquitoes were indeed present in the rainforest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when I used this product on my family as our only sunscreen we all got burnt pretty badly.  </li>
            <li> The Younger Yu has the least greasy feel of any of the non DEET stuff</li>
            <li> Is the mosquito repellent 100% effective?  </li>
            <li> So far the insect repellent aspect of it has not been good for us, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I applied a thick layer of it and went outside to do yard work.</li>
            <li> Rather than hold him down to put a separate sunscreen and bug spray on him, we have been using this.  </li>
            <li> The SPF30 will not let u down.</li>
            <li> It worked well for mosquitos, black flies and bees.</li>
            <li> so less stuff needs to be applied on the skin.</li>
            <li> Well, I saw a special on the Younger Yu 3-1 Sunscreen, Moisturizer, and Mosquito repellent and jumped on it.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared about how this product would feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I like that I can use this and have little to no nuisance from them.</li>
            <li> My favorite component of this 3 in 1 product is the insect repellent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to get my hands all messy; all I have to do is apply it to the sponge and to the location on where I want to put the product.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to avoid harsh chemicals and/or deet.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday for my 4 days in Goa, even on my face.</li>
            <li> Sunscreens seem to be some of the worst offenders out there, so I was excited to find a product that promised protection from the sun and also provide moisture at the same time without having harsh and damaging chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Used this on a vacation in Goa, India, where mosquito bites are potentially a serious problem due to malaria.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find something that has sunscreen and bug repellent and is DEET free!  </li>
            <li> I usually go out for walk during lunch time and now I put this on before going out and don’t get sun burns or tan.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what I was thinking when I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> These are mineral sunscreens and are unlikely to cause reactions in the skin (unlike some chemical sunscreens, which I&#x27;ve definitely had a reaction to in the past).  </li>
            <li> The addition of lemon oil to the citronella makes it smell nicer than a citronella candle, and this lotion doesn&#x27;t have the nasty feel of most bug repellents and sunscreens</li>
            <li> As a repellent it did very well.</li>
            <li> The repellent works very efficiently.</li>
            <li> The main reason I would use a combo sunscreen/insect repellent is because I can use it on my face.</li>
            <li> (If you have had a bad reaction to Neutrogena Dry Touch sunscreen, check this one out instead.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IMy son attracts bug bites like crazy, especially mosquitos, which my son attracts like crazy.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money and it actually stinks once you apply it on your skin.</li>
            <li> The place is really sunny and terribly buggy--</li>
            <li> Some might find the scent a little annoying, but all of my other herbal bug repellents have a vaguely citronella scent, too.</li>
            <li> I have used other bugs repellent before and always ended up with few on my neck or hand</li>
            <li> The 3 in 1lotion by Younger Yu is an all-natural lotion that is a sunscreen, insect repellent and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So the repellent is necessary and it works.</li>
            <li> The next day we went hiking through the rainforest again, but I forgot to apply this repellent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product works or not as a Sunscreen, but as a bug guard is useless.</li>
            <li> This is completely useless as an insect repellant.</li>
            <li> I put this sunscreen bug repellent to the test in a mosquito prone area on an extremely sunny day</li>
            <li> and I usually use deet but hate the that toxic smell.</li>
            <li> I applied this 3 in 1 sunscreen, insect repellent, moisturizer before a session of yard chores, and did not experience my usual April sunburn!  </li>
            <li> I tried it three time to evaluate it effectiveness while working on my yard and all three times I was bitten badly by mosquitos.</li>
            <li> (We have really bad bug issues around our grass.)  </li>
            <li> and I hate putting on anything that feels greasy.</li>
            <li> But now when I go hiking I just apply this product because it has both an SPF 30 sunblock and an insect repellent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a moisturizer, insect repellent and an anti-aging sunscreen.</li>
            <li> insect repellent comes from the oil of citronella.</li>
            <li> It is SPF 30 sunscreen, insect repellent, and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I searched for some time to find a natural/organic sunscreen and repellent so it is a keeper.</li>
            <li> It truly 3 in 1 with Sunscreen, moisturizer and insect repellent.</li>
            <li> The product says Insect repellent</li>
            <li> Organic, non-toxic, and also an insect repellent.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its ok, It smells more like a citronella candle than anything.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready for a trip to mexico and I decided to buy this product.  This product smells great and the fact that it is a sunscreen and insect repellent is even better.  It comes in a nice size tube and the expiration date isnt until mid 2016!!</li>
            <li> I love this product as it really works well. This is ideal for traveling.  I used it and I was very happy  with the results.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I can&#x27;t stand a moisturizer or a sunscreen that leaves your skin feeling oily or sticky.  This 3 in 1 product does not do that.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.  It also has a handy little applicator sponge that comes with it.  My favorite component of this 3 in 1 product is the insect repellent.  I like to go hiking and the insects always seem to attack me.  But now when I go hiking I just apply this product because it has both an SPF 30 sunblock and an insect repellent.  The bugs now leave me alone.  The scents of citronella and lemon also smell wonderful. My boyfriend even commented on the nice smell.  It&#x27;s so important to wear sunscreen, I&#x27;m 38 and do not want to look 48.  I used to always apply some sort of sunscreen in addition to my other face creams every morning.  This product is lovely in that you have to only apply IT and you have the sunscreen and moisturizer in this one product. It&#x27;s very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;  It comes in a nice little squeeze bottle with a flip cap.  It&#x27;s super easy to open and close.  It&#x27;s nice to just have to flip the cap, unlike other creams where you have to fumble with the screw cap with oily moisturizer on your hands.  I&#x27;m going to Hawaii in about 3 weeks and I am bringing this product for sure.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product. The scent is not obnoxious like some other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ordered. It seemed to work well, I didn&#x27;t have any (no see um bites) and I didn&#x27;t experience any sunburn. I give it a thumbs up except I thought it was a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> This does a great job all around!! I really like it!  I couldn&#x27;t recommend more highly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback. I choose to review this product  in order to inform others of my experience.</li>
            <li> The very first thing that I want to touch on with this review is how this product came packaged. You know when you purchase a lotion and immediately upon putting your hands in the box, they get all slimy? Well that is not the case with this product. This came in a nicely packaged box and the product was wrapped to where the top would stay closed. If you&#x27;re a big online shopper, this is something you can definitely appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I want to touch on is the overall design and usefulness of this product. While the product certainly matches the images shown, what you can&#x27;t tell is that it is a flip cap squeeze bottle. This makes the product very convenient for wherever you choose to use it. You don&#x27;t have to worry about unscrewing the cap and then possibly losing it. Instead you just flip open the top, squeeze what you need and flip it back. Now another thing that I think is convenient about this product is that it comes with a sponge applicator. I don&#x27;t have to get my hands all messy; all I have to do is apply it to the sponge and to the location on where I want to put the product. Its super easy and there is no clean up, i.e., no washing my hands. Lastly, this product is a 3 in 1. It&#x27;s a moisturizer, insect repellent and an anti-aging sunscreen. Each of these 3 things should always be used when you&#x27;re outside so I really like the fact that they come all together, making it much easier for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, lets talk about the product itself. I was a little scared about how this product would feel and smell. First, lets discuss the feel. I tend to have oily skin and a lot of times moisturizers make my skin feel super oily.  To my surprise, this product did not make me feel oily at all. It soaked into my skin and made it feel smooth. I really like that because like I said, moisturizers are hard to get right, especially when other uses get involved such as that of ant-aging components. The thing I didn&#x27;t really like about this product is the smell, which is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 (otherwise it would be a 5 out of 5 because I think everything else is great). Obviously smells are something that is very subjective to a lot of people due to sensitivities. To me, I didn&#x27;t really smell lemon in this product at all. All I could smell was straight up Citronella, which I really don&#x27;t care for. Maybe other people can distinguish between the two but I couldn&#x27;t. The Citronella smell is very strong but all Citronella types of things usually are as that what keeps the insects away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t use this as an everyday product due to the Citronella smell alone. However, I would use it for when I&#x27;m going outside and working in the yard, exercising outside or doing any other outdoorsy related activity.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be great!  I use it on my 2.5 year old son and it has not caused his super sensitive skin to break out.  He doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting bit and hasn&#x27;t been burned while wearing it.  The scent is rather pleasant and not overbearing at all. The only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; about the whole thing was that the company seemed to have sent me multiple requests for a review within a very short time of receiving the product (I don&#x27;t regularly review that email account).  I found the communication rather overbearing but understand that they are simply trying to have people know about the product and get feedback.  Based on the communications I suspect that should I have had a problem they would have been quick to rectify it.  Overall, good product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to apply to my face to keep mosquito&#x27;s from biting me. It works! Absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Got this for our Caribbean trip to protect my 4y/o daughter from mosquito bites, liked that it included SPF so used it liberally day and night with good results. The smell was pleasant, it goes on easily without white residue. My kid only got about 3-4 bites on a 3week trip, so I would say it worked well!</li>
            <li> Works great and goes on like a non greasy lotion. I love the 3 in 1 concept and the smell. I only use it on my daughter though cause it&#x27;s pricey. I would love to see the same product with a higher SPF</li>
            <li> I have been battling mosquitos all summer. I just wanted to sit on my patio and enjoy the nice weather but the bloodsuckers kept running me inside. I really didn&#x27;t want to use anything with DEET in it and the smell of most insect repellants just makes me sick to my stomach so I thought I would try this and see what happened.  It smells really good, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and best of all - no bug bites. I went out last week and didn&#x27;t put anything on - just to test the theory that the lotion really worked - and was eaten alive (I&#x27;m talking 18 mosquito bites in a 30 minute time frame).  I will NEVER go out in yard without this stuff again. Oh yeah, the sunscreen works really well too.  I burn very easily and this stuff has done the job. In my opinion, as an all-purpose product, it can&#x27;t be beat. I will be recommending it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Everyone that sees this lotion (3 in 1) is amazed that all 3 essential products are rolled into one.  It is a light cream that goes on very smooth (not like other heavy creams that I need to rub on for minues to get the white mark off).  it works like a charm also!  We live in Florida and mosquiotes are evrywhere, this truly helps my 14 month old stay protected.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea. In hot buggy climates, who wants to juggle potions where there is a one-stop shopping solution?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion goes on easily, and leaves no trace. That tells me there might not be quite enough titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. These items are very far down on the ingredients list.  The main reason I would use a combo sunscreen/insect repellent is because I can use it on my face. But if it&#x27;s not going to offer much protection, what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label says &amp;#34;Equivalent to SPF30.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t recall seeing it phrased similarly on other products. Typically, it is simply &amp;#34;SPFXX.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The insect repellent comes from the oil of citronella. Apparently, it&#x27;s been registered as such since 1948. But let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;d never go out during the summertime into a dusky Memphis  evening with only citronella—whether from a candle or in a cream. The skeeters just love me too much. Actually, I suspect it&#x27;s the citronella&#x27;s heat and flame that does the job, not the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the non-toxic ingredients, pleasant scent and lack of the &amp;#34;freshly embalmed look&amp;#34; make this well worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try this on your next camping or river/lake trip, I&#x27;d be sure to bring backup sunscreen and insect repellant. Just in case.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product and the fact that it&#x27;s a sunscreen, moisturizer, and insect repellent is a dream come true for anyone who lives in a sunny, humid, and/or insect ridden environment! It&#x27;s not sticky like many comparable lotions that I&#x27;ve tried and is perfect for kids/adults with skin sensitivities. The packaging is wonderful and even comes with a sponge applicator. I found the smell to be quite clean and refreshing as well. I highly recommend this miracle cream for it&#x27;s functionality to anyone who cares about their skin and wants to use a highly effective skin product.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smelling and effective.  My son used this at an outdoor, mosquito-infested nature camp all summer.  It seemed to work.  I&#x27;ve used it for woodsy hikes and have not had problems with bites.  Gentle on skin, no irritating aerosol.</li>
            <li> What a great product!  First of all this sunscreen is all natural and not filled with toxic chemicals ( almost 75% of all sunscreens contain something toxic).  Another plus is that is 3 products in 1.  It is SPF 30 sunscreen, insect repellent, and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a squeeze tube.  It is white and creamy like most sunblocks.  It smells just like a citronella candle to me.  When you rub it on your skin it absorbs very quickly and it is NOT greasy whatsoever! (Awesome)  It is just like a lotion.  When you are applying it smells pretty strong but by the time you rub it in the smell is almost gone.  You just get a light hint of the citronella and lemon which is of course to keep the bugs away.  It will be nice to go outside in the sun without looking greased up and stinking like a can of OFF!  I think this product is great and I hope they make a regular sunscreen too.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The 3 in 1lotion by Younger Yu is an all-natural lotion that is a sunscreen, insect repellent and moisturizer. I like the fact that it doesn’t contain chemical sun screen and all the other ingredients are all natural and good for skin. The smell is quite strong and is a combination of Citronella and Lemon, which doesn’t stay on the body for long. It provides good moisture and sun protection. I usually go out for walk during lunch time and now I put this on before going out and don’t get sun burns or tan. It doesn’t leave a white film like many other sunscreens. Although it has many oils like Apricot, Sweet Almond, tea tree, and essential oil of Citronella, it is not oily at all. It absorbs right away and leaves skin soft and smooth. It is non irritating and easy to apply. I received this product at a great discount for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used it several times when I mowed  2 acres and didn&#x27;t get sunburned or bitten by Mosquitos or any other bugs. And it takes me 4 hrs to mow our sloping property with trees and bushes. It has a pleasant smell and it does leave a slight moisturizing feel...it is a moisturizing lotion in addition to being a sunscreen of SPF 30. It worked great and I&#x27;ll be getting more! Update: July 10, 2015 Well, I saw a special on the Younger Yu 3-1 Sunscreen, Moisturizer, and Mosquito repellent and jumped on it. Picked up 3 bottles. The mosquitoes here love me because I&#x27;m delicious and I hate putting on anything that feels greasy. The Younger Yu has the least greasy feel of any of the non DEET stuff *cough* skin so soft *cough*. Also gave the sunscreen a torture test. We went sailing on a clear, hot, sunny day. Out there for 2+ hours, no shade. Did not get burned at all though I sure got dark. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn&#x27;t burn as it was really hot that day.  Is the mosquito repellent 100% effective?  Nope, more like 90-95% effective for me, and it wears out in about 5 hours. If you want 100% effectiveness, stay indoors or move to where there are no mosquitoes. I&#x27;ve tried lots of products and this stuff works the best and has all natural ingredients. If mosquitoes bother you, give this stuff a try. And no, I do not work for nor did I get any gratuity for my review.</li>
            <li> We used your natural sunscreen and it worked perfectly. We needed it primarily as an insect repellent for our 19 month old baby. It worked well for mosquitos, black flies and bees. It has a light and pleasant scent and not greasy at all, so we love it.</li>
            <li> I searched for some time to find a natural/organic sunscreen and repellent so it is a keeper. As a sunscreen it works pretty well. For me, with my skin, it would be better at 45 SPF equivalent as I did get a bit pinkish but I did not get red, so that was good. As a repellent it did very well. While bugs did continue to congregate around me (I seem to be a big magnet), they did not land. That was a blessing. The smell is not overpowering...in fact, it is fairly pleasant. It does not take a lot to cover skin areas so be conservative when you apply it at first or you will have more than is needed. And, this is also a moisturizer. While I didn&#x27;t particularly need this, it is a nice bonus. Being natural/organic (and Deet free) this combo is an easy 4.5, rounded to 5, for me. Definitely recommended. Warning: when your friends see you apply it they will ask to borrow it.</li>
            <li> I chose this product mainly because it is marked as 3-in-1 product so less stuff needs to be applied on the skin. This one is actually worked well on me and my wife, not very oily, smell is ok. But it is definitely not for the baby. I tried this on my one and half year old 3 times, he got pretty bad rash every time. So if you want this for adults, go ahead. If you are looking for something for kids, try something else.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what I was thinking when I bought this product.  It was a waste of my money and it actually stinks once you apply it on your skin.</li>
            <li> We bought this product for being a 3 in 1 and it worked as expected.  It was a great SPF and repellent, plus the added moisturizing is great.  It smells good compared to the chemical repellents.</li>
            <li> I am careful not to use sunscreens because of the chemicals within them. This one, however, is natural and organic with bug guard and moisturizers. I got it for my children and like it.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to avoid harsh chemicals and/or deet. I love this product as is effective in steering off bugs and mosquitoes when my family is outdoor. It has a certain smell and rated SPF 30 which is good.  It truly 3 in 1 with Sunscreen, moisturizer and insect repellent. 5 stars for being all in one product</li>
            <li> As a mother of 4 living in south Ga I was so excited to find this product.  It is so hard to find something that has sunscreen and bug repellent and is DEET free!  And not to mention that it is also a moisturizer!!  it works great and my family does not complain about the smell or it feeling sticky.  We are always outside - day and night!  It works great for playing or working in the yard during the day and not getting sunburned and also works great during the evenings when the mosquito&#x27;s are out.  It is also great for some of our outdoor activities like fishing or hanging out to protect us from the sun and the bugs.  It does not have a strong smell and it feels great going on.  I will definitely be ordering more!  I was offered a discount in exchange for my honest review and I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love that its natural and has sunscreen and repellant in one! Great for kids!</li>
            <li> I really had my fingers crossed that this cream would work - talk about a perfect combination! Just used it on a very warm, mountain camping trip and was extremely pleased. The fragrance is very mild and fades immediately (we can&#x27;t deal &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;/strong scent products.) Sunblock worked well - no sign of burning and because it was so hot, the moisturizer was a bonus. The biting flies and mosquitoes were no problem. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to protect my 3-year old daughter from mosquito bites in Miami and so far it has worked very good. Will definitely continue using it</li>
            <li> Very similar to Bullfrog, great suncreen and bug repellent.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitley buy again!  Fast Shipping!  Smells wonderful not like some other repellants.</li>
            <li> I product is great. I love the feel of my skin once it is applied. You don&#x27;t have that oily or greasy feel as with some other products. At first the insect repellant smell was strong, so at first I only wore it doing yard work. But the smell didn&#x27;t linger too long so now it is perfect to wear to my boot camp classes which are held outdoors. So the repellent is necessary and it works. I no longer come home full of bites and being in Florida that is a plus. I also like the all natural and organic aspect of the product because my skin is getting older and the natural products make it look and feel better.</li>
            <li> It is amazing what crazy ingredients are in so many products that we put on our skin or ingest every day.  Sunscreens seem to be some of the worst offenders out there, so I was excited to find a product that promised protection from the sun and also provide moisture at the same time without having harsh and damaging chemicals.  The consistency of this sunscreen is great.  It comes out easily and spreads and absorbs quickly into your skin.  It has a slight scent, but it dissipates almost instantly.  Unlike many sunscreen products that leave residue on your skin or sometimes leave it sticky, this rubs in well and actually moisturizes your skin leaving it feeling better than before you applied any product.  I put it on before spending some time outside at a festival on a sunny day and escaped any damage or burns from the sun.  I really like this product and am glad to have it now that the warm summer weather is upon us.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> My son is attending an outdoor nature camp this summer.  The place is really sunny and terribly buggy-- and he hates putting on any type of lotion. Rather than hold him down to put a separate sunscreen and bug spray on him, we have been using this.  Aside from being a time and sanity saver, it works great.  The one day he &amp;#34;forgot&amp;#34; to put this on, he came home covered in bug bites.  It has a nice citrusy smell and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  Definitely good for kids.</li>
            <li> My wife and I went ton a trip where we there would be lots of mosquitoes, and we wanted to protect our 13 month old as much as possible.  This lotion did the trick!  We only used it on him since we only had one tube and didn&#x27;t know if we had enough for the whole trip.  While we got many mosquito bites, our son made it through the whole 2 weeks without one single bit.  This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product works or not as a Sunscreen, but as a bug guard is useless. I tried it three time to evaluate it effectiveness while working on my yard and all three times I was bitten badly by mosquitos. The product says Insect repellent but, it does not specifies what types of insects and one would assume any insect specially one of the most common insects outdoors MOSQUITOES!!! Total waste of my money not cheap either, I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re fair skinned, ever sweat, and plan to be out in the sun for more than 20 minutes don&#x27;t bother. I made the mistake of trying this out on a camping trip, no matter how much I slathered on myself or my children and even my olive skinned husband we all got burned and bit up by bugs.</li>
            <li> I took this with when we went to the Northwoods for 4th of July vacation. Easy to apply, non-greasy, great smelling and kept mosquitos away. Love that it&#x27;s all natural, hate spraying chemicals on my body to keep bugs off.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I put this sunscreen bug repellent to the test in a mosquito prone area on an extremely sunny day and I must say that I was impressed.  No sunburn and the bugs totally left me alone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet, so I can&#x27;t give it five stars. But I would like to post a review on my first impressions of the product: the bottle is a good size and the smell is inoffensive. My kids don&#x27;t like sunscreen and the spray stuff doesn&#x27;t give good coverage anyway. The smell of this is pleasant and the lotion suspension should be easy to apply. And of course, it has natural ingredients if chemical overload is a concern of yours. I predict we&#x27;re going to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review once we&#x27;ve had a chance to use it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and works great to prevent sunburn and insect bites.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ok as moisturizer, but not as bug repellant or sun block</li>
            <li> Love this product! Use it for the whole family including our 6 month old. My husband loves it for when he wants to go fishing. Works amazing! The smell is a natural citronella and lemon smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream, goes on well and SPF works. So far the insect repellent aspect of it has not been good for us, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> A MOTHER LOVES IT FOR HER AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and a family history of skin cancer, so I definitely do what I can to protect against sun exposure and sunburn.  Also, I&#x27;ll soon be moving into a house with a large (1/2 acre?) backyard that is overgrown with all sorts of underbrush, so I&#x27;ll be outside among insects a lot as I try to clean that up.  I like that this product serves multiple purposes -- you never feel like slathering on multiple products when it&#x27;s already hot out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to note about this is that the SPF-providing ingredients are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.  These are mineral sunscreens and are unlikely to cause reactions in the skin (unlike some chemical sunscreens, which I&#x27;ve definitely had a reaction to in the past).  One problem I&#x27;ve previously had with mineral sunscreens is that they leave a white sheen on the skin (I&#x27;m pale, so it&#x27;s less noticeable with me, but I can see how it would be a problem for someone with even slightly darker skin).  Well, this product absorbs quite well and without leaving visible residue.  (I tried it all over my arms.)  Also, after using for awhile, this did NOT cause a rash.  This is an important concern for me because I have definitely gotten rashes from sunscreens before.  (If you have had a bad reaction to Neutrogena Dry Touch sunscreen, check this one out instead.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does have a citronella scent to it (I notice that more than the lemon).  It&#x27;s not strong, but it&#x27;s strong enough to conflict with perfume, so keep that in mind.  However, at a picnic or the beach or some other outdoor activity, it would not be overpowering.  The scent fades after maybe 5 or 6 hours, but it would probably have been time to apply more sunscreen before then, anyway.  (If you are really going to be in the middle of the woods or where there are ticks, you would still want to use something containing DEET.  In a more open area, especially where mosquitoes are the primary concern, this will almost certainly be enough.  Anyway, the citronella scent is helping to repel mosquitoes so you would want that to be somewhat prominent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this moisturizing without being greasy.  I find it non-irritating and I think the plant extracts are helpful by providing vitamins and antioxidants that should fight free radical damage from the sun.  The extracts should also help prevent bacterial growth, extending the shelf life of the product.  If you happen to get any on your clothes, try rubbing the area with pantyhose.  I don&#x27;t know why this works, but it does -- takes the sunscreen right out of the clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This had a good safety seal and a prominent expiration date sticker on it.  (It&#x27;s a flip-top squeeze tube so application is convenient.)  I expect this to last me quite a long time (though that will vary depending on how much of your body you have covered with clothing versus how much is exposed).  Definitely glad I got to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.ronella scent is helping to repel mosquitoes so you would want that to be somewhat prominent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this moisturizing without being greasy.

            <li> Organic, non-toxic, and also an insect repellent. What could be better for camping with my son?</li>
            <li> So convenient. Very mild smell and non-greasy. My little one still gets bites once in a while when he has been out too long but I don&#x27;t think there is any bug spray out there that will work for that.</li>
            <li> This is a cool 3-in-1 product! Worth it, perfect for summer</li>
            <li> I ordered this for our fishing trips. The 3 in 1 makes it easy. Just spray one product and I&#x27;m done. A great plus is that it is organic. I have very sensitive skin and with this product I have no worries. I would recommend this product with 5 stars</li>
            <li> This product is great! I bought this for my 3 year old twin grand daughters. I wanted something safe and non-toxic that would do the job without deet.  One of my grand daughters seems to be a magnet for mosquitoes. With all the illnesses and diseases that mosquitoes carry I sure don&#x27;t want them biting her. This product works! It not only keeps the mosquitoes from biting them, but is a sunscreen as well. As an added plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for their skin. I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, moisturizer, and insect repellant. Completely deet free and organic. I have been doing a lot of garden work and this product takes care of all 3 the issues that tend to bother me on a daily basis. I spend many hours every day in the sun...and this product helps protect my skin from the suns damaging rays. On top of that, mosquitoes and deer flies have been quite the nuisance this year. I can hardly step out my front door without getting eaten alive by hundreds of hungry vampire bugs. I like that I can use this and have little to no nuisance from them. Also, with working in the dirt it dries the skin out. This keeps my skin from drying and cracking. All in all a terrific product.</li>
            <li> I look for natural protection for my children. So one of my biggest concerns is the most organic sunscreen I can get them. This sunscreen is organic and provides 3 in 1 protection. IMy son attracts bug bites like crazy, especially mosquitos, which my son attracts like crazy. You simply put it on and bugs be gone and you are protected from the sun, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. What could be better?</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is stunningly great, i planned a road trip and i needed a sunscreen i stumbled upon this product the magic word 3 in 1 got me to give a try and i am glad i did. I have returned from my trip without any sunburn or mosquito bite. I have used other bugs repellent before and always ended up with few on my neck or hand but this has topped off other brand i tried i am never going back. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I can say without a doubt that this is an awesome sunscreen, bug repellent, and moisturizer.  My family and I went on a long hike in a mosquito infested area.  The view was awesome, and the mosquitoes totally left us alone!  I would highly recommend this sunblock to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it since my little girl was 30 months of age, it has strong fragrance because of the citronella so I avoid using it on her face but it has helped keep the mosquitoes away from her legs and arms. I&#x27;ve used this product on my trips to Asia and it has worked!</li>
            <li> This is great as described. Does the job.</li>
            <li> I loved that this product was non greasy. It went on very easily and soaked right into my skin.  However, when I used this product on my family as our only sunscreen we all got burnt pretty badly.  I even reapplied it several times and still got burnt.  I also noticed a mosquito land right on my arm and start to bite me not 10 min after applying the product.  (I used a different bug spray after that).  Overall as a sunscreen it might work if you reapply it every 15 min, but I think as a bug spray I would use something else.</li>
            <li> What a great idea to have an equivalent SPF 30 sunscreen, moisturizer and bug repellent in the same product! I go hiking often in the mountain and like the idea of getting all the coverage I need in one product versus 3 different products. The cream is light and goes on very easy. The lotion smells like Citronella and Lemon. I also like that it has several organic ingredients such as Organic Sweet Almond Oil, Organic Usnea Extract and Organic Aloe Extract. I strongly prefer using a Citronella-based product like this instead of the other bug repellents on the market that are full of toxic chemicals. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product</li>
            <li> Like it so far. The lemony smell dissipates quickly. Haven&#x27;t had encounters with mosquitos yet.</li>
            <li> Exquisite and excellent</li>
            <li> I love that this sunscreen is organic and all natural. I feel safe using it on my whole family.  I love the smell of it and if you love the smell of citronella you will love it too.  Works really well!</li>
            <li> This is completely useless as an insect repellant. I applied a thick layer of it and went outside to do yard work. Within half an hour I had nine bites and went back in to apply insect repellant that works.</li>
            <li> I love that this is an all-in-one product.  My son and I are both very sensitive to sun exposure and bug bites.  This product works very well, and is a one step and on your way solution.  I am so glad I tried it.  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> We love this product, all natural organic ingredients we can trust. Even if the product did not have all organic and natural ingredients, even if I have to pay more money for it, I would get it because it is much better to use it than getting something else cheaper filled with toxics and harmful chemicals. Over all, we loved this product. We all used it in and out of the water. Down side is that we had to keep applying it every time after getting in the water and after 40 minutes to secure its affectivity. For small baby with such sensitive skin, make sure you apply enough of it before and after getting in the water. My 9 year old got a little sun burn on her arms and chest, so be careful.</li>
            <li> The repellent works very efficiently. However, the sunblock effect was not that much...</li>
            <li> All of these ingredients are healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or my sensitive nose. The addition of lemon oil to the citronella makes it smell nicer than a citronella candle, and this lotion doesn&#x27;t have the nasty feel of most bug repellents and sunscreens</li>
            <li> I first picked this up because I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the junk it doesn&#x27;t have (DEET, parabens, etc.)  That it&#x27;s sunscreen and bug guard together is a handy thing, too.  (Although that would limit its usefulness for us to certain settings, as we don&#x27;t believe in everyday sunscreen use.)  The moisturizer is not something I would personally be looking for in a product like this, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say for SURE whether something like this is effective, because you can&#x27;t really test the same day, with all the identical factors, with and without it!  But as best we can tell, it works well -- at least for bugs.  (My kids were already heavily suntanned, so I can&#x27;t really weigh in well on the sunscreen.)  My kids and their friends all used this for a hot, sweaty summer afternoon in our backyard, when the sun was hot and the bugs were high.  (We have really bad bug issues around our grass.)  I don&#x27;t think anyone had a single bug bite.  (To my knowledge, no one burned, either, but as I said, my own kids wouldn&#x27;t have burned, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fairly pleasant, too.  It&#x27;s clearly natural and not a chemical smell and it&#x27;s lightly lemongrassy.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Although it is not yet mosquito season here, the spring sun is intense on my winter pale skin.  I applied this 3 in 1 sunscreen, insect repellent, moisturizer before a session of yard chores, and did not experience my usual April sunburn!  The fragrance is indeed citronella and lemon; it&#x27;s faint and not unpleasant, and it dissipates quickly.  The cream is thick and completely absorbs in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not cause breakouts on my skin, something many SPF products do.  The moisturizer component is very light, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be much more moisturizing than the standalone sunscreen products I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product to throw in the travel bag or beach bag, and know that you&#x27;re protecting your skin, maybe not as much as if you were using three separate products, but as insurance, and significantly more space saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using this daily during our mosquito infested outside activities later in the summer, and consider the price to be a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
            <li> I have use this quite, a lot know. I only use sunscreen when I go hiking or spend lots of time where there lots of sun. The SPF30 will not let u down. I walk around grasslands where there no shade or trees. And I don&#x27;t sew any sighs of it getting darker. I also notice that this will moisturize the skin and leave it cool. when I enter a forest I don&#x27;t get any insect bites.</li>
            <li> Great smell and works great! Nice that it&#x27;s a 3 in 1, saves time. Will use it again camping this year!</li>
            <li> I love this as a safe bug repellent and the sunscreen/lotion is an added bonus.  This summer has been the worse in many years for mosquitoes, I dread going out in my yard for anything. This product works great, I can even put it on my dogs face without worry, the mosquitoes have been relentless on the dogs too. Love that it works, that it is safe and no chemicals!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how smooth Younger Yu&#x27;s Organic Sunscreen goes on and did not feel sticky on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the directions and apply it generously and reapply after about 1 hour then the coverage is great. It is not very waterproof / sweatproof so be sure to reapply frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone looking for a good smelling, natural sunblock and mosquito repellent.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have 3 year old twin grand daughters. It&#x27;s hard to find a sunscreen that works well and is safe for a toddler. But what I am most impressed about with this product is the fact that it is also a bug repellent. One of my grand daughter is allergic to mosquitoes. If one bites her the bite turns into a huge itchy welt. This sunscreen/bug repellent/moisturizer really works. I am so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> So I live in St Louis which is currently hot and humid weather...perfect hunting ground for mossies! They love eating me and I usually use deet but hate the that toxic smell. Without deet, i will be eaten alive (more then 5x bites in 15mins before running back inside!). Got recommended to  trial this out. First it felt like putting a thick sunscreen on but that quickly absorb and actually not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Out for 45mins walks in the woods and did get bitten only once. Maybe I didn&#x27;t apply it properly at that spot but I think that not all mosquitoes are scared off citronella plus they REALLY like eating me alive!&lt;br /&gt; Still its not 100% effective like deet for me but if you the person that occasional get bitten rather then eaten alive like me then this one is for you! rgds Pete L</li>
            <li> Used this on a vacation in Goa, India, where mosquito bites are potentially a serious problem due to malaria. Friends commented that they saw mosquitos buzzing around my head but not coming near my skin. I saw tons of mosquitos but didn&#x27;t get any bites. So these same friends decided to set aside their DEET products and borrow some of this product, with the extra bonus of sun protection and moisturizing. I used this everyday for my 4 days in Goa, even on my face. I applied it about 2-3 times a day because my sense was that once the smell wears off, the effectiveness might be wearing off (though that&#x27;s just my intuition, not a scientific fact!). I didn&#x27;t spend much time in the ocean or sunbathing but I took lots of walks and I felt that this product also provided decent sun protection. I didn&#x27;t have any suntan lines (which is just how I like it). Some might find the scent a little annoying, but all of my other herbal bug repellents have a vaguely citronella scent, too. As far as sunscreens go, the scent of this product is MUCH better than the typical plasticky-awful sunscreen smell. So I will keep using this and I feel it&#x27;s worth the cost. I think the friends who borrowed mine will also be picking this stuff up.  It would be perfect for working in the yard at home as well.</li>
            <li> have not had a chance to really test it with bugs yet. Lotion and sunscreen work well</li>

            <li> We used this product during our recent trip to Belize where mosquitos are everywhere even during the day hours. I really liked the idea that instead of caring two bottles around (one with a  sunscreen and one with a bug spray) we could use just this product. It worked very good for us even during our trip to the jungle where you can see clouds of mosquitos around. The fragrance is light and pleasant. I was especially happy that my daughter  didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to the smell as she is extremely sensitive to artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li> awesome. very nice and clean</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best... my whole family uses it and my friends just tried on a international global trip and it worked wonderful.. its a great moisturizer too.. i highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> My husband and son took this on a camping trip last weekend, and it did great as a double duty SPF and bug spray.  I always worry about putting chemical sprays on my son, and like that this is organic.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a Deet equivalent that was non-toxic and non-staining and found this product. We tested it in the primary and secondary rainforests of Costa Rica and walked away without a single bite. The next day we went hiking through the rainforest again, but I forgot to apply this repellent. I learned the hard way that mosquitoes were indeed present in the rainforest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll be using this everywhere we plan on traveling when mosquitoes are present, from Belize to Croatia to Tanzania and Brazil. The stuff actually works, and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Works great and does its job!!!</li>
            <li> I love having only the one product to put on in the morning, as opposed to three! :) I also love that the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t feel thick and pasty, like some sunscreens; it&#x27;s very light and smooth. It feels like it&#x27;s not there, but it does the job! I wore the 3 in 1 outside all day in alternating sun and shade and did not get burned. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out in brighter sun-- I am confident it will work well! The smell is nice too, lemony!!!! I recommend this product highly.</li>
