            <li>wearing- a- wig* kind of way.</li>

            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig in November, and i must say i love it.</li>
            <li>The top layer is must shorter than the rest of the wig and therefore also gives the top of the head more volumn.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m glad i bought it.</li>
            <li>This wig can be used and will be for maney more party&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>While brushing the hair with a hair brush I discovered that the brush almost held more hair than the wig itself...</li>
            <li>There is nothing you can get better for this price.</li>
            <li>She says there are just too many bangs.  </li>
            <li>Also these wigs come with a free wig cap which has a netting on it so you can attach the wig right to the wig cap for more security, amazing idea!</li>
            <li>wig is very beautiful and just the right length, it looks so natural!!</li>
            <li>The hair was really long, as I&#x27;m tall, I was impressed.</li>
            <li>This was the first wig I bought, but it was a good choice.</li>
            <li>It does shed just a little bit but its still in great condition and great quality.</li>
            <li>AllNice4Yu has waaay better ones for cheap.</li>
            <li>The hair looks natural and the style looks great.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li>this wig is very natural looking, color is beautiful and this is my very first wig I was buying for halloween</li>
            <li>, you couldnt see my wig cap or neck through it and it was easy to brush.</li>
            <li>very worth it</li>
            <li>I loved this wig with the exception the color was more of an auburn, not anything remotely like a brown or light brown.</li>
            <li>Oh the bangs are long but a clip or bobby pin can move it aside and still look very nice.</li>
            <li>Really nice looking wig, but it wasn&#x27;t on an open cap.  </li>
            <li>However it was definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I think its worth what i paid.</li>
            <li>A fun change for your look.</li>
            <li>and I must say that was pretty quick shipping (:</li>
            <li>15 dollars.this wig is much nicer and more realistic than a halloween wig.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, it was the right color when it arrived.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping.....</li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>When going outside make sure you take a wig brush to touch it up.</li>
            <li>Do not use a regular hair brush as they will brush out the lovely curls.</li>
            <li>I want to order more and have a different style every week!</li>
            <li>This is my first wig and I bought this for my cosplay.</li>
            <li>But it can get tangled and a regular comb will make it shed more hair out.</li>
            <li>At first i was worried about the arrival date, but that changed because it arrived so</li>
            <li>I actually straightened it, and it continues to look healthy as when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I really liked it, i used it for my human vriska for homestuck and it was very soft</li>
            <li>tried it on and it is so pretty and very</li>
            <li>Cool wig for the price I bought for my 10yr old to play dress up with...</li>
            <li>It was Better than expected.</li>
            <li>like real hair when you wear</li>
            <li>/&gt;it comes with a wig cap, so no need to buy, really curly</li>
            <li>and  really loves  it.  </li>
            <li>The color is much lighter than what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>The seller was very promt in delivery.  </li>
            <li>I was really nervous about the color because the picture changed after I purchased the wig.</li>
            <li>but it arrived quite fast.</li>
            <li>the thing was absolute tangle beyond fixing......  </li>
            <li>if you put it on right, it looks natural</li>
            <li>But other than that, I thought it was okay.</li>
            <li>It was soft at first but did get matted after awhile.</li>
            <li>long light brown hair , this was cute although the hair came messy and the bangs were all over the place ...</li>
            <li>and  expected a  cheap one.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to manage and gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>First of all I purchased the item on Dec.9th and received it just last week.</li>
            <li>in case with price I think it&#x27;s worth of money but the wig not a long enough I think it&#x27;s medium</li>
            <li>Tried to use a wig brush to get the tangles out and the strands started coming out in huge clumps......biggest waste of money</li>
            <li>she was  surprised</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and life like</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller if you are getting a wig for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I simply soaked the wig in some fabric softer and it was back to being soft again.</li>

            <li> Like any other synthetic wig it is shiny, but with the help of YouTube and google that can be easily fixed.</li>

            <li> Although it fits well, it does not sit well on and looks very flat and stringy even after being  styled.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve got a big head and round face, so the wig made my head look bigger.</li>
            <li> I move my head, especially if I look down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long, minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> It was a completely different color from the previous photo.</li>

            <li> curls came out after a few washes and frizzed up on me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this wig.</li>

            <li> This wig is NOT a good quality wig. It is OBVIOUS that it is a wig when wearing it. AllNice4Yu has waaay better ones for cheap.</li>
            <li> Well made and looks lovely. It was Better than expected. Lovely. The hair was really long, as I&#x27;m tall, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig. I am M2F TS with an issue with my hair due to work. With this wig, I can go out and feel confident.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like real hair when you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only notice 2 drawbacks to this. The cap is not one size fits all. It is made for a small head, and even though it will stretch enough to wear, it causes some issues with the bangs.&lt;br /&gt;The other drawback.. it&#x27;s hard to keep in the style it comes in. the hair loves to just go crazy anytime I move my head, especially if I look down.</li>
            <li> curls came out after a few washes and frizzed up on me so i had to take a iron strainer and strained it</li>
            <li> I was so bummed that I saw I would be receiving my wig on April 16-24!! But I am not anymore, I am so overwhelmed with happiness! I just received my wig today and I must say that was pretty quick shipping (:&lt;br /&gt;The wig is very beautiful and just the right length, it looks so natural!! And the seller was amazing, he/she gave me an email about my package on where it was.&lt;br /&gt;I should have bought more than one wig from this seller its just super awesome. It does shed just a little bit but its still in great condition and great quality. I highly recommend this seller if you are getting a wig for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is a great wig that is perfect for everyday use. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t shed or tangle up that much compared to other wigs I have had in the past. It doesn&#x27;t come with a wig cap so if you need one remember to get one!</li>
            <li> just got my wig 2day, just like the pic show. the size &amp; color.. i order the wig on  February 24, 2014 &amp; on February 28, 2014 I had it in my hands. &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp; thxs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this wig. Although it fits well, it does not sit well on and looks very flat and stringy even after being  styled.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig in November, and i must say i love it. When going outside make sure you take a wig brush to touch it up. Do not use a regular hair brush as they will brush out the lovely curls. Invest in a wig brush. The quality of these wigs are amazing. I want to order more and have a different style every week! Also these wigs come with a free wig cap which has a netting on it so you can attach the wig right to the wig cap for more security, amazing idea!</li>
            <li> its a nice wig, you may need to trim the side bangs a bit&lt;br /&gt;they are long. if you put it on right, it looks natural&lt;br /&gt;they have a clip on the back so it stays on tight&lt;br /&gt;it comes with a wig cap, so no need to buy, really curly&lt;br /&gt;and nice color, tangle easy but its okay.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig and I bought this for my cosplay. The wig looks great but it&#x27;s hard to manage and gets tangled very easily. But other than that, I thought it was okay.</li>
            <li> this wig is very natural looking, color is beautiful and this is my very first wig I was buying for halloween and it&#x27;s long enough to touch your butt. Oh the bangs are long but a clip or bobby pin can move it aside and still look very nice. But it can get tangled and a regular comb will make it shed more hair out. Needs to be combed properly</li>
            <li> i bought this for halloween and i loved it alot still have it and really enjoyed!!! worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li> I  bought  this  wig  with  low  expectations as  a gag  gift for a  friend.  the  wig  took  almost a  month  to  get  here. It  came from China, went  though  customs and  even  arrived by  registered  mail.  quite a  story  for  a  $5 wig.  anyway  I  gave  the  wig  to  my  friend  and  expected a  cheap one.  she was  surprised and  really loves  it.  She doesn&#x27;t  know  I  only  spend  $5 on  her.</li>
            <li> Cool wig for the price I bought for my 10yr old to play dress up with...she wanted waist length hair so a wig under $15 bucks, can&#x27;t complain...</li>
            <li> The color is much lighter than what is shown in the picture. The hair is also EXTREMELY shiny in a *I- can- tell- you&#x27;re- wearing- a- wig* kind of way. It&#x27;s also not as long as it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li> Really nice looking wig, but it wasn&#x27;t on an open cap.  It was a full mesh cap that doesn&#x27;t adjust very smoothly, but it still looks beautiful for the value.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, the wig is beautiful.  The hair looks natural and the style looks great.  The seller was very promt in delivery.  Objectively, I am giving the seller a 4 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on my head, I would&#x27;ve given the wig a 3 star.  The top layer is must shorter than the rest of the wig and therefore also gives the top of the head more volumn.  I&#x27;ve got a big head and round face, so the wig made my head look bigger.</li>
            <li> At first i was worried about the arrival date, but that changed because it arrived so fast!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on and it is so pretty and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;This will be a hit for me on Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more from this seller!</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about the color because the picture changed after I purchased the wig. It was a completely different color from the previous photo. Thankfully, it was the right color when it arrived. I got it a few days later then the estimated date. However it was definitely worth the wait. This is going to be great for my cosplay outfit. It was soft at first but did get matted after awhile. I simply soaked the wig in some fabric softer and it was back to being soft again. Like any other synthetic wig it is shiny, but with the help of YouTube and google that can be easily fixed. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> in case with price I think it&#x27;s worth of money but the wig not a long enough I think it&#x27;s medium anyway I like it</li>
            <li> Its a shedding wig but it arrived quite fast. I think its worth what i paid. A fun change for your look.</li>
            <li> I really liked it, i used it for my human vriska for homestuck and it was very soft, you couldnt see my wig cap or neck through it and it was easy to brush. very worth it and i&#x27;m glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> I got this the other day....super fast shipping.....the wig looked great and continued to for a couple of hours......got home and took it off ......the thing was absolute tangle beyond fixing......  I hadn&#x27;t even been outside, it was just that tangled from having it on my head......Tried to use a wig brush to get the tangles out and the strands started coming out in huge clumps......biggest waste of money</li>
            <li> For 10 dollars its a good wig. I was looking for one at party city and spirit but the cheapest was 15 dollars.this wig is much nicer and more realistic than a halloween wig. The color is a reddish brown I thought/wished it would be darker. This wig can be used and will be for maney more party&#x27;s. you can hardly tell its fake! It did take 4 days to get here on two day shipping but was a fair price and quality wig</li>
            <li> This was the first wig I bought, but it was a good choice. It&#x27;s really soft and life like, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Great to have around for portrait photography.</li>
            <li> First of all I purchased the item on Dec.9th and received it just last week. While brushing the hair with a hair brush I discovered that the brush almost held more hair than the wig itself...Not worth the wait or the money spent.</li>
            <li> I never leave responses, but this deserves it. The customer service is awesome. When I got it, it wasn&#x27;t all messed up like you would expect. It&#x27;s very long, minimal shedding. I actually straightened it, and it continues to look healthy as when I first got it. There is nothing you can get better for this price.</li>
            <li> long light brown hair , this was cute although the hair came messy and the bangs were all over the place ...</li>
            <li> I loved this wig with the exception the color was more of an auburn, not anything remotely like a brown or light brown. The feel,  texture, and how the curls fell were amazing</li>
            <li> This wig will not get used, because my wife does not like how layered the bangs are.  She says there are just too many bangs.  Its also a little darker than it looks in the pic.</li>
