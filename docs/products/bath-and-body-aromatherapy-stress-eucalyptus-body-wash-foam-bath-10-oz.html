            <li>It smells amazing, breathing it in and with it mixing with the steam</li>
            <li>the awesome smell fills up the whole bathroom.</li>
            <li>This helps keep the oil from being &#x27;too oily&#x27;, and leaves my skin nicely conditioned.</li>

            <li>This product does not produce alot of bubbles and I was hoping for more eucalyptus and spearmint aroma.  </li>
            <li>but I was expecting more bubbles.</li>
            <li>MY favorite body wash, it makes your stress just wash away.</li>
            <li>Enjoyable scent</li>
            <li>Oh I love this stuff -</li>
            <li>He bought it for me for Mother&#x27;s Day and he uses it more than me.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love the scent of this bath wash.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Besides leaving a lovely smell in bathroom, my skin feels all tingly, and I come out of the shower feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>The bathroom smells lovely after my bath.  </li>
            <li>Did I mention I love this stuff?</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Eucalyptus Spearmint is such a wonderful, head-clearing scent.  </li>
            <li>I think this just might be my favorite B&amp;BW scent of all time, and that&#x27;s saying quite a bit, as I&#x27;ve been buying their stuff for years.  </li>
            <li>I smell more of the Eucalyptus than the Spearmint.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered three more.  </li>
            <li>This body wash is simply the best.  </li>
            <li>I love this eucalyptus body wash.</li>
            <li>This is awesome after a long day in class.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that most people would enjoy this.</li>
            <li>Enjoy my bath time even more.</li>
            <li>Leaves a light tingle on your skin that feels cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Got this last time i went to the USA and loved the smell, i was so pleased that Amazon stock it and ship it to Mexico.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>One of her favorite things to do is take a nice long bubble bath now.</li>
            <li>This is indeed what I was looking for, I just wish it was a bit more intense.</li>
            <li>Mixes with the warm steam from the shower and clear breathing</li>
            <li>Fresh, and clean scented.</li>
            <li>but it damn well makes me feel calm when I&#x27;m in the shower</li>
            <li>and truly makes you feel calm.</li>
            <li>It does a deep-cleaning job on pores, leaving your skin feeling very refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong, and it leaves your skin feeling fresh, not dry.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift that went over very well!</li>
            <li>All the different competing smells are too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I use this stuff along with the B&amp;BW eucalyptus spearmint sugar scrub in a hot bath</li>
            <li>This body wash never fails to lift my spirits.  </li>
            <li>This, and the lotion arrived yesterday (12/17) and I put my hair up and decided to take a hot shower and try this bath foam out.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be repurchasing once I&#x27;m out :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to generate plenty of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>&quot; really really works for him.</li>
            <li>We have both the body wash and the shampoo in this product line, and I can tell you this: the aroma is VERY noticible throughout the guest wing of the house whenever anyone showers.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a fan of air-freshener strength Eucalyptus smell, not so much.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very relaxing too.</li>
            <li>Also smells very fragrant.  </li>
            <li>Especially since it&#x27;s winter time, and I have sensitive skin, this worked out better than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>Better eucalyptus aroma than other body baths we&#x27;ve used, we will order again.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too sharp, but is still clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>decent volume for the price, probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again though unless for a dude..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have an 11-year-old son with high functioning Autism and anxiety issues.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>It is gently fragrant and makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It smells absolutely heavenly, is not gender specific, and really cleans.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s such a peaceful, relaxing time.</li>
            <li>Very soapy only need two squeeze.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the price, as nearly $15.00 is a little much for body wash, no matter how pleasant and relaxing it may be.</li>
            <li>Makes for a very relaxing bath after a long day, or just because.</li>
            <li>Pour too much and your skin will dry out.</li>
            <li>What a simple and inexpensive way to treat yourself a little extra special each day!</li>

            <li> We keep a few different scents in the shower at all times!</li>
            <li> I only need to use a small amount because it lathers up so well.  </li>
            <li> that i became black....</li>
            <li> Not sure if this or any other skin product can offer &#x27;stress relief&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I use it after I use the stress relief sugar scrub to remove dried skin and coat with a thing layer of oil.</li>
            <li> Using a small amount works well.</li>
            <li> No more headaches from walking in Bath and Body Works!</li>
            <li> We both hate going into a Bath and Body Works store.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to generate plenty of bubbles.  Pour too much and your skin will dry out.</li>
            <li> After a trip to the spa at the Venetian in Vegas, I wanted a body wash that had the same scent profile as a product I tried there. This is indeed what I was looking for, I just wish it was a bit more intense. I have no doubt that most people would enjoy this.</li>
            <li> This product does not produce alot of bubbles and I was hoping for more eucalyptus and spearmint aroma.  I realize this is a body wash and foam bath but I was expecting more bubbles.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product.my wife loves it and we couldnt find it at the bath and body works store,only on amazon.</li>
            <li> MY favorite body wash, it makes your stress just wash away. Enjoyable scent</li>
            <li> Better eucalyptus aroma than other body baths we&#x27;ve used, we will order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good!</li>
            <li> ... so relaxing to take bath with this stuff ...  helps with stuffed noses or colds as well</li>
            <li> Wonderful, relaxing aroma</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift that went over very well!</li>
            <li> This product is heavenly. I use it when I can sneak an alone bath from my kids. It smells so good and truly does help relieve stress.</li>
            <li> Truly a stress reliever. I don&#x27;t know how but it works. Great soap as well.</li>
            <li> I have an 11-year-old son with high functioning Autism and anxiety issues. He loves anything minty, so I picked up a bottle of this at our local mall one day. He loves it. He insists on using it for every bath, both as a bubble bath &amp; body wash. I don&#x27;t have to fight to get him into the tub, and the \\&quot;stress relief\\&quot; really really works for him. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Oh I love this stuff - the stress relief before bed clears my sinuses and I don&#x27;t know if it helps me sleep but it damn well makes me feel calm when I&#x27;m in the shower cuz I just like the aroma!!</li>
            <li> This Eucalyptus Spearmint body wash has a very pleasant fragrance and does aid in the relaxation of a nice warm bath or shower.  I tried to use smaller amounts to make it last longer.  My only complaint is the price, as nearly $15.00 is a little much for body wash, no matter how pleasant and relaxing it may be.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great, smells amazing &amp; I thought I was gonna fall asleep in the tub..lol ..great product and makes you feel stress free &amp; relaxed</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this stuff. He bought it for me for Mother&#x27;s Day and he uses it more than me. Great smelling and nice relaxing smell.</li>
            <li> We keep this in our guest bath, no one complains. But come to think of it, no one compliments, either. We have both the body wash and the shampoo in this product line, and I can tell you this: the aroma is VERY noticible throughout the guest wing of the house whenever anyone showers.  If you like Eucalyptus, it&#x27;s great. If you&#x27;re not a fan of air-freshener strength Eucalyptus smell, not so much.</li>
            <li> LOVE this...smells so so good!</li>
            <li> Got this last time i went to the USA and loved the smell, i was so pleased that Amazon stock it and ship it to Mexico.</li>
            <li> Enjoy my bath time even more.</li>
            <li> Bought this as gift and was receved with great enthusiasm!!! Great sale!</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells soooo good.</li>
            <li> This bath wash has a great mint smell  that envelopes you while bathing. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a friend, she loved it until it caused her to get a yeast infection. decent volume for the price, probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again though unless for a dude..</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t love bath and body works body wash??!!! sent this as a gift and my friend was happy and clean. :)</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love the scent of this bath wash.  We both hate going into a Bath and Body Works store.  All the different competing smells are too overwhelming.  So, I was very happy to find this product on Amazon.  No more headaches from walking in Bath and Body Works!</li>
            <li> This smells so good!  Great lather!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells *so* good. It&#x27;s an excellent foaming bubble bath and the awesome smell fills up the whole bathroom. I use this stuff along with the B&amp;BW eucalyptus spearmint sugar scrub in a hot bath and it&#x27;s such a peaceful, relaxing time.</li>
            <li> This is awesome after a long day in class.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Besides leaving a lovely smell in bathroom, my skin feels all tingly, and I come out of the shower feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend.  One of her favorite things to do is take a nice long bubble bath now.</li>
            <li> I love this. Smells really really really great. The lotion is very relaxing too.</li>
            <li> This body wash never fails to lift my spirits.  I only need to use a small amount because it lathers up so well.  The bathroom smells lovely after my bath.  I also gave it as a gift and the recipient also loved it.</li>
            <li> Fresh, and clean scented. Mixes with the warm steam from the shower and clear breathing and you can inhale deeply and feel it in your chest. Leaves a light tingle on your skin that feels cool and refreshing. I love this stuff! I use it after I use the stress relief sugar scrub to remove dried skin and coat with a thing layer of oil. This helps keep the oil from being &#x27;too oily&#x27;, and leaves my skin nicely conditioned. Did I mention I love this stuff? I love it!</li>
            <li> What a simple and inexpensive way to treat yourself a little extra special each day! We keep a few different scents in the shower at all times! 5 star scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 1 week back....the smell and everything is good but why i don&#x27;t know i got tan on my skin..that i became black....</li>
            <li> Very soapy only need two squeeze. Smells good!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am pregnant and absolutely addicted to the smell. I go through one of them every couple weeks. Makes a really nice bubble bath.</li>
            <li> This, and the lotion arrived yesterday (12/17) and I put my hair up and decided to take a hot shower and try this bath foam out. It smells amazing, breathing it in and with it mixing with the steam it&#x27;s like you have yourself a mini pampering session in the shower. It isn&#x27;t too strong, and it leaves your skin feeling fresh, not dry. Especially since it&#x27;s winter time, and I have sensitive skin, this worked out better than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Very good. Smell very good and came before it said.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person seemed happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is gently fragrant and makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed.  It is absolutely addictive.</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus Spearmint is such a wonderful, head-clearing scent.  I think this just might be my favorite B&amp;BW scent of all time, and that&#x27;s saying quite a bit, as I&#x27;ve been buying their stuff for years.  The body wash is easy rinsing and non-drying, and lathers up nicely.  The scent isn&#x27;t too sharp, but is still clean and fresh.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Looooove the scent of this. Makes for a very relaxing bath after a long day, or just because. I smell more of the Eucalyptus than the Spearmint. Smells so wonderful and really and truly makes you feel calm. I will definitely be repurchasing once I&#x27;m out :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body wash. It smells absolutely heavenly, is not gender specific, and really cleans. I will continue to buy this body wash as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this product, smells really good, i received my product in very good conditions, and well packed. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I&#x27;ve just ordered three more.  It does a deep-cleaning job on pores, leaving your skin feeling very refreshed and clean.  Also smells very fragrant.  Not sure if this or any other skin product can offer &#x27;stress relief&#x27;&#x27; but I do believe that eucalyptus and spearmint help to keep breathing passages open and possibly prevent colds and congestion.</li>
            <li> Great relaxing experience!</li>
            <li> This body wash is simply the best.  Using a small amount works well. The fragrance is wonderful, relaxing! I will continue to purchase this as long as I can a Ford it!</li>
            <li> This smells great and makes MOUNTAINS of bubbles in a bath.</li>
            <li> I love this eucalyptus body wash.</li>
