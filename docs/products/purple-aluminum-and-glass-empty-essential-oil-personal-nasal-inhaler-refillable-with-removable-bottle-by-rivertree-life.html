            <li>My honest opinion?</li>
            <li>High quality great product!</li>
            <li>As described, nice design, easy to use....</li>
            <li>If you do more, it would leak but why would you need more? :)</li>
            <li>The inhaler is very attractive and the benefits of my essential oils are maximized.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is glass.  </li>
            <li>and it arrived with an adorable hand written letter from the owner.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love that the vial inside is glass</li>
            <li>leave a bit sticking out the top</li>
            <li>Perfect for having essential oils for travel or in your purse when needed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I also find it challenging to cleanse the glass container, a q-tip seems ok, but still.</li>
            <li>I had some plastic ones before and after about 2 weeks they smelled more like plastic than like lavender.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this inhaler to help with a stuffy nose from allergies.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>The casing is classy and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>lid could fit more tighhtly</li>
            <li>so you can easily pull it out</li>
            <li>The inside is glass, which is a bit concerting, but ok, considering you can clean it out and see if there are any remnants.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>then that it is fine and usable.</li>
            <li>Our family loves these easy to clean inhalers.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this item.</li>
            <li>For those of you that have leaks, you can&#x27;t fill the container completely full of liquid.</li>
            <li>I figured if I was inhaling it more directly, it would work better, and boy was I right.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered quickly but did not meet my expectations at all.</li>
            <li>I first ordered the plastic inhalers but could not get comfortable with them for worrying about inhaling toxic substances from leached plastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of glad they were denied because now that I&#x27;ve used it a little longer</li>
            <li>It is nice to make a personalized essential oil blend.</li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>My allergies this season have been almost non-existent thanks to this baby!</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>Well many essential oils tend to burn the skin.</li>
            <li>I really wish all the above hadn&#x27;t happened because I love the style and</li>
            <li>The vial to hold the essential oil screws in securely and the cap stays in place.</li>
            <li>Really like the concept but doesn&#x27;t work as well when you have to reopen to add additional oils.  </li>
            <li>I filled 2/3 of the vile, inserted the cotton wick, and put it upright in the outside zippered pocket of my handbag with my lipstick.</li>
            <li>Functionally it works like my much cheaper inhalers, but this looks so much nicer.</li>
            <li>Pro&#x27;s: I like that it comes in a discreet, non-plastic nice looking small and reusable unit.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought more inhalers and less roller bottles.</li>
            <li>The bottom part that holds the glass doesn&#x27;t hold onto to it well enough so every time I open it I have to pry my nail in so that the top comes off instead of the bottom.  </li>
            <li>This is the third review I have tried to write, the past two were denied even though they were raving good.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you saturate the wick with a few drops of oil; don&#x27;t pour oil into the vial</li>
            <li>I filled mine with coarse salt and essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I am glad my Investment was Small because it&#x27;s already in the trash.</li>
            <li>The top is on so tight I can not even open it.</li>
            <li>The adhesive was completely gone.  </li>
            <li>You really should only put what the wick will absorb as it absorbs it.  </li>
            <li>As far as the wick falling in, just don&#x27;t push it in that far.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the disposable plastic inhaler sticks, this one does not have an opening at the bottom, thus not allowing it to be really utilized as such.</li>
            <li>I could barely smell the oils even though the wick was completely saturated.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, but a little tricky to get the oil inside the container, but other</li>
            <li>By the time I got to the restaurant it had nearly all leaked out, and the entire unit was greasy and everything smelled from the essential oil.  </li>
            <li>then I opened it and the glue that holds the &amp;#34;aluminum&amp;#34; part to the glass completely let loose.  </li>
            <li>Good idea bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Started to leak after less than a week of owning it:(</li>
            <li> High quality great product! I am impressed. The vial to hold the essential oil screws in securely and the cap stays in place. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Really like the concept but doesn&#x27;t work as well when you have to reopen to add additional oils.  Pretty but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Well made. Easy and attractive</li>
            <li> I made a sinus decongestant inhaler with this.  It is great quality and a good price.  The wick inside is not organic cotton and I didn&#x27;t use it.  I filled mine with coarse salt and essential oils.  It works well for what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> This is great! I use peppermint in it for headaches. I saw one review that said it leaks. It does not leak. You don&#x27;t fill the tube with oil. You drop the oil on the wick. Only what the wick absorbs. If you do more, it would leak but why would you need more? :)</li>
            <li> Oh this thing is just wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for my allergy blend so I&#x27;m not constantly rubbing oils on my neck. I figured if I was inhaling it more directly, it would work better, and boy was I right. My allergies this season have been almost non-existent thanks to this baby!</li>
            <li> It is nice to make a personalized essential oil blend. The inhaler is very attractive and the benefits of my essential oils are maximized.</li>
            <li> lid could fit more tighhtly</li>
            <li> These are great! I wish I had bought more inhalers and less roller bottles.</li>
            <li> Our family loves these easy to clean inhalers.  Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Junk. Comes with a &amp;#34;wick&amp;#34; that if you put it in the glass bottle it doesn&#x27;t come back out. and if you just fill the glass bottle wiht oil it would leak all over the place.</li>
            <li> As described, nice design, easy to use....</li>
            <li> This is the third review I have tried to write, the past two were denied even though they were raving good.  I&#x27;m kind of glad they were denied because now that I&#x27;ve used it a little longer it is not a product I would recommend again (I already recommended it to the 6000 students at my aromatherapy school).  The bottom part that holds the glass doesn&#x27;t hold onto to it well enough so every time I open it I have to pry my nail in so that the top comes off instead of the bottom.  That was a minor annoyance but when I hadn&#x27;t used it for about a week then I opened it and the glue that holds the &amp;#34;aluminum&amp;#34; part to the glass completely let loose.  The adhesive was completely gone.  I really wish all the above hadn&#x27;t happened because I love the style and and I love that it is glass.  For those of you that have leaks, you can&#x27;t fill the container completely full of liquid. You really should only put what the wick will absorb as it absorbs it.  As far as the wick falling in, just don&#x27;t push it in that far.  I leave mine it about an 1/8&amp;#34;.  Now let&#x27;s see if they delete this review...</li>
            <li> I brought it on a trip and it leaked all over everything</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. The top is on so tight I can not even open it. Not going to spend money to send it back so I am stuck. :(</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this item. I filled 2/3 of the vile, inserted the cotton wick, and put it upright in the outside zippered pocket of my handbag with my lipstick. By the time I got to the restaurant it had nearly all leaked out, and the entire unit was greasy and everything smelled from the essential oil.  I had a hard time getting the cap off since it was so greasy. I would hardly call this a portable device, given this reaction.  It won&#x27;t even stand upright even if I were to just leave it in place in my office.  I gave it 2 stars because it&#x27;s pretty and it arrived with an adorable hand written letter from the owner.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Very handy!</li>
            <li> no instructions, no guidelines, nothing but the actual product.</li>
            <li> great for my EO products</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s perfect for discreteness and travel. I love that the vial inside is glass so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the oils coming into contact with metal or plastic parts. Just make sure you saturate the wick with a few drops of oil; don&#x27;t pour oil into the vial it&#x27;s not designed to hold liquid oil...also don&#x27;t push the wick all the way in...leave a bit sticking out the top so you can easily pull it out</li>
            <li> Perfect for having essential oils for travel or in your purse when needed.  The casing is classy and beautiful.  Functionally it works like my much cheaper inhalers, but this looks so much nicer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted something for some of the oils I have. I am very satisfied with it. Works just fine. Easy to use, but a little tricky to get the oil inside the container, but other then that it is fine and usable. This is something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s: I like that it comes in a discreet, non-plastic nice looking small and reusable unit. The inside is glass, which is a bit concerting, but ok, considering you can clean it out and see if there are any remnants.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: Unlike the disposable plastic inhaler sticks, this one does not have an opening at the bottom, thus not allowing it to be really utilized as such. You can hold it up to your nose, but the opening is way to large to stick it in your nose like the plastic inhalers (which have a small hole at the bottom, so you don&#x27;t have a vacuum, hence letting you inhale while at the rim of your nose or slightly inside your nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find it challenging to cleanse the glass container, a q-tip seems ok, but still. My honest opinion? Go with the plastic disposable units, if you loose one, you won&#x27;t be frantic over trying to find it.</li>
            <li> these are great! bought a few for gifts and kept one for myself1</li>
            <li> I love it! I had some plastic ones before and after about 2 weeks they smelled more like plastic than like lavender. This just smells like lavender (because that&#x27;s what I put it in it. You can put any essential oil in it). I&#x27;ve been carrying it in my pocket almost every day for about 4 weeks and the smell is still the same.</li>
            <li> Good idea bad concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seasonal asthma and I get this dry hacking cough that just hangs on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I made a blend of essential oils Peppermint and eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem it does not have a screw on lid. It has a fibrous cork like thing that goes in the neck of the bottle. The problem is this fibrous plug allows th essential oil to seep out. Well many essential oils tend to burn the skin. Peppermint and Cinnamon are two of the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally carrying one of these in a pocket or purse is out of the question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they should have done is either of the options below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a screw on lid on the device&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a pocket clip on the device to keep it from turning over and making a smelly mess.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this inhaler to help with a stuffy nose from allergies.  I first ordered the plastic inhalers but could not get comfortable with them for worrying about inhaling toxic substances from leached plastic.  No worries with this inhaler.  The vial inside the aluminum cover is glass.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly but did not meet my expectations at all. I could barely smell the oils even though the wick was completely saturated. The oils leaked out and ate away at the plastic sleeve inside the cap. I am glad my Investment was Small because it&#x27;s already in the trash.</li>
            <li> Great Product and service would recommend to anyone. Thank U</li>
