            <li>having everything in one case is brilliant and well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I really do love this case!</li>
            <li>will say that this case is well made and the inside animal print is adorable!</li>
            <li>This is a professional makeup artist size, and probably a bit cumbersome for travel, but for my storage purposes it&#x27;s perfect...</li>
            <li>I love this case because there&#x27;s a lot of storage in the bottom and organizational space on the sides.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>,roomy and elegant looking.</li>
            <li>After it arrived, however, I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for medium amounts of makeup;easy to open, manage, strore, &amp; carry.</li>
            <li>Best such case we&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li>Great size for decent amount of makeup.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine, and my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I am able to quickly close it and move to another room without anything falling out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the large NYX train case for many many years until it crapped out.</li>
            <li>I love that my most frequently used make up pieces are easily stored in the top and are very easily accessible when I&#x27;m in a hurry to get ready for work.</li>
            <li>Seems well made and is perfect for my purpose, which is just for extra makeup storage that I can easily bring from the hall closet into the bathroom when I need more than my few &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; items.</li>
            <li>I love my new make up case!</li>
            <li>It will likely last forever and is the PERFECT size for all your make up storage needs.  </li>
            <li>I have been traveling a lot lately, and it&#x27;s been great to be able to pick the case up and put right into my car, instead of having to pack a travel bag makeup case.</li>
            <li>Very well made, easy to organize makeup, combs, brushes etc.</li>
            <li>I have limited space to keep all the products a girl needs and had been looking for a good solution...</li>
            <li>However, if you really did need this to be secure (anti-theft) it is not reliable in any stretch of the imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy!</li>
            <li>This case is exactly what I was looking for to organize my makeup.</li>
            <li>While this case is good for simple traveling, it doesn&#x27;t live up to my professional needs.</li>
            <li>the multiple compartments make it easy to organize and access all your makeup items.  </li>
            <li>This has tons of space and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It holds a ton of product and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very well made</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!  </li>
            <li>Very well constructed and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Very spacious.</li>
            <li>Glad that I spent the money!</li>
            <li>Lots of room, nice appearance and highly recommended for those who need to pack lots into a small space.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love my makeup and have recommended this to a few friends already whom I know have bought as well.  </li>
            <li>To put it into perspective, my coastal scents 252 eyeshadow palette fits comfortably in the bottom of the case, with plenty of room around the sides for me to put other stuff.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and the leopard lining adds distinctive style and contents show up better than usual.</li>
            <li>Alone it is heavy so packed full of cosmetics and skincare</li>
            <li>Seems like it will last me a very long time, because it won&#x27;t get much abuse (just daily makeup sessions, no heavy traveling).</li>

            <li> I love this case because there&#x27;s a lot of storage in the bottom and organizational space on the sides. I love that my most frequently used make up pieces are easily stored in the top and are very easily accessible when I&#x27;m in a hurry to get ready for work. I have been traveling a lot lately, and it&#x27;s been great to be able to pick the case up and put right into my car, instead of having to pack a travel bag makeup case.</li>
            <li> This has tons of space and is very sturdy. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great size for decent amount of makeup. Perfect amount of layers and compartments.</li>
            <li> I love my new make up case! It holds a ton of product and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Great buy!  Haven&#x27;t broke it yet! Just enough for what I need it for. Very well made</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended!  I love this thing.  Very well constructed and sturdy.  It will likely last forever and is the PERFECT size for all your make up storage needs.  10 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Needed to organize all makeup etc. into one case.  Very well made, easy to organize makeup, combs, brushes etc.,roomy and elegant looking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year now. It has survived massive travel, and moving across the country twice. It had enough trays to sort out my eyelines and eye pigments.&lt;br /&gt;The case DOES lock as well, so it ensures your products will not walk away. Comfortably fits BH cosmetics Pallets perfectly, or can stand CoverGirl/Tommy foundations.</li>
            <li> Case is very nice. Seems well made and is perfect for my purpose, which is just for extra makeup storage that I can easily bring from the hall closet into the bathroom when I need more than my few &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; items. Just enough trays and room to be organized. No more clutter in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> I initially ordered this case for my daughter.  After it arrived, however, I fell in love with it.  I had to order another for my daughter.  It keeps all my makeup, moisturizers, etc. in one place.  Additionally, I am able to quickly close it and move to another room without anything falling out.  It is very attractive and sturdy.  I should have ordered something like this years ago.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Heavy duty and well made. Very spacious. Interior print is awesome. I think I will have this for a long time. Glad that I spent the money!</li>
            <li> Perfect size to accommodate all my makeup. To put it into perspective, my coastal scents 252 eyeshadow palette fits comfortably in the bottom of the case, with plenty of room around the sides for me to put other stuff. I really do love this case!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for medium amounts of makeup;easy to open, manage, strore, &amp; carry. It&#x27;s very sturdy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist so I need a lot of space for a LOT of merchandise. While this case is good for simple traveling, it doesn&#x27;t live up to my professional needs. Also, this case is supposed to lock but did not come with the key. I think the locking mechanism is just for looks anyway because you can break into this with scissors if you needed to. However, if you really did need this to be secure (anti-theft) it is not reliable in any stretch of the imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the large NYX train case for many many years until it crapped out. Maybe I will invest in another one of them. It&#x27;s more expensive, but held everything I needed plus some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this case is well made and the inside animal print is adorable!</li>
            <li> Best such case we&#x27;ve seen! Sturdy and the leopard lining adds distinctive style and contents show up better than usual.</li>
            <li> This case is exactly what I was looking for to organize my makeup. It has lots of space but isn&#x27;t ridiculously bulky. I keep my moisturizers, concealer, eye shadow, mascara, etc. all in this case and it&#x27;s great. No more digging for things. Solid construction, but it&#x27;s not indestructible. Seems like it will last me a very long time, because it won&#x27;t get much abuse (just daily makeup sessions, no heavy traveling). Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Lots of room, nice appearance and highly recommended for those who need to pack lots into a small space.  I love my makeup and have recommended this to a few friends already whom I know have bought as well.  I will say this was larger than I&#x27;d expected but that&#x27;s fine, and my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions.  I will say I would never travel with this.  Alone it is heavy so packed full of cosmetics and skincare it would be quite cumbersome to lug around.</li>
            <li> This was the cosmetic organizer that I needed. I have limited space to keep all the products a girl needs and had been looking for a good solution... this Bucasi Aluminum Train Case is it!!  It is well built and the multiple compartments make it easy to organize and access all your makeup items.  This is a professional makeup artist size, and probably a bit cumbersome for travel, but for my storage purposes it&#x27;s perfect... having everything in one case is brilliant and well worth the price!</li>
