            <li> Disclaimer:  I&#x27;ve not purchased this from Amazon, only through local shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my first bottle as a gift close to 10 years (yes, a decade) ago.  It&#x27;s the only cologne I&#x27;ve worn since.  As other reviewers have stated, this is not a strong fragrance.  It is, to me, light, slightly spicy with subtle floral and musk undertones.  As others have stated, it does not require much to achieve the desired effect and it absolutely lasts for hours.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it over the years, and do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a light, pleasant, long lasting cologne.
