            <li>It feel nice in the scalp ...</li>
            <li>Great Product worth it!</li>
            <li>Although, I must warn this product is VERY strong and you should consult a certified hairstylist/beautician before using this product.</li>
            <li>Everything was perfect, on time, and the product in perfect conditions, and this is not the first time and always is in the same way</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product it really strengthen the hair and makes it so much more healthy; been using it for over a year now and my hair length and volume is great!</li>
            <li>i love it and the smell is nice</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Good smell and cool scalp have effectively stopped hair loss.</li>
            <li>This product felt great, but I am still in the process of my trial period to see if I get consistent results.</li>
            <li>but I have already experienced so much positive results in 2 application that I am a believer.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I looked to purchase my own, and I totally love it!</li>

            <li>I went to a new Dominican hair stylist with my own supplies!</li>
            <li>Very worthy product.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>First I must say that the delivery was amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product if you want your hair to grow fast!</li>
            <li>so all my new growth was gone when I first started using this product, which was awesome because I was able to see how fast  this product work.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the very first use, my hair was more maneagible.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four only because I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and haven&#x27;t seen any growth buttttt, it does feel amazing on my scalp nice and tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>Also, have people found it more useful when combined with the shampoo?  </li>
            <li>so I have confidence that it will work great to improve the overall health of my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It is great for my hair, and it totally rocks it!  </li>
            <li>Maybe others are having more success.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and should be used daily.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend! !!</li>
            <li>I used this product in the past and my hair was at its best then.</li>
            <li>Well I am excited and please to say this product worked for me.</li>
            <li>I love this product as it does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about hair growth</li>
            <li>I began using after the birth of my son significantly helped with the shedding and growth.  </li>
            <li>Also I do not use any special shampoos as yet.</li>
            <li>I have a full jar I need to throw out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this a full month yet</li>
            <li>overall good product hopefully stops the breakage</li>
            <li>Fantastic product worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I really want to try more products from this line.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much about this product but that it has helped my hair grow a lot and much more healthier.</li>
            <li>Makes my scalp feel super clean.</li>
            <li>It burns due to the ingredients, but it passes and you&#x27;ll look great.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I got this really quickly...</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using this product if you&#x27;re getting your hair relaxed, you should use it 1-2 weeks before or after because you may feel a mild burning sensation on your scalp.</li>
            <li>and I am loyal to the products that I see used in dominican salons.</li>
            <li>I have received tremendous hair growth with that product.</li>
            <li>Continuos use allows for quick results</li>
            <li>If you have a bold hairline and you are trying to recover it, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>Absolutely !!</li>
            <li>Definitely helps to insure a healthy scalp!</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and this is the first time I have seen results!</li>
            <li>I love it and it really makes my hair feel completely renewed, refreshed, clean, and full of life after each use.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference I have so much hair growth now.  </li>
            <li>Her hair grew back nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have used it in my own hair only once.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>It is such a nice tingly feeling, you can feel it working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>if your loosing hair.you&#x27;ll see the difference right a way</li>
            <li>I must say that I was loosing so much hair (especiallly on the front) that you could see my scalp (I was getting BOLD).</li>
            <li>but I guess at the super fast rate my hair grows, it cant get any faster.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I also used the garlic shampoo and the hot oil.</li>
            <li>I JUST STARTED USING THE NEQUAL INTENSIVE ENERGIZING LOTION,AND AFTER THE FIRST USE</li>
            <li>The first week my scalp was on fire</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe her at first</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>sure to use a deep conditioner;when</li>
            <li>The first shipment was damaged.</li>
            <li>More details later.</li>
            <li>Alter Ego Nequal Intensive Energizing Lotion burns (really burns!).  </li>
            <li>and it really does work!</li>
            <li>and its actually been growing out healthy.</li>
            <li>I have soft, fine hair and it easily gets damaged when permed or in the Sun too long.  </li>
            <li>I feel the best is yet to come but find my anxiety over gair loss is less and less with each use.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 because my hair does seem more dry.</li>
            <li>This product has such a strong smell</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a little over a month, however, I have seen great results with hair growth around my edges.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing to the scalp</li>
            <li>But it really improved my scalps condition.</li>
            <li>I purchased it because my daughter wants hair growth</li>
            <li>Now at month 4 my hair is much thicker and It looks like it did years ago.  </li>
            <li>Last week it was shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really works I started seeing results in one week and started recommending to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li>Seems like a promising product.</li>
            <li>so much it relieves my headache..</li>
            <li>i finish the whole bottle and didnt see any result.</li>
            <li>it really works</li>
            <li>It is intense, and I can imagine that it will induce morning sickness.</li>
            <li>Had to go through too much to get a replacement.</li>
            <li>Only thing is I cant tell if it&#x27;s a light oil or what.</li>
            <li>Take a chance on this product because it really works.  </li>
            <li>this was a waiste of my money never purchasing this again very disapointed</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>It really works my hair has not been falling out anymore</li>
            <li>Very relaxing when I use it.  </li>
            <li>However, this review is to inform you to not believe the hype about the intense tingle of this product.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>I started looking for items and found Alter Ego Intense Energizing Lotion.</li>
            <li>, as for every product I think you should use it for at least 6 months to really know if it is good or not, so I will do that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other stuff before but this thing works better and faster.</li>
            <li>Had an actual ball spot and after 4 weeks of using saw significant hair growth.</li>
            <li>I usually place a few drops in my hair after shampooing, and it makes my scalp feel great!!!!</li>
            <li>but it works pretty well, so far.</li>
            <li>slow and steady but god willing it will be 4 inches more in a few more months!</li>
            <li>did this help grow it back quickly.</li>
            <li>I have use this 3 times and I notice with the very first use I vast difference in my shedding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the results of this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The product gives a little tingle which tells me that it is refreshing my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and really oily</li>
            <li>Going to give it  few more months and see what happens.</li>
            <li>It also grew faster than normal.</li>
            <li>I figured using this would help my hair grow even faster than it normally do</li>
            <li>Negual intensive lotion drop has given me a second chance to regrow hair lose and regain confidence back with lustreouse  strong hair.  </li>
            <li>My edges are full and long!</li>
            <li>where I parted my hair, left or right.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous, but it was brand new and the box was also provided.</li>
            <li>I have so much new growth.</li>
            <li>It did tingle (on wet hair) but not bad.</li>
            <li>im happy with this product so far so good,my hair has definitely slow down shedding with each use.would buy again</li>
            <li>Be aware there is a very intense &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; to the scalp, but it does dissipate after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>(MY HAIR IS NATURAL)</li>
            <li>My  hair is pretty long</li>
            <li>I have natural coily kinky hair and this treatment</li>
            <li>2 1/2 years ago, I cut my 10 year old loc off.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping the results I have seen thus far will continue, as I work toward strengthening thinning edges.</li>
            <li>I have since gone natural and I use it weekly now to gain length.</li>
            <li>I always follow with a leave in moisture based conditioner and so far I&#x27;m seeing some results.</li>
            <li>Still too early to give a complete review</li>
            <li>But I like it (a lot) so far.</li>
            <li>We used this product when we were transitioning to natural hair two years ago and made the process a lot easier and healed our scalps.</li>
            <li>to early to tell if it works though.</li>
            <li>Been using Alter Ego for a long time but first time trying the Nequal.  </li>
            <li>so I had to cut my hair and then went natural because it made my hair appear thicker.</li>
            <li>As soon asking I get it cut, my hair grows right back 3 days later</li>
            <li>Which was very fast, normally I do not need a relaxer until 4 to 6 month at a time and by that time my hair grows 2 inches.</li>
            <li>After using the Intensive Energizing Lotion (first bottle), my hair had finally grown back.</li>
            <li>I am back on Amazon buying my second bottle because the first one is finished.</li>
            <li>It feels tingly on scalp, it was highly recommended by several salons...</li>
            <li>Sometimes it feels extremely intense, other times its just a normal tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>Overall it really does help your hair grow back so</li>
            <li>Now on to the 3rd week of wash and treatment and all I have to say is wow.</li>
            <li>Im using whatever they use and which ever deep condition they supply for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I still have 1/4 of a bottle left and have been using for 4 complete months.  </li>
            <li>I first used this when someone gave me a half bottle to used.</li>
            <li>This product along with other Alter Ego.products made my hair grow.back fast.</li>
            <li>I bought some to try and do my own hair at home because going every 2 weeks to get my hair done is not a necessary expensive being that I&#x27;m unemployed.</li>
            <li>Since using I have less shedding and not as much hair in the comb and have seem noticeable hair growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost positive the back is longer because my husband notice in a few weeks of me using this produce my hair was growing longer in the back.</li>

            <li> It feel nice in the scalp ...</li>
            <li> Great Product worth it!</li>
            <li> Although, I must warn this product is VERY strong and you should consult a certified hairstylist/beautician before using this product.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect, on time, and the product in perfect conditions, and this is not the first time and always is in the same way</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product it really strengthen the hair and makes it so much more healthy; been using it for over a year now and my hair length and volume is great!</li>
            <li> i love it and the smell is nice</li>
            <li> but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Good smell and cool scalp have effectively stopped hair loss.</li>
            <li> This product felt great, but I am still in the process of my trial period to see if I get consistent results.</li>
            <li> but I have already experienced so much positive results in 2 application that I am a believer.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I looked to purchase my own, and I totally love it!</li>

            <li> Very worthy product.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> First I must say that the delivery was amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you want your hair to grow fast!</li>
            <li> so all my new growth was gone when I first started using this product, which was awesome because I was able to see how fast  this product work.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the very first use, my hair was more maneagible.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four only because I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and haven&#x27;t seen any growth buttttt, it does feel amazing on my scalp nice and tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> Also, have people found it more useful when combined with the shampoo?  </li>
            <li> so I have confidence that it will work great to improve the overall health of my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It is great for my hair, and it totally rocks it!  </li>
            <li> Maybe others are having more success.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and should be used daily.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend! !!</li>

            <li> Well I am excited and please to say this product worked for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about hair growth</li>
            <li> I began using after the birth of my son significantly helped with the shedding and growth.  </li>
            <li> Also I do not use any special shampoos as yet.</li>
            <li> I have a full jar I need to throw out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this a full month yet</li>
            <li> overall good product hopefully stops the breakage</li>
            <li> Fantastic product worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really want to try more products from this line.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about this product but that it has helped my hair grow a lot and much more healthier.</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp feel super clean.</li>
            <li> It burns due to the ingredients, but it passes and you&#x27;ll look great.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I got this really quickly...</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this product if you&#x27;re getting your hair relaxed, you should use it 1-2 weeks before or after because you may feel a mild burning sensation on your scalp.</li>
            <li> and I am loyal to the products that I see used in dominican salons.</li>
            <li> I have received tremendous hair growth with that product.</li>
            <li> Continuos use allows for quick results</li>
            <li> If you have a bold hairline and you are trying to recover it, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely !!</li>
            <li> Definitely helps to insure a healthy scalp!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything and this is the first time I have seen results!</li>
            <li> I love it and it really makes my hair feel completely renewed, refreshed, clean, and full of life after each use.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference I have so much hair growth now.  </li>
            <li> Her hair grew back nicely.  </li>
            <li> I have used it in my own hair only once.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> It is such a nice tingly feeling, you can feel it working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> if your loosing hair.you&#x27;ll see the difference right a way</li>
            <li> I must say that I was loosing so much hair (especiallly on the front) that you could see my scalp (I was getting BOLD).</li>
            <li> but I guess at the super fast rate my hair grows, it cant get any faster.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I also used the garlic shampoo and the hot oil.</li>
            <li> I JUST STARTED USING THE NEQUAL INTENSIVE ENERGIZING LOTION,AND AFTER THE FIRST USE</li>
            <li> The first week my scalp was on fire</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe her at first</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> sure to use a deep conditioner;when</li>
            <li> The first shipment was damaged.</li>
            <li> More details later.</li>
            <li> Alter Ego Nequal Intensive Energizing Lotion burns (really burns!).  </li>
            <li> and it really does work!</li>
            <li> and its actually been growing out healthy.</li>
            <li> I have soft, fine hair and it easily gets damaged when permed or in the Sun too long.  </li>
            <li> I feel the best is yet to come but find my anxiety over gair loss is less and less with each use.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because my hair does seem more dry.</li>
            <li> This product has such a strong smell</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a little over a month, however, I have seen great results with hair growth around my edges.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing to the scalp</li>
            <li> But it really improved my scalps condition.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because my daughter wants hair growth</li>
            <li> Now at month 4 my hair is much thicker and It looks like it did years ago.  </li>
            <li> Last week it was shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> It really works I started seeing results in one week and started recommending to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Seems like a promising product.</li>
            <li> so much it relieves my headache..</li>
            <li> i finish the whole bottle and didnt see any result.</li>
            <li> it really works</li>
            <li> It is intense, and I can imagine that it will induce morning sickness.</li>
            <li> Had to go through too much to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Only thing is I cant tell if it&#x27;s a light oil or what.</li>
            <li> Take a chance on this product because it really works.  </li>
            <li> this was a waiste of my money never purchasing this again very disapointed</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> It really works my hair has not been falling out anymore</li>
            <li> Very relaxing when I use it.  </li>
            <li> However, this review is to inform you to not believe the hype about the intense tingle of this product.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> I started looking for items and found Alter Ego Intense Energizing Lotion.</li>
            <li> , as for every product I think you should use it for at least 6 months to really know if it is good or not, so I will do that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other stuff before but this thing works better and faster.</li>
            <li> Had an actual ball spot and after 4 weeks of using saw significant hair growth.</li>
            <li> I usually place a few drops in my hair after shampooing, and it makes my scalp feel great!!!!</li>
            <li> but it works pretty well, so far.</li>
            <li> slow and steady but god willing it will be 4 inches more in a few more months!</li>
            <li> did this help grow it back quickly.</li>
            <li> I have use this 3 times and I notice with the very first use I vast difference in my shedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the results of this product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product gives a little tingle which tells me that it is refreshing my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and really oily</li>
            <li> Going to give it  few more months and see what happens.</li>
            <li> It also grew faster than normal.</li>
            <li> I figured using this would help my hair grow even faster than it normally do</li>
            <li> Negual intensive lotion drop has given me a second chance to regrow hair lose and regain confidence back with lustreouse  strong hair.  </li>
            <li> My edges are full and long!</li>
            <li> where I parted my hair, left or right.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous, but it was brand new and the box was also provided.</li>
            <li> I have so much new growth.</li>
            <li> It did tingle (on wet hair) but not bad.</li>
            <li> im happy with this product so far so good,my hair has definitely slow down shedding with each use.would buy again</li>
            <li> Be aware there is a very intense &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; to the scalp, but it does dissipate after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> (MY HAIR IS NATURAL)</li>
            <li> My  hair is pretty long</li>
            <li> I have natural coily kinky hair and this treatment</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 years ago, I cut my 10 year old loc off.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping the results I have seen thus far will continue, as I work toward strengthening thinning edges.</li>
            <li> I have since gone natural and I use it weekly now to gain length.</li>
            <li> I always follow with a leave in moisture based conditioner and so far I&#x27;m seeing some results.</li>
            <li> Still too early to give a complete review</li>
            <li> But I like it (a lot) so far.</li>
            <li> We used this product when we were transitioning to natural hair two years ago and made the process a lot easier and healed our scalps.</li>
            <li> to early to tell if it works though.</li>
            <li> Been using Alter Ego for a long time but first time trying the Nequal.  </li>
            <li> so I had to cut my hair and then went natural because it made my hair appear thicker.</li>
            <li> As soon asking I get it cut, my hair grows right back 3 days later</li>
            <li> Which was very fast, normally I do not need a relaxer until 4 to 6 month at a time and by that time my hair grows 2 inches.</li>
            <li> After using the Intensive Energizing Lotion (first bottle), my hair had finally grown back.</li>
            <li> I am back on Amazon buying my second bottle because the first one is finished.</li>
            <li> It feels tingly on scalp, it was highly recommended by several salons...</li>
            <li> Sometimes it feels extremely intense, other times its just a normal tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> Overall it really does help your hair grow back so</li>
            <li> Now on to the 3rd week of wash and treatment and all I have to say is wow.</li>
            <li> Im using whatever they use and which ever deep condition they supply for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I still have 1/4 of a bottle left and have been using for 4 complete months.  </li>
            <li> I first used this when someone gave me a half bottle to used.</li>
            <li> This product along with other Alter Ego.products made my hair grow.back fast.</li>
            <li> I bought some to try and do my own hair at home because going every 2 weeks to get my hair done is not a necessary expensive being that I&#x27;m unemployed.</li>
            <li> Since using I have less shedding and not as much hair in the comb and have seem noticeable hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost positive the back is longer because my husband notice in a few weeks of me using this produce my hair was growing longer in the back.</li>
            <li> Either way stay tuned I&#x27;ll be back in a month or so to update as far as growth, or any other changes.</li>
            <li> Slowed down my hair loss, yet to see any new hair.</li>
            <li> Just section your hair after shampooing and work it into your scalp and then either either blow dry or let dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> It thickened my hair in the center where it was becoming thin in about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Have not used this product long enough to tell of</li>
            <li> By now I was super confused</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product, my excessive hair loss has practically stopped except for the strands that normally fall out when washing.  </li>
            <li> I can see patches of hair that are two inches long all over my scalp</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strange smell.</li>
            <li> , it was upsetting because I have long curly hair.</li>
            <li> One I died my hair over the summer and it began to shed from the dye being in my hair too long.</li>
            <li> They never seen anyone&#x27;s hair grow so fast and thick.</li>
            <li> I am African American or Black if you will.</li>
            <li> Product arrived a week earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I washed my hair or put my fingers through my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It may dry your hair so use a moisturizer along with it.</li>
            <li> Then on my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> African American hair cannot be washed everyday, so I wash my hair once every weekend</li>
            <li> I have been using this for only a month and a half, already my hair grow 1-1/2 inches long..  </li>
            <li> but still the smell was most unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> Not sure about growth of my hair yet because I am transition from perming my hair to going natural.  </li>
            <li> but my scalp calmed down immediately after using and that alone kept my use very regular (two times per day).  </li>
            <li> And it arrived earlier than expected !!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I may be rating this product a little prematurely as I have only been using it on my daughter for about a month (once per week).</li>
            <li> Not working the way I expected.  </li>
            <li> Once after wasing my hair while it was wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and my bottle is almost empty and my hair hasn&#x27;t grown an inch</li>
            <li> so I only use a few drops.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of hair products, and this is the only product that can actually tame my curls.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and usually use a soft brush to massage in areas needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little less than a month</li>
            <li> I was not going bald nor had any other condition.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this along with other Alter ego products</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any increased growth but at least I didn&#x27;t have to throw out the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> The hair dresser was so shocked she called over the wash girl that took care of me the first time i came in they started speaking spanish and smiling then called another woman.</li>
            <li> I could see lots of hair going down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick hair but recently noticed my hair thinning or missing closer to my forehead or sort of</li>
            <li> I am not upset about it because as I&#x27;ve stated previously I had no life at all in my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is falling out less</li>
            <li> I have to say that within this one use I&#x27;ve had less shedding</li>
            <li> It gives me a tingling feeling for about a minute and a half</li>
            <li> My hair sheds less.</li>
            <li> The product does have a tingling sensation when applied but as someone stated in a previous post, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t believe the hype\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Ego nequal is very active and stimulating.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks to the highest but my hair comes out pretty detangled.</li>
            <li> week ago I had bald spots around my hairline and a receeding hairline after taking off a weave that had been sown on too tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really skeptical about trying new products on my hair</li>
            <li> makes it a little bit easier to detangle after washing.</li>
            <li> and I saw lots of fuzz today and the bald spots were a little fuzzy.</li>
            <li> For now what I can say is that it has a lot of menthol that gives you a stinging feeling for a little while.  </li>
            <li> I had just a little hair growth after using it, but this was not my intention for buying it.</li>
            <li> but I was using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I WILL UPDATE IN A FEW WEEKS.\\&quot;BTW&#x27;</li>
            <li> I used it everyday after showering.</li>
            <li> I apply a few drops to my hairline and then sparingly all over my scalp and massag eit in.</li>
            <li> so I will post another one in a few months.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money</li>
            <li> you can notice a difference in your hair in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> feel you get to your scalp when you put a few drops in your head.</li>
            <li> Mind you, I am an 28 African American guy and I am no longer going to be cutting my hair because its a waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> did appreciate the small little tingles.</li>
            <li> Since I was young I pulled my hair back in tight ponytails all the time, after years of doing so my edges on both sides started to thin out so bad that people started to comment on it</li>
            <li> it was unbearable and unbelievable because I have not had life in my scalp in years.</li>
            <li> They told me no more weaves or braids just continue with my weekly washes and the drops.</li>
            <li> On fence about this product&lt;br /&gt;Ibe seen small growth on my edges</li>
            <li> Also Very heavy and greasy on my hair</li>
            <li> All positive reviewa are FAKE!!</li>
            <li> but honestly I do not want to try anything because this product is working.</li>
            <li> &quot; She started using this product and my edges are growing back in like crazy.</li>
            <li> This is a common symptom of hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Alter Ego because I recently moved to a new state that has cold, dry, horrible weather, and hard water.</li>
            <li> I am usually scared to run my fingers through my hair,but I did and this time there were no shedding hairs or breakage!</li>
            <li> No more hairs in the comb!</li>
            <li> No more hairs in the sink!</li>
            <li> and I have seen subtle growth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but it works ...</li>
            <li> I always do because I try to hide my bald spot which makes it worse.</li>
            <li> My new stylist name is Lora ( a stylist in marieta): (This store is 2 minutes away in the car!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the occurrence of itch scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the other people writing these reviews are fake or crazy, but this stuff is horrible</li>
            <li> I was buying this product from my hairdresser and it was expensive.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say I now have dandruff and my scalp itches like crazy.</li>
            <li> and I have been shedding like crazy,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a disturbing feeling!</li>
            <li> It was very disturbing since I had never looked like that before.</li>
            <li> so my scalp is just as bad.</li>
            <li> My hair loss was so bad that I use to cry</li>
            <li> I felt like a lab rat who got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> When I did it myself my hair was still shedding:(  </li>
            <li> Tryi it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The thinning was very depressing but my scalp also itched and hurt.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate it!!!</li>
            <li> it started itching something awful</li>
            <li> Since being here I had been having HORRIBLE hair breakage.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s gave me bald spots.... I hate it!!!</li>
            <li> this product Amazing i love it and the smell is nice</li>
            <li> It help regrow hair that was cut from my surgery so I am very pleased</li>
            <li> Very worthy product. It thickened my hair in the center where it was becoming thin in about 2 weeks but I was using it everyday. Very soothing to the scalp</li>
            <li> This product really works! My hair was damaged and breaking constantly, I noticed improvement after two applications. I used this product in the past and my hair was at its best then. I couldnt find this product in any of the beauty supply stores, now that I found it on-line I will always keep this handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to ever review anything cause i dont have the time. But this product NeQual by Alter Ego does work.  My dominican hairdresser recommended it, I&#x27;ve seen her using it herself.  I have to tell you I&#x27;ve always had thick hair but recently noticed my hair thinning or missing closer to my forehead or sort of where I parted my hair, left or right.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference I have so much hair growth now.  I even bought one for my Mom.</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great! I got this really quickly...like within 2 days. I was nervous, but it was brand new and the box was also provided. I have been using it for a week. I will try to remember to update if I have hair growth, but the itching has stopped immediately and I only used a tiny bit.  I have a sew in weave.</li>
            <li> This product has such a strong smell I cannot stand it.  Also Very heavy and greasy on my hair but still the smell was most unpleasant to me. I have a full jar I need to throw out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I use this as a pre-poo along with hair oil. I haven&#x27;t seen any increased growth but at least I didn&#x27;t have to throw out the entire bottle. This stuff stinks to the highest but my hair comes out pretty detangled.</li>
            <li> Of cousre as a women, I expect to put something that smells nice in my hair. I have read reviews from others about the smell but I was prepared. Before I set my hair I drop some of the product onto my scalp and massage as directed. It does gives off a tingling sensation but it does not irritate. I have very dry skin so my scalp is just as bad. But it really improved my scalps condition. As for growth... IT&#x27;S GROWING</li>
            <li> Arter ego nequal intensive energizing lotion is the best..fast delivery and low prices I would buy it again..I also used the garlic shampoo and the hot oil. Thank you very much I&#x27;m very happy with my products.</li>
            <li> Love this product &amp;#60;3 you can feel it working as soon as it hits your scalp. I would definitly buy again.</li>
            <li> I JUST STARTED USING THE NEQUAL INTENSIVE ENERGIZING LOTION,AND AFTER THE FIRST USE I LIKE THE WAY IT MAKES MY SCALP FEEL. I BROUGHT THIS BECAUSE THE TOP OF MY HAIR BEGIN TO BREAK OFF AND AFTER READING THE REVIEWS I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE THIS A TRY. SO FAR I&#x27;M HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT HAS MY SCALP FEELING AND LOOKING NOW I WAIT TO SEE IF THIS WILL GROW MY HAIR BACK....I WILL UPDATE IN A FEW WEEKS.\\&quot;BTW&#x27; I AM AFRICAN AMERICAN....</li>
            <li> So I am becoming a believer. I suffer from traction alopecia and while I know I should not do styles that aggravate my scalp I always do because I try to hide my bald spot which makes it worse. Yadda yadda yadda well I went to a Dominican salon 3 weeks ago and asked for a wash treatment blow out and trim. (MY HAIR IS NATURAL) stylist looked and my hair and suggested the best products for me. She told me to use the drops whenever I come in to wash my hair. Well I am excited and please to say this product worked for me. The first week my scalp was on fire it started itching something awful it was unbearable and unbelievable because I have not had life in my scalp in years. Well I went for the 2nd wash and treatment the hairdresser looked at my scalp and said my hair grew I didn&#x27;t believe her at first but I could not deny my hair looked darker. Now on to the 3rd week of wash and treatment and all I have to say is wow. The hair dresser was so shocked she called over the wash girl that took care of me the first time i came in they started speaking spanish and smiling then called another woman. By now I was super confused I asked what&#x27;s the problem they were like mommy your hair is growing a lot. They never seen anyone&#x27;s hair grow so fast and thick. They told me no more weaves or braids just continue with my weekly washes and the drops. Also I do not use any special shampoos as yet. Im using whatever they use and which ever deep condition they supply for my natural hair. I think its the drops that is working because I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing to this point has done anything for me. I do have to say I now have dandruff and my scalp itches like crazy. I am not upset about it because as I&#x27;ve stated previously I had no life at all in my scalp. It was bald and shiny with spots. I gave up on ever having any hair again. I know this is a premature post and maybe I should wait 3 months to see results but I have already experienced so much positive results in 2 application that I am a believer. I am happy and hopeful. For the itch I will use tgel but honestly I do not want to try anything because this product is working. Again I do not know if it will work for everyone but it has worked for me and I am grateful.</li>
            <li> My beautician recommended this product to me when my daughter&#x27;s hair started breaking off.  It really works!  Her hair grew back nicely.  I would not recommend using this product if you&#x27;re getting your hair relaxed, you should use it 1-2 weeks before or after because you may feel a mild burning sensation on your scalp. Overall it really does help your hair grow back so don&#x27;t hesitate try it today.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and was was wondering if someone could comment on how they&#x27;re using this product and how often they are using it. Also, have people found it more useful when combined with the shampoo?  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now, haven&#x27;t had hair growth, my hair is still damaged, the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that My hair is a bit thicker</li>
            <li> I love this product, it helps to keep my hair strong and healthy.  I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
            <li> Not working the way I expected.  I&#x27;ve been using it since February 2015...Going to give it  few more months and see what happens.</li>
            <li> First I must say that the delivery was amazing. I purchased this on a sunday and I recieved it on thursday. I haven&#x27;t had this a full month yet but it works pretty well, so far. I am African American or Black if you will. I bought the Alter Ego because I recently moved to a new state that has cold, dry, horrible weather, and hard water. Since being here I had been having HORRIBLE hair breakage. My  hair is pretty long and I didn&#x27;t want to lose it. A friend recommended this to me. African American hair cannot be washed everyday, so I wash my hair once every weekend and I use my Alter Ego. I have seen a drastic change in strength and a reduction in breakage. Although, I must warn this product is VERY strong and you should consult a certified hairstylist/beautician before using this product. When you use this after washing and conditioning your hair, it gives your scalp a severe tingling sensation so don&#x27;t get scared. I hope it continues to work.</li>
            <li> This product is great!! I use it in my deep conditions &amp; also add to my scalp when air drying. OMG you can feel the tingle as it works to stimulate the blood flow on the scalp. I have so much new growth. I would buy again &amp; I would recommend! Seller shipped faster than scheduled. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> This is another great hair lotion that feels so good when its applied. My hair dresser started using this on my hair b/c I counld&#x27;t find the AE Revitalizing lotion. Both are great products.</li>
            <li> I went to a new Dominican hair stylist with my own supplies! My new stylist name is Lora ( a stylist in marieta): (This store is 2 minutes away in the car! Its $20 for a wash and set on Wednesday and Thursdays! )Kera Care 1st lather shampoo, Kera Care moisturizing shampoo and deep moisturizing conditioner.  Not forgetting my Alter EGO Energizing Intensive Hair Lotion for Hair Loss.  I want to share with you that my hair is no longer shedding/ breaking at all!  I am just going to go the the hair dresser every two weeks. My hair works better going the the hair dresser than trying to do it myself. When I did it myself my hair was still shedding:(  I am usually scared to run my fingers through my hair,but I did and this time there were no shedding hairs or breakage! Its nice not to hear my kids who are 8, 9 and 12, telling me that my hair is breaking and falling on my robe!  No more hairs in the comb! No more hairs in the sink! I feel alot lighter. It&#x27;s nice to hear that it is working for me. Things like this is always working for others, but now for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure to use a deep conditioner;when i didn&#x27;t use this on my hair hair it made my hair feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Lacio, lacio is a leave-in conditioner and Cristalli Liquidi for maintance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps: I just received the Alter Ego Shampoo for hair loss yesterday. I will take this with me the the hair dressers next time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year.  My hairdresser recommended it.  My hair loss was so bad that I use to cry everytime I washed my hair or put my fingers through my dry hair. I could see lots of hair going down the drain.  Since I started using this product, my excessive hair loss has practically stopped except for the strands that normally fall out when washing.  I was buying this product from my hairdresser and it was expensive.  Since I found it here at Amazon, I have been buying it here.  If you are on the fence about trying it, try it and you will see the great results!</li>
            <li> I love this product as it does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to. Plus the price is great.  Yes yes yes</li>
            <li> Very good hair treatment I use it just after washing my hair.  I have natural coily kinky hair and this treatment makes it a little bit easier to detangle after washing. Not sure about growth of my hair yet because I am transition from perming my hair to going natural.  I hope this review was helpful to someone else.</li>
            <li> This product works. I purchased this product before and it worked so well that I decided to purchased it again. 2 1/2 years ago, I cut my 10 year old loc off.  During that time I decided to put extension in my hair . Those extension were done by African braiding salon. During a six month period of braiding my hair I lost all my edges from tightest of the braids. I put this product inside my shampoo. Within a week or so I notice sprouts. My brother also used it on his balding area on his head and the product worked for him also. He notice the growth within a week.  Bottom line is this product worked for me.</li>
            <li> I am African American and my hairline was thinning in the temple area. But after two applications the hair began to grow back. Also, the rest of my hair began to strengthen and is now just georgeous.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a little over a month, however, I have seen great results with hair growth around my edges.  I am hoping the results I have seen thus far will continue, as I work toward strengthening thinning edges.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d have hair around my edges again. I started going to the Dominicans and my stylist said, \\&quot;I have product that will grow your hair back!\\&quot; She started using this product and my edges are growing back in like crazy. I bought some to try and do my own hair at home because going every 2 weeks to get my hair done is not a necessary expensive being that I&#x27;m unemployed. I&#x27;ve seen the results of this product and would highly recommend it. I hope I get the same results as my stylist does. If not, I may have to cough up $30 every 2 weeks so that I can continue getting my edges back.</li>
            <li> Good product authentic.</li>
            <li> Great Product worth it!</li>
            <li> My edges and nape have grown back in. It has been 3 months and I am ordering again. I used this once a week on wash day! Great resultsðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> love the tingle, and would buy more if peppermint oil and lavender oil didn&#x27;t do the trick also.</li>
            <li> It give you Thicker hair roots. I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks and already see a difference in thickness. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Slowed down my hair loss, yet to see any new hair. I am satisfied though for what it&#x27;s doing. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
            <li> After getting highlights and color with a perm, I had a bald patch in the front of my hair. I used this product along with biotin and the hair has grown back. I have since gone natural and I use it weekly now to gain length. Very pleased with the results. The price is more affordable through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Since i started using Alter Ego, my hair has grown. If you need your edges to be restored or if you just want healthier hair.... this is the solution for you. It may dry your hair so use a moisturizer along with it.</li>
            <li> I may be rating this product a little prematurely as I have only been using it on my daughter for about a month (once per week). I have used it in my own hair only once. The product gives a little tingle which tells me that it is refreshing my scalp. I purchased it because my daughter wants hair growth and I am loyal to the products that I see used in dominican salons. This is one of those products so I have confidence that it will work great to improve the overall health of my daughter&#x27;s hair. Alter Ego is a line that I use and trust.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 months and reallly love it.  I have been having hair loss for 2 years and had lots of thinning in the front of my scalp.  The thinning was very depressing but my scalp also itched and hurt.  This is a common symptom of hair loss.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about hair growth but my scalp calmed down immediately after using and that alone kept my use very regular (two times per day).  The serum is like water so there isn&#x27;t any residue deposited on your hair and it drys quicker than water.  Now at month 4 my hair is much thicker and It looks like it did years ago.  I can see patches of hair that are two inches long all over my scalp so this had definitely worked.  Before trying this I used vitamins, hair loss shampoos but this is by far the best.  It lasts a long time too.  I still have 1/4 of a bottle left and have been using for 4 complete months.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my hair. Ait is thicker, healthier and stronger. It also grew faster than normal. I used it everyday after showering.</li>
            <li> Alter Ego Nequal,  it is a Great product, The ingredients are certainly beneficial for the scalp to remain healthy.. Yes, I would purchase again... Absolutely !!</li>
            <li> I have decided to do a one-week revew of this product and will follow-up in a month with another review. So far I am very happy with this product. I apply it once a week (this weekend was my second application) after having conditioned my hair. I apply a few drops to my hairline and then sparingly all over my scalp and massag eit in. It is such a nice tingly feeling, you can feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;A week ago I had bald spots around my hairline and a receeding hairline after taking off a weave that had been sown on too tight. It&#x27;s been a week and I saw lots of fuzz today and the bald spots were a little fuzzy. Last week it was shiny and smooth. I had not ad an &amp;#34;OMG I&#x27;m bald&amp;#34; moment in over a decade but with this product looks like there is hope. i will provide you with feedback in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It really works I started seeing results in one week and started recommending to all my friends and family. I have taken before and after pics to see if it works and it does.</li>
            <li> I first used this when someone gave me a half bottle to used. I know it works and I noticed after several weeks my hair become thicker. This works to help your hair become thicker.</li>
            <li> On fence about this product&lt;br /&gt;Ibe seen small growth on my edges but I also made sure to stimulate scalp with massage w/ finger tips and warp up at night.&lt;br /&gt;I did appreciate the small little tingles. Gave me sense it was working. Definitely great after a wash I used dabs all over head and massaged in.&lt;br /&gt;I did use it 2x daily on my edges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may purchase again</li>
            <li> i love it it work excellent.</li>
            <li> Great shopping! Product arrived within 4 days of placing the order. Have not used this product long enough to tell of it works. It does have a strange smell. I prefer the rejuvenating lotion by alter ego which also comes in a similar bottle with droplets to apply to your scalp. It smells so much better and doesn&#x27;t leave the tingly feeling on my scalp. I have received tremendous hair growth with that product. I will be going back to that</li>
            <li> Makes my entire scalp tingle when I use it after shampoo and deep conditioning. I always follow with a leave in moisture based conditioner and so far I&#x27;m seeing some results. Still too early to give a complete review so I will post another one in a few months. Seems like a promising product.</li>
            <li> I have dreads and at times my hair line was thinning out. A friend recommended this product and boy does it work. Continuos use allows for quick results</li>
            <li> The length and strength of my hair has been miraculous with this product. Smells great! I will forever purchase it.</li>
            <li> Ego nequal is very active and stimulating. I love the stimulating effect on my scalp whenever i used it and i think that it helps with hair growth too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 weeks now. I apply to my scalp once a week. I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the occurrence of itch scalp. My hair looks and feels healthier. Be aware there is a very intense &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; to the scalp, but it does dissipate after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Recommend it . its great if your loosing hair.you&#x27;ll see the difference right a way</li>
            <li> just been using this twice, i like the tingly feel so much it relieves my headache.. its still too soon to say whether or not it will work but im thinking it would :)</li>
            <li> I bought this over 8 months ago because I have lost my hairline. If you have a bold hairline and you are trying to recover it, this is not the product for you. Now, for reducing hair breakage, maybe a lil bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the good reviews, I still don&#x27;t know if it is working or not, as for every product I think you should use it for at least 6 months to really know if it is good or not, so I will do that.  For now what I can say is that it has a lot of menthol that gives you a stinging feeling for a little while.  My hair is falling out less but I am also using rosemary oil rubbing on my scalp before washing my hair and probably that is helping too. I believe it must work within time otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t have so many good reviews, so I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect, on time, and the product in perfect conditions, and this is not the first time and always is in the same way</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product .. And it arrived earlier than expected !! Great !!</li>
            <li> All positive reviewa are FAKE!! you can tell by go through their pervious reviews!! i finish the whole bottle and didnt see any result. what a waste of money</li>
            <li> Hair came out in clumps, not recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the other people writing these reviews are fake or crazy, but this stuff is horrible I felt like a lab rat who got a bad batch. My hair was falling out in clumps! Unless you want to stay bald.. do not purchase this stuff!</li>
            <li> Just started so this is my honesty review tingling to the max...irritation on skin just turns you red for a while no harm overall good product hopefully stops the breakage</li>
            <li> My hair has grown over 4-5 inches in the last year.. its  a lot for me because i had a stunt in hair growth for about 2 years!! slow and steady but god willing it will be 4 inches more in a few more months!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product after reading the reviews. I must say that I was loosing so much hair (especiallly on the front) that you could see my scalp (I was getting BOLD). It was very disturbing since I had never looked like that before. After using the Intensive Energizing Lotion (first bottle), my hair had finally grown back. I can&#x27;t see my scalp anymore. It is a GREAT feeling. I am back on Amazon buying my second bottle because the first one is finished. I would keep using this lotion without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Pecfect product for me.  it really works</li>
            <li> Does your scalp smell? Itch? Sting?  This product will relieve these problems. This product will help your hair grow. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you want your hair to grow fast!</li>
            <li> Since I was young I pulled my hair back in tight ponytails all the time, after years of doing so my edges on both sides started to thin out so bad that people started to comment on it, it was upsetting because I have long curly hair. I started going to a Dominican lady who used these drops on all her clients and she recommend that I buy them and use them at home as well. That was about 3 months ago and I will say that I am soooooooooooo happy with the change! My edges are full and long! It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve been able to say that :0D!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product felt great, but I am still in the process of my trial period to see if I get consistent results. It has only been used twice. I will have to wait to give an honest review after a month or so of use.</li>
            <li> Good smell and cool scalp have effectively stopped hair loss. But I haven&#x27;t found it could promote hair growth, just waiting for......</li>
            <li> I just go a relaxer so all my new growth was gone when I first started using this product, which was awesome because I was able to see how fast  this product work. Which was very fast, normally I do not need a relaxer until 4 to 6 month at a time and by that time my hair grows 2 inches. I have been using this for only a month and a half, already my hair grow 1-1/2 inches long..  In the front off my hair. I&#x27;m almost positive the back is longer because my husband notice in a few weeks of me using this produce my hair was growing longer in the back. He did not know at the time I was using this produce. My hair dresser also notice my hair longer in the back. Good product....</li>
            <li> it was a gift to a friend</li>
            <li> It works, but the smell keeps it a weekend event. The smell is like a cross of bengay and rosemary. It is intense, and I can imagine that it will induce morning sickness. Best to apply when you have time to let it air out. It does air out after 2-3hours.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product started using it after hair loss around my hairline... After using this product hair began to grow definitely stimulated hair growth.. I actually felt my  hair follicles tingling after using this product. My beautician recommended it great product</li>
            <li> Have recommended this product to my beautician. This lotion is a miracle worker. The first shipment was damaged. Had to go through too much to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> This product is potent.  I like it very much.  I have seen some hair growth. I really want to try more products from this line.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this.  I was not going bald nor had any other condition.  Just wanted my hair to hurry up &amp; grow a bit, plus my temples were thinning some.  Well this has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Negual intensive lotion drop has given me a second chance to regrow hair lose and regain confidence back with lustreouse  strong hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Used the product twice. Once after wasing my hair while it was wet. Then on my dry scalp. It did tingle (on wet hair) but not bad. The smell is okay too. I have to say that within this one use I&#x27;ve had less shedding so I&#x27;ll see how it works. Only thing is I cant tell if it&#x27;s a light oil or what. Either way stay tuned I&#x27;ll be back in a month or so to update as far as growth, or any other changes. But I like it (a lot) so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little less than a month but my hair has already begin to show improvement</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!!! IF UR HAVING HAIR ISSUES GET IT!! GREAT FOR MOISTURE GROWTH AND THINNING HAIR. ITS AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and saw noted improvement in my hair.  I began using after the birth of my son significantly helped with the shedding and growth.  This product smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this product it&#x27;s shipped/packaged good I order it quite often me and my sisters and we have never had a problem. We used this product when we were transitioning to natural hair two years ago and made the process a lot easier and healed our scalps. wish they sold it in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about this product but that it has helped my hair grow a lot and much more healthier. Will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks and I love it! My hair was shedding a lot before I started using this product now it may shed 3 strands of hair a day.  Take a chance on this product because it really works.  I&#x27;m really skeptical about trying new products on my hair but this product is awesome!  Tryi it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> tingles scalp don&#x27;t know howffective for growth</li>
            <li> Great product, use it every week.</li>
            <li> The product has started to grow my hair.</li>
            <li> After 3 years of traumatic hair loss, I finally found this product with the recommendation of a specialist. I&#x27;ve been using it for appx 6 months. I noticed a difference after the very first use, my hair was more maneagible. Over time my hair appeared thicker and after 6 months I must say, it has restored my confidence. I feel the best is yet to come but find my anxiety over gair loss is less and less with each use. I gave it a 4 because my hair does seem more dry. It gives my hair texture while others may be bothered by it. I used once a day and apply only to the scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and my bottle is almost empty and my hair hasn&#x27;t grown an inch this was a waiste of my money never purchasing this again very disapointed</li>
            <li> Love this product! Definitely helps to insure a healthy scalp!</li>
            <li> love it!!! bought it twice already!! def recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I learned about this at my salon, it is a Dominican Dooby Salon.  I liked it so much that I looked to purchase my own, and I totally love it! It is great for my hair, and it totally rocks it!  This product is great, I will use  it forever!</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves hair smooth and slky. I have tried hundreds of hair products, and this is the only product that can actually tame my curls. LOVE IT AND WOULD RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE. IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Omg very good product</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend! !! Amazing product! !</li>
            <li> I can feel the tingling in my hair so it seems to be waking my scalp up...to early to tell if it works though. More details later. It did arrive on time</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!  It really works.  If your hair is thinning and falling out, please give it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok, but would not buy it again. I have been using it for 2 months and see no difference.  It does cause a stinging feeling on the scalp that takes a while to get used to!  It&#x27;s a disturbing feeling!</li>
            <li> Alter Ego Nequal Intensive Energizing Lotion burns (really burns!).  I&#x27;ve been using it once a week on my edges when I shampoo my hair for a month now and see no noticeable difference in my hair&#x27;s health or growth.  Since the box had no instructions, I googled for some info and some website stated use every three days after shampooing.  Since I shampoo weekly, I used Nequal weekly. I have afro hair, no relaxer or chemical dyes.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  Just section your hair after shampooing and work it into your scalp and then either either blow dry or let dry naturally.  I saw an increased growth after 3 uses....</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product it really strengthen the hair and makes it so much more healthy; been using it for over a year now and my hair length and volume is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a month trying to grow in the sides of my hair but it hasn&#x27;t worked at all for me. I do feel a tingling sensation when I apply it, but I have not seen any hair growth. Maybe others are having more success.</li>
            <li> Product arrived a week earlier than expected! This is a great product and should be used daily.  I have been using it for a month and it really does work! I have tried everything and this is the first time I have seen results! I will continue to use it.  VERY happy with the product and the seller!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after a hairstylist recommended it to me. I use it once a week on my scalp and massage it through. It gives me a tingling feeling for about a minute and a half but it goes away. It really works my hair has not been falling out anymore and its actually been growing out healthy. I highly recommend this product. My hair is naturally curly and really oily so I only use a few drops. I&#x27;ve used other stuff before but this thing works better and faster.</li>
            <li> this is the best hair energizing product i have used.  you can notice a difference in your hair in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Been using Alter Ego for a long time but first time trying the Nequal.  You can actually feel the tingling on your scalp.  Great product</li>
            <li> My hair sheds less. Very relaxing when I use it.  It tingles when you put it on your scalp....love it! I waiting to see if my hair grows faster.</li>
            <li> im happy with this product so far so good,my hair has definitely slow down shedding with each use.would buy again</li>
            <li> I tried this out and started making my hair growth In a week I seen the difference will be buying another bottle win this one is finish...</li>
            <li> It feels tingly on scalp, it was highly recommended by several salons... Have been using on balding spots and my hair has grown back!!! Great product to use..</li>
            <li> I had use this product twice and my hair already looks different, as I use it every week I&#x27;m sure my hair will look even better</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after seeing some reviews about it on YouTube. I usually place a few drops in my hair after shampooing, and it makes my scalp feel great!!!! I had just a little hair growth after using it, but this was not my intention for buying it. I love it and it really makes my hair feel completely renewed, refreshed, clean, and full of life after each use.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it ... It feel nice in the scalp ... It&#x27;s a little expensive but it works ...</li>
            <li> I gave it a four only because I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and haven&#x27;t seen any growth buttttt, it does feel amazing on my scalp nice and tingly feeling. Makes my scalp feel super clean. Be where though as it has a very strong scent!</li>
            <li> I have soft, fine hair and it easily gets damaged when permed or in the Sun too long.  I purchased Alter Ego Nequal Intenive Energizing Lotion as recommended by my Dominican hair stylist.  You can actually feel it penetrating your scalp.  I use it everyday and usually use a soft brush to massage in areas needed.  I absolutely love the results from this product.</li>
            <li> My mom has this product in our bathroom, and after reading the reviews I&#x27;m definitely going to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give another review in like four months.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product about a month ago specifically to kick start some growth around my edges. I know one month is not enough time for drastic.changes to take effect. However, this review is to inform you to not believe the hype about the intense tingle of this product. What you do feel is the oxygen getting to your scalp kind of like a cool breeze. I use the product every three days after cleansing my scalp. Overall I like the product and will continue use for growth ans strength.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist because of my thinning edges. I have been using the product twice a day for four weeks and I have seen subtle growth. I am going to continue to use the product for two to three months to give it a chance. The product does have a tingling sensation when applied but as someone stated in a previous post, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t believe the hype\\&quot;.I will keep you informed of my progress.</li>
            <li> Get this if your hair is falling out or shedding and you have tried everything else. It works!!! I had surgery and I have been shedding like crazy, so much so I had to cut my hair and then went natural because it made my hair appear thicker. I have use this 3 times and I notice with the very first use I vast difference in my shedding.</li>
            <li> Excellent service////excellent product !!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out in the shower, when I brushed it (in the brush), so I asked my doctor and his reply was \\&quot;you&#x27;re getting older\\&quot;. I started looking for items and found Alter Ego Intense Energizing Lotion. I ordered it and will NEVER be out of it. My hair stopped falling out and I can grow longer hair because it&#x27;s not breaking either. This product does not make your hair greasy once you apply it. It&#x27;s more like a tea water. It burns due to the ingredients, but it passes and you&#x27;ll look great. Some people have noticed that my hair looks fuller and I told them about the product. Do not hesitate to purchase this product. It does what it said it will.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product to generate hair growth. Had an actual ball spot and after 4 weeks of using saw significant hair growth. Product tingles on scalp would not recommend using after a relaxer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with other Alter ego products and I love them all. This one is my favorite because I love the menthol feel you get to your scalp when you put a few drops in your head. Sometimes it feels extremely intense, other times its just a normal tingly feeling. Mind you, I am an 28 African American guy and I am no longer going to be cutting my hair because its a waste of money to me. As soon asking I get it cut, my hair grows right back 3 days later and I have the proof to back it up. I figured using this would help my hair grow even faster than it normally do but I guess at the super fast rate my hair grows, it cant get any faster. by the way, this product makes your hair look so healthy and shiny. I will add pics. This product along with other Alter Ego.products made my hair grow.back fast. I applied a wave/curl kit that took put the sides of my hair and.boy did this help grow it back quickly.</li>
            <li> Along with the Alter Ego Energizing hair loss shampoo I use this for too prevent shedding.I was experiencing breakage for  two reasons. One I died my hair over the summer and it began to shed from the dye being in my hair too long. Two, styling over time with heat just wreaks havoc on your hair. Since using I have less shedding and not as much hair in the comb and have seem noticeable hair growth.</li>
