            <li> Very disappointing order, hope they will resend the correct version, i did not want to pay this money for only 4 mini products.</li>

            <li> YOU HAVE TO READ THE DESCRIPTION PEOPLE ONLY SOME IS GIVEN TO YOU NOT THE WHOLE THING!!!!! SO STOP COMPLAINING READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems everyone has the same problem. Only part of what they thought they ordered was recieved, and what did come in was just so so. Now a days I prefer younique brand cosmetics over anything else. If you haven&#x27;t heard of it they are th eones with the original 3D mascara. Its way better and is 100% natural with no fillers or chemicals so you get the same exact product every single time. Plus its guaranteed.  Go to lashalert.com if you want to try it</li>
            <li> in order its says 8 pcs  plus new  perfume i got just 7 pcs , i rally disappointed in this order</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed  with the products because on the picture there are a lot of products and I received only some of that.</li>
            <li> All was received as shown.  I am glad to get the large size facial cleanser.  Love love love the soft color of the lip stick.</li>
            <li> picture is pretty much deceiving as it shows more than 8 items. secondly the sizes is very small (i think they are travel size)</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with it...She loves it...</li>
