    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>That&#x27;s just AWESOME!   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent price and service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since The Grooming Lounge gave this Best Hair Loss Treatment for 2013, I have to weigh in on this...</li>
            <li>This is incredibly obnoxious.</li>
            <li>The spray applicator works great.  </li>
            <li>My grandma and great grandma suffered from frontal hail loss</li>
            <li>happy with  Spectral DNC.</li>
            <li>Then I got the bright idea to use both together.</li>
            <li>This product is superior to every 15% minoxidil product I tried since Xandrox.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, bottle 2 was not as good as bottle 1.</li>
            <li>The product used to be good, but it seems to have lost its potency as ingredients  have changed over the years.</li>
            <li>Use it with the shampoo and conditioner and the results are really good.  </li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;I have been using Perfect Image 15% Minoxidil using a dropper with some success</li>
            <li>and maybe they would have more happy, repeat customers.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt it is mor effective than Rogaine and is a good solution for men looking to maintain their hair.</li>
            <li>as effective as the DNC-N or c.)</li>
            <li>the package was kind of smashed when I got it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of new hair growing on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the results</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say which of the two is the more effective</li>
            <li>I figured the vasodilator in this would do more good than the minoxidil (most people say blood flow is the most important for nourishing hair).</li>
            <li>The precision nozzle made the product application easy, more effective re targeting thinning areas, and more efficient re conservation of the product.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering elsewhere but am still satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It delivers excellent efficacy with a reduced potential for side effects.</li>
            <li>Try hair cloning instead, or better yet invest in a WIG.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post more when I know more.  </li>
            <li>I tried this looking for a better product to help regrowth.</li>
            <li>Better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>this, for my husband, worked a lot better than the concentrated lotion version.&lt;br /&gt;easier</li>
            <li>So if you like it, I guess you&#x27;d better stock up.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>, this product will make the hair look somewhat better, thicker.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Smell is ok for what it is.  </li>
            <li>I also have many hairs that were already perm that are growing alot faster.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a pretty good effect on hair texture.</li>
            <li>The product is fairly easy to work in and I have not had any problems with discoloration.     </li>
            <li>Easy application and quality product.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t at all concerned with my bald spot and fine with the thought of losing it all.</li>
            <li>It was like putting super glue in my hair!</li>
            <li>The product was sent as promised but when I read the detailed instructions, i decided it was not what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>and she said there isn&#x27;t a product on the market that is worth the health risks, which are many.  </li>
            <li>realize that most of us who suffer from hair loss are longing for a solution to our problem but it isn&#x27;t worth trying these products.</li>
            <li>but after closer inspection it was because my hairline had filled in dramatically.</li>
            <li>It was no longer listed on their web site at that time, and I&#x27;ve confirmed with customer support.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth the money, but after using the product I will be buying again.</li>
            <li>Overall I am quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li>There is a light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is fabulous,</li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks of using this, along with Revita shampoo, I have significant hair growth.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I lost a significant amount of hair after being on Topamax.</li>
            <li>I was aware that most products like this require on-going use to remain effective so to be on the safe side, I was diligent about using it daily.  </li>
            <li>In short I can&#x27;t recommend this product (DNC-N), though it may be the most effective out there.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even sure if it has as much minoxidil in it.</li>
            <li>Maybe they used the full recommended dose?</li>
            <li>I have used both Rogaine and this product, and I feel this one is superior in terms of its actual relationship to causing hair growth.</li>
            <li>I took a 30 day pic and will take a pic every 10 days till I see full results.</li>
            <li>The new hair is very fine</li>
            <li>Firstly I want to say that I had been using this product for the past 4 months with excellent results.</li>
            <li>I use Rogaine foam for my crown and have adequate maintenance at this time with this regime.  </li>
            <li>but it was delivered quickly to me....</li>
            <li>an seems to be more effective than other products</li>
            <li>This is the very first time I have ever endorsed a product.</li>
            <li>A great deal of Waste.</li>
            <li>nice stuff,oderless goes on well,can be used on the entire sclape</li>
            <li>I say that based on my own hair loss above my temples in the receding hair line area.  </li>
            <li>as 15% Minoxidil d.) or in it owns right?</li>
            <li>regular formula without Nanoxidil is by comparison clear and has a pleasant odor and could be worn all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With that said, my hair began to grow back very quickly!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a winning combo for a female on meds or cancer tx</li>
            <li>More on that one later.</li>
            <li>And this is the first product that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>DS Lab Spectral is the first product since Xandrox 12 and 15 that have maintained my hair line or at least greatly slowed the rate of loss and recede.  </li>
            <li>I will have more to update on as I get further along with the product.</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been able to maintain my hair using it (last 4 months).</li>
            <li>which only helped rip more of it out.</li>
            <li>It was the first time in 60 years that I have ever had headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not miss one day for the first 6 months.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>DS Labs needs to get it together and produce a consistent product</li>
            <li>review of Spectral DNC: a couple years ago, it seemed to work better than regular minoxidil.</li>
            <li>(well, what&#x27;s left of it :)</li>
            <li>first time trying it</li>
            <li>It has been a month now , well maybe it reduces the amount of hair loss , but for sure it does not grow hair back.</li>
            <li>This product seems to do exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I see many many small colorless hairs growing where my hairline used to be which should become perm hairs.</li>
            <li>, this is my first application I can not comment on it&#x27;s efficiency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost through the first bottle of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can not speak to effectiveness as I&#x27;m still on the first bottle.</li>
            <li>Whatever the case may be, I&#x27;m here to say WOW it really works!!!  </li>
            <li>I also really like the non-alcohol formula which smells very good and feels like a skin lotion, which is quite different from the typical formulations out on the market today.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray nozzle is great, just save it for future bottle or other brands to make sure you have the same one.</li>
            <li>No one knows for sure how good these products are but it seems to at least help keep what you have, if not limited regroth.</li>
            <li>Also, the precision spray nozzle was not included, and instead replaced by a cheap mister (photo uploaded above) in addition to the dropper, which I do not find useful.</li>
            <li>My most recent order was much lighter in color</li>
            <li>Good luck to anyone that tries it!!!!</li>
            <li>have yet to see any positive change.</li>
            <li>It seemed at first to be working, but now I don&#x27;t think there has been much change since at all.</li>
            <li>Where it was almost completely bald, within three days, now had a full carpet of peach-fuzz.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it works real well and will continue using it as long as it maitains my hair.</li>
            <li>All of which would have been just fine if it had only worked.  </li>
            <li>She also told me that there is a very high chance that discontinued use will result in thinner hair than I started with.</li>
            <li>it may take a little time but in the end it is amazing</li>
            <li>DS labs will vehemently deny this claim but the fact of the matter is that it really is.  </li>
            <li>The lack of the precision spray nozzle really bothers me</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very still.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see putting N on very often if at all</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I really think it&#x27;s the combination of the 2 that works together opposed to just the spray.</li>
            <li>I must say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff did NOTHING for me absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a way to get it closer to the scalp without so much of it landing on the hair.</li>
            <li>thanks to the seller I had not to wait....</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>I really do believe this product works.</li>
            <li>It took over 8 weeks of using it twice a day, but hair started to grow back in; at first &#x27;wild&#x27; hairs, but eventually more normal looking.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t give up it really works</li>
            <li>I rated it a 1 star for obvious reasons and if you are looking for a topical hair loss treatment honestly don&#x27;t get this product.</li>
            <li>therefore I am terrified that if I am not consistent with the use of this product that I will even lose more of it.</li>
            <li>I have new hair growth and my hair is much healthier and fuller.</li>
            <li>It was concentrated mainly on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting miraculous results, but my main problem with this product is the inconsistency in the product&#x27;s color, texture, and packaging.</li>
            <li>and I use whatever decent shampoo 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes this product might stimulate some hair on my head.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally high hairline</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve been using DS labs products for a few years now.</li>
            <li>will continue to use for a few more months to see if anything changes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought they were equally good, but in going *back* to this formula, my new bottle is just complete shit.</li>
            <li>so I got the DNC-N together with the new F7 from Canada.  </li>
            <li>You may use them in tandem with the new F7.  </li>
            <li>DNC, the new hair you grew during treatment will shed in two to three months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll embrace my new look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To begin, I see that one reviewer found information on the company website stating that discontinuing use will result in loss of new growth</li>
            <li>I have had  new hair come</li>
            <li>The second package is not working as well; the first made my hair go gangbusters in growth.</li>
            <li>but I found statements on their site that said exactly the opposite.  </li>
            <li>I also have many new perm hairs on the front of my scalp and a few starting to be perm along my hairline.</li>
            <li>This is fraud pure an simple.</li>
            <li>and it clearly states it must be used</li>
            <li>supposed to be clear and b.)</li>
            <li>wow this revita stuff works</li>
            <li>It had completely stopped my hair loss and was beginning to regrow some that I had lost.</li>
            <li>The bottle and box should come completely sealed.</li>
            <li>I have just started using this product and have no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>similar product I tried was much easier to work with.</li>
            <li>When I initially used it as directed in the instructions, I began to see results that were very encouraging.  </li>
            <li>And to note, I do NOT have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I and my girlfriend are the only ones who can really notice growth.</li>
            <li>and wow is it sticky it feels almost like glue</li>
            <li>and it takes about 6 months before you really see a big difference..</li>
            <li>Dont know if this is a fake product with good label or if the product was old.  </li>
            <li>It was so thick we had to add water which probably hurt the product more.</li>
            <li>three months seemed I was thinning more, after six I could plainly see I lost hair big time,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(in the DNC-N) is a new compound, built around a molecule that is structurally similar to Minoxidil</li>
            <li>I definitely see new hair growth where I&#x27;ve applied the product.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a major hassle and a hair color changer</li>
            <li>Additional ingredients enhance the activity of Nanoxidil for multiple mechanisms of action.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it is a complete imposter or what, but my hair loss/ shedding is OUT OF CONTROL despite regular use</li>
            <li>but I think it may not be tolerated by a large population of users if I&#x27;m correct that my symptoms are due to it.</li>
            <li>Only negative is the last order or most recent</li>
            <li>Minoxidil normally turns my brown hair to a shade very near black.</li>
            <li>I am 31 year old African male and maybe a Norwood 2a on the scale.</li>
            <li>My brows have not grown back completely, but I have seen a vast improvement, &amp; will continue to use the product twice a day.</li>
            <li>The only negative Is that it dries on my hair like extra strong hairspray.</li>
            <li>Being a female with a straight hairline can make your face look boxy and masculine if you have a round or square jawline, so this helped me tremendouly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Rogaine in the past without much success.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty certain it&#x27;s due to this product and not any other changes to my shampoo or other hair care routines.  </li>
            <li>What I received has a strong bad sickly sweet fragrance, is nearly clear, and evaporates rapidly without leaving hair stiff, unlike the old formula.</li>

            <li> In short I can&#x27;t recommend this product (DNC-N), though it may be the most effective out there.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even sure if it has as much minoxidil in it.</li>
            <li> Maybe they used the full recommended dose?</li>
            <li> I have used both Rogaine and this product, and I feel this one is superior in terms of its actual relationship to causing hair growth.</li>
            <li> I took a 30 day pic and will take a pic every 10 days till I see full results.</li>
            <li> The new hair is very fine</li>
            <li> Firstly I want to say that I had been using this product for the past 4 months with excellent results.</li>
            <li> I use Rogaine foam for my crown and have adequate maintenance at this time with this regime.  </li>
            <li> but it was delivered quickly to me....</li>
            <li> an seems to be more effective than other products</li>
            <li> This is the very first time I have ever endorsed a product.</li>
            <li> A great deal of Waste.</li>
            <li> nice stuff,oderless goes on well,can be used on the entire sclape</li>
            <li> I say that based on my own hair loss above my temples in the receding hair line area.  </li>
            <li> as 15% Minoxidil d.) or in it owns right?</li>
            <li> regular formula without Nanoxidil is by comparison clear and has a pleasant odor and could be worn all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With that said, my hair began to grow back very quickly!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a winning combo for a female on meds or cancer tx</li>
            <li> More on that one later.</li>
            <li> And this is the first product that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> DS Lab Spectral is the first product since Xandrox 12 and 15 that have maintained my hair line or at least greatly slowed the rate of loss and recede.  </li>
            <li> I will have more to update on as I get further along with the product.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been able to maintain my hair using it (last 4 months).</li>
            <li> which only helped rip more of it out.</li>
            <li> It was the first time in 60 years that I have ever had headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not miss one day for the first 6 months.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> DS Labs needs to get it together and produce a consistent product</li>
            <li> review of Spectral DNC: a couple years ago, it seemed to work better than regular minoxidil.</li>
            <li> (well, what&#x27;s left of it :)</li>
            <li> first time trying it</li>
            <li> It has been a month now , well maybe it reduces the amount of hair loss , but for sure it does not grow hair back.</li>
            <li> This product seems to do exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I see many many small colorless hairs growing where my hairline used to be which should become perm hairs.</li>
            <li> , this is my first application I can not comment on it&#x27;s efficiency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost through the first bottle of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can not speak to effectiveness as I&#x27;m still on the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Whatever the case may be, I&#x27;m here to say WOW it really works!!!  </li>
            <li> I also really like the non-alcohol formula which smells very good and feels like a skin lotion, which is quite different from the typical formulations out on the market today.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle is great, just save it for future bottle or other brands to make sure you have the same one.</li>
            <li> No one knows for sure how good these products are but it seems to at least help keep what you have, if not limited regroth.</li>
            <li> Also, the precision spray nozzle was not included, and instead replaced by a cheap mister (photo uploaded above) in addition to the dropper, which I do not find useful.</li>
            <li> My most recent order was much lighter in color</li>
            <li> Good luck to anyone that tries it!!!!</li>
            <li> have yet to see any positive change.</li>
            <li> It seemed at first to be working, but now I don&#x27;t think there has been much change since at all.</li>
            <li> Where it was almost completely bald, within three days, now had a full carpet of peach-fuzz.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it works real well and will continue using it as long as it maitains my hair.</li>
            <li> All of which would have been just fine if it had only worked.  </li>
            <li> She also told me that there is a very high chance that discontinued use will result in thinner hair than I started with.</li>
            <li> it may take a little time but in the end it is amazing</li>
            <li> DS labs will vehemently deny this claim but the fact of the matter is that it really is.  </li>
            <li> The lack of the precision spray nozzle really bothers me</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very still.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see putting N on very often if at all</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I really think it&#x27;s the combination of the 2 that works together opposed to just the spray.</li>
            <li> I must say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff did NOTHING for me absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to get it closer to the scalp without so much of it landing on the hair.</li>
            <li> thanks to the seller I had not to wait....</li>
            <li> Thanks..</li>
            <li> I really do believe this product works.</li>
            <li> It took over 8 weeks of using it twice a day, but hair started to grow back in; at first &#x27;wild&#x27; hairs, but eventually more normal looking.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t give up it really works</li>
            <li> I rated it a 1 star for obvious reasons and if you are looking for a topical hair loss treatment honestly don&#x27;t get this product.</li>
            <li> therefore I am terrified that if I am not consistent with the use of this product that I will even lose more of it.</li>
            <li> I have new hair growth and my hair is much healthier and fuller.</li>
            <li> It was concentrated mainly on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting miraculous results, but my main problem with this product is the inconsistency in the product&#x27;s color, texture, and packaging.</li>
            <li> and I use whatever decent shampoo 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes this product might stimulate some hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally high hairline</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been using DS labs products for a few years now.</li>
            <li> will continue to use for a few more months to see if anything changes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought they were equally good, but in going *back* to this formula, my new bottle is just complete shit.</li>
            <li> so I got the DNC-N together with the new F7 from Canada.  </li>
            <li> You may use them in tandem with the new F7.  </li>
            <li> DNC, the new hair you grew during treatment will shed in two to three months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll embrace my new look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To begin, I see that one reviewer found information on the company website stating that discontinuing use will result in loss of new growth</li>
            <li> I have had  new hair come</li>
            <li> The second package is not working as well; the first made my hair go gangbusters in growth.</li>
            <li> but I found statements on their site that said exactly the opposite.  </li>
            <li> I also have many new perm hairs on the front of my scalp and a few starting to be perm along my hairline.</li>
            <li> This is fraud pure an simple.</li>
            <li> and it clearly states it must be used</li>
            <li> supposed to be clear and b.)</li>
            <li> wow this revita stuff works</li>
            <li> It had completely stopped my hair loss and was beginning to regrow some that I had lost.</li>
            <li> The bottle and box should come completely sealed.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product and have no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> similar product I tried was much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> When I initially used it as directed in the instructions, I began to see results that were very encouraging.  </li>
            <li> And to note, I do NOT have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I and my girlfriend are the only ones who can really notice growth.</li>
            <li> and wow is it sticky it feels almost like glue</li>
            <li> and it takes about 6 months before you really see a big difference..</li>
            <li> Dont know if this is a fake product with good label or if the product was old.  </li>
            <li> It was so thick we had to add water which probably hurt the product more.</li>
            <li> three months seemed I was thinning more, after six I could plainly see I lost hair big time,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (in the DNC-N) is a new compound, built around a molecule that is structurally similar to Minoxidil</li>
            <li> I definitely see new hair growth where I&#x27;ve applied the product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a major hassle and a hair color changer</li>
            <li> Additional ingredients enhance the activity of Nanoxidil for multiple mechanisms of action.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is a complete imposter or what, but my hair loss/ shedding is OUT OF CONTROL despite regular use</li>
            <li> but I think it may not be tolerated by a large population of users if I&#x27;m correct that my symptoms are due to it.</li>
            <li> Only negative is the last order or most recent</li>
            <li> Minoxidil normally turns my brown hair to a shade very near black.</li>
            <li> I am 31 year old African male and maybe a Norwood 2a on the scale.</li>
            <li> My brows have not grown back completely, but I have seen a vast improvement, &amp; will continue to use the product twice a day.</li>
            <li> The only negative Is that it dries on my hair like extra strong hairspray.</li>
            <li> Being a female with a straight hairline can make your face look boxy and masculine if you have a round or square jawline, so this helped me tremendouly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rogaine in the past without much success.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty certain it&#x27;s due to this product and not any other changes to my shampoo or other hair care routines.  </li>
            <li> What I received has a strong bad sickly sweet fragrance, is nearly clear, and evaporates rapidly without leaving hair stiff, unlike the old formula.</li>
            <li> People are right that the black paint smears a little</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long (2 inches?)</li>
            <li> was now an inch long and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This in combination with their shampoo and condition not only kept my from falling out but regrew a lot of hair and closed the widening part and bald spot after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I switched to another Minoxidil 5% product for 2 weeks and while my symptoms improved they did not completely clear up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So for other users is this regular formula a.)</li>
            <li> My hairline was running in the other direction literally and as a 34 yo female I was freaking out.</li>
            <li> generic did, possibly due to propylene glycol.</li>
            <li> I learned to let it dry for an hour or two before putting on a hat.  </li>
            <li> So far after 3 mos of use, i&#x27;ve seen no more hair re-growth than i would with Kirkland brand.</li>
            <li> and I do not want to be a premature victim of that.</li>
            <li> THE NEW FORMULA SUCKS.</li>
            <li> I am experimenting with adding back the DSL product just to my temples or just to my crown to see if using less product has any impact, and I also plan to talk to a dermatologist in case I&#x27;m just experiencing an unrelated bout with psoriasis/dandruff.  </li>
            <li> This can be be reduced but still working on that (trying to see if comeing when wet vs dry).</li>
            <li> only two of my three previous orders have appeared to have been tampered with (bottle seal partially removed).</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with this product because it did make the statement that if it was not used regularly there was the possibility of shedding.  </li>
            <li> Today I am stuck with over $125 worth of useless product.  </li>
            <li> To The Grooming Lounge&#x27;s credit, they provided my with a partial credit upon receipt of the returned, remaining bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years since loosing hair( age related,  etc.)  </li>
            <li> I am waiting to reorder the right one, but am hesitant to do so for fear of ending up with the wrong one again.&lt;br /&gt;Sharon</li>
            <li> I decided to go with a little higher quality Minoxidil solution because I didn&#x27;t want my hair  being in worse shape than I started with.&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful when you squirt this stuff</li>
            <li> Few people who experience minoxidil sensitivity, which may include irritation and swelling, are less likely to experience these effects with Nanoxidil.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I probably will stick with less harsh hair loss prevention products in the future.</li>
            <li> so please read my other reviews too, use all this and some rogaine</li>
            <li> Based on other users&#x27; reviews, part of the quality deterioration seems be the result of DS Labs&#x27; taking ingredient sourcing offshore, and also due to their going public.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or any other product just get a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I noticed a formula change.  </li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with other things though.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to other women who are losing their brows as their hormones begin to fluctuate.</li>
            <li> The second ingredient in DS Labs is propylene glycol, not sure of the percentage, but it doesnt my me itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyways, The DNC-N smells like Vinegar and stays  wet half the day.</li>
            <li> The new shipment/formula did not work, my hair all fell back out even though I was still using the products regularly, AND I STARTED GETTING PAINFUL HEADACHES.  </li>
            <li> Still love the water base vs. the alcohol of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product seemed to be old, very thick, and does not come out of the dispenser with ease.</li>
            <li> your hair is as sensitive as mine, thin or sheds a lot anyways.</li>
            <li> The solution is watered down and not what is advertised.</li>
            <li> The oil helps hold the treatment in place longer so it doesn&#x27;t run down your face.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair that has  also been affected by unfortunate health.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are not as thick as they once were, but I can now get away with just dotting with my eyebrow pencil where my brows are a little sparser, instead of having to draw entire sections on my skin.</li>
            <li> I had not modified any part of my regiment and haven&#x27;t since, other than cutting out Spectral DNC, so I am positive that it was the Spectral DNC that caused these chemical burns.</li>
            <li> I started using Jamaican Black Castor Oil on my edges and saw some results, so I let this bottle sit for a while.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little south of $1000 a year, then as soon as you stop applying it, ALL GROWN HAIR is lost in a less than 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DS Labs is less greasy, but does make the hair in the treated area clump a little and become firm, almost like a gel styling product would.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after 2 years of little to no results with Rogaine.</li>
            <li> have been using for 8 months now with little results.</li>
            <li> (My stepson commented that I didn&#x27;t look as tired as the previous time he had seen me before I started using the product, but he couldn&#x27;t put his finger on what was different).</li>
            <li> Been using minoxidil for years, this is crap pure and simple.</li>
            <li> so I guess not everyone can use so be careful!!!</li>
            <li> I have had three orders that were missing the box shrink wrap.</li>
            <li> The product did have a distinctive odor and was a bit messy to use.  </li>
            <li> I think this stuff is a waste of money and does not work, Guys just save your money</li>
            <li> Sigh, another wasted pile of cash.</li>
            <li> but alas, he was having the same problem and had also discontinued use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They changed the formula a few times, so that could be the reason.</li>
            <li> And maybe one of the missing side effects is growing hair.</li>
            <li> I use the dropper to put a few drops in the cap &amp; then use a cotton swab to apply it where I need it.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair so stiff</li>
            <li> My hair is thinner than it was before I used this treatment BY AT LEAST HALF.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the product has become totally ineffective.</li>
            <li> you dont keep up on this product, after using it, you will have excessive SHEDDING!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ill go back to rogaine and see if it will at least slow down the shedding.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to proplyene glycol, making Rogaine impossible for me.</li>
            <li> this product.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say you can leave in, in washed or unwashed hair but this poduct gets hard like leaving gel or hair spray in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what ingredient gives it the smell, but this one doesn&#x27;t stink of alcohol or other weird smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cheapest store bought minoxidil will at least maintain</li>
            <li> I know it sucks going bald or balding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bald, it sucks but don&#x27;t buy this junk</li>
            <li> But I feel like my hair has been going downhill lately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not very happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> So you pay $75 a month on average for this treatment, much less the hassle and bad smell.</li>
            <li> I felt so bad as she has to get a shot and currently taking pills until it is out of her system.  </li>
            <li> I still am thin, no miracle, but there&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Cannot say there has been hair growth, but have not experienced any loss since beginning to use this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why is there propylene glycol in this product if their method has made the minoxidil soluble in a different base?</li>
            <li> If they really put in all the research and science they say they do, they failed miserably.</li>
            <li> I want to warn other men losing their hair, these products are crap.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s wrong with Jason Statham and Sean Connery anyway?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had zero hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to rate this one because I was sent the wrong item.</li>
            <li> but I can offer that if its not on your scalp its unlikely to work.</li>
            <li> My hair was very thin.</li>
            <li> lately I cant even touch my hair without 2-4 hairs coming off in my hand :(</li>
            <li> and I see it as DS Labs cutting corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair has been shedding like crazy for weeks now</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> in addition, my hair is falling out like crazy!!</li>
            <li> I am moving on to Lipogain despite my allergy to propylene glycol after this awful experience.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product was sent as promised but when I read the detailed instructions, i decided it was not what I wanted.  When I contacted Amazon to return the item, the message implied that I could not return it.  So I am stuck with a product I do not want.</li>
            <li> wow this revita stuff works but it&#x27;s a major hassle and a hair color changer, I&#x27;m a hair dresser so please read my other reviews too, use all this and some rogaine and it&#x27;s a winning combo for a female on meds or cancer tx</li>
            <li> Firstly I want to say that I had been using this product for the past 4 months with excellent results. It had completely stopped my hair loss and was beginning to regrow some that I had lost. Unfortunately, starting about two months ago I began receiving opened containers of this product. The bottle and box should come completely sealed. I have had three orders that were missing the box shrink wrap. in addition, two of those orders also appeared to have the bottle seal tampered with as well. Needless to say, the product has become totally ineffective. The solution is watered down and not what is advertised. Minoxidil normally turns my brown hair to a shade very near black. All brands that I have tried do this and it is a known side effect of the drug. in addition, The Spectral DNC was causing additional hairs to sprout on my upper cheeks. With continued use of the open product I am no longer experiencing either of these telling side-effects. in addition, my hair is falling out like crazy!! Do not purchase until Amazon gets it together! You&#x27;ve been warned.    edit: after speaking with DS Labs customer care I was told that they are no longer wrapping the boxes in cellophane. this being the case only two of my three previous orders have appeared to have been tampered with (bottle seal partially removed). I will be ordering elsewhere but am still satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I didn&#x27;t wait to wait for the DNC-N&#x27;s US launch so I got the DNC-N together with the new F7 from Canada.  But let&#x27;s focus on the DNC-N, in the simplest term, it&#x27;s a supercharged version of DNC.  DS labs will vehemently deny this claim but the fact of the matter is that it really is.  An excerpt from DS Labs&#x27; reply to my inquiry:  \\&quot;Nanoxidil (in the DNC-N) is a new compound, built around a molecule that is structurally similar to Minoxidil but with one fewer carbon chain, and a lower molecular weight. Additional ingredients enhance the activity of Nanoxidil for multiple mechanisms of action. This compound is the newest member of a class of agents known as ion-channel openers. It delivers excellent efficacy with a reduced potential for side effects. Few people who experience minoxidil sensitivity, which may include irritation and swelling, are less likely to experience these effects with Nanoxidil.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it.  If you can&#x27;t wait for its launch, get the DNC-L for now, which is a close relative of DNC-N but they contain different ingredients.  You may use them in tandem with the new F7.  More on that one later.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it works real well and will continue using it as long as it maitains my hair. Without a doubt it is mor effective than Rogaine and is a good solution for men looking to maintain their hair.</li>
            <li> nice stuff,oderless goes on well,can be used on the entire sclape an seems to be more effective than other products</li>
            <li> According to their official website, and I quote:   Q: Will I lose the hair I grew if I quit Spectral.DNC?  A: Yes, hair regrowth requires continual treatment. If you stop using Spectral.DNC, the new hair you grew during treatment will shed in two to three months.  So you pay $75 a month on average for this treatment, much less the hassle and bad smell. that&#x27;s a little south of $1000 a year, then as soon as you stop applying it, ALL GROWN HAIR is lost in a less than 8 weeks. That&#x27;s just AWESOME!   Try hair cloning instead, or better yet invest in a WIG.  forget it. I&#x27;ll embrace my new look. What&#x27;s wrong with Jason Statham and Sean Connery anyway?</li>
            <li> This is the very first time I have ever endorsed a product. This works for me. I have thin fine hair that has  also been affected by unfortunate health. And this is the first product that has ever worked for me. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it will only work with continued used from now and forever. When I stop the vanity I will stop usage ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li> It gives what it promises..&lt;br /&gt;Using twice a day, once in the morning and once at night..&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of new hair growing on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the results</li>
            <li> April 2012 :  I have used various minoxidil combinations and formulations for 20 years.  Recently, Xandrox went off the market, and I have been seeking a replacement.  This product is superior to every 15% minoxidil product I tried since Xandrox.  I say that based on my own hair loss above my temples in the receding hair line area.  I use Rogaine foam for my crown and have adequate maintenance at this time with this regime.  DS Lab Spectral is the first product since Xandrox 12 and 15 that have maintained my hair line or at least greatly slowed the rate of loss and recede.  Since using it 60 days ago I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in shedding and my hair line thickening in moderate fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only side effects were redness, which fades away within 15 minutes or so.  I also really like the non-alcohol formula which smells very good and feels like a skin lotion, which is quite different from the typical formulations out on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 1 2012:  Product continues to impress me - solid hair growth at receding hair line - the only product out there I know of that can do this.  I still am thin, no miracle, but there&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s long (2 inches?) and it&#x27;s helping cover the thinning look.  Only negative is the last order or most recent had a fragrance added that my wife and kids can smell - kinda soapy smelling.  Wish they&#x27;d take that out.  Still love the water base vs. the alcohol of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 14, 2013:  I&#x27;m having sensitivity problems now and I&#x27;m pretty certain it&#x27;s due to this product and not any other changes to my shampoo or other hair care routines.  I went from itching/dandruff to outbreaks of red sores that would not heal along with severe itching.  I also noticed some hair loss associated with this reaction and wondered if it might be associated.  I switched to another Minoxidil 5% product for 2 weeks and while my symptoms improved they did not completely clear up.  I am experimenting with adding back the DSL product just to my temples or just to my crown to see if using less product has any impact, and I also plan to talk to a dermatologist in case I&#x27;m just experiencing an unrelated bout with psoriasis/dandruff.  I&#x27;ll post more when I know more.  Lowering my rating to 3 Stars because this product works but I think it may not be tolerated by a large population of users if I&#x27;m correct that my symptoms are due to it.</li>
            <li> Have a hole in the pipette that comes, in the liquid to leak out and shake.&lt;br /&gt;Regret is the low level of inspection accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Since hair growth of hair seems to take three to six months, the efficacy of the product can not be realized yet.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you can confirm the efficacy would be followed by the use, purchase in the future, you want to use.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product and have no problems so far.  The spray applicator works great.  The product is fairly easy to work in and I have not had any problems with discoloration.     I will have more to update on as I get further along with the product.</li>
            <li> Been using minoxidil for years, this is crap pure and simple. The cheapest store bought minoxidil will at least maintain&lt;br /&gt;what you have. I tried this looking for a better product to help regrowth. Instead I got snake oil. I used it for six months,&lt;br /&gt;after three months seemed I was thinning more, after six I could plainly see I lost hair big time,&lt;br /&gt;I doubt there is any minoxidil in this garbage. This is fraud pure an simple. No help from Amazon or DS &amp;#34;Labs&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Ripoff !</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle I bought on Amazon. I&#x27;m using it now for 2 weeks, but already showing signs of hair coming back. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this formula along with the DS DNC Shampoo and Conditioner.  I used it faithfully twice daily for three months as recommended.  Unfortunately I had zero hair growth.  I have alopecia universalis so have no eyebrows, lashes and am bald as well with no body hair.  I had high hopes this product might stimulate some hair on my head. The product did have a distinctive odor and was a bit messy to use.  I learned to let it dry for an hour or two before putting on a hat.  Nevertheless, it stained the lining of my hat.  All of which would have been just fine if it had only worked.  Good luck to anyone that tries it!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells, it gets sticky and it doesn&#x27;t even seem like it works.  It makes my hair coarse and brittle when I use it.  I probably will stick with less harsh hair loss prevention products in the future.</li>
            <li> 10/12 update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW THE NEW FORMULA SUCKS. I had been using Nanoxodil- DNC-N at 5%, also made by Spectral. I thought they were equally good, but in going *back* to this formula, my new bottle is just complete shit. I can&#x27;t tell if I got bilked by the seller, which was \\&quot;r and m european beauty center\\&quot; &lt; Avoid avoid avoid. Looking to hair loss forums, it seems like the formula has changed though the company denied it. What I received has a strong bad sickly sweet fragrance, is nearly clear, and evaporates rapidly without leaving hair stiff, unlike the old formula. I can&#x27;t tell if it is a complete imposter or what, but my hair loss/ shedding is OUT OF CONTROL despite regular use It&#x27;s like back to square one. I am moving on to Lipogain despite my allergy to propylene glycol after this awful experience. F-you guys, Spectral. We were counting on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works for me. My skin is sensitive to proplyene glycol, making Rogaine impossible for me. This formula does not cause such irritation.  I have been able to maintain my hair using it (last 4 months). People are right that the black paint smears a little but it is not a big deal. I have not had a problem in shipping and bought it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, bottle 2 was not as good as bottle 1. The second package is not working as well; the first made my hair go gangbusters in growth. Also, the precision spray nozzle was not included, and instead replaced by a cheap mister (photo uploaded above) in addition to the dropper, which I do not find useful. This is incredibly obnoxious. The mister gets the product everywhere. The precision nozzle made the product application easy, more effective re targeting thinning areas, and more efficient re conservation of the product. The lack of the precision spray nozzle really bothers me and I see it as DS Labs cutting corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As DS Labs has expanded, quality appears to have dropped, both in this product and in the Revita shampoo. Based on other users&#x27; reviews, part of the quality deterioration seems be the result of DS Labs&#x27; taking ingredient sourcing offshore, and also due to their going public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish DS Labs would continue to prioritize the quality of their product rather than focus on investor returns. If this product gets any crappier, it&#x27;ll probably be time to move on.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my Mom and she had to go to the hospital for treatment.  Her face was swollen and she got rashes on the areas she applied the product.  Her ears were even swollen.  I felt so bad as she has to get a shot and currently taking pills until it is out of her system.  I used it and it actually worked for me so I guess not everyone can use so be careful!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle would not spray , malfunctioned.&lt;br /&gt;I had to improvise to apply as directed.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see any positive change.</li>
            <li> Use three times a day and re-style your hair.is just not practical.  Would have to use this on days when not going anywhere and no one is coming over.  Leaves hair very still.</li>
            <li> Had to replace Nioxin after 8 years since they changed their formula. You can feel this invigorating your head again. Leaves hair looking thicker and softer.</li>
            <li> I do not like the consistency of this product.  It leaves the hair so stiff I can&#x27;t get a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;A similar product I tried was much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> This Product is not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt know the risk of using it before I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;If you dont keep up on this product, after using it, you will have excessive SHEDDING!&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is as sensitive as mine, thin or sheds a lot anyways. I do NOT recomend this product.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say you can leave in, in washed or unwashed hair but this poduct gets hard like leaving gel or hair spray in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not very happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Dont know if this is a fake product with good label or if the product was old.  It was so thick we had to add water which probably hurt the product more.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed 10 sprays twice a day. I did this for 2 weeks and my head started getting this holes one it. Like open sores scabbing over. It was concentrated mainly on the crown of my head. This product also gave me headaches. I rated it a 1 star for obvious reasons and if you are looking for a topical hair loss treatment honestly don&#x27;t get this product. Or any other product just get a shampoo and conditioner. I think this stuff is a waste of money and does not work, Guys just save your money I know it sucks going bald or balding. I&#x27;m bald, it sucks but don&#x27;t buy this junk</li>
            <li> Sigh, another wasted pile of cash. I ordered this after 2 years of little to no results with Rogaine. I figured the vasodilator in this would do more good than the minoxidil (most people say blood flow is the most important for nourishing hair). The directions say to use 10 drops at a time. I tried that once. It was like putting super glue in my hair! which only helped rip more of it out. Nevertheless, I continued with it, using only 2-3 drops at a time for about 6 weeks. lately I cant even touch my hair without 2-4 hairs coming off in my hand :( I guess at this point Ill go back to rogaine and see if it will at least slow down the shedding.</li>
            <li> The product used to be good, but it seems to have lost its potency as ingredients  have changed over the years.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product because it supposedly worked for her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin, I see that one reviewer found information on the company website stating that discontinuing use will result in loss of new growth but I found statements on their site that said exactly the opposite.  They said that they had discovered a formula that solved that problem.  I was aware that most products like this require on-going use to remain effective so to be on the safe side, I was diligent about using it daily.  I used the shampoo, conditioner and spray.  When I initially used it as directed in the instructions, I began to see results that were very encouraging.  I suffered no obvious side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out of product, I ordered another shipment. Like other reviewers, I noticed a formula change.  The new shipment/formula did not work, my hair all fell back out even though I was still using the products regularly, AND I STARTED GETTING PAINFUL HEADACHES.  It was the first time in 60 years that I have ever had headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been shedding like crazy for weeks now so I went to see my dermatologist, who is a part-time professor at our local university Medical school and she said there isn&#x27;t a product on the market that is worth the health risks, which are many.  She also told me that there is a very high chance that discontinued use will result in thinner hair than I started with. Today I am stuck with over $125 worth of useless product.  I asked my hairdresser if her husband wanted it but alas, he was having the same problem and had also discontinued use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that most of us who suffer from hair loss are longing for a solution to our problem but it isn&#x27;t worth trying these products. I will write again when and if my hair stops falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am editing my review 3 months after the above review:  My hair is thinner than it was before I used this treatment BY AT LEAST HALF.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to rate this one because I was sent the wrong item. I had ordered  DS Laboratories Spectral DNC Topical Hair Loss Treatement, 60-ml Bottle. But was sent DNC-N which I don&#x27;t like. I am waiting to reorder the right one, but am hesitant to do so for fear of ending up with the wrong one again.&lt;br /&gt;Sharon</li>
            <li> As per the instruction, use in the morning and at night.  Do not miss one day for the first 6 months.  After 3 months you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Cannot say there has been hair growth, but have not experienced any loss since beginning to use this product. I&#x27;ve been using it now for over a year.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. The product seemed to be old, very thick, and does not come out of the dispenser with ease. A great deal of Waste. I probably will not order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I did post this review on DNC \\&quot;N\\&quot;with reference to the DNC regular formula:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I have been using Perfect Image 15% Minoxidil using a dropper with some success so i thought I&#x27;d try DNC-N based on reviews on Amazon. I also tried the Spectral DNC (non \\&quot;N\\&quot; formula).&lt;br /&gt;The N is like thickish brown tea which I would only use at night or let sit then wash off after an hour assuming that its penetrates by then (as stated say with PI 15% formula).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular formula without Nanoxidil is by comparison clear and has a pleasant odor and could be worn all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say which of the two is the more effective but I can offer that if its not on your scalp its unlikely to work. I don&#x27;t see putting N on very often if at all and it clearly states it must be used regularly.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll try regular DNC and/or return to 15% minoxidil as I&#x27;m not about to lose what I&#x27;ve generated over the last year. In short I can&#x27;t recommend this product (DNC-N), though it may be the most effective out there.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for other users is this regular formula a.) supposed to be clear and b.) as effective as the DNC-N or c.) as 15% Minoxidil d.) or in it owns right?</li>
            <li> This product really works!  Use it with the shampoo and conditioner and the results are really good.  I have new hair growth and my hair is much healthier and fuller.</li>
            <li> My hairline was running in the other direction literally and as a 34 yo female I was freaking out. My grandma and great grandma suffered from frontal hail loss and I do not want to be a premature victim of that. I started using Jamaican Black Castor Oil on my edges and saw some results, so I let this bottle sit for a while. Then I got the bright idea to use both together. So twice a day I spray my edges with this spray treatment them I oil my hairline with the JBCO. Last week I looked in the mirror and felt I looked 5 years younger. Initially, I thought is was because of my skin clearing up...but after closer inspection it was because my hairline had filled in dramatically. Being a female with a straight hairline can make your face look boxy and masculine if you have a round or square jawline, so this helped me tremendouly. Better than I thought it would. I gave it 4 stars because I really think it&#x27;s the combination of the 2 that works together opposed to just the spray. The oil helps hold the treatment in place longer so it doesn&#x27;t run down your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for four months. I chose it because of the relatively low propylene glycol content. It seemed at first to be working, but now I don&#x27;t think there has been much change since at all. I was not expecting miraculous results, but my main problem with this product is the inconsistency in the product&#x27;s color, texture, and packaging. Every order comes with different packaging. My most recent order was much lighter in color and I&#x27;m not even sure if it has as much minoxidil in it. DS Labs needs to get it together and produce a consistent product and maybe they would have more happy, repeat customers.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this, for my husband, worked a lot better than the concentrated lotion version.&lt;br /&gt;easier to use aswell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> I must say that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product. I&#x27;ve used Rogaine in the past without much success. After about 3 weeks of using this, along with Revita shampoo, I have significant hair growth. I just ordered another 60 day supply and will see how it goes. Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I tried this product to help my thinning hair.  I definitely see new hair growth where I&#x27;ve applied the product.  The new hair is very fine but it does the job.  The only negative Is that it dries on my hair like extra strong hairspray.</li>
            <li> I think this product was discontinued a couple months ago. It was no longer listed on their web site at that time, and I&#x27;ve confirmed with customer support. So if you like it, I guess you&#x27;d better stock up. Personally I&#x27;m not going to stock up, because I&#x27;ve moved on to Lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review of Spectral DNC: a couple years ago, it seemed to work better than regular minoxidil. But I feel like my hair has been going downhill lately. They changed the formula a few times, so that could be the reason. Or maybe the effectiveness of the extra ingredients is wearing off. But on the forums that seems to be the consensus- that the formula a couple years ago actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement for Spectral DNC is DNC-N, which contains \\&quot;nanoxidil\\&quot; instead of minoxidil. I tried that for 2 months and my hair definitely went downhill. Supposedly nanoxidil is a lower molecular weight version of minoxidil, without the side effects. And maybe one of the missing side effects is growing hair. When someone (anyone) does a peer-reviewed double-blind study that shows nanoxidil actually does something, I&#x27;ll try it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff did NOTHING for me absolutely NOTHING. My hair actually looks thinner than it did before. They must call this stuff hair loss treatment because if you want to lose your hair, you should try using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also drips all over the place. I&#x27;ve gotten it on my forehead several times and I actually worried it might grow hair on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;Guess I didn&#x27;t need to worry since it never actually grows any hair.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who was losing her hair recommended Spectral DNC to me. I wasn&#x27;t at all concerned with my bald spot and fine with the thought of losing it all. After months of coaxing, recommending, and persuasion, I finally gave in and decided to try Spectral DNC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t follow the recommended dosage on the bottle. Only four or five squirts to the affected area rather than the recommended ten. I also only used it once a day as opposed to the recommended twice a day. With that said, my hair began to grow back very quickly! Where it was almost completely bald, within three days, now had a full carpet of peach-fuzz. Within a week the peach-fuzz grew to a quarter of an inch! Three weeks and what wasn&#x27;t there before was now an inch long and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously results will vary from person to person because I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, rash, or &amp;#34;scabbing&amp;#34; as some people have described. Maybe they used the full recommended dose? Whatever the case may be, I&#x27;m here to say WOW it really works!!!  :)</li>
            <li> This in combination with their shampoo and condition not only kept my from falling out but regrew a lot of hair and closed the widening part and bald spot after 3 months.I like the pump because it sprays evenly over the area.  I wish there was a way to get it closer to the scalp without so much of it landing on the hair.</li>
            <li> I have used both Rogaine and this product, and I feel this one is superior in terms of its actual relationship to causing hair growth.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s lots of products out there that have the 5% minox. What I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It seems to have a pretty good effect on hair texture. For example if you have somewhat wavy/curly hair (well, what&#x27;s left of it :), this product will make the hair look somewhat better, thicker.&lt;br /&gt;- It smells good. Not sure what ingredient gives it the smell, but this one doesn&#x27;t stink of alcohol or other weird smells.&lt;br /&gt;- I think it works. No one knows for sure how good these products are but it seems to at least help keep what you have, if not limited regroth.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with a little higher quality Minoxidil solution because I didn&#x27;t want my hair  being in worse shape than I started with.&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful when you squirt this stuff on that it doesn&#x27;t run all over and it makes your hair &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; when it dries, but you can brush that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it once a day (I am female) and it seems to be working.  I use this in conjunction with other things though.  I will continue using it even though there are cheaper options out there.  Smell is ok for what it is.  I gave it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t get a dropper with it and the package was kind of smashed when I got it.</li>
            <li> first time trying it so we&#x27;ll see. ive been battling balding for a while with laser, rogain, and the DS shampoo, so just testing this out now too</li>
            <li> lets see how it works...but it was delivered quickly to me....thanks to the seller I had not to wait.... its from some of my friends who used it and they recommended to me.....and I am seeing some changes too.......Thanks..</li>
            <li> Easy application and quality product.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth the money, but after using the product I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I lost a significant amount of hair after being on Topamax. My hair was very thin. The medicine was discontinued and I used this to get my hair back to the way it was before. Still use it.</li>
            <li> It has been a month now , well maybe it reduces the amount of hair loss , but for sure it does not grow hair back.</li>
            <li> This product seems to do exactly what it says. it may take a little time but in the end it is amazing</li>
            <li> Since The Grooming Lounge gave this Best Hair Loss Treatment for 2013, I have to weigh in on this... I have a naturally high hairline and I thought that my hair was thinning at the hairline. So, I decided to try Spectral DNC. I really do believe this product works. I swear that my hairline became fuller and thicker while using this product. And I used this product for 2 or 3 years before DS Laboratories reformulated it. A couple months back, I noticed that the overall scent changed and my scalp had been chemically burned on the sides of my head (above the ears and towards the back) and at one of my temples. I had not modified any part of my regiment and haven&#x27;t since, other than cutting out Spectral DNC, so I am positive that it was the Spectral DNC that caused these chemical burns. I tried contacting DS Laboratories twice but never received a reply. To The Grooming Lounge&#x27;s credit, they provided my with a partial credit upon receipt of the returned, remaining bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would recommend this product... but only if it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin. And to note, I do NOT have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this stuff and it worked both times. I am 31 year old African male and maybe a Norwood 2a on the scale. My hair is always cut very short so the 1st time as well as this time I and my girlfriend are the only ones who can really notice growth. I stopped takin it the 1st time because I couldn&#x27;t afford it with the shampoo. This time I&#x27;m only using the serum and I use whatever decent shampoo 3 times a week. (I also use a toothbrush to scrub my scalp when I shampoo it). This time I have used it for 30 days, but this time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only missed 1 application. I see many many small colorless hairs growing where my hairline used to be which should become perm hairs. I also have many new perm hairs on the front of my scalp and a few starting to be perm along my hairline. I also have many hairs that were already perm that are growing alot faster. This stuff works and it has gotten cheaper so I will continue use. I took a 30 day pic and will take a pic every 10 days till I see full results. Will post pics on youtube slideshow  after 4 to 6 months of continued use.</li>
            <li> Bought &amp; used it only once... Never got a chance... It makes your skin yellowish if you use it often...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to regrow my eyebrows which have become very sparse &amp; have almost disappeared in a few spots since I&#x27;ve entered menopause. (Menopause &#x3D; losing your eyebrows &amp; gaining a moustache) It took over 8 weeks of using it twice a day, but hair started to grow back in; at first &#x27;wild&#x27; hairs, but eventually more normal looking. My eyebrows are not as thick as they once were, but I can now get away with just dotting with my eyebrow pencil where my brows are a little sparser, instead of having to draw entire sections on my skin. (My stepson commented that I didn&#x27;t look as tired as the previous time he had seen me before I started using the product, but he couldn&#x27;t put his finger on what was different). I use the dropper to put a few drops in the cap &amp; then use a cotton swab to apply it where I need it. This avoids contamination of the solution in the bottle. Overall I am quite happy with this product. My brows have not grown back completely, but I have seen a vast improvement, &amp; will continue to use the product twice a day. I would recommend it to other women who are losing their brows as their hormones begin to fluctuate.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been using DS labs products for a few years now. I want to warn other men losing their hair, these products are crap. If they really put in all the research and science they say they do, they failed miserably. Anyways, The DNC-N smells like Vinegar and stays  wet half the day. So far after 3 mos of use, i&#x27;ve seen no more hair re-growth than i would with Kirkland brand. The only product that worked before they changed the formula for the 3rd time was the Spectral DNC-L. I dont know about this company, I think they got a billion dollar scam going.</li>
            <li> have been using for 8 months now with little results. will continue to use for a few more months to see if anything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g.p.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with this product because it did make the statement that if it was not used regularly there was the possibility of shedding.  I have a tendency to forget things therefore I am terrified that if I am not consistent with the use of this product that I will even lose more of it.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail applied it to my scalp and wow is it sticky it feels almost like glue, this is my first application I can not comment on it&#x27;s efficiency. I will up date after a month</li>
            <li> I am only three weeks in but I am seeing some growth&lt;br /&gt;I will post again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word word word word</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost through the first bottle of this product. It doe snot irritate my scalp like Kirkland generic did, possibly due to propylene glycol. The second ingredient in DS Labs is propylene glycol, not sure of the percentage, but it doesnt my me itch.&lt;br /&gt;DS Labs is less greasy, but does make the hair in the treated area clump a little and become firm, almost like a gel styling product would. This can be be reduced but still working on that (trying to see if comeing when wet vs dry). The spray nozzle is great, just save it for future bottle or other brands to make sure you have the same one. There is a light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can not speak to effectiveness as I&#x27;m still on the first bottle. Was using Kirkland generic liquid with a dropper once a day (twice would make me itch)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is there propylene glycol in this product if their method has made the minoxidil soluble in a different base?</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years since loosing hair( age related,  etc.)  I have had  new hair come is by regular use.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with  Spectral DNC.</li>
            <li> I was starting to lose a lot of hair in the front like where your bangs would be so I started using this about a year ago and it is fabulous, your hair actually grow&#x27;s back, it takes about 6 weeks before you start to notice it so don&#x27;t give up it really works and it takes about 6 months before you really see a big difference..</li>
