            <li>Ordered more.  </li>
            <li>I love my sample bottles.  </li>
            <li>So you would then just remove the top and pour away.</li>
            <li>perfect for gift giving of essential oils.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Was thinking I won&#x27;t have many uses (because it is the size of a garbanzo bean)</li>
            <li>Perfect for mixing essential oils together before adding them to your projects.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use my bottles yet, but I have no doubt they will work perfect for giving out samples of essential oils.  </li>

            <li>perfect for giving samples of essential oils to friends.</li>
            <li>My friends have enjoyed samples from my Eden&#x27;s Garden Synergy Blend set also purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>these make awesome travel bottles for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Aside from this I was pleased with the bottles...</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I was wanting a good price.  </li>

            <li>Super fast delivery and great quality.</li>
            <li>so they aren&#x27;t lost easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in purse or pocket.</li>
            <li>The stoppers are easy to put into the bottles.  </li>
            <li>These do not release the drops easily.  </li>
            <li>Each bottle holds about 10 drops of oil which is easily transferred by using a 1ml plastic transfer pipette.  </li>
            <li>Everything was pretty nice except that a couple of the vials cracked when I put in the orifice reducers</li>
            <li>good quality, nice vial, fast shipping Thanks</li>
            <li>Oils are secure no leaks or cracks and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>That being said, they work fine as sample bottles</li>
            <li>they were fine, and suited my need perfectly&lt;</li>
            <li>plastic orifice makes it so you need to shake the bottle a bit to get the oil out -creating mini-drop splashes (which is fine for spreading tea tree oil on your skin).</li>
            <li>but I suppose it&#x27;s better than having it flow out too quickly.</li>
            <li>Perfect for samples of oil or just little amounts to keep with me in my purse.</li>
            <li>Great for essential oil on the go.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get the plastic tops to fit in glass.</li>
            <li>Caps and orifices all fit.</li>
            <li>Great for giving out samples of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Great size oils bottles to share your essential oils with friends and family.</li>
            <li>I will use these until they are gone, then try to find some that have caps that fit securely.</li>
            <li>These work great for sharing essential oils.</li>
            <li>I keep lemon and grapefruit essential oils with me to drop into my water when I&#x27;m out and about, and these are great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>great for essential oil samples!</li>
            <li>Some of the lids don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>But great for giving samples of my essential oil blends.</li>
            <li>they traveled securely and did not spill.</li>
            <li>Very useful.  </li>
            <li>These are very handy for carrying essential oils in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect little sample size bottle!.</li>
            <li>They came very quickly and were exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Fast shipment, super cute and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I don&#x27;t know what response I&#x27;d have gotten directly from this seller, but I&#x27;m pretty secure in the knowledge that if I take a problem to Amazon, they&#x27;ll fix it somehow.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and their the cutest sample bottles ever!!!</li>
            <li>My essential oil labels fit exactly on the top of the bottle cap, making them perfect bottles for essential oil samples.</li>
            <li>Good receptacle for sharing essential oil samples with people.</li>
            <li>as many are very pricey</li>
            <li>The only real issue I have with them is that the dropper top takes some good shaking to get even the thinnest of oils out</li>
            <li>Easy to put together, love the orifice reducer and cap inserts that create a complete seal.</li>
            <li>The price is much better than you&#x27;ll find elsewhere and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>love these, they have an extra snap on top to keep spills away</li>
            <li>Wonderful size for samples of essential oil blends or for carrying a tiny bit of prediluted blends around without worrying about leaks.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and with all bottle, lids, and orifice reducers included.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Order came in quickly.</li>
            <li>These little bottles are so cute and make the perfect sample bottles for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>But the bottles in general are really nice.</li>

            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>Thanks again!!</li>

            <li>Thank you for the great deal and super fast shipping, I&#x27;ll be back to do more business with you again in the near future when I need more.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the quickest way to figure out whether they are worth buying from again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice quality, but really really really tiny.</li>
            <li>They are nice teeny tiny bottles.</li>
            <li>Has a nice seal and still has an inner seal.</li>
            <li>These are really handy for sharing oils with friends so they can try an essential oil without investing in them</li>
            <li>Nice size for your essential oils to carry in your carry purse!</li>
            <li>These guys are so handy for purse size essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, product was as expected.</li>
            <li>I did not find the dropper orifice to be useful though...</li>
            <li>Very nice little bottles</li>
            <li>Super small and great for sharing oils or popping them into a pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>Exactly what expected to receive - great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>These are the right size for aromatherapy gifts</li>
            <li>Just the right size for samples.  </li>
            <li>Price was right</li>
            <li>Bottles were clean and packaged VERY well.</li>
            <li>Sharing the oils is easy with proper packing to make everything look professional and sealed in its own container.</li>
            <li>These are great for making sample mixes of something you want to try but not sure if you will like.  </li>
            <li>They are small but they are great quality amber glasses.  </li>
            <li>Soze of the bottle is great for sharing small amounts of oil.</li>
            <li>Packaged well and will be suitable for mixing samples of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Bottles are the perfect size for a blend of a few oils, for later use with a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need and also not to pay the very high shipping cost from AromaTools!</li>
            <li>And I finally figured out to put my favorite oils for blending in these without the dropper plug in these to use with dropper pipette for making up new recipes without having to pull out the original bottles.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I love the size of these bottles for giving samples of my essential oils to friends.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly what I was looking for to use for my business.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what you think they are going to be.</li>
            <li>Did not work for our purposes and they were more fragile than they looked.  </li>
            <li>The size is exactly what I wanted, but now they are sitting in a drawer waiting while I look for the remaining pieces elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I gave these a three star because they take so much time for the dropper to drop a drop!</li>
            <li>I go with the 5/8 dram for oils that need to drip vs being able to rub a drop on topically.</li>
            <li>They did the first time but not any since.</li>
            <li>Ah, i just love these tiny glasses!!!</li>
            <li>These are a great size for sharing essential oils with others; however, the white tops don&#x27;t fit snugly enough.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product-they just took several days longer than I expected to arrive.</li>
            <li>I filled a few vials and had no problem putting the plastic dropper top in</li>
            <li>Cute and handy little jars for samples of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I love these for sharing essential oil and making new blends!</li>
            <li>Cute little bottles, came in great shape no broken bottles or missing pieces</li>
            <li>Ideal for making small amounts of essential oil blends to sample and for sharing samples with friends.</li>
            <li>The oil has a hard time dripping out when you tip it over to use and it would be nice to have a dropper, luckily I had one.</li>
            <li>and it went in nice and tight.</li>
            <li>I have to keep tapping the bottle of the bottle and still don&#x27;t get a decent drop!</li>
            <li>great for sharing samples with my friends who are not familiar with essential oils though.</li>
            <li>Great little vials used to give out samples of my doTERRA essential oils.</li>
            <li>I really like these.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Probably my fault for not realizing what the size really meant....</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>fast shipping rec as described.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when I was adding my oils to the bottle and it dripped straight out.</li>
            <li>The orifices are different sizes and don&#x27;t fit into the bottles</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Got here fast</li>
            <li>Just right to put my young living essence oil samples in.</li>
            <li>a couple bottles had very wide mouths so the dropper top didn&#x27;t fit in properly.</li>
            <li>These are decent for what they are and they certainly serve their purpose.</li>
            <li>That said, they are so small and cute!</li>
            <li>The size of these little bottles is perfect, but the hole in the plastic reducer pieces is too small.</li>
            <li>I love giving out samples of essential oils, but the 2ML can empty my bottle quickly.</li>
            <li>These are such cute little bottles that will definitely come in handy while on the go.</li>
            <li>I use these with Doterra oils to make small but effective batches.</li>
            <li>know some others mentioned having a delay in shipping, and I don&#x27;t know if it was from the same seller or not, but I highly, highly suggest that whoever you purchase from, if issues arise, to make them aware of it and give them a chance to make it right.</li>
            <li>By holding the vial upside down and tapping it with some force, I was able to get some drops out.</li>
            <li>I put several drops of grapeseed oil in one and turned it upside down, shook it around, and it didn&#x27;t seem to leak, but when I tried to take the top off, the white cap came off with the top.</li>
            <li>do have to shake the vial to get a drop to come out, but that is better than too many drops coming rapidly since the vial holds a very small amount of the essential oil.</li>
            <li>Cap isn&#x27;t flat on top so round labels don&#x27;t fit well.  </li>
            <li>Cost so much less than speciality stores online and free shipping!</li>
            <li>I just ordered a dozen, but it looks like you could fit 18 into a tin for a pretty extensive pocket essential oils kit!  </li>
            <li>exactly what I expected and the order shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Took me a while to figure out how to put the dropper in tight, to be truthful</li>
            <li>Make sure your lids are on tight or your oil will escape.</li>
            <li>High quality amber glass, the reducer fits snug, no leaks.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li>I love these little bottles.</li>
            <li>The little white plugs are used to regulate how much comes out of the vial which is nice</li>
            <li>Some are very loose, while others seemed to fit.</li>
            <li>but one of them shattered the bottle and about $4 worth of essential oils</li>
            <li>figured they&#x27;d add a few more bottles</li>
            <li>I picked these up for my wife, so she could keep a few of her favorite oils in the car.</li>
            <li>They all came in good conditions, none of the them is broken.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for sending samples of essential oils.</li>
            <li>When I need a full single drop I just take off the orifice and pour.</li>
            <li>I use as testers for new medicinal blends and the drops will not come out without lots of work.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly these little bottles pour out each individual drop easily without dumping the whole amount (I needed to get a few drops of oregano oil aimed at the back of my tongue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can make my oil blends or even travel with my individual oils without having to carry a large box with me!</li>
            <li>Wife ended up not using them after she had one break in the car, fortunately it was mostly empty and did not make a huge mess.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together and seal tight.</li>
            <li>The orifice/dropper part is very small, so you have to tap on the bottom of the bottle when it&#x27;s turned up, but it keeps the oils from coming out too fast, and you can easily control how much goes into your water.  </li>
            <li>They hold about 20 drops of essential oils which makes sharing with my mom and daughter much easier!</li>
            <li>came in a small squished box but the bottles were all ok.</li>
            <li>Filling them was challenging due to their TINY size.</li>
            <li>We have to put them in hot water to soften them enough to put them in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Gifted a friend with some of my Young Living Frankincense oil with these small vials.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>The office reducers don&#x27;t fit tightly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic little bottles.</li>
            <li>I use these little drams for sharing all my favorite essential oil with others.</li>
            <li>LOVE these little bottles!!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and solid product.</li>
            <li>my sister took my house key laid it across the top and pushed the center of the key</li>
            <li>Bought these to give samples in gift baskets for essential oils and worked really well.  </li>
            <li>My only issue is they don&#x27;t drip out the oil very well at all.</li>
            <li>I was worried they would have air pockets in the glass and that the caps would not fit securely for that price.  </li>
            <li>Nice none cracked or broken or leaked</li>
            <li>The bottles arrived in good condition, but they are basically useless for the intended purpose without the reducer.</li>
            <li>The bottles are perfect for mini samples of essential oils but the white reducers make it nearly impossible to get the oil out.</li>
            <li>This seller took my concerns seriously and more than made up for the delay.</li>
            <li>These tiny jars are exactly what I wanted to use as samples for my essential oils</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the advertised orifice reducers with them, and they&#x27;re pretty crucial in some uses of essential oils.</li>
            <li>cool little glass containers</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and would purchase from again in the future.</li>
            <li>Nice tight little package for sampling my doTERRA oils.</li>
            <li>Also, these are a lighter color than what I normally buy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d target just pay extra to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I expected and wanted.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>These little bottles are great for carring small amounts of Essential Oils while traveling or giving samples of Essential Oils to Clients.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them a 5 star rating was because I think the lids are awkwardly large for how tiny the vials are.</li>
            <li>Love these little guys!!!</li>
            <li>I have NOT used the drop spout things, only because the bottles are so tiny that you don&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li>Amazon fixed it financially (refund).</li>
            <li>The cap doesnt seem to screw all the way down straight, but no leaks thus far.</li>
            <li>It would work fine for making small oil mixes since I don&#x27;t want to use large bottle and waste my products.</li>
            <li>but I found out that I can get them for half price in another web side thanks do!</li>
            <li>Good quality product, I received all the parts, nothing broken or missing.</li>
            <li>These little bottles were exactly what I wanted and they arrived in a timely manner -</li>
            <li>On top of that, those little plastic pieces that are the dropper top are IMPOSSIBLE to get an actual drop out of.</li>
            <li>A few of the black lids didn&#x27;t fit the bottles.</li>
            <li>These little bottles are very sturdy.</li>

            <li> The stoppers are easy to put into the bottles.  </li>

            <li> Each bottle holds about 10 drops of oil which is easily transferred by using a 1ml plastic transfer pipette.  </li>
            <li> Everything was pretty nice except that a couple of the vials cracked when I put in the orifice reducers</li>
            <li> good quality, nice vial, fast shipping Thanks</li>
            <li> Oils are secure no leaks or cracks and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> That being said, they work fine as sample bottles</li>
            <li> they were fine, and suited my need perfectly&lt;</li>
            <li> plastic orifice makes it so you need to shake the bottle a bit to get the oil out -creating mini-drop splashes (which is fine for spreading tea tree oil on your skin).</li>
            <li> but I suppose it&#x27;s better than having it flow out too quickly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for samples of oil or just little amounts to keep with me in my purse.</li>
            <li> Great for essential oil on the go.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get the plastic tops to fit in glass.</li>
            <li> Caps and orifices all fit.</li>
            <li> Great for giving out samples of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great size oils bottles to share your essential oils with friends and family.</li>
            <li> I will use these until they are gone, then try to find some that have caps that fit securely.</li>
            <li> These work great for sharing essential oils.</li>
            <li> I keep lemon and grapefruit essential oils with me to drop into my water when I&#x27;m out and about, and these are great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> great for essential oil samples!</li>
            <li> Some of the lids don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> But great for giving samples of my essential oil blends.</li>
            <li> they traveled securely and did not spill.</li>
            <li> Very useful.  </li>
            <li> These are very handy for carrying essential oils in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Super fast shipping and their the cutest sample bottles ever!!!</li>
            <li> My essential oil labels fit exactly on the top of the bottle cap, making them perfect bottles for essential oil samples.</li>
            <li> Good receptacle for sharing essential oil samples with people.</li>
            <li> as many are very pricey</li>
            <li> The only real issue I have with them is that the dropper top takes some good shaking to get even the thinnest of oils out</li>
            <li> Easy to put together, love the orifice reducer and cap inserts that create a complete seal.</li>
            <li> The price is much better than you&#x27;ll find elsewhere and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> love these, they have an extra snap on top to keep spills away</li>
            <li> Wonderful size for samples of essential oil blends or for carrying a tiny bit of prediluted blends around without worrying about leaks.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and with all bottle, lids, and orifice reducers included.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Order came in quickly.</li>
            <li> These little bottles are so cute and make the perfect sample bottles for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> But the bottles in general are really nice.</li>
            <li> purchased multiple orders of this item and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> super cute, smaller than I expected but great</li>
            <li> Thank you for the great deal and super fast shipping, I&#x27;ll be back to do more business with you again in the near future when I need more.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the quickest way to figure out whether they are worth buying from again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice quality, but really really really tiny.</li>
            <li> They are nice teeny tiny bottles.</li>
            <li> Has a nice seal and still has an inner seal.</li>
            <li> These are really handy for sharing oils with friends so they can try an essential oil without investing in them</li>
            <li> Nice size for your essential oils to carry in your carry purse!</li>
            <li> These guys are so handy for purse size essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, product was as expected.</li>
            <li> I did not find the dropper orifice to be useful though...</li>
            <li> Very nice little bottles</li>
            <li> Super small and great for sharing oils or popping them into a pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> Exactly what expected to receive - great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These are the right size for aromatherapy gifts</li>
            <li> Just the right size for samples.  </li>
            <li> Price was right</li>
            <li> Bottles were clean and packaged VERY well.</li>
            <li> Sharing the oils is easy with proper packing to make everything look professional and sealed in its own container.</li>
            <li> These are great for making sample mixes of something you want to try but not sure if you will like.  </li>
            <li> They are small but they are great quality amber glasses.  </li>
            <li> Soze of the bottle is great for sharing small amounts of oil.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and will be suitable for mixing samples of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Bottles are the perfect size for a blend of a few oils, for later use with a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need and also not to pay the very high shipping cost from AromaTools!</li>
            <li> And I finally figured out to put my favorite oils for blending in these without the dropper plug in these to use with dropper pipette for making up new recipes without having to pull out the original bottles.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I love the size of these bottles for giving samples of my essential oils to friends.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I was looking for to use for my business.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what you think they are going to be.</li>
            <li> Did not work for our purposes and they were more fragile than they looked.  </li>
            <li> The size is exactly what I wanted, but now they are sitting in a drawer waiting while I look for the remaining pieces elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I gave these a three star because they take so much time for the dropper to drop a drop!</li>
            <li> I go with the 5/8 dram for oils that need to drip vs being able to rub a drop on topically.</li>
            <li> They did the first time but not any since.</li>
            <li> Ah, i just love these tiny glasses!!!</li>
            <li> These are a great size for sharing essential oils with others; however, the white tops don&#x27;t fit snugly enough.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product-they just took several days longer than I expected to arrive.</li>
            <li> I filled a few vials and had no problem putting the plastic dropper top in</li>
            <li> Cute and handy little jars for samples of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I love these for sharing essential oil and making new blends!</li>
            <li> Cute little bottles, came in great shape no broken bottles or missing pieces</li>
            <li> Ideal for making small amounts of essential oil blends to sample and for sharing samples with friends.</li>
            <li> The oil has a hard time dripping out when you tip it over to use and it would be nice to have a dropper, luckily I had one.</li>
            <li> and it went in nice and tight.</li>
            <li> I have to keep tapping the bottle of the bottle and still don&#x27;t get a decent drop!</li>
            <li> great for sharing samples with my friends who are not familiar with essential oils though.</li>
            <li> Great little vials used to give out samples of my doTERRA essential oils.</li>
            <li> I really like these.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Probably my fault for not realizing what the size really meant....</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> fast shipping rec as described.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I was adding my oils to the bottle and it dripped straight out.</li>
            <li> The orifices are different sizes and don&#x27;t fit into the bottles</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Got here fast</li>
            <li> Just right to put my young living essence oil samples in.</li>
            <li> a couple bottles had very wide mouths so the dropper top didn&#x27;t fit in properly.</li>
            <li> These are decent for what they are and they certainly serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> That said, they are so small and cute!</li>
            <li> The size of these little bottles is perfect, but the hole in the plastic reducer pieces is too small.</li>
            <li> I love giving out samples of essential oils, but the 2ML can empty my bottle quickly.</li>
            <li> These are such cute little bottles that will definitely come in handy while on the go.</li>
            <li> I use these with Doterra oils to make small but effective batches.</li>
            <li> know some others mentioned having a delay in shipping, and I don&#x27;t know if it was from the same seller or not, but I highly, highly suggest that whoever you purchase from, if issues arise, to make them aware of it and give them a chance to make it right.</li>
            <li> By holding the vial upside down and tapping it with some force, I was able to get some drops out.</li>
            <li> I put several drops of grapeseed oil in one and turned it upside down, shook it around, and it didn&#x27;t seem to leak, but when I tried to take the top off, the white cap came off with the top.</li>
            <li> do have to shake the vial to get a drop to come out, but that is better than too many drops coming rapidly since the vial holds a very small amount of the essential oil.</li>
            <li> Cap isn&#x27;t flat on top so round labels don&#x27;t fit well.  </li>
            <li> Cost so much less than speciality stores online and free shipping!</li>
            <li> I just ordered a dozen, but it looks like you could fit 18 into a tin for a pretty extensive pocket essential oils kit!  </li>
            <li> exactly what I expected and the order shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Took me a while to figure out how to put the dropper in tight, to be truthful</li>
            <li> Make sure your lids are on tight or your oil will escape.</li>
            <li> High quality amber glass, the reducer fits snug, no leaks.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles.</li>
            <li> The little white plugs are used to regulate how much comes out of the vial which is nice</li>
            <li> Some are very loose, while others seemed to fit.</li>
            <li> but one of them shattered the bottle and about $4 worth of essential oils</li>
            <li> figured they&#x27;d add a few more bottles</li>
            <li> I picked these up for my wife, so she could keep a few of her favorite oils in the car.</li>
            <li> They all came in good conditions, none of the them is broken.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for sending samples of essential oils.</li>
            <li> When I need a full single drop I just take off the orifice and pour.</li>
            <li> I use as testers for new medicinal blends and the drops will not come out without lots of work.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly these little bottles pour out each individual drop easily without dumping the whole amount (I needed to get a few drops of oregano oil aimed at the back of my tongue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can make my oil blends or even travel with my individual oils without having to carry a large box with me!</li>
            <li> Wife ended up not using them after she had one break in the car, fortunately it was mostly empty and did not make a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together and seal tight.</li>
            <li> The orifice/dropper part is very small, so you have to tap on the bottom of the bottle when it&#x27;s turned up, but it keeps the oils from coming out too fast, and you can easily control how much goes into your water.  </li>
            <li> They hold about 20 drops of essential oils which makes sharing with my mom and daughter much easier!</li>
            <li> came in a small squished box but the bottles were all ok.</li>
            <li> Filling them was challenging due to their TINY size.</li>
            <li> We have to put them in hot water to soften them enough to put them in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Gifted a friend with some of my Young Living Frankincense oil with these small vials.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The office reducers don&#x27;t fit tightly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic little bottles.</li>
            <li> I use these little drams for sharing all my favorite essential oil with others.</li>
            <li> LOVE these little bottles!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and solid product.</li>
            <li> my sister took my house key laid it across the top and pushed the center of the key</li>
            <li> Bought these to give samples in gift baskets for essential oils and worked really well.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is they don&#x27;t drip out the oil very well at all.</li>
            <li> I was worried they would have air pockets in the glass and that the caps would not fit securely for that price.  </li>
            <li> Nice none cracked or broken or leaked</li>
            <li> The bottles arrived in good condition, but they are basically useless for the intended purpose without the reducer.</li>
            <li> The bottles are perfect for mini samples of essential oils but the white reducers make it nearly impossible to get the oil out.</li>
            <li> This seller took my concerns seriously and more than made up for the delay.</li>
            <li> These tiny jars are exactly what I wanted to use as samples for my essential oils</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the advertised orifice reducers with them, and they&#x27;re pretty crucial in some uses of essential oils.</li>
            <li> cool little glass containers</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and would purchase from again in the future.</li>
            <li> Nice tight little package for sampling my doTERRA oils.</li>
            <li> Also, these are a lighter color than what I normally buy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d target just pay extra to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected and wanted.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> These little bottles are great for carring small amounts of Essential Oils while traveling or giving samples of Essential Oils to Clients.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them a 5 star rating was because I think the lids are awkwardly large for how tiny the vials are.</li>
            <li> Love these little guys!!!</li>
            <li> I have NOT used the drop spout things, only because the bottles are so tiny that you don&#x27;t really need them.</li>
            <li> Amazon fixed it financially (refund).</li>
            <li> The cap doesnt seem to screw all the way down straight, but no leaks thus far.</li>
            <li> It would work fine for making small oil mixes since I don&#x27;t want to use large bottle and waste my products.</li>
            <li> but I found out that I can get them for half price in another web side thanks do!</li>
            <li> Good quality product, I received all the parts, nothing broken or missing.</li>
            <li> These little bottles were exactly what I wanted and they arrived in a timely manner -</li>
            <li> On top of that, those little plastic pieces that are the dropper top are IMPOSSIBLE to get an actual drop out of.</li>
            <li> A few of the black lids didn&#x27;t fit the bottles.</li>
            <li> These little bottles are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I now can mix up different essential oils and not feeling bad about using a lot if i dont like the new scent:)))</li>
            <li> I wanted to carry a small amount of essential oils with me, and not have to bring the whole bottle and risk it spilling or breaking.</li>
            <li> Cute, but a few broken orifice reducers and they leak.</li>
            <li> These are not any cheaper in the long run for that reason plus the oil you lose from the dropper caps not being snug.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time for just one oil drop to pass through.</li>
            <li> Several of them were broken, and they all seem pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> Id like to know however I&#x27;ve never had any issues with any of the other sized bottles I&#x27;ve had to open and close.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller (Almost4minds in this case) and asked when I could expect my order to be shipped and delivered, and the shipping date was missed due to personal issues on their end.</li>
            <li> Other then that they got the job done for my essential oil samples.</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles but am not impressed with the orifice drop reducer.  </li>
            <li> so I could make small recipes and not commit to making a giant 5 ml bottle (relatively speaking)</li>
            <li> Only half the bottles had lids &amp; stoppers.</li>
            <li> When the reducer was put on the cap sits crooked and without it still doesn&#x27;t close tight.</li>
            <li> little bottle seems to hold about 20-30 drops of essential oils.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can keep a little bit of my essential oils with me all the time!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch of caps or maybe bottles...not sure......</li>
            <li> A few of the white dropper inserts would not stay in.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> I bought them to put a few drops (10-20) of my essential oils in to hand out as samples and things.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and needed.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.  </li>
            <li> Very small, but big  enough.</li>
            <li> Turn upside down and the lid comes off and you loose all the oil.</li>
            <li> Small enough but with wide openings to pour in the oils.</li>
            <li> The photo I added are the bottles with different oils, labels of oils and the small carry tote to carry in purse around town or traveling.  </li>
            <li> They are of lesser quality than others I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> I also received them about 2 days before I expected to!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is hard to get a drop out of the vial.</li>
            <li> The white plastic is hard to get in the bottles.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, nothing broken or missing!!</li>
            <li> What it boils down to is that Almost4Minds dropped the ball, but Amazon caught it.</li>
            <li> I like these little bottles</li>
            <li> Not worth it for these little things!</li>
            <li> The drams can be a little hard for the oil to drip out</li>
            <li> but the orifice is too small for some of the thicker oils to come through.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for small EO blends that I&#x27;m trying out</li>
            <li> Yes the are small, as you should expect a 1ml bottle to be.  </li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars, but a couple bottles had their bottoms missing!</li>
            <li> I wasted a ton of oil mailing out samples using these bottles because all the oil leaked out!</li>
            <li> They are so small that they can be discreetly used as an inhaler at my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are SOOOOO small.</li>
            <li> but they are so small you might use whatever is in it all at once anyway.  </li>
            <li> Too small for my needs.  </li>
            <li> it was too small to allow my oils to dropper out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re purchasing this, you probably know that 1 ml is about 20 drops depending on the density of the oil, but seriously, you won&#x27;t grasp how little that is until you receive these.</li>
            <li> Cap isn&#x27;t hard plastic and kinda squishes when squeezed.  </li>
            <li> orifice reducer is hard for me to manage but</li>
            <li> This is a very small bottle.  </li>
            <li> Bottles are not much good without reducers.</li>
            <li> Even tried widening the opening with a knife and still not successful.</li>
            <li> These are going to work well for a smell and tell game.</li>
            <li> Broken bottle in one of the boxes I ordered.  </li>
            <li> The bottles were packeged poorly and 4 of the 6 bottles came in shattered.</li>
            <li> However the bottles that weren&#x27;t broken seemed functional and would have served their purpose.</li>
            <li> The quality is poor.</li>
            <li> The bottles were so thin, you can hardily tell if they were glass or plastic.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a happy customer!</li>
            <li> but they are difficult to remove if you want to refill the vial.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get product to flow out of bottle.</li>
            <li> Way to expensive..wayyyy to expensive!</li>
            <li> Found these to be very difficult to get the oil out of the practice reducer</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the bottles were plastic (I was expecting glass).</li>
            <li> You literally have to shake drops out. :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The dropper caps on these are awful.</li>
            <li> However, the orifice reducers are absolutely horrible and don&#x27;t work.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really liked them for my business but I found out that I can get them for half price in another web side thanks do!</li>
            <li> These are the right size for aromatherapy gifts I really like these.  Just a enough for the recipient to experience essential oils.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with this product. I use as testers for new medicinal blends and the drops will not come out without lots of work. Even tried widening the opening with a knife and still not successful. I will not recommend or buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and solid product. I will order again!</li>
            <li> Good receptacle for sharing essential oil samples with people. I appreciate the plastic orifices which assist in dispensing a drop. Two of the orifices were mis-sized for the 1 ml bottle. Good to check the fitting before giving a sample to someone. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Cute and perfect for giving away essential oils for my friends to try.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivered on time!</li>
            <li> Item was shipped and delivered within the Prime 2 day shipping. Bottles were clean and packaged VERY well. Order included pore reducers, caps, and paper inserts for caps as well. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Great for sharing essential oils with family that want to try a couple before they buy their own.</li>
            <li> used with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love the size of these bottles for giving samples of my essential oils to friends. They are smaller than the 5/8 dram, but enough to let someone experience the healing properties of the oils.</li>
            <li> as expected - perfect for my needs</li>
            <li> These are perfect for our oils and making smaller doses or samples for my kids or friends.</li>
            <li> I like these little bottles so well I have already reordered.  The photo I added are the bottles with different oils, labels of oils and the small carry tote to carry in purse around town or traveling.  All I bought on Amazon and love them!!</li>
            <li> Some of the caps leak in the package I received. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch of caps or maybe bottles...not sure......</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t actually glass, they are plastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic little bottles. They work well! I share my oils with friends and loved ones with zero problems.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for samples to give away!</li>
            <li> Great for essential oil on the go.</li>
            <li> These bottles were good for my purposes. I wanted to carry a small amount of essential oils with me, and not have to bring the whole bottle and risk it spilling or breaking. (I actually did drop one vial, and it did not break.) These mini vials hold about 30 drops of essential oil. The only drawback is that it is hard to get a drop out of the vial. The orifice reducer seems low-quality. By holding the vial upside down and tapping it with some force, I was able to get some drops out. Overall I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Much smaller then I thought. Will work great for sample oils.</li>
            <li> Flimsy. I filled a few vials and had no problem putting the plastic dropper top in but one of them shattered the bottle and about $4 worth of essential oils goes all over my computer desk with bits of glass everywhere. On top of that, those little plastic pieces that are the dropper top are IMPOSSIBLE to get an actual drop out of. Not buying these again.</li>
            <li> nice packaging great price perfect for oil samples</li>
            <li> Great sample bottles!</li>
            <li> They arrive as they are shown. Perfect, love them. Will buy more!!!</li>
            <li> worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li> arrived just as promised and they are perfect for samples and great price.</li>
            <li> These tiny jars are exactly what I wanted to use as samples for my essential oils</li>
            <li> I used these for Essential Oil samples and they are perfect!</li>
            <li> Good quality for storing oils or whatever else you want to</li>
            <li> Everything was pretty nice except that a couple of the vials cracked when I put in the orifice reducers</li>
            <li> I would not buy these again. They are of lesser quality than others I have had in the past. Several of them were broken, and they all seem pretty flimsy. The office reducers don&#x27;t fit tightly.</li>
            <li> the 1 mil bottles were great. Just right to put my young living essence oil samples in. thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! These are such cute little bottles that will definitely come in handy while on the go. I can make my oil blends or even travel with my individual oils without having to carry a large box with me! Thank you for the great deal and super fast shipping, I&#x27;ll be back to do more business with you again in the near future when I need more.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for samples ! Oils are secure no leaks or cracks and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> smaller than what I thought they would be...</li>
            <li> Ideal for making small amounts of essential oil blends to sample and for sharing samples with friends.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the product I prdered</li>
            <li> Tiny, but very happy with the product. Perfect for my essential oil samples.</li>
            <li> Great vials. Cost so much less than speciality stores online and free shipping!</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected and the order shipped quickly</li>
            <li> The bottles are great! The oil has a hard time dripping out when you tip it over to use and it would be nice to have a dropper, luckily I had one. But the bottles in general are really nice. I&#x27;ve dropped a couple and they have not even cracked.</li>
            <li> Very useful.  If you need to be able to roll instead of spraying things on, this does the job.</li>
            <li> Nice none cracked or broken or leaked</li>
            <li> These little bottles are so cute and make the perfect sample bottles for my essential oils. People just love them.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Now if I could find a dropper that fits through the hole to refill them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get the plastic tops to fit in glass. Tried several. One bottle even broke between my fingers while trying to get the top in. If I&#x27;m doing something wrong Id like to know however I&#x27;ve never had any issues with any of the other sized bottles I&#x27;ve had to open and close.</li>
            <li> perfect to sample my essential oils. I liked the labels, that was a nice surprise</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I was wanting a good price.  It did take a bit to arrive though.  I ordered several items the same day from different sellers.  This was the last to arrive and much later than the rest.  I would have rated it excellent if it had come quicker.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re into essential oils, these are great for sample sizes to give to loved ones! Packaging is good too.</li>
            <li> I use these little drams for sharing all my favorite essential oil with others. These bottles are the perfect size for sharing oil samples. High quality amber glass, the reducer fits snug, no leaks. Will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Good product, came packaged well.</li>
            <li> The plastic dropper doesn&#x27;t snap in place like some of the others I&#x27;ve purchased, but it does it job</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the bottles were plastic (I was expecting glass). The size was great though.</li>
            <li> These came nicely wrapped in bubble wrap. The orifice reducers were sealed in a zipper bag so they aren&#x27;t lost easily. Just the right size for sending samples of essential oils. Just wish there was a bigger quantity for sale.</li>
            <li> Excellent size for experiments!!! We&#x27;re in to making our own tintures, and this size bottle is perfect!</li>
            <li> The bottles are perfect if your wanting them to share oils...but the orifice is too small for some of the thicker oils to come through.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, super cute and easy to use.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I use these with Doterra oils to make small but effective batches.</li>
            <li> The bottles are perfect for mini samples of essential oils but the white reducers make it nearly impossible to get the oil out.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill, great for gifting or sample sizes.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for small EO blends that I&#x27;m trying out so I could make small recipes and not commit to making a giant 5 ml bottle (relatively speaking) before I knew I&#x27;d like it. As for the bottles, these are TINY. If you&#x27;re purchasing this, you probably know that 1 ml is about 20 drops depending on the density of the oil, but seriously, you won&#x27;t grasp how little that is until you receive these. They are hilariously small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was waiting for my order to arrive, I noticed that the date that it was supposed to ship was missed. I contacted the seller (Almost4minds in this case) and asked when I could expect my order to be shipped and delivered, and the shipping date was missed due to personal issues on their end. They couldn&#x27;t speed up the shipping time as it would have still arrived on the same day, but they promised to add additional product to the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured they&#x27;d add a few more bottles, so imagine my surprise when I received it and there were 24 BOTTLES!!! This seller took my concerns seriously and more than made up for the delay. That&#x27;s going above and beyond in customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some others mentioned having a delay in shipping, and I don&#x27;t know if it was from the same seller or not, but I highly, highly suggest that whoever you purchase from, if issues arise, to make them aware of it and give them a chance to make it right. That&#x27;s the quickest way to figure out whether they are worth buying from again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I may pass on some of the generosity that I received and give out a couple sample bottles of oil to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Nice quality, but really really really tiny. Probably my fault for not realizing what the size really meant.... great for sharing samples with my friends who are not familiar with essential oils though.</li>
            <li> love these, they have an extra snap on top to keep spills away</li>
            <li> Sharing the oils is easy with proper packing to make everything look professional and sealed in its own container. Thanks</li>
            <li> They are nice teeny tiny bottles. It would work fine for making small oil mixes since I don&#x27;t want to use large bottle and waste my products. Only problem is out of the plug/dropper tops in my batch, there is no air hole so the oil doesn&#x27;t drip out like most bottles do. Otherwise, they are ok.</li>
            <li> Only half the bottles had lids &amp; stoppers.</li>
            <li> Gifted a friend with some of my Young Living Frankincense oil with these small vials.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to shake the vial to get a drop to come out, but that is better than too many drops coming rapidly since the vial holds a very small amount of the essential oil.</li>
            <li> These are great for oils. A few of the white dropper inserts would not stay in. Over all pleased with this product and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I thought the bottles included reducers, I obviously did not read the product description closely enough.  Bottles are not much good without reducers.</li>
            <li> fast shipping rec as described. Great size for EO</li>
            <li> Just the right size for samples.  Took me a while to figure out how to put the dropper in tight, to be truthful my sister took my house key laid it across the top and pushed the center of the key and it went in nice and tight.</li>
            <li> Perfect for samples of oil or just little amounts to keep with me in my purse. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, I received all the parts, nothing broken or missing. Caps and orifices all fit.</li>
            <li> These are decent for what they are and they certainly serve their purpose. However, don&#x27;t expect them to all be perfectly the same. I found they were different sizes (height) and a couple bottles had very wide mouths so the dropper top didn&#x27;t fit in properly. That being said, they work fine as sample bottles and I&#x27;m happy. The price is much better than you&#x27;ll find elsewhere and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Nice tight little package for sampling my doTERRA oils.</li>
            <li> works great to share my oils with family and friends, great for traveling. Make sure your lids are on tight or your oil will escape.</li>
            <li> These are adorable. Yes the are small, as you should expect a 1ml bottle to be.  I bought these to use to give out samples of oils. These may not be what you&#x27;re looking for if you want to blend your own oils.</li>
            <li> Cannot wait to share my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Great for giving out samples of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Always glass for essential oils.  These are great to give as a sample for someone.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly in a compact pill box and hold my do terra oils so I have the ones I use at work on hand. I&#x27;m very happy with these amber glass vials.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wonderful size for samples of essential oil blends or for carrying a tiny bit of prediluted blends around without worrying about leaks.</li>
            <li> I love these for sharing essential oil and making new blends!</li>
            <li> Cute and handy little jars for samples of essential oils.  Great quality and protect oils</li>
            <li> Great size oils bottles to share your essential oils with friends and family.</li>
            <li> These are great for samples.  This is a very small bottle.  Initially, it is smaller than what I&#x27;d hoped for but I believe it will work great for offering samples to customers.</li>
            <li> Excellent service! Thank you! It was nice not to pay for a ton of vials I didn&#x27;t need and also not to pay the very high shipping cost from AromaTools! The vials were perfect and almost identical!</li>
            <li> they were fine, and suited my need perfectly&lt;br /&gt;great transaction as well</li>
            <li> Very small, but big  enough. Has a nice seal and still has an inner seal.</li>
            <li> Bottles are the perfect size for a blend of a few oils, for later use with a carrier oil.  Love the fact they came with reducers if I choose to use them, as well as the top labels, so I know what each one is.  I also received them about 2 days before I expected to!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and with all bottle, lids, and orifice reducers included. No complaints! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> perfect for samples.  Carry some personal EO in my purse for my use.</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles. They hold about 20 drops of essential oils which makes sharing with my mom and daughter much easier! Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> super cute, smaller than I expected but great</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described. It arrived quickly. This item is exactly what I was looking for to use for my business.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars, but a couple bottles had their bottoms missing! the sides of the bottle are there, but the bottom was a hole! Imagine my surprise when I was adding my oils to the bottle and it dripped straight out.</li>
            <li> Works great, love them !</li>
            <li> These are going to work well for a smell and tell game.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was different about these vials is the drop reducer. You literally have to shake drops out. :(</li>
            <li> Cute little bottles, came in great shape no broken bottles or missing pieces</li>
            <li> Great bottles for the price.</li>
            <li> nice for sharing oil samples verses taking meds for your health</li>
            <li> These were just as promised!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are cute!! Arrived quickly!!</li>
            <li> Very nice little bottles</li>
            <li> Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> The dropper caps on these are awful. Also, these are a lighter color than what I normally buy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d target just pay extra to buy in bulk. These are not any cheaper in the long run for that reason plus the oil you lose from the dropper caps not being snug.</li>
            <li> So glad I made this choice!</li>
            <li> Have to remove the plastic stopper in order to get the oil to drip out at all.</li>
            <li> These little bottles are great for carring small amounts of Essential Oils while traveling or giving samples of Essential Oils to Clients.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sampling to clients</li>
            <li> The vials are great and perfect for essential oil or tincture samples. However, the orifice reducers are absolutely horrible and don&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t buy these if you&#x27;re depending on the reducers! Otherwise, I love them.</li>
            <li> Found these to be very difficult to get the oil out of the practice reducer</li>
            <li> These are exactly what you think they are going to be. Clean and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I think I need a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Bought these to give samples in gift baskets for essential oils and worked really well.  Easy to put together and seal tight. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! The cap doesnt seem to screw all the way down straight, but no leaks thus far. Plan to repurchase!</li>
            <li> Did not work for our purposes and they were more fragile than they looked.  Cute and adorable though.</li>
            <li> This size is perfect. I love giving out samples of essential oils, but the 2ML can empty my bottle quickly.</li>
            <li> There were no orifice reducers with them.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Broken bottle in one of the boxes I ordered.  Cap isn&#x27;t flat on top so round labels don&#x27;t fit well.  Cap isn&#x27;t hard plastic and kinda squishes when squeezed.  Bottle seemed to hold more than the 1/4 drams I&#x27;m use to.  Price was right and I needed them for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> cool little glass containers</li>
            <li> These are really handy for sharing oils with friends so they can try an essential oil without investing in them as many are very pricey</li>
            <li> These are great to share your oils. Small enough but with wide openings to pour in the oils. The orifice reducers and caps stay on and haven&#x27;t leaked.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> great for giving samples</li>
            <li> The bottles were packeged poorly and 4 of the 6 bottles came in shattered. Will be returning this item in hopes of purchasing a pack that doesn&#x27;t arrive shattered. However the bottles that weren&#x27;t broken seemed functional and would have served their purpose.</li>
            <li> Orifice reducer was not included. The bottles arrived in good condition, but they are basically useless for the intended purpose without the reducer. The size is exactly what I wanted, but now they are sitting in a drawer waiting while I look for the remaining pieces elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping essential oils.  These have nice caps and are just what is needed to seal in the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have purchased multiple orders of this item and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Vials were awesome just had one that was brokes üëç</li>
            <li> The quality is poor. The orifices are different sizes and don&#x27;t fit into the bottles well. Some are very loose, while others seemed to fit.</li>
            <li> Great size for samples.  Easy to carry in purse or pocket.</li>
            <li> I wasted a ton of oil mailing out samples using these bottles because all the oil leaked out! I&#x27;m not a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Love these little guys!!!</li>
            <li> these are sooooo cute and perfect for my needs. Good price too.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. I used these to share essential oils with friends. The little white plugs are used to regulate how much comes out of the vial which is nice but they are difficult to remove if you want to refill the vial. Best used for one use or if you plan to refill don&#x27;t use the white plugs.</li>
            <li> These are very handy for carrying essential oils in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Your luggage&lt;br /&gt;-Purse&lt;br /&gt;-Emergency kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each little bottle seems to hold about 20-30 drops of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic orifice makes it so you need to shake the bottle a bit to get the oil out -creating mini-drop splashes (which is fine for spreading tea tree oil on your skin). When I need a full single drop I just take off the orifice and pour. Surprisingly these little bottles pour out each individual drop easily without dumping the whole amount (I needed to get a few drops of oregano oil aimed at the back of my tongue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This size is perfect for space saving and weight restrictions. I am going to add oils to my backpacking bag this way!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great item at a great price.</li>
            <li> I gave these a three star because they take so much time for the dropper to drop a drop! That said, they are so small and cute! I share essential oils with my friends with them.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and their the cutest sample bottles ever!!! These are perfect for giving samples of my DoTerra essential oils!! My customers all loved the cute orfices! Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> One bottle arrived cracked and damaged box was not damage inside item was</li>
            <li> Perfect! Thank you. Would highly recommend and would purchase from again in the future. A+</li>
            <li> Adorable, and a handy size.  I just started making up some of my own blends and these are wonderful for mixing up blends to store and then add carrier oils to.  A bonus that works for me, since I can not ever travel without an assortment, is that you can get ten of these, or eight along with a 5 ml.bottle  into an Altoid tin for travel!  I have a tin for my purse, with my favorite blends for alertness etc.  They are so small that they can be discreetly used as an inhaler at my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a second tin for my overnight bag, with all the sleepytime and ache and pain blends in it.  And I finally figured out to put my favorite oils for blending in these without the dropper plug in these to use with dropper pipette for making up new recipes without having to pull out the original bottles.  It makes it so convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that they don&#x27;t cone in cobalt.</li>
            <li> These are a great size for sharing essential oils with others; however, the white tops don&#x27;t fit snugly enough. I put several drops of grapeseed oil in one and turned it upside down, shook it around, and it didn&#x27;t seem to leak, but when I tried to take the top off, the white cap came off with the top. I will use these until they are gone, then try to find some that have caps that fit securely. I don&#x27;t want my friends and family to spill oil on themselves if the caps fall off while they are trying to use the oils.</li>
            <li> good price, packaged well, delivered on time. The stoppers are easy to put into the bottles.  1/4 bottles are a challenge to get a good drop from.  I go with the 5/8 dram for oils that need to drip vs being able to rub a drop on topically.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my EO samples.  Ordered more.  Have not had a problem getting the reducer in or leaking.</li>
            <li> Perfect for samples and to keep my oils in my bag.</li>
            <li> I love my sample bottles.  Was exactly what I expected and wanted.  They arrived right on time in a nice sealed package was able to reuse in my oil pack.</li>
            <li> The bottles were so thin, you can hardily tell if they were glass or plastic.  I used them for personal sharing with family members, but are too low quality to resell blends.</li>
            <li> Good product. They don&#x27;t seem to leak so that is a plus. My only issue is they don&#x27;t drip out the oil very well at all.</li>
            <li> good quality, nice vial, fast shipping Thanks</li>
            <li> fast shipping. good price.</li>
            <li> Nice size for your essential oils to carry in your carry purse! Would recommend them!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping great product!</li>
            <li> Orifice reducers do not work, oil can&#x27;t come out at all</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, nothing broken or missing!! Thanks</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> A few of the black lids didn&#x27;t fit the bottles. Other then that they got the job done for my essential oil samples.</li>
            <li> I love these! They are SOOOOO small. Which is perfect for me. They also shipped same day I ordered and showed up in my mail box several days before they were scheduled to. I&#x27;m waiting on my second order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I bought them to put a few drops (10-20) of my essential oils in to hand out as samples and things. I have NOT used the drop spout things, only because the bottles are so tiny that you don&#x27;t really need them. But the girlfriend I borrowed from before ordering swears by these!</li>
            <li> These are great for making sample mixes of something you want to try but not sure if you will like.  You could also sample out some of your favorites for friends or family to try.  They are small but they are great quality amber glasses.  The only real issue I have with them is that the dropper top takes some good shaking to get even the thinnest of oils out but they are so small you might use whatever is in it all at once anyway.  So you would then just remove the top and pour away.</li>
            <li> Perfet for my needs.  Nice quality.</li>
            <li> These work great for sharing essential oils.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size to drop in my purse.  I keep lemon and grapefruit essential oils with me to drop into my water when I&#x27;m out and about, and these are great for that purpose.  The orifice/dropper part is very small, so you have to tap on the bottom of the bottle when it&#x27;s turned up, but it keeps the oils from coming out too fast, and you can easily control how much goes into your water.  LOVE THESE!!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and great quality.</li>
            <li> perfect for gift giving of essential oils.</li>
            <li> came in a small squished box but the bottles were all ok. and were exactley what i needed</li>
            <li> They all came in good conditions, none of the them is broken. Great size to mix my own blends for 2 or 3 use. Remember they are very tiny.</li>
            <li> Everything was great! Easy to put together, love the orifice reducer and cap inserts that create a complete seal. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them a 5 star rating was because I think the lids are awkwardly large for how tiny the vials are.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get product to flow out of bottle.</li>
            <li> good bottles , caps strip easily !</li>
            <li> Perfect little sample size bottle!. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was worried they would have air pockets in the glass and that the caps would not fit securely for that price.  Boy was I surprised.&lt;br /&gt;they are not flimsy and the tops fit perfect.  I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Great little vials used to give out samples of my doTERRA essential oils.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and needed.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I am using them for all of my Essential Oil samples to give to prospective clients!  Love them!</li>
            <li> They have always been here within 4 days and I have never had a problem with them breaking. I do wish they came with a pipette each time. They did the first time but not any since. Great quality though!</li>
            <li> These little bottles were exactly what I wanted and they arrived in a timely manner - so why one teeny star? I didn&#x27;t get the advertised orifice reducers with them, and they&#x27;re pretty crucial in some uses of essential oils. Amazon fixed it financially (refund). What it boils down to is that Almost4Minds dropped the ball, but Amazon caught it. To be fair, I don&#x27;t know what response I&#x27;d have gotten directly from this seller, but I&#x27;m pretty secure in the knowledge that if I take a problem to Amazon, they&#x27;ll fix it somehow.</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles but am not impressed with the orifice drop reducer.  These do not release the drops easily.  I have to keep tapping the bottle of the bottle and still don&#x27;t get a decent drop!</li>
            <li> We use these for samples of essential oils. They suit our needs perfectly</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE these little bottles!! I can keep a little bit of my essential oils with me all the time!!  Perfect for oils on the go!!</li>
            <li> great for essential oil samples!</li>
            <li> I picked these up for my wife, so she could keep a few of her favorite oils in the car. Filling them was challenging due to their TINY size. Wife ended up not using them after she had one break in the car, fortunately it was mostly empty and did not make a huge mess.</li>
            <li> These guys are so handy for purse size essential oils.  Arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Good bottles. Got here fast</li>
            <li> Was thinking I won&#x27;t have many uses (because it is the size of a garbanzo bean) but it end up practical size for giving samples to my friends</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.  Quality good.</li>
            <li> Way to expensive..wayyyy to expensive! Not worth it for these little things! Find Elufly on here so much more affordable!!!</li>
            <li> Perfectly holds the oils I needed. :)</li>
            <li> The white plastic is hard to get in the bottles. We have to put them in hot water to soften them enough to put them in the bottle. Soze of the bottle is great for sharing small amounts of oil.</li>
            <li> Ah, i just love these tiny glasses!!! I now can mix up different essential oils and not feeling bad about using a lot if i dont like the new scent:)))</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixing essential oils together before adding them to your projects. You can also mix them and then pipette them into your diffuser from these bottles.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE!  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use my bottles yet, but I have no doubt they will work perfect for giving out samples of essential oils.  I HIGHLY recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Used for essential oil samples.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for giving samples of essential oils to my friends and family. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect for offering essential oil samples in.</li>
            <li> The size of these little bottles is perfect, but the hole in the plastic reducer pieces is too small. It takes a long time for just one oil drop to pass through.</li>
            <li> Holds 25-30 drops of your favorite oils.</li>
            <li> I used these vials for samples of my company&#x27;s eye serum. They were the best thing I found, and worked great! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Some of the lids don&#x27;t fit. Turn upside down and the lid comes off and you loose all the oil.</li>
            <li> Perfect for essential oil samples or to take your oils with you when u travel. I am happy with the product-they just took several days longer than I expected to arrive.</li>
            <li> great for samples  to share and carry with you</li>
            <li> Exactly what expected to receive - great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> They came very quickly and were exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Order came in quickly. Packaged well and will be suitable for mixing samples of essential oils.  Quality vials.</li>
            <li> perfect for giving samples of essential oils to friends.</li>
            <li> Too small for my needs.  Is this what drug smugglers swallow?</li>
            <li> Super small and great for sharing oils or popping them into a pocket or purse. My friends have enjoyed samples from my Eden&#x27;s Garden Synergy Blend set also purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> orifice reducer is hard for me to manage but great item</li>
            <li> LOVE! these make awesome travel bottles for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find these bottles fit perfectly into a mint tin.  I just ordered a dozen, but it looks like you could fit 18 into a tin for a pretty extensive pocket essential oils kit!  Great find!</li>
            <li> Soooooo teeny.  But great for giving samples of my essential oil blends. The drams can be a little hard for the oil to drip out but I suppose it&#x27;s better than having it flow out too quickly. I think next time I&#x27;ll order the next size up just to have a bigger surface area to hold on to and label.</li>
            <li> When the reducer was put on the cap sits crooked and without it still doesn&#x27;t close tight. I&#x27;m always worried they will spill</li>
            <li> Good quality, product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Cute, but a few broken orifice reducers and they leak.</li>
            <li> If you want to share your essential oils, these tiny vials help you do it, without robbing your personal store!</li>
            <li> Each bottle holds about 10 drops of oil which is easily transferred by using a 1ml plastic transfer pipette.  The bottles come with the orifice cap which allows the vial to dispense a drop at a time.  My essential oil labels fit exactly on the top of the bottle cap, making them perfect bottles for essential oil samples.</li>
            <li> These little bottles are very sturdy. I put some of my essential oils in these for traveling. I did not find the dropper orifice to be useful though...it was too small to allow my oils to dropper out. So I had to take the plastic orifices out to access the liquid inside. I am taking one star off for this. Aside from this I was pleased with the bottles...they traveled securely and did not spill.</li>
