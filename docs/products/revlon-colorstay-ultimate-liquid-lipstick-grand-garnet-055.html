            <li>love it.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite lipstick now</li>
            <li>Not the product&#x27;s fault though! :)</li>
            <li>I have used this lipstick brand for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I found that I couldn&#x27;t find this color in any stores around any more</li>
            <li>Tonight I bought 8 more.  </li>
            <li>It is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I am no longer able to purchase this product in my area</li>
            <li>You must use an additional moisturizer with this product, I love its longevity.  </li>
            <li>Revlon discontinued my favorite color, Grand Garnett, 055.</li>
            <li>Plus, you can&#x27;t put color on top of color bc</li>
            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>love this the lipstick stays on forever and</li>
            <li>I have been using this lipstick for over 2 years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>The more you put on the brighter it gets.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>You do need to remove what is on your lips if you want to apply more but that is easy to do.</li>
            <li>and it said this would look good with my fair skin, red-copper hair, and blue eyes.</li>
            <li>and I carry a wee tin of original Vaseline to add moisture when I need it because when applied over the top it does not affect the lipstick.</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>As it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily (&amp;#34;Revlon colorSTAY&amp;#34;,) I use eye makeup remover to get it all off.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>and I like to get the colors I need without the risk of going to the supermarket and not finding them available.</li>
            <li>felt cheap</li>
            <li>went from being ready to throw this stuff away to loving it once I learned how to finesse the application process.</li>
            <li>Overall a great lip stain for the price.</li>
            <li>I seldom wear red, but sometimes need it so a good choice when I need more color.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time also, I can get a good 5-6 hours or more depending if I eat or not.</li>
            <li>This is a great color a nice bright red but not too harsh.  </li>
            <li>colors stay true all day</li>
            <li>I always use lip balm on top as these types of lipsticks are very drying if you don&#x27;t keep lip balm on.  </li>
            <li>Revlon Colorstay still looks good over 9 hours later even after eating.</li>
            <li>The color Grand Garnet is softer than the red which makes it able to be worn with just about every color of clothes I have.  </li>
            <li>The seller is absolutely NOT at fault, and I am sure they have other wonderful products-</li>
            <li>Color is just right</li>
            <li>and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>This particular type of lippy is discontinued in the UK and no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>The color barely showed had to keep putting more on</li>
            <li>would like to subscribe very much for your dear to me</li>
            <li>Use it in the morning and it lasts most of the day!&lt;br /&gt;The color was vibrant, but yet soft.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, do not know why</li>
            <li>My favorite red.</li>
            <li>almost entire afternoon, she don&#x27;t have to put more  even after she eat her lunch</li>
            <li>It was the exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I bought several colors and love them all.</li>
            <li>Now I hope I have enough to last till they come out with something as good to replace it.</li>
            <li>I love the how long the color lasts -- all day!  </li>
            <li>And I have tried a large number of them.  </li>
            <li>It was no longer available at my local drug stores, so I ordered it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I tell you that my shipment in the very beauty and magnificence</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be much easier to remove in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It truthfully does last an entire day, or overnight.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t wash it off or rub it off, except for normal wear and tear by evening.  </li>
            <li>While it is not a &amp;#34;24 hour lasting lipstick&amp;#34;, it is better than any other lipstick I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I find this stays on very well and does not dry out my lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear moisturizer that works well with Revlon Colorstay.</li>
            <li>stays on all day and is soft  to the feel on the lips.</li>
            <li>fast enough-</li>
            <li>Im gonna stick to straight lipstick and/glosses for next time.</li>
            <li>(Other lip balms remove it but original Vaseline in blue tin doesn&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>(I wear other shades), but this just wasn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so dry, you really need moisturizer topcoat..</li>
            <li>.it tends to be a little drying, but a little vaseline over the top keeps it soft.</li>

            <li> .it tends to be a little drying, but a little vaseline over the top keeps it soft.</li>
            <li> Long lasting lip stain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why Revlon discontinued this line of Ultimate lipsticks -- unless they lasted too long for Revlon&#x27;s profitability.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that is a bit dry on the lips</li>
            <li> and it added at *least* twenty minutes to us getting ready to leave, because it just would NOT come off of my lips.</li>
            <li> It turned out lighter on me than I expected, but I still wear it as a &amp;#34;base coat&amp;#34; and put another regular lipstick color over it.  </li>
            <li> Appears to dry the lips, so a gloss will be needed</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really last 24 hours but does stay on from early morning till late evening even with eating.  </li>
            <li> I bought a dark red and it did come off..</li>
            <li> Apply the first coat very thinly and then wait</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly drying on the lips but the longevity makes up for it</li>
            <li> I do use a lip gloss over it as the lipstick dries with a tacky finish, and is slightly drying to the lips.  </li>
            <li> a little heavier&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish it came off a little easier.</li>
            <li> Just need to put a little gloss over it as the day goes buy.  </li>
            <li> It also tends to wind up on teeth for a few minutes after application.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I bought 6 and stored them till I need them.  </li>
            <li> This was just to messy.</li>
            <li> I needed more of a blue base, rather than an orange base.  </li>
            <li> having a hard time find product.&lt;br /&gt;stays</li>
            <li> It is sometimes hard to find and</li>
            <li> at least 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely serious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a good product from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> ALMOST NOTHING will take this stuff off, worse still--</li>
            <li> I just wanted to forget this ugly little accident ever happened.</li>
            <li> Unable to buy this colour in Australia.</li>
            <li> They were SO wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry that it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sad</li>
            <li> , it is very difficult to find in shops and on line.</li>
            <li> It looked horrifying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shade of red is the perfect match for my skin tones--the others are too brilliant.  Revlon discontinued this color sadly; for all of us who love it, we say &amp;#34;bring it back, please.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s staying power is remarkably good.  While it is not a &amp;#34;24 hour lasting lipstick&amp;#34;, it is better than any other lipstick I have tried.  And I have tried a large number of them.  It feels better on the lips than the others.  I have had friends comment that, after a meal, I still have lipstick on while they are heading to the powder room to reapply theirs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so dry, you really need moisturizer topcoat.. it stays but not not fuller, will look like you have lip liner:-)</li>
            <li> love the lipstick. the color is great.  stays on all day and is soft  to the feel on the lips. colors stay true all day</li>
            <li> As we all know, the color of lipstick depends on the wearer.  My girlfriend, who has a completely different skin tone, wore this and I loved it.  It was no longer available at my local drug stores, so I ordered it from Amazon.  It turned out lighter on me than I expected, but I still wear it as a &amp;#34;base coat&amp;#34; and put another regular lipstick color over it.  That way, even when the regular lipstick rubs off, I still have color on my lips!  Overall, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> love it.  have been using it for months.  having a hard time find product.&lt;br /&gt;stays on all day..  my color!!!</li>
            <li> Long lasting lip stain. Unable to buy this colour in Australia. I was pleased to be able to purchase this product through you.</li>
            <li> I do love my Revlon Colorstay lipsticks, as I said before, they do stay!!! and I like to get the colors I need without the risk of going to the supermarket and not finding them available.</li>
            <li> Love love love the staying power of this brand.  It&#x27;s slightly drying on the lips but the longevity makes up for it and I carry a wee tin of original Vaseline to add moisture when I need it because when applied over the top it does not affect the lipstick. (Other lip balms remove it but original Vaseline in blue tin doesn&#x27;t).  This particular type of lippy is discontinued in the UK and no longer available in stores. I always stock up from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> The best lipstick I&#x27;ve ever had. It truthfully does last an entire day, or overnight. I can&#x27;t imagine why Revlon discontinued this line of Ultimate lipsticks -- unless they lasted too long for Revlon&#x27;s profitability.</li>
            <li> dear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to subscribe very much for your dear to me and I want to be a client I have you to&lt;br /&gt;And I tell you that my shipment in the very beauty and magnificence</li>
            <li> I find this stays on very well and does not dry out my lips.</li>
            <li> Color is just right and it stays on all day. . .it tends to be a little drying, but a little vaseline over the top keeps it soft.</li>
            <li> I seldom wear red, but sometimes need it so a good choice when I need more color. Very lasting and shade does not change on lips.</li>
            <li> This is a great color a nice bright red but not too harsh.  I always use lip balm on top as these types of lipsticks are very drying if you don&#x27;t keep lip balm on.  It lasts a long time also, I can get a good 5-6 hours or more depending if I eat or not.</li>
            <li> This is the only lipstick I use as I put it on once in the morning, At work I have coffee, snacks, lunch etc and when I get home around 4.00pm it is still on.  Unfortunately, do not know why, it is very difficult to find in shops and on line.</li>
            <li> Now I know why the local stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. ALMOST NOTHING will take this stuff off, worse still-- it smears all over your face when you try to remove it WITH the recommended cleanser, so it looks like you have stepped out of some sort of horror movie. I used Revlon&#x27;s online color/make-up recommendation program- and it said this would look good with my fair skin, red-copper hair, and blue eyes. I couldn&#x27;t even find his type of liquid lipstick in my area, so I checked online to find my &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; color. They were SO wrong. It looked horrifying. I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough- and it added at *least* twenty minutes to us getting ready to leave, because it just would NOT come off of my lips. I&#x27;m completely serious. I thought I was going to have to wait for a layer of skin to shed off of my lips, for it to come off. My lips hurt for the entire evening, just from trying to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a better note, it was incredibly inexpensive- so I didn&#x27;t feel the need to bug the seller about exchanging it, I wouldn&#x27;t put another color on, for fear it would never come off. And I didn&#x27;t want to risk paying to send it back. The seller is absolutely NOT at fault, and I am sure they have other wonderful products- I just wanted to forget this ugly little accident ever happened. Please do NOT let my product review detract you from the seller though - I left 5 star feedback for them. The product came very quickly and well packaged. It&#x27;s just not a good product from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I choose to rate 4 starts, because of the product&#x27;s quality and delivery was fast.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to my friends and colleagues.</li>
            <li> The color barely showed had to keep putting more on I don&#x27;t think it was even by revelon felt cheap</li>
            <li> I use this every day as a bottom coat.  The color stays on all day.  I&#x27;ve given several to friends who asked how I do it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a good colour stay! Appears to dry the lips, so a gloss will be needed</li>
            <li> Just a fair warning, this goes on really light and watery. It also tends to wind up on teeth for a few minutes after application. After some trial and error, here&#x27;s what I learend to do to avoid said pitfalls:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Apply the first coat very thinly and then wait at least 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;- Avoid covering the inside of the lip&lt;br /&gt;- Apply the second coat a little heavier&lt;br /&gt;- If you &amp;#34;scribble&amp;#34; or miss a spot, correct immediately. This stuff stains!&lt;br /&gt;- If you don&#x27;t feel like scrubbing it off at night, apply some lip balm generously and then go to bed. It&#x27;ll be much easier to remove in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from being ready to throw this stuff away to loving it once I learned how to finesse the application process. It&#x27;s my favorite lipstick now and I constantly get compliments on it. The shade I purchased looks great once I figured out that it needs two coats, and it lasts all day until I start purposefully removing it. It is rather high-maintenance in the beginning, but for the amount of attention it draws, and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about it once it&#x27;s on, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> ....it was not the color red I was looking for.  I needed more of a blue base, rather than an orange base.  The Colorstay products are WONDERFUL (I wear other shades), but this just wasn&#x27;t right.  Not the product&#x27;s fault though! :)</li>
            <li> I like it)&lt;br /&gt;Only use morning time and no problem all day)))))))))))))</li>
            <li> I have used this lipstick brand for years and love it.  It is sometimes hard to find and now I know where I can get just about any color I need.</li>
            <li> My favorite red. I just wish it came off a little easier. Overall a great lip stain for the price.</li>
            <li> My mom likes it, she said it lass almost entire afternoon, she don&#x27;t have to put more  even after she eat her lunch</li>
            <li> I found that I couldn&#x27;t find this color in any stores around any more so I turned to Amazon.  A few weeks ago I bought 6 and stored them till I need them.  Tonight I bought 8 more.  It doesn&#x27;t really last 24 hours but does stay on from early morning till late evening even with eating.  You do need to remove what is on your lips if you want to apply more but that is easy to do. You just use something like Blistex or eye makeup remover and it comes right off.  The color Grand Garnet is softer than the red which makes it able to be worn with just about every color of clothes I have.  Now I hope I have enough to last till they come out with something as good to replace it.</li>
            <li> Use it in the morning and it lasts most of the day!&lt;br /&gt;The color was vibrant, but yet soft. Will purchase again sometime.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that does not want to keep re-applying lipstic.&lt;br /&gt;Once in the morning is good!</li>
            <li> Great color which is no longer available in stores...great service...came in two days well packaged.  I am very pleased with the service.</li>
            <li> I like it for the color and for its long-lasting properties.  Sorry that it was discontinued. I wish that it is brought back into the stores.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day. Just need to put a little gloss over it as the day goes buy.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> I wish Revlon had not discontinued this product.  It is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I am no longer able to purchase this product in my area so I was very excited to find it on Amazon.  It was the exactly what I was looking for.  It stays on for the entire day without having to reapply it.  Perfect for anyone.  I bought several colors and love them all.</li>
            <li> You must use an additional moisturizer with this product, I love its longevity.  The color remains on ALL DAY, but some people might need to re-moisturize occasionally.  I use Cover Girl Outlast Moisturizing Topcoat.  It&#x27;s a clear moisturizer that works well with Revlon Colorstay. I&#x27;m just sad Revlon discontinued my favorite color, Grand Garnett, 055. Also, to remove it, you must use something like eye make up remover.  You can&#x27;t wash it off or rub it off, except for normal wear and tear by evening.  Plus, you can&#x27;t put color on top of color bc it will flake.</li>
            <li> I love the color.  I love the how long the color lasts -- all day!  And I loved the price.</li>
            <li> love this the lipstick stays on forever and the color is nice. The only thing is that is a bit dry on the lips but the fact that is stays on and on and on is the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lipstick for over 2 years now and love it.  It stays on for several hours without having to worry about it.  Great product, I hope they keep making it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fade away even after eating something with oil, like a salad.  It doesn&#x27;t leave lipstick smears on the rim of a glass.  I do use a lip gloss over it as the lipstick dries with a tacky finish, and is slightly drying to the lips.  As it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily (&amp;#34;Revlon colorSTAY&amp;#34;,) I use eye makeup remover to get it all off.  It&#x27;s very effective at what it&#x27;s created to do.</li>
            <li> Like one reviewer said. The more you put on the brighter it gets. I bought a dark red and it did come off.. As I ate and drank. It got on my teeth too. It was still on but it just faded. Im gonna stick to straight lipstick and/glosses for next time. This was just to messy.</li>
            <li> I have never rated this product by given it a star; and I have never wrote a review for this product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Marlene Farrell-Trent</li>
            <li> Revlon Colorstay still looks good over 9 hours later even after eating. Depending on how you apply it, it looks like different colors.</li>
