            <li> Beautiful. The very first time I put it on the beads snapped and fell everywhere. Useless now.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but very small even when linking to the last chain. You will need to pin it in your hair for sure.</li>
            <li> i will buy it again for a gift</li>
            <li> Very pretty looks just like picture. Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> beautiful! the whole time i wore it i was given complaments by both sexes,&lt;br /&gt;thank you, lorin lee hope to buy more verietys</li>
            <li> It was broken when I got it so it went right from the mail box to the trash...waste of money</li>
            <li> Super cute, just wasnt too crazy about it due to it being like a necklace. It doesnt have the chain piece that goes down the middle of your head. Package came super fast. Thanks</li>
            <li> These products break way too easily. I purchased two and they both broke very easily. I never got to wear them. I got a few pics in one even though it was broken. Now they are both in the trash. Its better to spend a little more money and get a better quality item. I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Beautiful!! I looked like a Grecian Goddess!!</li>
            <li> So cute on. Lite weight very fashionable</li>
            <li> Looks great, loved it!</li>
            <li> The pearls are all one size. Not the same as the photo. But all in all very pretty. And cheap! For the price you get a beautiful piece that doubles as a necklace.</li>
            <li> Ok in the package I was like meh but when I put it on with my flowy maxi dress wow!!! What a cute accessory!! Also came in a week. Nice job. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars just because I can tell I have to shallac it or my forehead will turn green. What do u want for a few dollars. I love it. I can&#x27;t wait to rock this. I feel like a princess with it on. I will be buying other Styles from this seller.</li>
            <li> I liked it but found it hard to use without bobby pins otherwise pretty</li>
