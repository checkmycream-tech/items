            <li> I am so disappointed that Victoria Secret has discontinued yet another of my favorite perfumes.  I will likely buy another before I can no longer find it!</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume in the stores, but I couldn&#x27;t find it.  I ordered it Amazon, and within three days - I did NOT pay for the express shipping - the perfume had arrived!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. And unfortunate they have discontinued it at Victoria&#x27;s Secret. I&#x27;m so happy I can get it an amazon. So I can continue to wear my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Excellent the item delliverd on tim</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this perfume is the atomizer. But the scent is wonderful and musky, my favorite type of scent. Be careful though - on some people it may smell a little &#x27;old lady&#x27;. It smells wonderful on me, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift, and it totally fullfilled my friend expectations. My purchase arrived just in time. Recommended 100%</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this scent and as her mom, I don&#x27;t find it offensive.  Nice that we don&#x27;t disagree.  It appears the VS has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> purchased this for my girlfriend. the atomizer did not work at all. we ended up pouring the perfume in another bottle and she uses that.</li>
            <li> I bought my original one from VS and loved it.  It was on clearance then and when I went back found out that they dont carry anymore.  I have had several comments on how well it smells.  So glad that I found on Amazon to purchase another bottle.  Will probably buy a couple more just so I dont run out.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped right away and was properly packaged.  Victoria&#x27;s Secret no longer makes this perfume so it was great to find it and at a fair price.  I would definitely buy products from Sale All in the future.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> This perfume is soooooo amazing!!!!  I love, love, love it!!!!!  I gave it as Christmas gifts to my sister-in-law and my grandmother and they both fell in love with it, too :-)  Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. I was so upset that Victoria Secret discontinued this fragrance. So I&#x27;ve been looking for it every since. I saw it on Amazon, and purchased it. I was afraid it would have been a generic, but it was the actual authentic fragrance!! Great buy!!!</li>

            <li> This is by far one of the best scents that VS put out. I was disappointed when it was discontinued. I took a chance one night and checked Amazon and was surprised to find it here. What a gem and what a find. At least for now, I am loving the way my &amp;#34;Love Rocks&amp;#34;.</li>
