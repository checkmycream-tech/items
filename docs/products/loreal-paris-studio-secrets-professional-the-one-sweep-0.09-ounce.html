            <li>It looks great on my eyes, and is something I&#x27;ll also be doing every morning now!!</li>
            <li>am chatting on the phone with an out of state friend, and she starts to tell me about this incredible eye shadow she is using.</li>
            <li>&quot; I bought it because they colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you the beautiful smokey eye.</li>
            <li>colors are beautiful and pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is also great for beginners in makeup.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the applicator!!</li>
            <li>I really liked the idea of the One-Sweep, but the execution wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>Good for touch ups on the go</li>
            <li>I would buy again because I think that it is handy to have available, but if you are looking for a perfect eye shadow look, you won&#x27;t get it here.</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I will for sure use again!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Would I recommend it, eh kind of iffy about it.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use with beautiful results!</li>
            <li>This product is great for a quick smoky eye look, but you&#x27;ll have to blend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy!  </li>
            <li>It was more of a bright purple than I anticipated but still love how it gives you the smokey eye so easily.</li>
            <li>The colors look beautiful and really did enhance my brown eyes.  </li>
            <li>This eyeshadow will come in handy when I just want something kind of quick...</li>
            <li>I can no longer find these in the stores here, so love being able to purchase here.</li>
            <li>You are better off learning then giving up and using this.</li>
            <li>I love cosmetics, and I was super-excited to try out some L&#x27;Oreal products through buzzagent.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t in a rush to make sure I knew how it works.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>(Ok, I don&#x27;t know what the hell</li>
            <li>I still did not have any faith that this product was going to be the magical smoky eye producer that my friend raved about.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One Sweep Smoky Eye Shadow was considerably more</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One Sweep Smoky Eye Shadow was considerably more</li>
            <li>The color distinction is a bit overwhelming...</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;oreal</li>
            <li>I will be better able to give an opinion once I use it.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of having a quick eyeshadow that is easy to apply and helps to eliminate the time consuming process of priming, contouring, highlighting, and lining...</li>
            <li>I like it to be easy.  </li>
            <li>This eye shadow is so easy to apply that I never go out without doing my makeup.</li>
            <li>Beautiful with blue eyes.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and it worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>but I think even when I&#x27;m in a hurry, I will feel better if I use a blending brush to smooth out the lines and of course, I&#x27;ll be sure to add some primer first as well.    </li>
            <li>The colors are great, It isn&#x27;t necessarily one sweep</li>
            <li>but it does blend smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I received this product free to try and review</li>
            <li>Thankfully, they are still available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The eye shadow is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try this as a BzzAgent and was pretty pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product because of it&#x27;s reported convenience and efficiency.</li>
            <li>actually recommend this product, and am going to begin hoarding it in case they discontinue it as Aveeno has done to my beloved Positively Smooth Lotion.</li>
            <li>actually recommend this product, and am going to begin hoarding it in case they discontinue it as Aveeno has done to my beloved Positively Smooth Lotion.</li>
            <li>My first attempt was not that GREAT, but wait a second.....</li>
            <li>A concept that anyone will be able to grasp successfully after giving it a few practice runs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A concept that anyone will be able to grasp successfully after giving it a few practice runs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tool does not provide professional results by any stretch, but it is nice to have it in the repertoire for times when you just want to swipe and go.  </li>
            <li>As a Bzzz Agent, I received a full size sample of this eyeshadow for brown eyes.</li>
            <li>It can be a little tricky at first figuring out how to use the large contoured applicator that comes with it, but once you figure it out, it is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s fast and easy but there are some problems to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Just note that the look is more natural than a bold eye shadow look.  </li>
            <li>no further for an amazing CHEEK CONTOUR product.</li>
            <li>But I think I like the results better doing it the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>Wow, lots of Bzz Agents on here :)</li>
            <li>If your looking for easy you have gone to far!!</li>
            <li>When I first saw an ad for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s One-Sweep Eyeshadow, I was intrigued, certainly!</li>
            <li>Really like this product; it seems like a gimmick, but actually works great, especially if you want to spend the minimum amount of time doing your makeup.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;d rather use separate colors and get better results.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really SUCK, EITHER!</li>
            <li>(How dare they!)didn&#x27;t really SUCK, EITHER!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I did not use a primer on my lids.</li>
            <li>It always takes a few more sweeps to apply the color completely, which kind of defeats its purpose...    </li>
            <li>Then, add a tiny amount of your favorite blush to the apples of the cheek and blend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also be checking out the playful eyes next :)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>You get the hang of it pretty quick, and then you don&#x27;t want to use your single eye shadows anymore! :)</li>
            <li>It always looks like I spend a lot more time on my eyes than I do thanks to the multiple color palette.  </li>
            <li>I have large eyes</li>
            <li>and it would be nice to use when space is tight and you&#x27;re hurried, maybe at the gym or traveling.</li>
            <li>but really, my lids are not that large, so</li>
            <li>and I think they do make my brown eyes really pop.</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to follow and it really only needs one sweep to leave a decent layer of eye shadow on.  </li>
            <li>I can get the same effect with the other shadows I currently own.</li>
            <li>I would try the L&#x27;Oreal One Sweep right there in the car, so that when I concluded that it sucked, I could immediately bring it back in with a receipt and get my money refunded.  </li>
            <li>the other is light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instant WOW!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product and was terribly upset to find it no longer sold in stores.  </li>
            <li>The brush didn&#x27;t fit my eyes very well, and it was hard to get complete coverage.</li>
            <li>Obviously this was the manufacturers attempt to draw in the cosmetic applying challenged, such as myself, with the promise of an effort free smoky eye in one simple move.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>WoW. There it was.</li>
            <li>WoW. There it was.</li>
            <li>so I will do that before completely disregarding the product.    </li>
            <li>I got the natural hazel.</li>
            <li>I mean ya sure go ahead.</li>
            <li>Although when I was putting it on my left eye for the first time, I had to stop and realized I had to flip the applicator over as well as the eyeshadow pallet to swipe again on the opposite side.</li>
            <li>One problem is it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but at least it is easy to reapply!</li>
            <li>The colors were nice, but went on too sheer and, because of the shape of the applicator it was hard to go over the same area again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it will fit neatly inside a small purse.</li>
            <li>Also, one eyelid eye shadow is higher than the other.</li>
            <li>I sat in my car, flipped the vanity mirror down on the visor, pushed a light on, and ripped open that eyeshadow package like a dieter tearing open a bag of Oreo&#x27;s when no one is around.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, especially people who tend to be too busy to put on makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The applicator was good sized, strangely shaped, and initially awkward as I tried to unravel the direction I was supposed to use to transfer shadow to applicator, and then applicator across eyelid.</li>
            <li>the colors were light enough that imperfections were not obvious, but dark enough to give your eyes a little pop.  </li>

            <li> I mean, everyone has a different eye shape, and no one can really wear eye shadow the same way.</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t tried this before, it will take getting used to swiping the brush so that it picks up all 3 colors evenly, but it really isn&#x27;t that hard.</li>
            <li> Usually I like a thinner liner in the corners of my eyes, thickening the line as I move to the outer counters for a more dramatic effect.    </li>
            <li> My other problem is that I have to wash the brush every time I use it because when I sweep the brush onto the eye shadow, the products went into different places.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This did not work in one single sweep.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like this product; it seems like a gimmick, but actually works great, especially if you want to spend the minimum amount of time doing your makeup.  I can no longer find these in the stores here, so love being able to purchase here.</li>
            <li> CRAP! Plain and simple. This so called \\&quot;one-sweep\\&quot; is a bunch of BULL! I mean ya sure go ahead. Do the one Sweep. See where it gets ya. You will come out looking like a goth rainbow. Or a clown whatever you perfer. I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon. I bought this at a store. I didn&#x27;t buy this due to the \\&quot;One-sweep\\&quot; I bought it because they colors are beautiful. Nonetheless this is junk! It doesn&#x27;t go on correctly. I used the one sweep brush for kicks an giggles because I knew it was going to fail. When I did I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at how stupid I looked. It doesn&#x27;t give you the beautiful smokey eye. If your looking for easy you have gone to far!! Turn back. You are better off learning then giving up and using this. Don&#x27;t get me wrong....If your using this WITHOUT the given brush then YES by all means use it. Take it from me DON&#x27;T use the one sweep brush. ITS JUNK!!!!</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s an eye shadow product that gives you a smoky eye look with three different shadows in one sweep. Seems pretty skeptical but it does work. Itâ€™s fast and easy but there are some problems to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you swipe the brush onto your eyelids, it leaves you solid lines of each of the eye shadow. You will need to blend it out to get rid of the harsh lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other problem is that the eye shadow application is uneven. After I swiped both of my eyes, you can see one eyelid has a dark application and the other is light. Also, one eyelid eye shadow is higher than the other. My other problem is that I have to wash the brush every time I use it because when I sweep the brush onto the eye shadow, the products went into different places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are beautiful and pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a C+...This product is great for a quick smoky eye look, but you&#x27;ll have to blend. This is also great for beginners in makeup. You can just apply each eye shadow individually like i do instead of using the brush. Would I recommend it, eh kind of iffy about it.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, It isn&#x27;t necessarily one sweep but it does blend smoothly.  One problem is it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but at least it is easy to reapply!</li>
            <li> I love cosmetics, and I was super-excited to try out some L&#x27;Oreal products through buzzagent. I really liked the idea of the One-Sweep, but the execution wasn&#x27;t very good. The brush didn&#x27;t fit my eyes very well, and it was hard to get complete coverage. The colors were nice, but went on too sheer and, because of the shape of the applicator it was hard to go over the same area again.&lt;br /&gt;I like the concept and it would be nice to use when space is tight and you&#x27;re hurried, maybe at the gym or traveling. Personally, I&#x27;d rather use separate colors and get better results.</li>
            <li> The poor reviews are baffling. The only issue I had with this is that the colors are a bit dark for every day wear. I followed the directions and it worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I received this product free to try and review and I love it!  The colors look beautiful and really did enhance my brown eyes.  The eye shadow is super easy to use.  You can see each color on your lid but they are blended perfectly.  I will for sure use again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup often, so when I do I like it to be easy.  I had the opportunity to try this as a BzzAgent and was pretty pleased with the results.  This tool does not provide professional results by any stretch, but it is nice to have it in the repertoire for times when you just want to swipe and go.  The color pallet I received included brown, green and tan.. the colors were light enough that imperfections were not obvious, but dark enough to give your eyes a little pop.  I would buy again because I think that it is handy to have available, but if you are looking for a perfect eye shadow look, you won&#x27;t get it here.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Quick and easy to use with beautiful results!</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it would save me time on the days I just am running so late for work.  I was skeptical at first, but I tired it.  I practiced on days I wasn&#x27;t in a rush to make sure I knew how it works.  It&#x27;s so easy!  The instructions are easy to follow and it really only needs one sweep to leave a decent layer of eye shadow on.  Now I use this when I am in a rush and it takes about 30 secs to do my eyes.  What a time saver!  Just note that the look is more natural than a bold eye shadow look.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Beautiful with blue eyes.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I am not a makeup person, because I&#x27;m always in a rush in the mornings. This eye shadow is so easy to apply that I never go out without doing my makeup. Swipe, wipe, and done!  What&#x27;s not to love!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you haven&#x27;t tried this before, it will take getting used to swiping the brush so that it picks up all 3 colors evenly, but it really isn&#x27;t that hard. You get the hang of it pretty quick, and then you don&#x27;t want to use your single eye shadows anymore! :)</li>
            <li> When I first saw an ad for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s One-Sweep Eyeshadow, I was intrigued, certainly! After the wonder and novelty wore off, (three minutes, approximately), I scoffed.  Obviously this was the manufacturers attempt to draw in the cosmetic applying challenged, such as myself, with the promise of an effort free smoky eye in one simple move.&lt;br /&gt;There was just no way. I showed it to my husband, who agreed it was ludicrous. (Ok, I don&#x27;t know what the hell I was thinking discussing eye shadow with my husband either. I just HAD TO  SHOW someone, and my Shih Tzu, Coco Latte&#x27;, was not available.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fastforward several months.&lt;br /&gt;I am chatting on the phone with an out of state friend, and she starts to tell me about this incredible eye shadow she is using. You know which one it was. I was incredulous, but she swore up and down that this stuff just ROCKED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product whore that I am, I was on my way to a Walgreen&#x27;s at 11:00 pm to try the stuff. I didn&#x27;t drive away with my purchase. No, that would be silly. I would try the L&#x27;Oreal One Sweep right there in the car, so that when I concluded that it sucked, I could immediately bring it back in with a receipt and get my money refunded.  I sat in my car, flipped the vanity mirror down on the visor, pushed a light on, and ripped open that eyeshadow package like a dieter tearing open a bag of Oreo&#x27;s when no one is around. I still did not have any faith that this product was going to be the magical smoky eye producer that my friend raved about. I mean, everyone has a different eye shape, and no one can really wear eye shadow the same way. I read that in Seventeen Magazine when I was seventeen! (Which is about 26 years ago, but never mind that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator was good sized, strangely shaped, and initially awkward as I tried to unravel the direction I was supposed to use to transfer shadow to applicator, and then applicator across eyelid. My first attempt was not that GREAT, but wait a second.....HEY! It didn&#x27;t really SUCK, EITHER! I tried again. WoW. There it was. The essential smoky eye. And I was pulling it off. Not only did I have smoky eyes, but I was doing it with ONE product, ONE applicator, and ONE sweep. IMPRESSED? OH YEAH!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Love it! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I WAS going to the Lancome counter at Macy&#x27;s and buying every product they plastered onto my face. I&#x27;d walk away with a bagful of the crap, and I KID YOU NOT: a MAP OF MY FACE and where to put what! (Did I mention? I ALWAYS WEIGHTED LESS AFTER THESE VISITS! About $350 to $400 less.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal One Sweep Smoky Eye Shadow was considerably more affordable!&lt;br /&gt;The applicator takes a LITTLE bit of thought, something that I&#x27;m not inclined to part with....However, once you understand the mechanics of it, the rest is honestly VERY simple. A concept that anyone will be able to grasp successfully after giving it a few practice runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadow color combos are terrific, although I can only vouch for the ones recommended for brown eyes. Color stays on your lids with little to NO fading at all. Stays on until you evict it with a makeup remover yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually recommend this product, and am going to begin hoarding it in case they discontinue it as Aveeno has done to my beloved Positively Smooth Lotion.

            <li> hate that they discontinued these! I love them!</li>
            <li> As a Bzzz Agent, I received a full size sample of this eyeshadow for brown eyes. Let me start by saying I am a makeup fanatic! I was so excited to try this product because of it&#x27;s reported convenience and efficiency. I have tried the eyeshadow about four different times and I also applied it to my best friend to see how it looked on her. Here are the problems I am running into:    1. The first time I used it, I did not use a primer on my lids. Now, I have oily skin and a primer is almost always necessary for me. Within an hour, the eyeshadow had faded and started to smudge. This may be because I had no primer. I have yet to try it with a primer though so I will do that before completely disregarding the product.    2. The color distinction is a bit overwhelming...I have large eyes but really, my lids are not that large, so the deep purple \\&quot;liner\\&quot; color at the bottom looked like it was too think in comparison to the read of the color. Usually I like a thinner liner in the corners of my eyes, thickening the line as I move to the outer counters for a more dramatic effect.    3. This did not work in one single sweep. It always takes a few more sweeps to apply the color completely, which kind of defeats its purpose...    All in all, I gave it three stars. I like the coors themselves and I think they do make my brown eyes really pop. I liked the idea of having a quick eyeshadow that is easy to apply and helps to eliminate the time consuming process of priming, contouring, highlighting, and lining...But I think I like the results better doing it the old fashioned way. Will I use the shadow again? Definitely. Will I purchase another set? Perhaps but probably doubtful. I can get the same effect with the other shadows I currently own. This eyeshadow will come in handy when I just want something kind of quick...and like I said, I like the colors...but I think even when I&#x27;m in a hurry, I will feel better if I use a blending brush to smooth out the lines and of course, I&#x27;ll be sure to add some primer first as well.    One last \\&quot;pro\\&quot;: I did like the size of the compact and I like that it has a mirror built in. Good for touch ups on the go and it will fit neatly inside a small purse. I love L&#x27;oreal so this one product will not keep me from buying other products from the brand. (See my review for the Illuminating mascara as well.)</li>
            <li> Psst!&lt;br /&gt;Look no further for an amazing CHEEK CONTOUR product. Yes, it is meant for eyes, but this is a ten second instant cheek contour!&lt;br /&gt;Apply with the included brush, then blend gently with a small contour brush. Then, add a tiny amount of your favorite blush to the apples of the cheek and blend. Gently.&lt;br /&gt;Instant WOW!</li>
            <li> I have not had the opportunity to use the product yet. I will be better able to give an opinion once I use it. I would imagine that it will  be what I have come to expect of a L&#x27;Oreal product. My past experiences with L&#x27;Oreal products have been positive.</li>
            <li> Wow, lots of Bzz Agents on here :) Well, I ALSO received this to try from Bzz Agent. I got the natural hazel. I am in love with the applicator!! It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to know that you swipe the applicator over the eyeshadow all at once, and then over your eyes!! Although when I was putting it on my left eye for the first time, I had to stop and realized I had to flip the applicator over as well as the eyeshadow pallet to swipe again on the opposite side. Not a big deal. Seriously, it takes all of 20 seconds to do your eyeshadow!! I didn&#x27;t have any other problems with it. It looks great on my eyes, and is something I&#x27;ll also be doing every morning now!! I&#x27;ll also be checking out the playful eyes next :) I definitely recommend this product, especially people who tend to be too busy to put on makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Could not find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It was more of a bright purple than I anticipated but still love how it gives you the smokey eye so easily.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product and was terribly upset to find it no longer sold in stores.  Thankfully, they are still available on Amazon.  I have several colors and wear alone or use as a base when I want to change it up a bit.  It always looks like I spend a lot more time on my eyes than I do thanks to the multiple color palette.  It can be a little tricky at first figuring out how to use the large contoured applicator that comes with it, but once you figure it out, it is AMAZING!!!!</li>
