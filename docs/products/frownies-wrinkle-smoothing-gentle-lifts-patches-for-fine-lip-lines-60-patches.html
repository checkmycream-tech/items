    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These have been around for years, for good reason:  they work!  </li>
            <li>promotes the best results - a kind of temporary, mini facelift.</li>
            <li>Win some.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled Frownies came out with these!  </li>
            <li>I found these patches work best for my frown lines between my eyebrows, and for keeping my lips from pressing together and forming lines across the top of my lip while I sleep.  </li>
            <li>Works fairly well but can come off during the night.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I have lip lines and got very excited when I seen this product as some of the reviews looked great.  </li>
            <li>Great product and so comfortable compared to the paper ones.</li>
            <li>I would like the Frownie to be infused with some kind of serum</li>
            <li>They are worth EVERY penny!!!</li>
            <li>Just make sure not to put them on over any kind of nighttime moisturizer, however, because they won&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>have re-discovered it - gift to relatives in eastern Europe who didn&#x27;t know of Lou Reed before, and they love it too.</li>
            <li>While I absolutely love the Frownies Forehead &amp; Between the Eyes, I did not like this product.  </li>
            <li>I love frownies..</li>
            <li>That made it all worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I use them faithfully now to keep from forming more lines while I sleep.</li>
            <li>I really like the Frownie products, they all work great.</li>
            <li>I love Frownies...</li>
            <li>I love the thought of the way these work.</li>
            <li>Tried even putting it on my forehead it did stick better there but still fell of after about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The lines are now greatly reduced and my lips look far more relaxed</li>
            <li>but until then, clean your face, apply your favorite serum, let dry, then apply the Frownie for best results.</li>
            <li>Works much better than any Frownies product available, and not just at the lip line.  </li>
            <li>This is not my favorite as I prefer the original that needs to be moistened before using.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend these Frownies, even though I use the original paper Frownies for frown lines between the eyebrows and love them.</li>
            <li>They are fabulous for nasolabial folds and the sides of the mouth.  </li>
            <li>They are fantastic, though i never could get them to stick anywhere but my forehead.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so impressed with this product, because it appears to create a new wrinkle at the same time I am attempting to get rid of others.</li>
            <li>In addition, it is training me to be very aware of the frowns and scrunches that I put my face through throughout the day that create these lines.  </li>
            <li>In particular, I&#x27;ve been using them around my chin lines with great success and also on my \\&quot;elevens\\&quot; between my eyes above the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li>It took an entire box before I figured out how to make these effective.</li>
            <li>use the lifts as well for under my right eye and it smooths out the lines as well around that area.</li>
            <li>It is a fairly deep crease and even one night with the frownie on makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>These really do work!  </li>
            <li>It does smooth the lines around your lips,but they do not go away completely</li>
            <li>the ones for the frown lines work really well!</li>
            <li>I first saw them at my sister&#x27;s house</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stick very well and, given the way your mouth moves naturally, they come off too easily.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the effects wear off pretty much by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>These are easy to apply and the lines above my lips are softening as promised.</li>
            <li>it is getting them off without fear of ripping off the fine upper lip hair which I fear would result in a mustache!  </li>
            <li>Shipped the item quickly, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, and I really like Frownies and have used them for years because they work and because my dermatologist recommended them.  </li>
            <li>Okay, really do not stay on well like the spray activated ones for forehead.</li>
            <li>One of the coolest products I have seen to deal with my gentle frown lines.</li>
            <li>So I just patiently sit with a warm washcloth over the patches for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Love the other Frownie products though.</li>
            <li>It would probably be better to just apply the patches without stretching the skin ~ just like with the other Frownies products.  </li>
            <li>Recipient says: I like the Frownies line of products, particularly the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Also, the other ones are easy to use, remove &amp; reuse...</li>
            <li>I will try to return them as they don&#x27;t even begin to do what they claim &amp; they are far from gentle.  </li>
            <li>A narrow 3\\&quot; curve would probably work better, for centering under the nose and below the bottom lip.</li>
            <li>New to me.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I like them thus far and will see if they are worth the price long term.</li>
            <li>This summer I was beginning to notice the lines in EVERY light, even from a few feet away from a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size is only for one side of the mouth at a time, so I decided to try it on the left side and compare it with the right.  </li>
            <li>These are very unforgiving in the lip area; they will not lay flat and pucker your lip, counter productive.  </li>
            <li>Service was fine not satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>The center of the band-aid will stay stuck on all night as long as my skin is completely clean (no moisturizer on the area).</li>
            <li>I have used the Frownies product line for over two years now and only recently added these Gentle Lifts.  </li>
            <li>Since they are somewhat inexpensive compared to other wrinkle treatments and safe, and could tell a little difference, I will probably order another pack.</li>
            <li>first I had trouble with them, but now I CANNOT live without them.  </li>
            <li>Yes they do stick just fine, remove them slowly.</li>
            <li>I was excited but cautiously optimistic, and then immediately disappointed when I opened them because they were more like \\&quot;Band Aids\\&quot; instead of the paper forehead</li>
            <li>These small patches work better than any of their other Frownies product.  </li>
            <li>Quite simply put, they are IMPOSSIBLE to use and because of that I really can&#x27;t tell you honestly if they work or not.</li>
            <li>To apply, I curl my top lip tightly over my teeth to flatten out the vertical muscles and center lip peaks, then press the stiff Frownies band-aid across the center area right under my nose.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> To apply, I curl my top lip tightly over my teeth to flatten out the vertical muscles and center lip peaks, then press the stiff Frownies band-aid across the center area right under my nose.</li>
            <li> also tried the pads in chin and lower mouth area wrinkles, but because these areas are soft and fleshy, wrinkles between the pads were created or they left an outline of themselves that remained for quote a few</li>
            <li> : It would help a lot if the stiff band-aid was much longer because the ends don&#x27;t stick down on the current version.</li>
            <li> Although they are somewhat difficult to use at the lip line, they are FANTASTIC everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> I would like to rerurn but waited too long.  </li>
            <li> The trick is, you have to start one one side, literally spreading out the upper lip with 2 fingers of 1 hand while applying the Forwnie with the other.  </li>
            <li> Skin has to be completely dry.</li>
            <li> Loose some.</li>
            <li> You have to use at least three in a row to cover your upper lip but the pads do not abutt each other well, as each pad has an unsticky edge around its entire outside.  </li>
            <li> Does help soften lines a little  if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> The patches have not irritated me but not much bothers my skin.</li>
            <li> Lip Lines appear to be gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only wearing them over night a few days a week &amp; it seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> and I can see absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> I have used Frownies for years ~ but this product really makes lines look worse.  </li>
            <li> I just cut the regular frownies into a narrow oval and apply to my lip crease which has formed from years of sleeping on my side.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected but works well.</li>
            <li> one fell off and I could tell the other one was very loose.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on the lip area like the other frownies do,  </li>
            <li> these are hard tiny little peices and unless your face is flat like yiour forehead they will not stay.</li>
            <li> The pads are too small - only about a half inch in length - and they are thick and somewhat cushiony and also quite stiff.  </li>
            <li> These are rigid little ovals that work well</li>
            <li> When sleeping, the little pads cause a wrinkle to form between adjoined pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I just press down hard for a few seconds and repeat on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money on these.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these lip ones, but was desperate for something to soften the lines that started forming above my upper lip a few years back.</li>
            <li> Please believe me, first of all they will barely stay on the stickiness of them is terrible.  </li>
            <li> They are like thick, little bandaids.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever been disappointed with their products.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, use the paper ones instead!</li>
            <li> I did not realize how small they were; you must use two.</li>
            <li> Too stiff and hard to adhere correctly.  </li>
            <li> but of course, once removed the lines will slowly reappear.</li>
            <li> They are quite thick as well.</li>
            <li> No more frown lines for me!</li>
            <li> Works no better or worse than any tape would.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These little pads are quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> and then I peel them off downwards very slowly...</li>
            <li> Poor product.</li>
            <li> The lines were progressively getting worse when I decided to try this version of Frownies.</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> it is absolutely useless.  </li>
            <li> but, this product is terrible &amp; a waste of money.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am thrilled Frownies came out with these!  They are fabulous for nasolabial folds and the sides of the mouth.  Great product and so comfortable compared to the paper ones.</li>
            <li> Does help soften lines a little  if you use it daily. The patches have not irritated me but not much bothers my skin. I wore them nightly on my frown lines between my eyes. They did not bother my sleep and did not fall off. I did notice that the effects wear off pretty much by the end of the day. Since they are somewhat inexpensive compared to other wrinkle treatments and safe, and could tell a little difference, I will probably order another pack. You may want to try these but do not expect BOTOX results.</li>
            <li> peel off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and have re-discovered it - gift to relatives in eastern Europe who didn&#x27;t know of Lou Reed before, and they love it too.</li>
            <li> These really do work!  In addition, it is training me to be very aware of the frowns and scrunches that I put my face through throughout the day that create these lines.  It has brought my attention to the fact that I need to lighten up and relax about life and work.  That is what permanently gets rid of these scrunch lines. Until I master that, however, I will use the Frownies.  Perhaps it is because of the rosehip oil I use on my face, but I reuse my Frownies for sometimes a week before the adhesive wears off.  Count me a believer!  Thank you, Racquel Welch, for bringing these to my attention in your book!</li>
            <li> While I absolutely love the Frownies Forehead &amp; Between the Eyes, I did not like this product.  The shape does not follow the lip line to keep everything in place.  These also fall off at night.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well but can come off during the night.</li>
            <li> I love frownies..the origional brown paper that you put in water and stick on your forehead. They are fantastic, though i never could get them to stick anywhere but my forehead. These are supposed to be for the lip area.no way..these are hard tiny little peices and unless your face is flat like yiour forehead they will not stay. waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so impressed with this product, because it appears to create a new wrinkle at the same time I am attempting to get rid of others.The supplier was terrific- Shipped the item quickly, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The product does it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;But the results don&#x27;t last and the area of coverage is smaller than what I need.</li>
            <li> No Pun intended.  I am also a lover of the forehead patches, have been using them for over a decade.  I was skeptical about these lip ones, but was desperate for something to soften the lines that started forming above my upper lip a few years back. This summer I was beginning to notice the lines in EVERY light, even from a few feet away from a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When these lip patches arrived I was excited but cautiously optimistic, and then immediately disappointed when I opened them because they were more like \\&quot;Band Aids\\&quot; instead of the paper forehead patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I had trouble with them, but now I CANNOT live without them.  The trick is, you have to start one one side, literally spreading out the upper lip with 2 fingers of 1 hand while applying the Forwnie with the other.  Then I just press down hard for a few seconds and repeat on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part is not that I can&#x27;t get them to stick...it is getting them off without fear of ripping off the fine upper lip hair which I fear would result in a mustache!  So I just patiently sit with a warm washcloth over the patches for a few minutes and then I peel them off downwards very slowly...the result...VOILA!!! Lip Lines appear to be gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only wearing them over night a few days a week &amp; it seems to do the trick.  I feel like I am erasing the lines, and trust me, I am my harshest critic. But just like the forehead patches, when I stop using them, wrinkles come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So stick with it!  They are worth EVERY penny!!!</li>
            <li> I have used the Frownies product line for over two years now and only recently added these Gentle Lifts.  Although they are somewhat difficult to use at the lip line, they are FANTASTIC everywhere else.  In particular, I&#x27;ve been using them around my chin lines with great success and also on my \\&quot;elevens\\&quot; between my eyes above the bridge of my nose.  Recently, a close friend who is 5-years younger, asked me about my skin regimine and commented that I \\&quot;didn&#x27;t have any wrinkles\\&quot;.  Wow!  That made it all worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I found these patches work best for my frown lines between my eyebrows, and for keeping my lips from pressing together and forming lines across the top of my lip while I sleep.  I use them faithfully now to keep from forming more lines while I sleep.</li>
            <li> These have been around for years, for good reason:  they work!  Just make sure not to put them on over any kind of nighttime moisturizer, however, because they won&#x27;t stay on.  Skin has to be completely dry.</li>
            <li> I really like the Frownie products, they all work great. This is not my favorite as I prefer the original that needs to be moistened before using. These are rigid little ovals that work well, I may just be a creature of habit.</li>
            <li> I love Frownies...have used them for years but, this product is terrible &amp; a waste of money.  I will try to return them as they don&#x27;t even begin to do what they claim &amp; they are far from gentle.  Also, the other ones are easy to use, remove &amp; reuse...these are not.  First time I&#x27;ve ever been disappointed with their products.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, use the paper ones instead!</li>
            <li> It does smooth the lines around your lips,but they do not go away completely: they soften the lines.&lt;br /&gt;I use the lifts as well for under my right eye and it smooths out the lines as well around that area.</li>
            <li> Yes they do stick just fine, remove them slowly. They are like thick, little bandaids. They do work but of course, once removed the lines will slowly reappear. I found using them whilst i sleep overnight promotes the best results - a kind of temporary, mini facelift. I would like the Frownie to be infused with some kind of serum but until then, clean your face, apply your favorite serum, let dry, then apply the Frownie for best results.</li>
            <li> The size is only for one side of the mouth at a time, so I decided to try it on the left side and compare it with the right.  I did it for over  a week and I can see absolutely no difference.  It&#x27;s a shame, and I really like Frownies and have used them for years because they work and because my dermatologist recommended them.  Also, I don&#x27;t like all the unwrapping you have to do.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stick very well and, given the way your mouth moves naturally, they come off too easily.</li>
            <li> I would never buy these again. Quite simply put, they are IMPOSSIBLE to use and because of that I really can&#x27;t tell you honestly if they work or not.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected but works well.</li>
            <li> Okay, really do not stay on well like the spray activated ones for forehead.</li>
            <li> Recipient says: I like the Frownies line of products, particularly the [[ASIN:B004U3ARC4 Frownies Forehead &amp; Between Eyes 144-ct.]], so I decided to give these a try. I like them thus far and will see if they are worth the price long term.</li>
            <li> Too stiff and hard to adhere correctly.  I would like to rerurn but waited too long.  Win some. Loose some.</li>
            <li> Works much better than any Frownies product available, and not just at the lip line.  I have those very deep &amp;#34;angry eleven&amp;#34; lines between my eye brows.  These small patches work better than any of their other Frownies product.  They say they are reuseable.  Not on my skin.  I also use Scotch Tape to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> Service was fine not satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> These are very unforgiving in the lip area; they will not lay flat and pucker your lip, counter productive.  When I took one of them off, some skin came off with it.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on the lip area like the other frownies do,  I feel like I wasted my money on these.  Love the other Frownie products though.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how small they were; you must use two. They are quite thick as well.</li>
            <li> Works no better or worse than any tape would. I found the attitude of the company user-unfriendly. I asked if there was any guarantee or assurance and was told no, however, open packages would not be accepted for refund. I was also told that no one has ever returned Frownies. How can one be dissatisfied with a product without opening it?  Does that make sense to anyone?</li>
            <li> I have used Frownies for years ~ but this product really makes lines look worse.  Directions say to stretch the skin lines before applying patches.  By the next morning, not only were the lines still there, they seem to have gotten deeper once the patches were taken off.  It would probably be better to just apply the patches without stretching the skin ~ just like with the other Frownies products.  Sorry, but they missed the mark on this one.</li>
            <li> You have to use them religiously!! If you do they work/also the ones for the frown lines work really well!</li>
            <li> I love the thought of the way these work. I first saw them at my sister&#x27;s house so I decided to try them. I let you know later how they work for me.</li>
            <li> Same as for frowies forehead.  Poor product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them enough yet. New to me.</li>
            <li> PLEASE do not buy this product it is absolutely useless.  I have lip lines and got very excited when I seen this product as some of the reviews looked great.  Maybe who reviewed them works for Frownies as they do NOTHING for you.  Please believe me, first of all they will barely stay on the stickiness of them is terrible.  I put two on and got into bed one fell off and I could tell the other one was very loose.  Tried even putting it on my forehead it did stick better there but still fell of after about 15 minutes.  Keep your money and do not buy these.</li>
            <li> I just cut the regular frownies into a narrow oval and apply to my lip crease which has formed from years of sleeping on my side. It is a fairly deep crease and even one night with the frownie on makes a huge difference! So if you want to save some $ you can just use your regular frownies!</li>
            <li> These are easy to apply and the lines above my lips are softening as promised. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It took an entire box before I figured out how to make these effective. I wear a nightguard (retainer) to protect my teeth, which causes me to pucker my lips during sleep. The lines were progressively getting worse when I decided to try this version of Frownies. To apply, I curl my top lip tightly over my teeth to flatten out the vertical muscles and center lip peaks, then press the stiff Frownies band-aid across the center area right under my nose. This discourages the lip muscles from forming a pucker while I sleep, and doesn&#x27;t touch my lips so I can keep balm on them. The center of the band-aid will stay stuck on all night as long as my skin is completely clean (no moisturizer on the area). The lines are now greatly reduced and my lips look far more relaxed the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Modification Request: It would help a lot if the stiff band-aid was much longer because the ends don&#x27;t stick down on the current version. A narrow 3\\&quot; curve would probably work better, for centering under the nose and below the bottom lip.</li>
            <li> The pads are too small - only about a half inch in length - and they are thick and somewhat cushiony and also quite stiff.  You have to use at least three in a row to cover your upper lip but the pads do not abutt each other well, as each pad has an unsticky edge around its entire outside.  When sleeping, the little pads cause a wrinkle to form between adjoined pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the pads in chin and lower mouth area wrinkles, but because these areas are soft and fleshy, wrinkles between the pads were created or they left an outline of themselves that remained for quote a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little pads are quite expensive.  Instead of throwing them out,  I gave them to a friend to try.  She had the same complaints as I did and gave them back to me.  I cannot recommend these Frownies, even though I use the original paper Frownies for frown lines between the eyebrows and love them.</li>
            <li> No more frown lines for me! One of the coolest products I have seen to deal with my gentle frown lines.</li>
