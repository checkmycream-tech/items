            <li>works so good.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Rene Russo said she used them and loved them.</li>
            <li>Still good.</li>
            <li>To be fair, this product does at promised.</li>
            <li>Thats whats good about Amazon.</li>
            <li>Depending on how you sleep, lines are created around the stickers and if you don&#x27;t hold a warm cloth on them for a good while in the morning, they hurt to remove.</li>
            <li>Love these things!  </li>
            <li>I love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>Love these Frownies!  </li>
            <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t want any more!  </li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>These stay on amazingly well...</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I like them because they leave kind of a shield across my forehead.</li>
            <li>Your better options would be exercise, diet, and a good cream solution.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have seen the effect on her with no prompting to &amp;#34;look at my face&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>r gone awesome, but only for 2 minutes then they return again not too happy about that.  </li>
            <li>I bought the rose water spray that was recommended to go with it- even though it was a bit pricey, because I wanted to make sure I did exactly what was needed to get the best result.</li>
            <li>I am excited to hopefully avoid the \\&quot;worry-brow\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li>They were also very easy to remove IF directions are followed, i.e. thoroughly soak the patch.  </li>
            <li>They are great, I&#x27;ve used other brands but Frownies work the best.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a temporary effect, I believe they are a very good find that I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>I think the rose water activator works better than water.</li>
            <li>but these are the most amazing product.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>Frownies are amazing for a quick fix!</li>
            <li>I hope this keeps getting better and better all the time.  </li>
            <li>I am really impressed with the results, i will definitely buy again !!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping not to have to resort to more severe measures.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t wear them the frown lines seem more noticeable in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am sure this type works better  than  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t wear it my frown line is much more noticeable.</li>
            <li>The more often you use them the better the results</li>
            <li>I wake up completely smooth in that area now!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much safe than Botox.</li>
            <li>, I thought they would be of a better quality.  </li>
            <li>but they worked way better and were better quality than Frownies.  </li>
            <li>Love these..</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>To get more bang for your buck, apply moisturizer to the area 15 minutes before applying the frownie.</li>
            <li>I love them......</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>but I feel more relaxed when I go to bed.</li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em .  </li>
            <li>I have one crease between my brown line (not the 11&#x27;s like most people) that has bothered me for some time.</li>
            <li>She thinks they help most with the lines between eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it works for everyone, but for me, this product really does work great.</li>
            <li>so I was glad I checked out Amazon, and there they were.....</li>
            <li>If applied correctly, nothing works better.</li>
            <li>When I take it off, it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>Used for many years.</li>
            <li>i am def noticing a reduction in my rather prominent forehead lines.</li>
            <li>I make sure I never run out of these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll help it from getting more but not improve the crease.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I betcha you love em.</li>
            <li>Been using for years, and feel &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; without them :).</li>
            <li>was mostly before falling asleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to need to use more eggs.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Still my favorite product for between the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am 67 with skin better than most my age.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>They do work, my forehead seems more relaxed in the morning.</li>
            <li>OKAY</li>
            <li>I dont love them yet.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I needed and at a good price.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is a safe, easy and not taking the cosmetic surgery approach to reducing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Combined with a regimen of tretinoin and massage/manipulation, I have managed to virtually remove the 11&#x27;s that were becoming increasingly deeper on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>using now and it free and better</li>
            <li>Tried other brands and this one is still the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy, inexpensive and noninvasive way to avoid lines on your face from sleeping.</li>
            <li>Easy, inexpensive way to minimize frown lines.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use and once on</li>
            <li>so a box easily lasts a year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll fall off easily.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to attach a patch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and remove.</li>
            <li>It does make a difference in the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I am 25 and started getting fine lines on my forehead and was bothered by them.</li>
            <li>This would be fine</li>
            <li>I found that mine worked the best when slightly angled on the forehead.</li>
            <li>and I will be free of fine lines.  </li>
            <li>In just two days they have made a HUGE change in the wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I use these every night just for the between the eyebrows frown wrinkles--they make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Botox on a budget works fabulously</li>
            <li>Remember to stretch the area between your eyes to smooth out the crease BEFORE you apply the frownie.</li>
            <li>I am 35 have light &amp;#34;11 lines&amp;#34; between my eyes.</li>
            <li>Bizarre I know.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>I do believe they smooth out the lines between my eyes if used every night.  </li>
            <li>They do smooth out the 11 area quite a bit</li>
            <li>Pretty soon I&#x27;ll be sticking them all over my face--as I age and continue my love for sun every summer....</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because it was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>the more consistently you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Frownies in the past and they work wonderfully...</li>
            <li>I have a line between my brows that was getting deeper and deeper, but using this has arrested the deepening and smoothed out the line significantly.</li>
            <li>I use Frownies as a temporary fix if I am going somewhere special.  </li>
            <li>Be sure not to use too much liquid or patch will not hold and will be ruined.</li>
            <li>i think one full box to train that area to relax</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to soak the frownie with water, but do get enough water on it so it gets good and tacky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not a bad price</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>it really works!!</li>
            <li>not too pretty if you are on a special date, but they DO keep the creases away.  </li>
            <li>So glad they are now available on Amazon as always purchased them on a different website.</li>
            <li>These are precious so do not waste.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; behind frownies helps me do the best I can at keeping the wrinkles at bay and</li>
            <li>For that, she thinks they are worth the price.</li>
            <li>They are also economical.</li>
            <li>I have a prominent crease between my eyes despite being fairly young.</li>
            <li>But better to start young.</li>
            <li>I apply fingertip amount of pomegranate oil directly to the area beforehand, sticks better, adds hydration.</li>
            <li>Their shipment time was super fast!</li>
            <li>Certainly cheaper than Botox or fillers!</li>
            <li>They are natural and easy to use.</li>
            <li>After a while, you should be able to skip a few days and be ok.</li>
            <li>hae used these for a few years now - excellent and immediate results the next AM - resisting any temptation to put toxins into my face.</li>
            <li>Before buying I read the reviews....should have trusted the ones that were less than good..</li>
            <li>They were not frown lines, but possibly created from side sleeping and good old gravity.  </li>
            <li>I have a scar from going through a windshield many years ago that was at one time under my chin---it has somehow crept up over the years to above my jawline----the frownies</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s definitely cheaper :-)</li>
            <li>so frownies work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>they reduce those lines with consistent use.</li>
            <li>and if it works for you, I would wonder if it was more from &amp;#34;wishful thinking&amp;#34; than this actual product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the deep lines between the eyes for more than 10 years since I was in the mid-50.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that in the next day or two that will be gone</li>
            <li>The more you use them, and  the younger you start, the faster you will notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I just ordered 3 more boxes even though I have 1 1/2 boxes left.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the same results can be achieved with &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But must use consistently all night.</li>
            <li>They really work!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve uses them for years and this is the first box I&#x27;ve had an issue with.</li>
            <li>because if I miss one night, the line is evident again.</li>
            <li>The most I&#x27;ve skipped was probably a week at a time which didn&#x27;t have a big impact.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s activated by water, but what exactly is in the glue?</li>
            <li>Might be ok to use just on \\&quot;11&#x27;s for temporary improvement before a big event.  </li>
            <li>The first time was an accident, forgot to blend.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than waking up with deep lines in my forehead.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, thank you!  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>but it definitely helps me look more awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said, you do forget they are on which can be pretty funny.</li>
            <li>the other kind  </li>
            <li>for some reason I keep getting the other kind that dont stick as well as these ones.  </li>
            <li>A frown line can really age you, and now, I don&#x27;t have one, thanks to Frownies!</li>
            <li>They seem less effective.</li>
            <li>I usually press on patch &amp; hold for about 1 min to be sure it&#x27;s secure.</li>
            <li>I did not have very high hopes for these when I ordered.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for a temporary improvement... possibly before a party, stick them on for a few hours?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have to round off the corners, however I don&#x27;t have to be real precise in doing so.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really take care of the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>These really work -- no joke.</li>
            <li>(And the results for me have lasted the whole day)</li>
            <li>Fast forward and at 47 they ate permanent even during the day.  </li>
            <li>The wrinkles between the eyes are smooth after regular use.</li>
            <li>For years these really helped.  </li>
            <li>They really do work</li>
            <li>They really work</li>
            <li>Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>A simple way to keep that area smooth for about 8 hours per night.</li>
            <li>These really work.  </li>
            <li>Just wet it, and pop it on, be sure to (gently)stretch your skin so you are not putting the Frownie over a crease.</li>
            <li>This really keeps my forehead from developing sleep lines.  </li>
            <li>If I go without them a night or two, I really see the difference in the mirror.</li>
            <li>These things really work.</li>
            <li>They work really well</li>
            <li>The paper is much thinner, they don&#x27;t stay in place and basically don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>This makes a real difference.</li>
            <li>I still have the 11, but they are much milder now than they used to be.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>They really do work.</li>
            <li>IT IS NON TOXIC AND GENTLE .</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It also is really helping me realize when I am frowning so</li>
            <li>Have been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Two nights into using Frownies and all I can say is, wow, these work!!!</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>after a bit the original back into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>one year later: Because really good items can suddenly disappear (Amazon is the ONLY place I can find Frownies)</li>
            <li>I CANNOT live without my Frownies!</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I doubted very much that it would work, but it was inexpensive enough</li>
            <li>so much I can;t allow myself to live by one---I&#x27;d never come off of it.....</li>
            <li>Here, you get a 4 month supply for less than $15 and they work much better.</li>
            <li>These are definitely not a permanent solution but they work so noticeably that I will make sure to use them the night before any big event/date/etc.</li>
            <li>they just need to come up with an entire facial mask :-)</li>
            <li>Price is high for what is basically gummed kraft paper but they work.</li>
            <li>I have also cut these in half to test out smaller patches in multiple spots and although it can be done, the adhesion wasn&#x27;t quite as great this way.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews</li>
            <li>i have only used like 10 days worth ....</li>
            <li>Sure, it plumps your face when you awaken in the morning; but, after a few hours the effect wears off.  </li>
            <li>The lines return right back to normal.</li>
            <li>Smooth the lines with fingers before pressing 1 moisture square patch over the area until it is complete dry (about 15 -20 seconds)</li>
            <li>I use them on the the side of my right eye, where I sleep and get deep creases.</li>
            <li>Sure it is a temporary fix of my ugly and hateful &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s better than nothing!</li>
            <li>I will try something new.  </li>
            <li>but they still pushed in new wrinkles</li>
            <li>I remember my mom using these when I was very young.  </li>
            <li>This is the first and last time I order from this company.  </li>
            <li>They work only if your are consistent.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have no more lines between the eyes any more.</li>
            <li>I have a huge wrinkle down my forehead as a result of bells palsy.</li>
            <li>When I take the little triangle off in the morning the huge wrinkle is practically gone.</li>
            <li>use just a little water and smooth on patch.</li>
            <li>Could see a big difference starting from the first use!</li>
            <li>They were old and they didn&#x27;t stick....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years- at almost 70 years old, I don&#x27;t have any forehead lines.</li>
            <li>I might be too sensitive.</li>
            <li>very night before going to bed and remove the patch next morning when you wake up.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, these might not be for you.</li>
            <li>I used these religiously for 6 straight weeks with zero results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s EXACTLY the same product just in a much bigger roll and cheaper price without the fancy name and box.</li>
            <li>Impossible to find anywhere so happy to get them through Amazon.</li>
            <li>For deep lines, it may take a few weeks before the lines smooth out.  </li>
            <li>Need something a little more extreme.</li>
            <li>My order appeared as though the box had been in the oven or someplace very hot and they were al dried up&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Unale to use them</li>
            <li>anyway after three nites of using frownies---they are actaully getting less and less prominent.  </li>
            <li>It a standard old product.</li>
            <li>Seller did make it right after a little coaxing.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about these since I have used expensive creams before with no luck and for something that costs only $15 to be so effective is amazing.</li>
            <li>-they go unnoticed, unlike my silly looking tape, lol.</li>
            <li>These little things really work!</li>
            <li>Not sure how extended use of this would result in long term wrinkle prevention but the line on my forehead is significantly plumper after I remove these things over night.</li>
            <li>If you use them as directed, faithfully for the first few weeks then once or twice a week, that pesky frown line between your eyes will almost disappear.</li>
            <li>(3) the light brown papers (same color as grocery store paper bags) look a tad bit ridiculous on one&#x27;s forehead.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if the creases are actually less</li>
            <li>Basically, wearing Frownies is like adding a little gluey substance to a paper bag and sticking on your wrinkles and thinking your wrinkles will magically go away!</li>
            <li>I like to use them the night prior to big events because trying to use them every night gets a little too much.</li>

            <li> swimmer for years and loving the beach....love the beach!  </li>
            <li> Always does a good job.</li>
            <li> I just use a good primer and foundation.</li>
            <li> works so good.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> Rene Russo said she used them and loved them.</li>
            <li> Still good.</li>
            <li> To be fair, this product does at promised.</li>
            <li> Thats whats good about Amazon.</li>
            <li> Depending on how you sleep, lines are created around the stickers and if you don&#x27;t hold a warm cloth on them for a good while in the morning, they hurt to remove.</li>
            <li> Love these things!  </li>
            <li> I love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> Love these!  </li>
            <li> Love these Frownies!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t want any more!  </li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> These stay on amazingly well...</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I like them because they leave kind of a shield across my forehead.</li>
            <li> Your better options would be exercise, diet, and a good cream solution.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say I have seen the effect on her with no prompting to &amp;#34;look at my face&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> r gone awesome, but only for 2 minutes then they return again not too happy about that.  </li>
            <li> I bought the rose water spray that was recommended to go with it- even though it was a bit pricey, because I wanted to make sure I did exactly what was needed to get the best result.</li>
            <li> I am excited to hopefully avoid the \\&quot;worry-brow\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li> They were also very easy to remove IF directions are followed, i.e. thoroughly soak the patch.  </li>
            <li> They are great, I&#x27;ve used other brands but Frownies work the best.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a temporary effect, I believe they are a very good find that I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I think the rose water activator works better than water.</li>
            <li> but these are the most amazing product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Frownies are amazing for a quick fix!</li>
            <li> I hope this keeps getting better and better all the time.  </li>
            <li> I am really impressed with the results, i will definitely buy again !!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping not to have to resort to more severe measures.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t wear them the frown lines seem more noticeable in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am sure this type works better  than  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wear it my frown line is much more noticeable.</li>
            <li> The more often you use them the better the results</li>
            <li> I wake up completely smooth in that area now!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much safe than Botox.</li>
            <li> , I thought they would be of a better quality.  </li>
            <li> but they worked way better and were better quality than Frownies.  </li>
            <li> Love these..</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> To get more bang for your buck, apply moisturizer to the area 15 minutes before applying the frownie.</li>
            <li> I love them......</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> but I feel more relaxed when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em .  </li>
            <li> I have one crease between my brown line (not the 11&#x27;s like most people) that has bothered me for some time.</li>
            <li> She thinks they help most with the lines between eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works for everyone, but for me, this product really does work great.</li>
            <li> so I was glad I checked out Amazon, and there they were.....</li>
            <li> If applied correctly, nothing works better.</li>
            <li> When I take it off, it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li> love.</li>
            <li> Used for many years.</li>
            <li> i am def noticing a reduction in my rather prominent forehead lines.</li>
            <li> I make sure I never run out of these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll help it from getting more but not improve the crease.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I betcha you love em.</li>
            <li> Been using for years, and feel &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; without them :).</li>
            <li> was mostly before falling asleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to need to use more eggs.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Still my favorite product for between the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am 67 with skin better than most my age.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> They do work, my forehead seems more relaxed in the morning.</li>
            <li> OKAY</li>
            <li> I dont love them yet.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is a safe, easy and not taking the cosmetic surgery approach to reducing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Combined with a regimen of tretinoin and massage/manipulation, I have managed to virtually remove the 11&#x27;s that were becoming increasingly deeper on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> using now and it free and better</li>
            <li> Tried other brands and this one is still the best.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy, inexpensive and noninvasive way to avoid lines on your face from sleeping.</li>
            <li> Easy, inexpensive way to minimize frown lines.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use and once on</li>
            <li> so a box easily lasts a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll fall off easily.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to attach a patch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and remove.</li>
            <li> It does make a difference in the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and started getting fine lines on my forehead and was bothered by them.</li>
            <li> This would be fine</li>
            <li> I found that mine worked the best when slightly angled on the forehead.</li>
            <li> and I will be free of fine lines.  </li>
            <li> In just two days they have made a HUGE change in the wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I use these every night just for the between the eyebrows frown wrinkles--they make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Botox on a budget works fabulously</li>
            <li> Remember to stretch the area between your eyes to smooth out the crease BEFORE you apply the frownie.</li>
            <li> I am 35 have light &amp;#34;11 lines&amp;#34; between my eyes.</li>
            <li> Bizarre I know.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I do believe they smooth out the lines between my eyes if used every night.  </li>
            <li> They do smooth out the 11 area quite a bit</li>
            <li> Pretty soon I&#x27;ll be sticking them all over my face--as I age and continue my love for sun every summer....</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because it was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> the more consistently you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Frownies in the past and they work wonderfully...</li>
            <li> I have a line between my brows that was getting deeper and deeper, but using this has arrested the deepening and smoothed out the line significantly.</li>
            <li> I use Frownies as a temporary fix if I am going somewhere special.  </li>
            <li> Be sure not to use too much liquid or patch will not hold and will be ruined.</li>
            <li> i think one full box to train that area to relax</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to soak the frownie with water, but do get enough water on it so it gets good and tacky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a bad price</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> it really works!!</li>
            <li> not too pretty if you are on a special date, but they DO keep the creases away.  </li>
            <li> So glad they are now available on Amazon as always purchased them on a different website.</li>
            <li> These are precious so do not waste.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; behind frownies helps me do the best I can at keeping the wrinkles at bay and</li>
            <li> For that, she thinks they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> They are also economical.</li>
            <li> I have a prominent crease between my eyes despite being fairly young.</li>
            <li> But better to start young.</li>
            <li> I apply fingertip amount of pomegranate oil directly to the area beforehand, sticks better, adds hydration.</li>
            <li> Their shipment time was super fast!</li>
            <li> Certainly cheaper than Botox or fillers!</li>
            <li> They are natural and easy to use.</li>
            <li> After a while, you should be able to skip a few days and be ok.</li>
            <li> hae used these for a few years now - excellent and immediate results the next AM - resisting any temptation to put toxins into my face.</li>
            <li> Before buying I read the reviews....should have trusted the ones that were less than good..</li>
            <li> They were not frown lines, but possibly created from side sleeping and good old gravity.  </li>
            <li> I have a scar from going through a windshield many years ago that was at one time under my chin---it has somehow crept up over the years to above my jawline----the frownies</li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s definitely cheaper :-)</li>
            <li> so frownies work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> they reduce those lines with consistent use.</li>
            <li> and if it works for you, I would wonder if it was more from &amp;#34;wishful thinking&amp;#34; than this actual product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the deep lines between the eyes for more than 10 years since I was in the mid-50.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that in the next day or two that will be gone</li>
            <li> The more you use them, and  the younger you start, the faster you will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I just ordered 3 more boxes even though I have 1 1/2 boxes left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the same results can be achieved with &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But must use consistently all night.</li>
            <li> They really work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve uses them for years and this is the first box I&#x27;ve had an issue with.</li>
            <li> because if I miss one night, the line is evident again.</li>
            <li> The most I&#x27;ve skipped was probably a week at a time which didn&#x27;t have a big impact.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s activated by water, but what exactly is in the glue?</li>
            <li> Might be ok to use just on \\&quot;11&#x27;s for temporary improvement before a big event.  </li>
            <li> The first time was an accident, forgot to blend.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than waking up with deep lines in my forehead.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, thank you!  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> but it definitely helps me look more awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, you do forget they are on which can be pretty funny.</li>
            <li> the other kind  </li>
            <li> for some reason I keep getting the other kind that dont stick as well as these ones.  </li>
            <li> A frown line can really age you, and now, I don&#x27;t have one, thanks to Frownies!</li>
            <li> They seem less effective.</li>
            <li> I usually press on patch &amp; hold for about 1 min to be sure it&#x27;s secure.</li>
            <li> I did not have very high hopes for these when I ordered.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for a temporary improvement... possibly before a party, stick them on for a few hours?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have to round off the corners, however I don&#x27;t have to be real precise in doing so.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really take care of the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> These really work -- no joke.</li>
            <li> (And the results for me have lasted the whole day)</li>
            <li> Fast forward and at 47 they ate permanent even during the day.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles between the eyes are smooth after regular use.</li>
            <li> For years these really helped.  </li>
            <li> They really do work</li>
            <li> They really work</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> A simple way to keep that area smooth for about 8 hours per night.</li>
            <li> These really work.  </li>
            <li> Just wet it, and pop it on, be sure to (gently)stretch your skin so you are not putting the Frownie over a crease.</li>
            <li> This really keeps my forehead from developing sleep lines.  </li>
            <li> If I go without them a night or two, I really see the difference in the mirror.</li>
            <li> These things really work.</li>
            <li> They work really well</li>
            <li> The paper is much thinner, they don&#x27;t stay in place and basically don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> This makes a real difference.</li>
            <li> I still have the 11, but they are much milder now than they used to be.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> They really do work.</li>
            <li> IT IS NON TOXIC AND GENTLE .</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It also is really helping me realize when I am frowning so</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Two nights into using Frownies and all I can say is, wow, these work!!!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> after a bit the original back into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one year later: Because really good items can suddenly disappear (Amazon is the ONLY place I can find Frownies)</li>
            <li> I CANNOT live without my Frownies!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I doubted very much that it would work, but it was inexpensive enough</li>
            <li> so much I can;t allow myself to live by one---I&#x27;d never come off of it.....</li>
            <li> Here, you get a 4 month supply for less than $15 and they work much better.</li>
            <li> These are definitely not a permanent solution but they work so noticeably that I will make sure to use them the night before any big event/date/etc.</li>
            <li> they just need to come up with an entire facial mask :-)</li>
            <li> Price is high for what is basically gummed kraft paper but they work.</li>
            <li> I have also cut these in half to test out smaller patches in multiple spots and although it can be done, the adhesion wasn&#x27;t quite as great this way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews</li>
            <li> i have only used like 10 days worth ....</li>
            <li> Sure, it plumps your face when you awaken in the morning; but, after a few hours the effect wears off.  </li>
            <li> The lines return right back to normal.</li>
            <li> Smooth the lines with fingers before pressing 1 moisture square patch over the area until it is complete dry (about 15 -20 seconds)</li>
            <li> I use them on the the side of my right eye, where I sleep and get deep creases.</li>
            <li> Sure it is a temporary fix of my ugly and hateful &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s better than nothing!</li>
            <li> I will try something new.  </li>
            <li> but they still pushed in new wrinkles</li>
            <li> I remember my mom using these when I was very young.  </li>
            <li> This is the first and last time I order from this company.  </li>
            <li> They work only if your are consistent.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have no more lines between the eyes any more.</li>
            <li> I have a huge wrinkle down my forehead as a result of bells palsy.</li>
            <li> When I take the little triangle off in the morning the huge wrinkle is practically gone.</li>
            <li> use just a little water and smooth on patch.</li>
            <li> Could see a big difference starting from the first use!</li>
            <li> They were old and they didn&#x27;t stick....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years- at almost 70 years old, I don&#x27;t have any forehead lines.</li>
            <li> I might be too sensitive.</li>
            <li> very night before going to bed and remove the patch next morning when you wake up.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, these might not be for you.</li>
            <li> I used these religiously for 6 straight weeks with zero results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s EXACTLY the same product just in a much bigger roll and cheaper price without the fancy name and box.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find anywhere so happy to get them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> For deep lines, it may take a few weeks before the lines smooth out.  </li>
            <li> Need something a little more extreme.</li>
            <li> My order appeared as though the box had been in the oven or someplace very hot and they were al dried up&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Unale to use them</li>
            <li> anyway after three nites of using frownies---they are actaully getting less and less prominent.  </li>
            <li> It a standard old product.</li>
            <li> Seller did make it right after a little coaxing.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these since I have used expensive creams before with no luck and for something that costs only $15 to be so effective is amazing.</li>
            <li> -they go unnoticed, unlike my silly looking tape, lol.</li>
            <li> These little things really work!</li>
            <li> Not sure how extended use of this would result in long term wrinkle prevention but the line on my forehead is significantly plumper after I remove these things over night.</li>
            <li> If you use them as directed, faithfully for the first few weeks then once or twice a week, that pesky frown line between your eyes will almost disappear.</li>
            <li> (3) the light brown papers (same color as grocery store paper bags) look a tad bit ridiculous on one&#x27;s forehead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if the creases are actually less</li>
            <li> Basically, wearing Frownies is like adding a little gluey substance to a paper bag and sticking on your wrinkles and thinking your wrinkles will magically go away!</li>
            <li> I like to use them the night prior to big events because trying to use them every night gets a little too much.</li>
            <li> Using this is so much cheaper and less freaky (needles and putting botulism in your face) than using Botox!</li>
            <li> I find when I use the adhesive papers regularly, the deep forehead line I&#x27;ve developed between my brows is much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I put on my night cream and then stick these crazy things in place over my most pronounced forehead wrinkles, and the next morning when I peel them away, the area has smoothed out and the effect seems to last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend frownies to get you started and see if they work for you, but long term going the generic route is easier on the wallet.</li>
            <li> The effects don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> They help some,  but the effects don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Some people actually use their facial muscles all night long, but when your muscles are forced to relax it really can give a look of relaxation, rejuvenation and youth.</li>
            <li> May work for others with less sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After buying a few boxes I got fed up with the price, did some research, bought &amp;#34;gummed tape&amp;#34; here on amazon and cut it up into similar shapes and put them into my old frownies box.</li>
            <li> Botox and other injections can cost hundreds-thousands of dollars and only last 2-3 month.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will ever completely go away because it was so deep</li>
            <li> Long time user of these, they work if you use them.</li>
            <li> I can apply them in seconds now after using them so long.</li>
            <li> I have reused them if I don&#x27;t get them too wet, then when the line goes away, I only use them twice a week</li>
            <li> Well I don&#x27;t know how long we should wait for results</li>
            <li> , how long?</li>
            <li> Peeling it off dry will remove all facial/brow hair underneath.</li>
            <li> I have taken the dog out and answered the door with this upside down triangle in the middle of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using medical tape to get rid of my &amp;#34;eleven&amp;#34; lines between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I do have very pale sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> To remove, I use a wet washcloth to work the edges loose.  </li>
            <li> A pain in the rear to perforate and tear apart the little squares every night to use, and sometimes they don&#x27;t adhere as well as others even though I follow the same routine each night.</li>
            <li> Thanks frownies from this crazy old redhead........</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and for some reason, I sleep with my brows furrowed and have for at least 20 years when I started to realize in the mornings I had those &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34; lines.  </li>
            <li> Wear them at least 2 weeks regularly if you have deep lines.</li>
            <li> I find that I can take a break for a few days before the lines come back.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get these to stay on, and they didn&#x27;t cover the area I expected them to cover.</li>
            <li> You have to lightly wet them, pull your skin taut, then place it on.</li>
            <li> but you can also just wet them</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on all the different products they offer.</li>
            <li> Been using them for a decade, Minimal elevens, and I am a quite the scowler.</li>
            <li> They work, but they need to be wet before removing</li>
            <li> and I certainly am not going to cut up craft paper and try and find a glue that&#x27;s comparable as others had mentioned.</li>
            <li> While continuing to stretch, tap down around the edges of the frownie until it starts to dry.</li>
            <li> But I grew up in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s where even all the silly people on T.V. shows had these pretty glowing tans....</li>
            <li> I must agree that the last 2 orders did not &#x27;stick&#x27; as well as they have in the past.</li>
            <li> Other people may like them, but I did not.</li>
            <li> I have basically no lines in those areas (as compared to other areas of my face where I do have lines).</li>
            <li> As stated by other reviewers, these will not remove wrinkles but may prevent wrinkle development or deepening.  </li>
            <li> I see a difference and so do other people.</li>
            <li> Just as expected!  </li>
            <li> I will use some of the oils  that some of the other reviewers have tried too.</li>
            <li> You can always research a product and find other ways to make or help it work.</li>
            <li> I sleep with it on and in the morning the line is very minimal.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, but I now have been using these for years as they really work to get rid of the angry frown lines between the eyes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not so fond of is the little bit of sticky residue that is left behind when they are pulled off.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years, I believe they really help my forehead crease from getting worse!</li>
            <li> Obviously, It does not prevent the frown lines from developing throughout the day, but it at least I wake up refreshed, not looking upset before I start my day.</li>
            <li> Few tips; you must stretch and hold the skin between your eyebrows horizontally with one hand while pressing on the moistened frownie with the other.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days I have eliminated all but a very small 1/2&amp;#34; line in the middle of my forehead (this one was the deepest).</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t&#x3D;&#x3D;I guess I have a slight case of \\&quot;tanorexia\\</li>
            <li> Odd sounding, counter intuitive application -</li>
            <li> Even that was so slight it is not worth the trouble for me.    </li>
            <li> These little babies are a beauty investment I&#x27;ll make forever.</li>
            <li> If you perspire even just a little, they will come off.  </li>
            <li> Smooths skin temporarily for a little while after use.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the time, money, and trouble.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a few weeks trial period</li>
            <li> People always ask me my secret and no one seems to believe that a simple product like this truly erases lines.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not a miracle but it will keep Botox away for a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a few years and wear one every night.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do something to stop them from getting worse and possibly improve them.</li>
            <li> I dont know if they would work if you already have heavy wrinkling.</li>
            <li> I use them a few times a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been so frustrating to see between my brows start to create the same lines</li>
            <li> Think Jane Bingham on Drop Dead Diva....beautiful woman, with those dang worry lines.</li>
            <li> I do not have deep wrinkles but was noticing that I was getting expression &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; and I do not want the problem to get worse.</li>
            <li> My 11 were getting pretty bad</li>
            <li> I gave them a 3 because: they used to be a 5 - now they&#x27;re no very effective -</li>
            <li> Frownies really work for breaking bad habits of knitting your brows together.</li>
            <li> They usually come off soon or by the end of the night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this&#x27;ll do what it says with time.  </li>
            <li> Tear the corners off - they can be sharp and irritating.</li>
            <li> I otherwise have hardly any wrinkles at all.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mom because she has a hard time relaxing her frown muscles even in her sleep, and it basically is like putting tape on her skin all night to avoid her from doing so.</li>
            <li> At least overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this product has been around since the late 1800s and works just like they promise.  </li>
            <li> Have used these for years and have escaped frown wrinkles because of them (and I&#x27;m late 50&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> So, these seem absolutely ridiculous, however, they do make a noticeable (but temporary) difference.</li>
            <li> poorer rating is due to difficult in using them, the other creases they make, and how painful it is to remove them.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pretty shocked that this works!!!</li>
            <li> Too tough to get off.</li>
            <li> I have/had the worst \\&quot;11&#x27;s\\&quot; in the world--too much worrying,</li>
            <li> the difference, these are my answer to being tired of botox.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as apparently you cannot return them.</li>
            <li> At the very least, they train you not to frown!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry if it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it does for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the adhesive makes me break out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Try them....not expensive</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with these.</li>
            <li> very poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> unfortunately, I look like a zombie!</li>
            <li> I had the beginning of a rather noticible one in my forties and fifties that made me look mad.</li>
            <li> Also still very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I had really bad frown lines.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see the material on this patches.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try these for years and really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice no change at all which is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> that i just hated and these have reduced it to almost nothing in just a couple nights.  </li>
            <li> Work but smell awful.</li>
            <li> I have terrible &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I stumbled on these and thought I should try them while sleeping because I always wake up with my face scrunched and the lines are worst in the morning.</li>
            <li> I frown in my sleep and was getting horrible lines there</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> they actually work!!!!  I am telling all my aging friends and will continue to use---thank you Frownies!!!  I have/had the worst \\&quot;11&#x27;s\\&quot; in the world--too much worrying, sun and stressful work are what I blame....anyway after three nites of using frownies---they are actaully getting less and less prominent.  I hope this keeps getting better and better all the time.  I have a scar from going through a windshield many years ago that was at one time under my chin---it has somehow crept up over the years to above my jawline----the frownies are working making that lessen as well.  Pretty soon I&#x27;ll be sticking them all over my face--as I age and continue my love for sun every summer....despite being a redhead--I do tan---but I know I shouldn&#x27;t&#x3D;&#x3D;I guess I have a slight case of \\&quot;tanorexia\\&quot; I don&#x27;t go to tanning beds (stopped that about 10 years ago)  But I grew up in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s where even all the silly people on T.V. shows had these pretty glowing tans....and i trained my redheaded skin to tan by lifeguarding--being a state champ. swimmer for years and loving the beach....love the beach!  so much I can;t allow myself to live by one---I&#x27;d never come off of it.....rambler---sorry!&lt;br /&gt;Anway Frownines do work!!!  Thanks frownies from this crazy old redhead........</li>
            <li> Really works!  I find that I can take a break for a few days before the lines come back. I like to think they are also preventing the formation of deeper lines!</li>
            <li> These stay on amazingly well...I think the rose water activator works better than water.</li>
            <li> Love these things!  I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use them overnight.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with the results, i will definitely buy again !! A bit pricey, but compared to botox - it&#x27;s definitely cheaper :-)</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay on, therefore they don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have a huge wrinkle down my forehead as a result of bells palsy. When I first saw this product I doubted very much that it would work, but it was inexpensive enough so I gave it a try. It works for me. When I take the little triangle off in the morning the huge wrinkle is practically gone. I am so happy. I&#x27;m sorry if it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it does for me.</li>
            <li> Since Botox for some reason didn&#x27;t work for me I rely on my Frownies and wear them as much as possible. Sure it is a temporary fix of my ugly and hateful &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s better than nothing! I just wish that they would invent a Frownie that you can wear without detection underneath your makeup, wouldn&#x27;t that be awesome! Anyway, Frownies WORK and I never  leave home without them!</li>
            <li> I have used these for years, I believe they really help my forehead crease from getting worse! They are natural and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like them because they leave kind of a shield across my forehead. I wish I could wear them all day! unfortunately, I look like a zombie! Need something a little more extreme. Didn&#x27;t really take care of the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Inexpensive and better than other products I have tried. Easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pretty shocked that this works!!! Not sure how extended use of this would result in long term wrinkle prevention but the line on my forehead is significantly plumper after I remove these things over night. The thing is that if you use them every night, then you can&#x27;t put on anti-agin cream or moisturizer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s great for a temporary improvement... possibly before a party, stick them on for a few hours?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if masking tape would work over night (I might try it).</li>
            <li> Work but smell awful. It&#x27;s like having a can of dog food stuck to your forehead.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve notice no change at all which is very disappointing. I was hoping not to have to resort to more severe measures.</li>
            <li> This is the first and last time I order from this company.  I now go to Drugstore.com.  They were old and they didn&#x27;t stick....very poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Frownies for years and never had a problem until I ordered from this company.</li>
            <li> These actually work. I love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> They have made a big difference in my frown lines!</li>
            <li> Have used these for years and would never go without them. So glad they are now available on Amazon as always purchased them on a different website.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a couple of years now and although they don&#x27;t erase wrinkles they help with prevention. I wear them at night so I don&#x27;t frown while I sleep. When I don&#x27;t wear them the frown lines seem more noticeable in the morning.</li>
            <li> Always does a good job.</li>
            <li> Temporary fix, but they do seem to work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn these for decades. I must agree that the last 2 orders did not &#x27;stick&#x27; as well as they have in the past. They usually come off soon or by the end of the night. Too bad. They seem less effective. Nothing in the way I put them on has changed. I still wash my face, so there&#x27;s no lotion, before I put them on.  I gave them a 3 because: they used to be a 5 - now they&#x27;re no very effective - but there&#x27;s nothing else on the market.</li>
            <li> I am sure this type works better  than  the other kind  I have been buying...for some reason I keep getting the other kind that dont stick as well as these ones.  I need to get this brand again!</li>
            <li> I am 31 and have been using the for my frown line between the eyes. I sleep with it on and in the morning the line is very minimal. If I don&#x27;t wear it my frown line is much more noticeable. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These work great, just as others wrote.  If you&#x27;re not going out and no one is visiting, leave on all day. At least overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I use just a little water and smooth on patch. Be sure not to use too much liquid or patch will not hold and will be ruined. These are precious so do not waste. Follow enclosed directions and rub area for about 10 - 15 seconds then apply. I usually press on patch &amp; hold for about 1 min to be sure it&#x27;s secure. They truly work!</li>
            <li> Great Product!!! Never stop making  FROWNIES it really works!!</li>
            <li> These really work -- no joke.</li>
            <li> Used to order from another high-priced company.  The product is great -- I&#x27;ve used it for years!  And the price was great.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e used these for years and they work great.  The more often you use them the better the results</li>
            <li> Started using these 2 days ago along with a 25% Vitamin C serum. I did not have very high hopes for these when I ordered. In just two days they have made a HUGE change in the wrinkles on my forehead. (And the results for me have lasted the whole day) I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but these are the most amazing product.</li>
            <li> Would Scotch tape work as well?  Does seem to diminish frown wrinkles during the night</li>
            <li> I would have &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines permanently between my eyebrows if it wasn&#x27;t for this product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and for some reason, I sleep with my brows furrowed and have for at least 20 years when I started to realize in the mornings I had those &amp;#34;angry&amp;#34; lines.  Fast forward and at 47 they ate permanent even during the day.  I otherwise have hardly any wrinkles at all.  I even resorted to ask my dermatologist about botox, but he scared me when he said it would cause eyebrows to raise if I got in that area.  Anyway, saw these years ago, but never bought until a month ago and MIRACOUSLY I wake up completely smooth in that area now!  I am scared to death these will disappear from AMazon so plan to buy bulk!</li>
            <li> Every night they work</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get them to stick.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, but I now have been using these for years as they really work to get rid of the angry frown lines between the eyes. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> this product has been around since the late 1800s and works just like they promise.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&#x27;s much safe than Botox.</li>
            <li> I have used them and yes they work at relaxing your worry wrinkle as i have on forehead between eyes but after you do the worry look over the day it comes back but I have to use i think one full box to train that area to relax ----which i have only used like 10 days worth ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teacher and I move my face a lot AND I can&#x27;t afford botox, so frownies work pretty well for me. After buying a few boxes I got fed up with the price, did some research, bought &amp;#34;gummed tape&amp;#34; here on amazon and cut it up into similar shapes and put them into my old frownies box. It&#x27;s EXACTLY the same product just in a much bigger roll and cheaper price without the fancy name and box. I&#x27;d recommend frownies to get you started and see if they work for you, but long term going the generic route is easier on the wallet. The &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; behind frownies helps me do the best I can at keeping the wrinkles at bay and whatever is left I just use a good primer and foundation.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see the material on this patches.  Paper with a sticky side, I thought they would be of a better quality.  The effects don&#x27;t last long.  I remember I used another brand from a pharmacy, I don&#x27;t recall the name but they worked way better and were better quality than Frownies.  Disappointed, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Great price. I&#x27;ve used these for years. *They work*</li>
            <li> Love these..they work great for the frown lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this&#x27;ll do what it says with time.  Unfortunately, the adhesive makes me break out.  I do have very pale sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Long time user of these, they work if you use them. Will be buying again</li>
            <li> Frownies really work for breaking bad habits of knitting your brows together. It does make a difference in the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years- at almost 70 years old, I don&#x27;t have any forehead lines.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The wrinkles between the eyes are smooth after regular use.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the time, money, and trouble.  Your better options would be exercise, diet, and a good cream solution.  These patches, are basically brown packaging tape.  Sure, it plumps your face when you awaken in the morning; but, after a few hours the effect wears off.  Also, can give you breakouts.</li>
            <li> These work great for me. My lines aren&#x27;t that deep yet. Few tips; you must stretch and hold the skin between your eyebrows horizontally with one hand while pressing on the moistened frownie with the other. While continuing to stretch, tap down around the edges of the frownie until it starts to dry. Now you can let go from stretching your skin.  You don&#x27;t want to soak the frownie with water, but do get enough water on it so it gets good and tacky. This is the only part that takes trial and error. To remove, I use a wet washcloth to work the edges loose.  To get more bang for your buck, apply moisturizer to the area 15 minutes before applying the frownie. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work and don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> It a standard old product. Its been around forever..it was the 1920&#x27;s version of botox! If you dont have the money or inclination to&lt;br /&gt;use botox...buy frownies. they reduce those lines with consistent use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 7 years! I had very deep frown lines before I discovered this miracle product. I was contemplating between this and Botox and tried this instead.I gave it a few weeks trial period and I got hooked. People always ask me my secret and no one seems to believe that a simple product like this truly erases lines. I CANNOT live without my Frownies!</li>
            <li> I think these are great. The frownie&#x27;s force me to stop making the face that caused the two wrinkles I have. My &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; has changed to a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and I can&#x27;t wait for that to disappear too.</li>
            <li> Botox on a budget works fabulously</li>
            <li> Have been using these for decades!  I had really bad frown lines.  For years these really helped.  But the frown lines were so persistent that I decided to start getting Botox -- and have been doing so for several years.  But I continue to use the Frownies every night!  I think it helps the Botox to last longer -- just my opinion, but everything you can do to make those muscles quit working and just atrophy from lack of use has got to be helpful.  I am so used to putting on the Frownie at night that it has become part of my lights out routine and I just feel something is amiss if I don&#x27;t have one on.  They really do work and I will continue to use them, along with the Botox.</li>
            <li> Been using for about 2 weeks, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. A pain in the rear to perforate and tear apart the little squares every night to use, and sometimes they don&#x27;t adhere as well as others even though I follow the same routine each night. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> works so good. I can&#x27;t go to bed without wearing them. I love them......</li>
            <li> Love these. Swear by them!</li>
            <li> Have used Frownies for years and will continue to do so forever, if necessary.  They help control my expression lines.</li>
            <li> Having used Frownies for some time, I appreciate their simplicity and effectiveness in frown line reduction and prevention.  Running out is not an option!</li>
            <li> The Frownies seem to help me relax the muscles between eyes.  I don&#x27;t really know if the creases are actually less then they would be without the Frownies but I feel more relaxed when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I did not like the way the strips stuck to my face. Too tough to get off. I might be too sensitive. May work for others with less sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They work only if your are consistent.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get these to stay on, and they didn&#x27;t cover the area I expected them to cover. Other people may like them, but I did not.</li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em .  Easy to use and they work!!!</li>
            <li> Frownies are amazing for a quick fix!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and they work like a charm. The key is knowing how to apply them and using them every night. I can apply them in seconds now after using them so long.</li>
            <li> Got these for my sister.  She is 50.  She swears by them.  I can honestly say I have seen the effect on her with no prompting to &amp;#34;look at my face&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Easy, inexpensive and noninvasive way to avoid lines on your face from sleeping. I use them on the the side of my right eye, where I sleep and get deep creases.</li>
            <li> A great find. They really work</li>
            <li> I started using Frownies about 9 months ago. I find when I use the adhesive papers regularly, the deep forehead line I&#x27;ve developed between my brows is much less noticeable. I use witch hazel to dampen the glue on the back of the paper, which works well. Then I let the paper steam off in the shower the next morning. So from my perspective, there are two things to know about this product: (1) Frownies work if you use them regularly, but (2) the improvements they engender will disappear if you miss several nights in a row. So don&#x27;t expect any permanent results (nor does the packaging promise them). I guess there is also a third thing to know: (3) the light brown papers (same color as grocery store paper bags) look a tad bit ridiculous on one&#x27;s forehead. But if you can tolerate that limitation, this is a relatively inexpensive way to lessen forehead frown lines.</li>
            <li> At the very least, they train you not to frown! I wear them around the house</li>
            <li> They help some,  but the effects don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery. Product as described. Good job!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a number of times. Believe they relax those  muscles and improved the frown lines on my forehead. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all for me. I have one crease between my brown line (not the 11&#x27;s like most people) that has bothered me for some time. I was excited to try this product because it was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I bought the rose water spray that was recommended to go with it- even though it was a bit pricey, because I wanted to make sure I did exactly what was needed to get the best result. I tried for several weeks. Basically, wearing Frownies is like adding a little gluey substance to a paper bag and sticking on your wrinkles and thinking your wrinkles will magically go away! It did not work (oh how I &amp;#34;wished&amp;#34; it did) and if it works for you, I would wonder if it was more from &amp;#34;wishful thinking&amp;#34; than this actual product. My advice- save your money and massage your wrinkles with some Vitamin E capsules or Retinol, or bite the bullet and get Botox!</li>
            <li> A simple way to keep that area smooth for about 8 hours per night. Of course it&#x27;s not a miracle but it will keep Botox away for a few years.</li>
            <li> These really work.  I&#x27;ve been using them for a few years and wear one every night.</li>
            <li> These are definitely not a permanent solution but they work so noticeably that I will make sure to use them the night before any big event/date/etc. I have terrible &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; wrinkle lines and they virtually disappear after using these. Even though it&#x27;s a temporary effect, I believe they are a very good find that I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for signs of aging, noticeable difference!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the deep lines between the eyes for more than 10 years since I was in the mid-50. I have no lines at all in that area now.  Smooth the lines with fingers before pressing 1 moisture square patch over the area until it is complete dry (about 15 -20 seconds) very night before going to bed and remove the patch next morning when you wake up. You&#x27;ll have no more lines between the eyes any more. For deep lines, it may take a few weeks before the lines smooth out.  Just be patient, it works.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom; she has used these for some time. She thinks they help most with the lines between eyebrows. For that, she thinks they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and started getting fine lines on my forehead and was bothered by them. I wanted to do something to stop them from getting worse and possibly improve them. These worked perfectly. Within 3 days I have eliminated all but a very small 1/2&amp;#34; line in the middle of my forehead (this one was the deepest). I&#x27;m confident that in the next day or two that will be gone and I will be free of fine lines.  I was skeptical about these since I have used expensive creams before with no luck and for something that costs only $15 to be so effective is amazing.</li>
            <li> Easy, inexpensive way to minimize frown lines.</li>
            <li> Not only does this work, but also helps curb bedtime headaches.</li>
            <li> I use them every night between my eyes and definitely see a difference.  I do have to round off the corners, however I don&#x27;t have to be real precise in doing so.  Good product</li>
            <li> It may be helpful to prevent further or deeper lines. But don&#x27;t expect it will fix your frown lines.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t stay in place.  My order appeared as though the box had been in the oven or someplace very hot and they were al dried up&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Unale to use them</li>
            <li> Always works. Tried other brands and this one is still the best. It&#x27;s really not a bad price and I certainly am not going to cut up craft paper and try and find a glue that&#x27;s comparable as others had mentioned. This is STILL the best out there on the market</li>
            <li> I have used them on and off for years. Impossible to find anywhere so happy to get them through Amazon. If you use them as directed, faithfully for the first few weeks then once or twice a week, that pesky frown line between your eyes will almost disappear. It will depend on skin type, and how deep the line is, and how you sleep, of course. I sleep on my side so I should wear one to bed every night, but I don&#x27;t. I had the beginning of a rather noticible one in my forties and fifties that made me look mad. I tried collagen and later fat injections but they actually did not work for me. With Frownies you must be diligent and patient to see results. Just wet it, and pop it on, be sure to (gently)stretch your skin so you are not putting the Frownie over a crease.The more you use them, and  the younger you start, the faster you will notice a difference. After a while, you should be able to skip a few days and be ok. They are so easy to use and once on, you don&#x27;t know they are there. I actually have forgetten to take mine off and worn them all day or until I go out and look in the mirror.  Don&#x27;t know if it works for everyone, but for me, this product really does work great. I&#x27;d given up after collagen and fat injection. Just by chance, I read about them in a short magazine article about actresses&#x27; beauty trips while I was in a doctor&#x27;s office. Rene Russo said she used them and loved them. That was about 12 years ago  and I was in my mid-fifties. A frown line can really age you, and now, I don&#x27;t have one, thanks to Frownies! I bought 3 boxes from Amazon just in case they disappear forever...... They are also economical. I have reused them if I don&#x27;t get them too wet, then when the line goes away, I only use them twice a week so a box easily lasts a year. I didn&#x27;t use them at all for a couple ofyears because I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores. The line gradually started coming back so I was glad I checked out Amazon, and there they were..... Whew.    one year later: Because really good items can suddenly disappear (Amazon is the ONLY place I can find Frownies) I just ordered 3 more boxes even though I have 1 1/2 boxes left. I do not dare ever taking the chance of running out of these gems. If applied correctly, nothing works better. Remember to stretch the area between your eyes to smooth out the crease BEFORE you apply the frownie. When I take it off, it&#x27;s like magic. Wear them at least 2 weeks regularly if you have deep lines. After your muscles adjust, you can skip a night or two. Botox and other injections can cost hundreds-thousands of dollars and only last 2-3 month. Here, you get a 4 month supply for less than $15 and they work much better. Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> I have used Frownies for years and they are the answer to an affordable way to stay looking younger.</li>
            <li> not too pretty if you are on a special date, but they DO keep the creases away.  especially if you use botox, these are a must to make it last longer.  love.</li>
            <li> only used once too soon to tell</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mom because she has a hard time relaxing her frown muscles even in her sleep, and it basically is like putting tape on her skin all night to avoid her from doing so. It will obviously temporarily &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; your lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to wear them with nothing on your face, otherwise they won&#x27;t stick well. Try stretching your skin with both hands as much as possible in the opposite direction of the wrinkle while you get someone else to stick them on.</li>
            <li> My second box of Frownies!! They are great, I&#x27;ve used other brands but Frownies work the best.</li>
            <li> Used for many years. Still good.</li>
            <li> This really keeps my forehead from developing sleep lines.  I lie on my side, and shift side to side.  Without Frownies, sleep lines are created and then deepened night after night.</li>
            <li> Not the &amp;#34;sexiest&amp;#34; thing to wear to bed, lol but after 2 weeks of use i am def noticing a reduction in my rather prominent forehead lines.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using medical tape to get rid of my &amp;#34;eleven&amp;#34; lines between my eyebrows. These frownies are awesome. Simple. And they work. I could not&lt;br /&gt;Believe the difference, these are my answer to being tired of botox. They are flesh colored so i put them on and kinda sweep my hair over them if i am summoned by kids for a last&lt;br /&gt;Minute bedtime issue-they go unnoticed, unlike my silly looking tape, lol. and i am hooked.  What a great discovery.  I wish i had found these years ago!!!!  Please never stop making these!</li>
            <li> Have used these for years and have escaped frown wrinkles because of them (and I&#x27;m late 50&#x27;s). Even my daughters asked me what I use to keep away the lines--I gave them these to try.  If I go without them a night or two, I really see the difference in the mirror. I make sure I never run out of these. They WORK.</li>
            <li> To be fair, this product does at promised. I have a prominent crease between my eyes despite being fairly young. While it doesn&#x27;t fix the crease all day to start, it lasts longer and longer the more consistently you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My poorer rating is due to difficult in using them, the other creases they make, and how painful it is to remove them. You have to lightly wet them, pull your skin taut, then place it on. This would be fine but you have to hold your skin taut until the glue dries and that can take a while. If you don&#x27;t, then your skin will crease under it. It&#x27;ll help it from getting more but not improve the crease. Depending on how you sleep, lines are created around the stickers and if you don&#x27;t hold a warm cloth on them for a good while in the morning, they hurt to remove.</li>
            <li> I have furrowed brows, or worry lines, (two lines between my brows). If I wear these over night the next day they are somewhat diminished. As soon as I furrow my brow again, the lines are back.</li>
            <li> So, these seem absolutely ridiculous, however, they do make a noticeable (but temporary) difference. I put on my night cream and then stick these crazy things in place over my most pronounced forehead wrinkles, and the next morning when I peel them away, the area has smoothed out and the effect seems to last all day. I like to use them the night prior to big events because trying to use them every night gets a little too much.</li>
            <li> I am 49 and have used these on my forehead and above brows for almost 20 years. They have worked great for me. I have basically no lines in those areas (as compared to other areas of my face where I do have lines). But better to start young. I dont know if they would work if you already have heavy wrinkling.</li>
            <li> As stated by other reviewers, these will not remove wrinkles but may prevent wrinkle development or deepening.  I have parallel creases between my brows.  These prevent me from frowning while I sleep.  I&#x27;m sure the same results can be achieved with &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; tape.  So you&#x27;re paying for pre-cut convenience.  They were also very easy to remove IF directions are followed, i.e. thoroughly soak the patch.  It&#x27;ll fall off easily.  Peeling it off dry will remove all facial/brow hair underneath.</li>
            <li> Well I don&#x27;t know how long we should wait for results but, I put it on at night all night.  I wake up and take it off and my 11s r gone awesome, but only for 2 minutes then they return again not too happy about that.  I will continue using it till I finish the box, then if no change I will try something new.  I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I can definitely see the results after a night of wearing these, although sometimes they irritate my skin after.  I use them a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Help!  But must use consistently all night.</li>
            <li> I have the genetic brow knitting thing....my mom, at 55, looks worried all the time. It&#x27;s been so frustrating to see between my brows start to create the same lines and I am 33. Think Jane Bingham on Drop Dead Diva....beautiful woman, with those dang worry lines. I stumbled on these and thought I should try them while sleeping because I always wake up with my face scrunched and the lines are worst in the morning. Two nights into using Frownies and all I can say is, wow, these work!!! I am excited to hopefully avoid the \\&quot;worry-brow\\&quot;!! Try them....not expensive and I betcha you love em.</li>
            <li> These little things really work! You do have to wear them every night, but amazingly enough they do take care of the wrinkles between your eyebrows. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does!&lt;br /&gt;Now they just need to come up with an entire facial mask :-) lol.</li>
            <li> can not sleep without it. it keeps the frown line away.</li>
            <li> They did not stay on.</li>
            <li> My wife loves them. Makes her look 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> These things really work. I see a difference and so do other people.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Been using for years, and feel &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; without them :). Use them every night. They really work!</li>
            <li> It is easy to attach a patch.&lt;br /&gt;I was mostly before falling asleep.&lt;br /&gt;Would wake seem to have worked.&lt;br /&gt;But after a bit the original back into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to need to use more eggs.&lt;br /&gt;but, how long?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn these for years. They work really well but you need to wear them regularly. Some people cannot stand having them on during the night but I guess I&#x27;m used to it. If you have sensitive skin, these might not be for you. They are basically brown craft paper with glue on them. I just peel them off in the morning but you can also just wet them and they fall off. Tear the corners off - they can be sharp and irritating. Certainly cheaper than Botox or fillers!</li>
            <li> I used these religiously for 6 straight weeks with zero results. I am 35 have light &amp;#34;11 lines&amp;#34; between my eyes. I thought these would help. They work for an hour or 2 after you peel them off but throughout the day. The lines return right back to normal. A lot of work with no results. On to Botox.</li>
            <li> I have used Frownies in the past and they work wonderfully...these however, do not seem the same.  The paper is much thinner, they don&#x27;t stay in place and basically don&#x27;t work.  Very disappointed as apparently you cannot return them.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is a safe, easy and not taking the cosmetic surgery approach to reducing wrinkles.  If used on a regular basis you will see results, by relaxing the facial muscles while you sleep.  What a concept.  Some people actually use their facial muscles all night long, but when your muscles are forced to relax it really can give a look of relaxation, rejuvenation and youth.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get some botox.</li>
            <li> hae used these for a few years now - excellent and immediate results the next AM - resisting any temptation to put toxins into my face.</li>
            <li> This makes a real difference. I have a line between my brows that was getting deeper and deeper, but using this has arrested the deepening and smoothed out the line significantly. Using this is so much cheaper and less freaky (needles and putting botulism in your face) than using Botox!</li>
            <li> No botox with these frownies!  I use these every night just for the between the eyebrows frown wrinkles--they make a huge difference.  I frown in my sleep and was getting horrible lines there that i just hated and these have reduced it to almost nothing in just a couple nights.  Results are not permanent, you have to keep using them to keep the results.  I am on my second box of frownies and I will continue to use them indefinitely and tell others about them.  Easy to put on and remove.</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with these. They didn&#x27;t stick properly. I&#x27;ve uses them for years and this is the first box I&#x27;ve had an issue with.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I had a deep frown line between my eyes. This product reverted it. I do have to keep using it though because if I miss one night, the line is evident again. Not sure if it will ever completely go away because it was so deep but I don&#x27;t mind regularly using these as part of my nightly routine.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite product for between the eyes.  If you sleep with it, you notice an improvement the next day.</li>
            <li> Shame on me..Before buying I read the reviews....should have trusted the ones that were less than good..&lt;br /&gt;they simply don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;i would return if i could.</li>
            <li> Perfect if you are a squinter or sleep on your side.  Removes those scowl lines.  Just don&#x27;t put face cream on prior or they won&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> Love it. I frown during my sleep, and the Frownies helped me &amp;#34;learn&amp;#34; to keep my 11s relaxed, even when I skip using them. My 11 were getting pretty bad (I was 28 when I started using them, and I am 30 1/2 now), and I see the difference in the pictures after I started using them. I still have the 11, but they are much milder now than they used to be. But I do diligently use them nightly. The most I&#x27;ve skipped was probably a week at a time which didn&#x27;t have a big impact.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much but it keeps me from frowning in my sleep, which leads to deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love these Frownies!  I use them every night.  Combined with a regimen of tretinoin and massage/manipulation, I have managed to virtually remove the 11&#x27;s that were becoming increasingly deeper on my forehead.  They were not frown lines, but possibly created from side sleeping and good old gravity.  The Frownies keep everything in place and have made a noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on all the different products they offer.They are all the same!</li>
            <li> Helps to keep scowl lines in check</li>
            <li> I like what Frownies does but there is no information on the package about what glue is used. I know it&#x27;s activated by water, but what exactly is in the glue? Since I wear it for 8 hours, it would be helpful to know. I&#x27;m over 60 and the smell reminds me of the packaging tape that my mom used to use to send packages. It may be the same glue. The package tape had to be activated with water as well.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try these for years and really disappointed.  I followed instructions diligently but they still pushed in new wrinkles &amp; I don&#x27;t want any more!  Maybe they would work for younger skin on \\&quot;elevens\\&quot; etc.  I am 67 with skin better than most my age.  Might be ok to use just on \\&quot;11&#x27;s for temporary improvement before a big event.  Even that was so slight it is not worth the trouble for me.    Seller did make it right after a little coaxing.  Their shipment time was super fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and was starting to look 47. These little babies are a beauty investment I&#x27;ll make forever.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give these another try to see if they had been improved.  The answer is no.  If you perspire even just a little, they will come off.  Also still very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> They work. Been using them for a decade, Minimal elevens, and I am a quite the scowler. Odd sounding, counter intuitive application - I apply fingertip amount of pomegranate oil directly to the area beforehand, sticks better, adds hydration. Bizarre I know. The first time was an accident, forgot to blend. Serendipity.</li>
            <li> Love these! Could see a big difference starting from the first use! Easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> you will lost your money for nothing&lt;br /&gt;better use of some paper type&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using now and it free and better</li>
            <li> Just as expected!  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love these. They really do work. The only thing I am not so fond of is the little bit of sticky residue that is left behind when they are pulled off. They do work, my forehead seems more relaxed in the morning. I would suggest testing out different application spots. I found that mine worked the best when slightly angled on the forehead. I have also cut these in half to test out smaller patches in multiple spots and although it can be done, the adhesion wasn&#x27;t quite as great this way. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Frownies have worked for me for years; though they aren&#x27;t glamorous to wear.  It&#x27;s better than waking up with deep lines in my forehead. They stay put, unlike similar products.</li>
            <li> They work, but they need to be wet before removing</li>
            <li> Every morning I&#x27;d wake up with frown lines inbetween my eyes. Frownies has definitely made a difference. Obviously, It does not prevent the frown lines from developing throughout the day, but it at least I wake up refreshed, not looking upset before I start my day. I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother- they just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL FOR ME . I LIKE THAT IT IS NON TOXIC AND GENTLE . MUST ADMIT THAT SOMETIME STHE EDGES COME OF BUT YOU WORK WITH AND REAPPLY AND ITS OKAY BUT IT ACTUALLY IRONS OUT THE WRINKLE</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works just as described and it not Botox so ther eis no danger of poisoning yourself. This was delivered on time and packaged quite well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, thank you!  I&#x27;ve used Frownies for years and wouldn&#x27;t be without them!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I know it only a temporary fix but it definitely helps me look more awake and refreshed. It also is really helping me realize when I am frowning so I can change that behavior. I do not have deep wrinkles but was noticing that I was getting expression &amp;#34;elevens&amp;#34; and I do not want the problem to get worse. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a temporary fix and want to &amp;#34;retrain&amp;#34; your facial muscles not to frown.</li>
            <li> Best ever!  Delivered quickly.  One of my staples in my makeup kit!!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Having been using nightly for about 2 weeks. Smooths skin temporarily for a little while after use. Wish effects were longer.</li>
            <li> They are great if you sleep on your face and wake up with a frown line. I don&#x27;t want to be without them. Price is high for what is basically gummed kraft paper but they work.</li>
            <li> I use Frownies as a temporary fix if I am going somewhere special.  I do believe they smooth out the lines between my eyes if used every night.  The lines do come back when not used.  I remember my mom using these when I was very young.  I am now 63.</li>
            <li> I dont love them yet. They do smooth out the 11 area quite a bit but I guess I was expecting a miracle. I will continue to use tho. Like another reviewer said, you do forget they are on which can be pretty funny. I have taken the dog out and answered the door with this upside down triangle in the middle of my eyes. Gosh, what we women do sometimes. I will use some of the oils  that some of the other reviewers have tried too. Thats whats good about Amazon. You can always research a product and find other ways to make or help it work. I will probably use these until I try botox.</li>
