            <li>Good, good stuff!</li>
            <li>Bought 4 bottles and will buy more from this awesome seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell, produces great lather and rinses nicely.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>The odor is pleasant to begin with, and not too strong, or too long-lasting.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light, almost not there.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of mint and rosemary and was looking forward to trying this shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li>The smell of most shampoos puts me off.</li>
            <li>Have ordered/used many bottles of this body wash...</li>
            <li>Love it will order again.</li>
            <li>Refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you the most bang for your buck... wish it was thicker.</li>
            <li>good product, smells fresh</li>
            <li>However, it is still a great deal, uses natural ingredients and is minty.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also like Breathe Easy, if Booth still makes it.</li>
            <li>Product smells strong but lathers well.</li>
            <li>Average foaming cleanser at best.</li>
            <li>Nice crisp, clean smell.</li>
            <li>Overall, product is really nice, but I feel the smell sometimes is too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other C. Booth products and have been very happy with everything so far, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay if you have normal hair, it is a bit smelly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh man, what can I say about this Booth Triple Action Rosemary Bath Shower Gel, it is soooooooooooooooooo refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Have used this product previously and it is a nice refreshing body soap, especially for summer, but I do used it during the rest of the year as well.</li>
            <li>cleans my hair nicely, I haven&#x27;t used a conditioner and it has left my hair soft.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, not overwhelming and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something super minty, and this is a bit more mild than I was expected, especially after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried using this as a shampoo, but as a bath gel, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Mild rosemary and mint scent and gentle cleansing for my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This has very little fragrance, so if you are sensitive to smells and just wanted something natural, this might be more for you.</li>
            <li>Leaves you soft clean and slightly tingling.  </li>
            <li>Easy everyday minty fragrant wake me up!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, and this scent is hard to find at my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>In General!</li>
            <li>Gives me a clean spa feeling, if you know what I mean.  </li>

            <li> My delicate sniffer is offended not only by how they smell in the shower, but how they stick with you for hours.</li>
            <li> works well with hard well water.</li>
            <li> I wanted this because it is hard to find the shampoo or shower gel with rosemary.</li>
            <li> to me it has worse ingredient than parabens , they are methylchloroisothiazolinone  and  methylisothiazolinone...</li>
            <li> Disappointing product.</li>
            <li> This was the worst smelling shampoo I have ever used.</li>

            <li> Disappointing product. The scent is very light, almost not there. It smells like neither mint nor rosemary. Average foaming cleanser at best.</li>
            <li> Oh man, what can I say about this Booth Triple Action Rosemary Bath Shower Gel, it is soooooooooooooooooo refreshing.  And invigorates your body, scalp, hair, skin. Leaves you soft clean and slightly tingling.  Love it!  Bought 4 bottles and will buy more from this awesome seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT DEAL! thank you seller and Amazon  for listing these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other C. Booth products and have been very happy with everything so far, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I haven&#x27;t tried using this as a shampoo, but as a bath gel, it works very well. I have found the rosemary and mint to have a calming effect on my dry, itching skin. The fragrance is nice, not overwhelming and dissipates quickly. I will definitely be ordering more through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was the worst smelling shampoo I have ever used. I could no finish washing my hair once without going to a different shampoo.</li>
            <li> Easy everyday minty fragrant wake me up!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was packaged well. Product smells strong but lathers well. Overall, product is really nice, but I feel the smell sometimes is too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you have normal hair, it is a bit smelly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very herbal!!</li>
            <li> Mild rosemary and mint scent and gentle cleansing for my very dry skin.  Love it.  Will order again and again!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of mint and rosemary and was looking forward to trying this shampoo and body wash. This has very little fragrance, so if you are sensitive to smells and just wanted something natural, this might be more for you.</li>
            <li> This product cause me to breakout on my face. Using this product as a cleanser was the only change in my skincare and by the second use I had huge painful acne along the bottom half of my face.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this for my husband, but after I smelled it decided to keep it.  Nice crisp, clean smell. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Have used this product previously and it is a nice refreshing body soap, especially for summer, but I do used it during the rest of the year as well.</li>
            <li> works well with hard well water. cleans my hair nicely, I haven&#x27;t used a conditioner and it has left my hair soft. I also like the fragrance, I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the fragrance, I thought the mint would over power the Rosemary but it doesn&#x27;t. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The smell of most shampoos puts me off. My delicate sniffer is offended not only by how they smell in the shower, but how they stick with you for hours. Enter C. Booth Rosemary and Mint. The odor is pleasant to begin with, and not too strong, or too long-lasting. You can take it as a compliment to the product that when I could no longer get the product locally, I searched the product out on the internet and go to the trouble of buying it online.</li>
            <li> Have ordered/used many bottles of this body wash...LOVE the smell, produces great lather and rinses nicely.  Good, good stuff!</li>
            <li> I had no idea this could be used as shampoo as well which is a plus!  I was looking for something super minty, and this is a bit more mild than I was expected, especially after reading the reviews.  However, it is still a great deal, uses natural ingredients and is minty.</li>
            <li> I wanted this because it is hard to find the shampoo or shower gel with rosemary. You get it all with this. Love it will order again.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, and this scent is hard to find at my local pharmacy. Great for sensitive skin. No parabens are in this product.</li>
            <li> Refreshing.  Gives me a clean spa feeling, if you know what I mean.  I also like Breathe Easy, if Booth still makes it.</li>
            <li> In General! Oily hair doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> formula changed ?to me it has worse ingredient than parabens , they are methylchloroisothiazolinone  and  methylisothiazolinone...if you google them you will find out that they can be harmful to your health.  I wont buy this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you the most bang for your buck... wish it was thicker.</li>
            <li> good product, smells fresh</li>
