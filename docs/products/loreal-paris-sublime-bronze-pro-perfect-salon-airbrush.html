            <li>LOL).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard and read great things about this product</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li>The color was very nice and brown, however, you can&#x27;t tell where you&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li>I love this product - perfect way to look like you have been at the beach for a week.</li>
            <li>and I love this one the best.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but I don&#x27;t know any tanners that smell good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Applying this product is very easy, you just hold it about 12in from the desired area and spray; the can will spray evenly upside-down and sideways too!</li>
            <li>But you need to give it a good spray.</li>
            <li>But you need to give it a good spray.</li>
            <li>But you need to give it a good spray.</li>
            <li>Good luck with your purchase.</li>
            <li>However this product has gotten a lot of good results this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Lightly sprayed face and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li>but thats all good.</li>
            <li>price is good thought.</li>
            <li>A couple hours after I applied this it looked good.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Neutrogena product and loved it.</li>
            <li>good luck.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, nice color -</li>
            <li>Since you can&#x27;t see it you will wonder \\&quot;well did I get that spot good enough?\\&quot; and you will hit that spot again.</li>
            <li>Definatly a good product.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent and looks likes a real, straight from the beach tan!</li>
            <li>When I need a quick tan on my legs, this is the best way to get it.  </li>
            <li>*more like burn* and have never had really great results from doing the lotion tanners.</li>
            <li>am fair skinned &amp; use tanning beds everyother day, but need more help from spray tans to reach a good tan color.</li>
            <li>Best part is that you can&#x27;t feel it or smell it very much at all.</li>
            <li>I love the color and smell!</li>
            <li>Make sure you use lotion before to prevent streaking and continue to use lotion to prolong your tan!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Almost as funny as the excellent reviews this product got on a compare website.  </li>
            <li>Will be getting through subscribe and save for sure!</li>
            <li>I would deffinitly reccomend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Another til, spray tans at a salon cost me 15$, so 10$ on L&#x27;oreal sunless tan is much better for me!</li>
            <li>I love the way tan skin looks!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>My husband has a lovely none orange tan going after one application!  </li>
            <li>Will continue to buy it through Amazon as the price is better!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned (not porcelain but definitely light) and this is one of the better self-tanner products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Smooth, no splotches I was happy.</li>
            <li>It evened out and the color was nice.</li>
            <li>I think the color goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have finally found one that works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of musty smelling, not citrusy like the bottle</li>
            <li>This Loreal smell does stay with her all day, and honestly I can also smell it (</li>
            <li>but I am nice and say nothing).</li>
            <li>I do not understand  how this stuff has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>and I felt confident this was a good choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to say, it smelled nice, but the method of application just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>..must use gloves ...and if u buy this do itself a favor and make sure u rub it in good</li>
            <li>She remarked how nice my skin looked</li>
            <li>Now I look like I have a nice glow all over.</li>
            <li>another nice detail...</li>
            <li>/&gt;First...good people you need a kind friend to spray this stuff on you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice now and have a nice glowing tan.</li>
            <li>while I liked it quite a bit it did at times make me feel \\&quot;orange\\</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>well it kind of does</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not orange, but rather kind of a dirt looking brown.</li>
            <li>Polynesia Monoi Miracle (smells like yummy Gardenia) body oil to the area misted to insure even tanning and a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>and it looks nice and even.  </li>
            <li>The colour is nice though and very easy to build up.</li>
            <li>Color develops quickly - with one spray on my face and neck, I get color within 3-5 hours, so if I am going out that night, I can apply it at noon, and the color is great by 5</li>
            <li>You can spray-on another layer to enhance the effect very easily, within an hour of applying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I tan very easily and well but was looking for an alternative to damaging tanning beds.</li>
            <li>Probably would be best if someone was very fair or ghostly, but for medium tan naturally as I am, doesn&#x27;t show much difference.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had that beautiful tan until the first time I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on sale at Rite Aid this week and was thrilled to try the top rated (CR) self tanning product.  </li>
            <li>its more trail and error kind of thing</li>
            <li>I used my CT maximizer (california tan) lotion, its like a clear gel that smells great!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, once you get the hang of it it is quite easy to use.</li>
            <li>I Love Love Love this spray self tanner!</li>
            <li>I would also turn the ceiling fan on to lessen the strong fumes!</li>
            <li>I found out about this awesome product, which is under $10, and is FAR BETTER than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This bronzer has gone on very smoothly for me and it doesn&#x27;t streak.  </li>
            <li>or just do the nest best buy it in the lotion ..much better and goes on even still streaks if not careful</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and turns a nice color.</li>
            <li>And be very very carful when doing your legs and feet!!!</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned, and have been happily using tanning products (lotions) for years.  </li>
            <li>would be better if a friend could help.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love that I can just spray it and go.  </li>
            <li>i love the color it gives u</li>
            <li>might wanna buy 2 cans to maintain the color and be carefull with the bottom of your feet:)</li>
            <li>and I think it helps the tan develop more evenly--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I love the color.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful product!!!</li>
            <li>I just made sure</li>
            <li>There is NO RUBBING with this - so again, as another reviewer said, no tan palms :)</li>
            <li>There is NO RUBBING with this - so again, as another reviewer said, no tan palms :)</li>
            <li>Here is a summary of the top 10 reasons I love this product</li>
            <li>Love it and will be tan all winter</li>
            <li>Actually a better color than I get from the booth.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more and use this always.  </li>
            <li>so you must watch wear you spray and feel for it and make sure you&#x27;ve covered every area.</li>
            <li>may cause striking in the color.</li>
            <li>How many bottles will I need to cover the rest of my body?</li>
            <li>In all honesty this product is okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better self tanning sprays that gave better results faster.</li>
            <li>I sprayed evenly on my legs and top of feet at 12-inch distance.</li>
            <li>For the night it looked awesome, but the next day I decided that I would try it again..</li>
            <li>This happened because I stood in one spot when spraying myself and the excess spray landed on the top of my feet.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I spray this on my face a couple times a week so that my face looks tan</li>
            <li>As a self-tanner addict, I can tell you this is my favorite self tanner.</li>
            <li>Last time I applied it, I was paranoid and applied it twice, within an hour or two, and I was VERY happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>You need to hold the can about a foot away from where your spraying and make sure that you pay attention to where you&#x27;ve sprayed (since you can&#x27;t see it going on).  </li>
            <li>My favorite tanner of all time.</li>
            <li>And i can layer it to get a deeper color I feel sure.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the actual design of the packaging, I thought.. &#x27;</li>
            <li>We made sure to get every spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and since I haven&#x27;t been able to wash it off,  I don&#x27;t think I will be able to wear shorts for weeks.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok when sprayed, but after it is on for about an hour</li>
            <li>the more you use it the more even the tan becomes.</li>
            <li>After applying the spray, I rinsed the palms of my hands and soles of my feet and rubbed with water between fingers and toes, just to make sure there wasn&#x27;t any tanning solution there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product so I didn&#x27;t have to wear panty hose, mostly to avoid another bulge showing through my clothes.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the 360 sprayer hits every angle</li>
            <li>make sure you also shake can continuously.  </li>
            <li>Best self tanner yet at a low cost.</li>
            <li>I have to say this product is better than any sunless lotion I have used.</li>
            <li>I sprayed the sunless spray on my legs, &amp; the next morning they looked great!</li>
            <li>To fix the darker spots I used CT body buffer exfoliator w/ warm water on a wash cloth pressing lightly.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; airbrush tan.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am fairly satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you appreciate the detail, I for one do not buy and apply a product that I don&#x27;t thoroughly understand beforehand.</li>
            <li>If I remember, I&#x27;ll make an update detailing whether or not I find a way to apply it more evenly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you appreciate the detail, I for one do not buy and apply a product that I don&#x27;t thoroughly understand beforehand.</li>
            <li>If I remember, I&#x27;ll make an update detailing whether or not I find a way to apply it more evenly.</li>
            <li>I also love that this bronzer doesn&#x27;t get my hands all yucky like most lotions do.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any rubbing in or scrubbing your hands afterwords to make sure they don&#x27;t get stained from the bronzer.  </li>
            <li>It takes more then two sprays for it to work</li>
            <li>but I knw when winter comes I sure wont be.</li>
            <li>LOVE it, and will probably be a life time user.</li>
            <li>BUILD IT :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the risk.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m on the hunt for more of this product.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the better sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li>sure I got everything\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This one is even better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>More like 5</li>
            <li>I plan to find a company that has a better spray bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>which is very rare with sunless tanning products!</li>
            <li>If you just do a light spray daily your color stays perfect.</li>
            <li>works great, very natural.</li>
            <li>This tanner was such a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li>but so far has worked great.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a good 1 week and while showering nothing really comes off.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, goes on quickly, and in my opinion, it smells better than most tanning products.</li>
            <li>I have tried different sunless tanners and I loved this one!  </li>
            <li>For one, the application process is super easy!  </li>
            <li>No obnoxious smell, easy to apply, and no orange color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the best I&#x27;ve ever used as far as going on evenly and color and smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, easy to use</li>
            <li>Like how it goes on so easy</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t paying attention, you could easily streak since you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;ve done.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily</li>
            <li>I used a light lotion before spraying in the shower so that it would go on more smoothly</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is really, really strong.</li>
            <li>not being too strong.  </li>
            <li>you get the strong &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>One of the best parts about this spray is it works upside down and is easy to grip.</li>
            <li>We followed directions and he sprayed me down just perfect.</li>
            <li>Best one I have used hands down.</li>
            <li>I have a light medium complexion and I tan easily.</li>
            <li>The spray falls from gravity and will cover those areas just fine.  </li>
            <li>I was able to see a nice glow within an hour and as time went on it developed very nicely and naturally.</li>
            <li>I am super fair and two light coats or one heavy coat will give me a color I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li>You do need to let the color develop overnight because you won&#x27;t get an accurate reading otherwise.  </li>
            <li>It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores).  </li>
            <li>The light mist seems to cover evenly</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally light (\\&quot;Ivory\\&quot; if we&#x27;re using Clinique foundation).  </li>
            <li>one get one free --</li>
            <li>i also used a bronzer with it but its an awesome product ive showered a few times</li>
            <li>and it goes on streak free</li>
            <li>The final color was really great.</li>
            <li>Not too much, just a nice sun kissed glow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**This goes on in a light mist.</li>
            <li>It falls lightly on the skin.</li>
            <li>I also put a light spritz on my face before bed and woke up looking like I had been kissed by the sun on a beach.</li>
            <li>I will order again if its available.  </li>
            <li>The color is natural, it sprays evenly and smells good too.</li>
            <li>I tried Neutrogena airbrush before trying the L&#x27;Oreal and the L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze was FAR superior.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to save so much money and still be satisfied with my tan!  </li>
            <li>I love the tan that I got from this product but make sure to be in a very WELL ventilated area when using it.</li>
            <li>And maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a fair skinned person, but it doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect fix to being pale.</li>
            <li>color is lovely, the price is right, and the smell is--GONE.  </li>
            <li>loved the fact it was such a fine light mist, and it was so easy to apply myself.</li>
            <li>you almost think its not working but DON&#x27;T over spray because it doesn&#x27;t take much to give you a beautiful natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Even coverage, quick drying &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, very convenient to apply, not too expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>find this product to be a quick and easy way to deepen an already existing tan.</li>
            <li>This product gives an even tan and is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>did spray quickly and lightly on my face and neckline and its given me a very satisfying natural looking color.</li>
            <li>This is the easiest and most natural self tanner I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li>If you want to go bold spray lightly.</li>
            <li>Admittedly it&#x27;s not my favorite, but it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>no orangeyness - and super super fine application.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to fix with another coat, &amp; as I use it more I&#x27;m getting better at applying it evenly.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for a few years and it sprays on nice and even, easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>all the areas that should have special attn</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion and even have trouble tanning in a bed.  </li>
            <li>If I missed a spot the first time I get a second chance to cover it up, lol.</li>
            <li>I like it, I used it and got a great tan color, but be careful with sweat and sun.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately my first time I didn&#x27;t do such a great job.</li>
            <li>After the fourth application I thought it looked really good.</li>
            <li>Its a good product overall</li>
            <li>Overall I loved the rest of the color of my body.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice, natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>and 1 good spray will last 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>and 1 good spray will last 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>I am a fairly overweight albino male and I&#x27;ve always longed to have the skin color of a navel orange.</li>
            <li>It dries fairly &amp;#34;quickly&amp;#34;, and definitely a lot quicker than the neutrogena one.</li>
            <li>This product really needs better directions...</li>
            <li>Overall good color and</li>
            <li>I get a nice medium natural color by using it on my legs two nights in a row.</li>
            <li>Color is good, but not enough aerosol in can.</li>
            <li>but overall it was a good product.</li>
            <li>There was an odor, but it was not very strong and was kind of nice.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite aspects because there was no shocking fake made-up looking color, just a nice glow that developed into a great tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light.</li>
            <li>It give a nice light color, if your looking a little natural color this is great.  </li>
            <li>It has great coloring but leaves a lot of streaks ..and read the other reviews do not sprat ur hands or feet</li>
            <li>beautiful color, very easy to apply, no discoloring of hands/nails, easy hold bottle, fast dry, can carry it in purse if you wanted to, decently priced, fast coloring.     </li>
            <li>Also dries quickly so you can move on with your life.   </li>
            <li>I start with my legs and spray in a quick, circular motion.</li>
            <li>Dries really quickly.</li>
            <li>While spraying, make sure you move around the room, but make sure you don&#x27;t just go back and forth between two spots.</li>
            <li>I noticed a spot on my wrist from the quick touch-up job I had done on my calves.  </li>
            <li>Although the tan looks better the 3rd day its still orange not my favorite product out there.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t flip the bottle over when you go to apply it; it stops working pretty quickly if you do that!</li>
            <li>it sputters, lucky if it sprays 8 inches.</li>
            <li>So my feet bottoms are super orange</li>
            <li>Luckily I had 4 days off work</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>Finally a self tanner that looks NATURAL on fair skin!</li>
            <li>Arrived and sprayer works great unlike another distributors spray product I ordered for less cost.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff so much i just bought it yesterday from the place i work at and was willing to try it cuz before i was using a lotion tanner</li>
            <li>So I loved the Sublime Bronze instant tan stuff, forgot the exact name</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and evenly but no way to see how much has been applied and is way toooo orange.</li>
            <li>I love it - doesn&#x27;t streak or look &amp;#34;orangish,&amp;#34; and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>The spray is a very fine mist that goes on lightly and dries instantly.</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this product and look forward to using it more over the summer!</li>
            <li>I used the WHOLE CAN on my legs &amp; NO color appeared!!</li>
            <li>If I go into the sun for the first time in months, I will burn at first, but I can easily get tanned without overdoing it too soon.  </li>
            <li>Personally, porcelain or dark at the pool is gorgeous, but I&#x27;m all forwhat makes someone else more confident.</li>
            <li>A touch better than Neutrogena&#x27;s spray tan, but I&#x27;m telling you, good results are hard to come by.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the second coat helps for nice even coverage.</li>
            <li>Make sure you look at your arms/legs/face in natural light.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Make sure you look at your arms/legs/face in natural light.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Make sure you look at your arms/legs/face in natural light.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>It stays fresh.  </li>
            <li>I guess since I have no skin pigment my body absorbed all the tanning stuff</li>
            <li>This is a nice spray that provides a deep color.  </li>
            <li>The rash issue again may be a deal breaker, but hopefully I can avoid it by showering, applying, and then applying the deodorant in the morning when the spray should be completely absorbed, keep in mind</li>
            <li>Cheers.e rash issue again may be a deal breaker, but hopefully I can avoid it by showering, applying, and then applying the deodorant in the morning when the spray should be completely absorbed, keep in mind</li>
            <li>so-o-o-o much better than the old stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Why more people d o not invest a few dollars into this product, is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;Having a nice tan look to your face and arms in thw winter</li>
            <li>However it dries pretty quick on your skin although it takes time to notice it penetrating</li>
            <li>3 hours later people will give me compliments on how tan i am makes me feel special:)</li>
            <li>Right now my face is like one shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now my face is like one shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now my face is like one shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>i can go to the mall right after using this and</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal got it right with this product.</li>
            <li>right away:&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it dissipated right away.  </li>
            <li>I go to bed right after and have never had a problem with it getting on my sheets or clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>rubbing right after because it will be lighter there.</li>
            <li>You have to wash your hands right away afterwards.</li>
            <li>in fact i put lots of lotion on my toe nails and then wash my hands and apply lotion right after to  my hands.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you color right away.</li>
            <li>but because we&#x27;re pinching pennies right now it was something I was going to need to put on hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I&#x27;m writing a review right now is because my husband texted asking if I was going to spray tan him this evening to get a bit darker</li>
            <li>Mainly I love the convenience of this bronzer because you can spray it on you and let it dry (which it does quickly) and be on your way!  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and doesn&#x27;t stink to high heaven days after using.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say is that I liked the smell compared to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>first application turned out a little streaky, but the second covered it up pretty good to a nice colored &amp; even application.</li>
            <li>and that is key to getting a good, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Maybe an expensive spray is way better, but this is what my budget allows and it works great.</li>
            <li>I grew up going to the beach every weekend from early morning until after dinner and had a beautiful dark tan when school started.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t streak, easy to apply, natural color as a result.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to put on with no mess, no worries about your hands turning orange or your nails.</li>
            <li>Like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, best kept secret.</li>
            <li>My sister recommended it to me and her skin looked really pretty</li>
            <li>and i put  this stuff on first</li>
            <li>like I did (the first time)  </li>
            <li>After trying several self tanning products, this is now my favorite.</li>
            <li>I attempted to spray my legs better but this morning I noticed some white patches.</li>
            <li>I can get a real tan on my body and use it to tan my face and the color matches to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>It delivers the same results as many department-store products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been to the beach because I can&#x27;t go in the direct sun light</li>
            <li>I think had I had my husband help with the application it would have turned out a lot better, so Im going to give that a try next time!     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lotions (ie Jergens), and Neutrogena Micro-Mist Spray (VERY orange!).  </li>
            <li>and then if you step in it, the bottom of your feet won&#x27;t look so pretty.</li>
            <li>I first start using this product about 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>May as well go bak to the eighties and use the first ever made.</li>
            <li>The first day I use it, I always exfoliate first.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fairly consistent looking coverage all over - even under boob and butt cheeks...</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will use regular/gradual tanning lotion shortly after spraying this on to make sure things are evened out.</li>
            <li>I like this product better than any instant tan.</li>
            <li>so then I reapplied it again, spraying even more on, and waited, waited, woke up next day, still nothing!!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Very displeased with this product!</li>
            <li>first exfoliate with a sugar scrub</li>
            <li>I have noticed the color rubbing off on the inside of my clothes in areas where I sweat, mostly the neck and upper shoulders, as well as the fact that a lady friend of mine had the color rub off on her hands when she gave me a neck rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this self tanner, bought online because did not find it on my local stores.</li>
            <li>More then likely will either try the darker version or another brand.</li>
            <li>Perfect even coverage, and doesn&#x27;t fade in any weird pattern.</li>
            <li>different (wink wink) but not terrible</li>
            <li>After about an hour out together my mom complimented my skin and said I looked really pretty.</li>
            <li>I did my normal facial cleansing routine tonight and the color stayed nicely without any streaking.</li>
            <li>Husband works in hot conditions and after sweating he was still tanned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this one is pretty close.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d risk a few dollars to see if L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product would be a good alternative(and</li>
            <li>Yes, you have to take some extra time and follow the tips of other users if you want the best look possible, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>making sure I was keeping the bottle far enough away from my body to get even coverage and to move the bottle quickly.    </li>
            <li>It left a yellow orange tint all over my bathroom floor (which wiped off rather easily) but make sure to remove any floor rugs or the shower curtain if you are in close proximity.</li>
            <li>This product has made it possible for me to have a nice, natural (but darker) color to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have patches because I sprayed extra in some spots thinking I didn&#x27;t get it good enough.</li>
            <li>Only good thing, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my white sheets.</li>
            <li>I sprayed in perfect lines right down my legs a few times.</li>
            <li>I find a quick spritz after an exfoliating shower about every other day gives me a nice glow and natural, gradual build up of color when I go to FL in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I will be much happier with it when I can find a method to apply it evenly, on a consistent basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I think the product has potential, and I believe that most of the negatives can be negated by more careful preparation and application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s nice if it looks good, but a week is very painful when your legs splotchy and orange.</li>
            <li>You know how it is, you want a little color, so I thought ok why not!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, you wake up the next morning</li>
            <li>make sure you are completely dry before applying.  </li>
            <li>has a certain tan shade forming in certain areas...</li>
            <li>So now I have large orange shin, and the rest of my body is still transparent.   </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t say how far away to spray it, which I think is pretty important, can&#x27;t be too close or it will be drippy, and can&#x27;t be too far, because it won&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li>I have had streaking on the back of my legs before, but its easily ex-foliated off and I should have been more careful.  </li>
            <li>it goes on with such a fine mist</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the spray tan at first, like all other tanning products.</li>
            <li>This tanner has such a fine mist that I really wasn&#x27;t worried.  </li>
            <li>I ended up with splotches &amp; stripes on my legs, because you can&#x27;t tell where or how much is being applied.  </li>
            <li>and it wasnt really getting all the spots on my body</li>
            <li>I am VERY anal about how my self tanner looks.</li>
            <li>But I really feel like the spray provides very even coverage.</li>
            <li>my favorite spray on tan, I never get globs of wet spray tan on me when using this product.</li>
            <li>I attribute that to spraying it too fast.</li>
            <li>I did the face fast because, again, I didn&#x27;t want an orange face.</li>
            <li>I attribute that to spraying it too fast.</li>
            <li>I did the face fast because, again, I didn&#x27;t want an orange face.</li>
            <li>I did the face fast because, again, I didn&#x27;t want an orange face.</li>
            <li>but if you added to much it got streaky.</li>
            <li>I spray my face as well and it looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I would suggest a real spray tan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a very restricted budget and can&#x27;t afford a case of this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I have so much skin area that I needed a case of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It sprays well, way better than the neutrogena one that tries to copy it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not sticky (unless you spray on way too much in one sitting).  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tan very well</li>
            <li>I am brunette with freckles, but get very tan in the summer</li>
            <li>Thanks folks - J</li>
            <li>Very blotchy.</li>
            <li>were not spotted thanks to doing it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Came out very well.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>but for real life... forget about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it had a color to it when spraying it on because it kept drying so fast</li>
            <li>so you dont have spray marks that are really close to your body</li>
            <li>I stood in the shower and tried to spray as evenly as possible and used a light coat on my face.</li>
            <li>: It doesn&#x27;t really work very well in terms of color strength, sometimes once it sets it still has a sticky finish to it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for the spray.  </li>
            <li>I have hairy legs, applying the spray to my legs does absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li>Goes on evenly and dries in a reasonable color.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>This is such an improvement over what was available a decade ago....</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>.. use too much and you WILL become orange...</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had much luck with self tanners.</li>
            <li>I tend to apply it 3 times a week as the tan it provides is gradual, which comes in handy given that it has been rather inconsistently uneven in my experience with it</li>
            <li>However, so far, I seem to be able to hit everywhere evenly by the third day.</li>
            <li>i was a little nervous to go out right away until i got a more even apperance</li>
            <li>did she know I was trying my new L&#x27;Oreal tanning spray for the first time.</li>
            <li>Does give a decent LIGHT tan to very white people.</li>
            <li>I use other product for my face.  :)</li>
            <li>The color appears within an hour, like it says on the bottle, but if you apply a coat every day (after exfoliating) then after the first few applications you get a gorgeous bronze (not yellow) color.</li>
            <li>It dries instantly, keeps your hands clean and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>Finally a brand got the self tanners right!</li>
            <li>but unfortunately your \\&quot;tan\\&quot; will have a strong orange color instead of a nice bronze or brown color.</li>
            <li>the spray is really consistent, easy to hold down, and although you&#x27;d never use it as perfume, it smells</li>
            <li>Its not going to overpower your normal scents after it dries for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and did NOT spray my feet, hands, knees, or elbows.</li>
            <li>You only get about one full body coverage with this can.</li>
            <li>But I was able to scrub my feet and tone down the color to what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Positives: Complimented often, nobody has called me out on having a fake tan without me admitting it first, product is cheap, dries fast, and the product is safe for your skin.</li>
            <li>Enough of the spray floats down in the air to those areas that it will cover it nicely without looking obvious or having a huge color difference versus your legs.</li>
            <li>The color was a very natural bronze and not orange like most other self tanners.</li>
            <li>Less is more.</li>
            <li>Such a quick fix without turning orange.</li>
            <li>I rarely write negative reviews unless the product genuinely warrants it, and this does!</li>
            <li>The color is very natural looking, but not when it is really streaky...  </li>
            <li>#34;i used it yesterday &amp; got no results!!&amp;#34;- buildable is better in case you mess up somehow</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from it and decided to rub this in with my left hand while I sprayed with my right hand.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>My feet, elbows and knees were a lovely dark shade of brownish-orange!</li>
            <li>cons: goes on clear and you can&#x27;t see where it has been applied to, therefore making it easier to end up with streaking, says it has a \\&quot;scent\\&quot; to it when really it just smells like a self tanner    </li>
            <li>a tip - you really don&#x27;t need to directly spray your ankles and feet if using on your legs.</li>
            <li>Bought a few more cans for my upcoming trip to Vegas.</li>
            <li>I obviously don&#x27;t need this, but I have fun seeing the effects of stuff like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally landed on the L&#x27;Oreal spray, which sprays on clear, dries fairly quickly, and if you apply it evenly, tans evenly.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed color right away same day.</li>
            <li>(although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it right next to clothes or anything).</li>
            <li>&quot; right out of the blue.</li>
            <li>They are right, the mist falls enough to give you even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Make sure to let it dry for around 20 minutes before getting dressed or climbing into bed; I found on several occasions that my bra and panties were left with an orange tint as was my light blue bedding even after I thought I was more than dry enough to climb in!!!</li>
            <li>It went on pretty clean, a few streaks but nothing noticeable unless I pointed it out.</li>
            <li>I had a shopping date with my daughter and mother for school shoes and decided to give my new spray tanner a whirl before going out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to be a new staple in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>Brand new</li>
            <li>So I decided to try something new after reading reviews I went with this one.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that on my skin it takes a good 8+ hours to develop color</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly...</li>
            <li>Have used it daily for a full week and barely see any difference.  </li>
            <li>I have very pale skin and find that it takes a couple applications to see results (which I think is much more natural looking than one layer of intense color).  </li>
            <li>I do not spray my feet or hands, as the spray lands on them anyway and ends up looking very natural.</li>
            <li>The color leaves a very natural looking glow, not orange or &amp;</li>
            <li>It looks very natural, not orangey at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I simply applied the spray directly there (the next day) and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very natural looking and even, it has a subtle scent and it works better than any spray tan I&#x27;ve ever gotton in a salon because I can highlight certain spots if I want (shoulders, etc</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the exact same.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the exact same.</li>
            <li>I also rubbed lightly with a towel over my knees and elbows to ensure that the tanner was not to dark in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Are these old bottles?!</li>
            <li>spray feet or hands, the excess will cover normally and naturally.  </li>
            <li>Take your time and evenly apply it everywhere, if you didn&#x27;t get it enough the first time, you can always try again tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work with my super pale skin (way too orange) but worked pretty well on my darker friend</li>
            <li>I usually seem to have a nice golden brown/very slightly orangish glow.</li>
            <li>I sprayed my face twice and within a few hours my skin was a pretty golden brown.</li>
            <li>I think the problem with the spray is that it goes uncontrollably everywhere, whereas with the lotion I control with my hand exactly where it goes, therefore avoiding sensitive areas such as the sides of my feet and knees.</li>
            <li>It looks better than the last custom spray I got, not as dark but it warmed me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: To blend in those larger tan spots I used pure acetone on a QTip to rub in the area and the spots lighten quite a bit or completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She began asking me all kinds of questions about the product (do you have to rub it in, does it smell, etc...) and was really excited to find out that it was a spray mist and dried pretty much instantly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, after MULTIPLE attempts to get this orange, terrible looking excuse for a &#x27;tan&#x27; off me... I was very unsuccessful and had to look like an umpa lumpa for my high school best friend&#x27;s wedding.. and I was wearing a satin mid thigh strapless to top it</li>
            <li>I went to use it and all it sprayed was clear, nothing happened.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear</li>
            <li>I got professionally airbrushed a week before I tried this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My professional airbrush tan was fading, so I decided to try and give it some help.  </li>
            <li>so i decided to give this a try it goes on fast and its very simple!!!</li>
            <li>I am a 44 year old natural blond with lupus, an autoimmune disease that doesn&#x27;t allow me to stay in the sun.</li>
            <li>I suggest standing on an old rag, or else the bottom of your feet will turn orange.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT spray your hands or feet or they will be discolored (they will get color naturally from the excess spray falling on them).&lt;br</li>
            <li>only real downfall is that the smell isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;prettiest.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near</li>
            <li>The color is as close to natural as it comes and is not orange at all, not even in natural daylight.  </li>
            <li>I found that if I avoid anything that would cause exfoliation with my bath or shower the tan lasted longer (up to nearly 5 days.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would completely recommend, and at $6 what a bargain.</li>
            <li>This deffinitly fixed that problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and keeps me from looking completely</li>
            <li>I picked this product up for 2 reasons, I can&#x27;t seem to tan naturally, or in a bed.</li>
            <li>strategy thus far...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve made it this far</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve made it this far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say these are old products being sold.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan because my mom has gotten skin cancer from natural tanning</li>
            <li>It looks natural, not orange.</li>
            <li>then others like my legs were VERY spotty and even some on my back as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for some time because of it&#x27;s natural look.  </li>
            <li>if your using for full body have someone else spray you down</li>
            <li>Secondly, because I work out a lot, and tan skin shows more definition than deathly pale skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Pretty laughable, so definitely do not use if you have an important, bare-legs event coming up, or God forbid, try this stuff on your face if you haven&#x27;t experimented first!</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it I was worried because I looked really splotchy</li>
            <li>i was the airbrush tannning tech at a day spa for 2 years and so far this is by far the closest thing i have found to the actual $30 professional spray tans!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended alternative to skin cancer and pasty white legs.</li>
            <li>: Shower, dry myself carefully so as not to take off much of the color, air dry further, then apply again, paying special attention to places that I missed on Sunday (always seems to happen).&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday:</li>
            <li>All of it is caught by the hair, and when I go to the gym with pale white calves and a nice tan up top looks laughable, so I&#x27;ve taken a layer off my arms and legs with a shaver to see if this helps.</li>
            <li>My daughter jokingly said, \\&quot;Mom, now your hand matches your arm color.\\&quot; &lt;~I&#x27;m a medium complexioned black person, so please if you&#x27;re white or light DON&#x27;T do that rub barehanded.</li>
            <li>One mentioned that I looked orange (close friend who I assumed would mock me as soon as I began tanning, so he can be written off) and one coworker who mentioned that my face was a little streaky, probably due to me touching my face, mostly rubbing my eyes late at night before bed when I apply the stuff.</li>
            <li>Even after having it on for 12+ hours it did not leave a tan and the I really thought it would, just because of how dark it tints when you first apply it, but after I showered the next day...</li>
            <li>This not only dry very fast, it is also natural looking.</li>
            <li>I think maybe the first time I didn&#x27;t let it dry completely before I got dressed because one of the splotches was on the back of my leg where my shorts would have rubbed.</li>
            <li>only con to this is the smell, which I can live with for the price.  </li>
            <li>I remember putting it on, and waiting 6 whole hours for the stuff to dry.</li>
            <li>, TAN LAST SEVERAL DAYS, , FAST SERVICE.</li>
            <li>It takes a few hours to show up and a few days to build, but I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I used only very soft washcloths, liquid moisturizing body wash and avoided using anything abrasive (loofa or sponges.)  </li>
            <li>Even with my other spray-on tanners, I found myself giving a quick rub-in after it dried a little, just to make sure it was even.  </li>
            <li>My skin is LIGHT, and this is the only product that has a fine enough mist to help me augment my difficult to tan legs.</li>
            <li>its not extreme.  </li>
            <li>but my arms certain areas didnt take to it and through out half the next day my face looked really blochy</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get a ton of color in each application, but my theory is \\&quot;slow and steady wins</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I have had no luck with the product naturally settling on my hands, my hands are always shades whiter, and applying it lightly to my hands resulted in a dirt like effect from the knuckles down.</li>
            <li>Exfoliating is important (duh).</li>
            <li>But generally almost fool proof.</li>
            <li>I only look orange in soft lighting, such as my bedroom, and another reviewer is VERY CORRECT in saying that the sun makes the entire tan look different.</li>
            <li>When overused, this barely makes one look orange</li>
            <li>After I put on my body spray (about 45 mins after) I could barely even detect it.</li>
            <li>Especially on the feet (and I never sprayed directly on my feet.</li>
            <li>I like a healthy looking tan--but without the unhealthy results of sunshine.  </li>
            <li>You can kinda see the results after an hour but the true test of the color you&#x27;ll get will be a few hours later.</li>
            <li>This Bronzer is SO easy to put on- as it is in an airbrush type of bottle and you can spray it on your back and hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li>First, I washed my hands and the water ran down my arms causing streaking.</li>
            <li>This dries quickly and there is very little streaking.  </li>
            <li>Its a no mess application and the color builds from daily applications and the color lasts.</li>
            <li>I looked like a hot mess</li>
            <li>The tanning effects are great (got several compliments on my tan!), but I found it a little tough to spray on without ending up with streaks/bare spots - you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;ve sprayed &amp; it takes a few hours for the color to really show.</li>
            <li>be very careful on how you apply it and how much product you apply.</li>
            <li>: You MUST go outside at some point the next morning to see what it looks like in natural lighting.</li>
            <li>I found that indoors you look completely tan with no splotches, but when I left work and went outside, I noticed that I missed a lot of areas on my legs.</li>
            <li>: You MUST go outside at some point the next morning to see what it looks like in natural lighting.</li>
            <li>I found that indoors you look completely tan with no splotches, but when I left work and went outside, I noticed that I missed a lot of areas on my legs.</li>
            <li>You can get some results for later the same evening if you do it early in the morning.</li>
            <li>First buy the dark deep one.  </li>
            <li>My knees have a large dark patch on front.</li>
            <li>so if you have a dark complexion you might not see much darkenening.</li>
            <li>(I know, obvious, but I have a natural inclination to flip it over when I&#x27;m doing my back and the back of my legs!).</li>
            <li>I tried a few days after the first time, just to even out the areas where there was seemingly no color, but I still have areas that look like there is nothing.  </li>
            <li>First off, when spraying it is very hard to tell what area you have sprayed and how much.</li>
            <li>It was not much more color than the Jergens stuff, but if you leave it on for about 8 hours it gives you just a little glow, if you are looking for more drastic color  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either, which in the past has bothered me with other products.</li>
            <li>and I guess i&#x27;m just too overweight as the whole bottle only managed to cover from my knee down.</li>
            <li>It only seems to work when you keep the can straight up and down.</li>
            <li>Lastly, and most importantly, I had some sort of reaction with my old spice deodorant and the spray that resulted in a red and painful rash under the armpits, the rash appeared under both arms on the same day, I read about it online, stopped using deodorant for a week (in case it was fungal) and it cleared up within a few days.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t bend legs more than 90 degrees for probably an hour, I have a line behind my knees, even though I waited until it felt dry to sit.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, although after a few hours it does begin to smell like all fake tanners but much more faint.  </li>
            <li>After several hours, I started noticing a little color, but really noticed the difference the next day.  </li>
            <li>Good or bad, the tan seems to last about a week.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Definatly a good product.  </li>
            <li> This product is excellent and looks likes a real, straight from the beach tan!</li>
            <li> When I need a quick tan on my legs, this is the best way to get it.  </li>
            <li> *more like burn* and have never had really great results from doing the lotion tanners.</li>
            <li> am fair skinned &amp; use tanning beds everyother day, but need more help from spray tans to reach a good tan color.</li>
            <li> Best part is that you can&#x27;t feel it or smell it very much at all.</li>
            <li> I love the color and smell!</li>
            <li> Make sure you use lotion before to prevent streaking and continue to use lotion to prolong your tan!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Almost as funny as the excellent reviews this product got on a compare website.  </li>
            <li> Will be getting through subscribe and save for sure!</li>
            <li> I would deffinitly reccomend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Another til, spray tans at a salon cost me 15$, so 10$ on L&#x27;oreal sunless tan is much better for me!</li>
            <li> I love the way tan skin looks!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My husband has a lovely none orange tan going after one application!  </li>
            <li> Will continue to buy it through Amazon as the price is better!</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned (not porcelain but definitely light) and this is one of the better self-tanner products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Smooth, no splotches I was happy.</li>
            <li> It evened out and the color was nice.</li>
            <li> I think the color goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have finally found one that works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of musty smelling, not citrusy like the bottle</li>
            <li> This Loreal smell does stay with her all day, and honestly I can also smell it (</li>
            <li> but I am nice and say nothing).</li>
            <li> I do not understand  how this stuff has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> and I felt confident this was a good choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say, it smelled nice, but the method of application just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> ..must use gloves ...and if u buy this do itself a favor and make sure u rub it in good</li>
            <li> She remarked how nice my skin looked</li>
            <li> Now I look like I have a nice glow all over.</li>
            <li> another nice detail...</li>
            <li> /&gt;First...good people you need a kind friend to spray this stuff on you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice now and have a nice glowing tan.</li>
            <li> while I liked it quite a bit it did at times make me feel \\&quot;orange\\</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> well it kind of does</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not orange, but rather kind of a dirt looking brown.</li>
            <li> Polynesia Monoi Miracle (smells like yummy Gardenia) body oil to the area misted to insure even tanning and a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> and it looks nice and even.  </li>
            <li> The colour is nice though and very easy to build up.</li>
            <li> Color develops quickly - with one spray on my face and neck, I get color within 3-5 hours, so if I am going out that night, I can apply it at noon, and the color is great by 5</li>
            <li> You can spray-on another layer to enhance the effect very easily, within an hour of applying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I tan very easily and well but was looking for an alternative to damaging tanning beds.</li>
            <li> Probably would be best if someone was very fair or ghostly, but for medium tan naturally as I am, doesn&#x27;t show much difference.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had that beautiful tan until the first time I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on sale at Rite Aid this week and was thrilled to try the top rated (CR) self tanning product.  </li>
            <li> its more trail and error kind of thing</li>
            <li> I used my CT maximizer (california tan) lotion, its like a clear gel that smells great!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, once you get the hang of it it is quite easy to use.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this spray self tanner!</li>
            <li> I would also turn the ceiling fan on to lessen the strong fumes!</li>
            <li> I found out about this awesome product, which is under $10, and is FAR BETTER than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This bronzer has gone on very smoothly for me and it doesn&#x27;t streak.  </li>
            <li> or just do the nest best buy it in the lotion ..much better and goes on even still streaks if not careful</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and turns a nice color.</li>
            <li> And be very very carful when doing your legs and feet!!!</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned, and have been happily using tanning products (lotions) for years.  </li>
            <li> would be better if a friend could help.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love that I can just spray it and go.  </li>
            <li> i love the color it gives u</li>
            <li> might wanna buy 2 cans to maintain the color and be carefull with the bottom of your feet:)</li>
            <li> and I think it helps the tan develop more evenly--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I love the color.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product!!!</li>
            <li> I just made sure</li>
            <li> There is NO RUBBING with this - so again, as another reviewer said, no tan palms :)</li>
            <li> There is NO RUBBING with this - so again, as another reviewer said, no tan palms :)</li>
            <li> Here is a summary of the top 10 reasons I love this product</li>
            <li> Love it and will be tan all winter</li>
            <li> Actually a better color than I get from the booth.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more and use this always.  </li>
            <li> so you must watch wear you spray and feel for it and make sure you&#x27;ve covered every area.</li>
            <li> may cause striking in the color.</li>
            <li> How many bottles will I need to cover the rest of my body?</li>
            <li> In all honesty this product is okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better self tanning sprays that gave better results faster.</li>
            <li> I sprayed evenly on my legs and top of feet at 12-inch distance.</li>
            <li> For the night it looked awesome, but the next day I decided that I would try it again..</li>
            <li> This happened because I stood in one spot when spraying myself and the excess spray landed on the top of my feet.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I spray this on my face a couple times a week so that my face looks tan</li>
            <li> As a self-tanner addict, I can tell you this is my favorite self tanner.</li>
            <li> Last time I applied it, I was paranoid and applied it twice, within an hour or two, and I was VERY happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> You need to hold the can about a foot away from where your spraying and make sure that you pay attention to where you&#x27;ve sprayed (since you can&#x27;t see it going on).  </li>
            <li> My favorite tanner of all time.</li>
            <li> And i can layer it to get a deeper color I feel sure.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the actual design of the packaging, I thought.. &#x27;</li>
            <li> We made sure to get every spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and since I haven&#x27;t been able to wash it off,  I don&#x27;t think I will be able to wear shorts for weeks.  </li>
            <li> The smell is ok when sprayed, but after it is on for about an hour</li>
            <li> the more you use it the more even the tan becomes.</li>
            <li> After applying the spray, I rinsed the palms of my hands and soles of my feet and rubbed with water between fingers and toes, just to make sure there wasn&#x27;t any tanning solution there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product so I didn&#x27;t have to wear panty hose, mostly to avoid another bulge showing through my clothes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the 360 sprayer hits every angle</li>
            <li> make sure you also shake can continuously.  </li>
            <li> Best self tanner yet at a low cost.</li>
            <li> I have to say this product is better than any sunless lotion I have used.</li>
            <li> I sprayed the sunless spray on my legs, &amp; the next morning they looked great!</li>
            <li> To fix the darker spots I used CT body buffer exfoliator w/ warm water on a wash cloth pressing lightly.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; airbrush tan.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am fairly satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you appreciate the detail, I for one do not buy and apply a product that I don&#x27;t thoroughly understand beforehand.</li>
            <li> If I remember, I&#x27;ll make an update detailing whether or not I find a way to apply it more evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you appreciate the detail, I for one do not buy and apply a product that I don&#x27;t thoroughly understand beforehand.</li>
            <li> If I remember, I&#x27;ll make an update detailing whether or not I find a way to apply it more evenly.</li>
            <li> I also love that this bronzer doesn&#x27;t get my hands all yucky like most lotions do.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any rubbing in or scrubbing your hands afterwords to make sure they don&#x27;t get stained from the bronzer.  </li>
            <li> It takes more then two sprays for it to work</li>
            <li> but I knw when winter comes I sure wont be.</li>
            <li> LOVE it, and will probably be a life time user.</li>
            <li> BUILD IT :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the risk.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m on the hunt for more of this product.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the better sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li> sure I got everything\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This one is even better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> More like 5</li>
            <li> I plan to find a company that has a better spray bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> which is very rare with sunless tanning products!</li>
            <li> If you just do a light spray daily your color stays perfect.</li>
            <li> works great, very natural.</li>
            <li> This tanner was such a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li> but so far has worked great.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a good 1 week and while showering nothing really comes off.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, goes on quickly, and in my opinion, it smells better than most tanning products.</li>
            <li> I have tried different sunless tanners and I loved this one!  </li>
            <li> For one, the application process is super easy!  </li>
            <li> No obnoxious smell, easy to apply, and no orange color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the best I&#x27;ve ever used as far as going on evenly and color and smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, easy to use</li>
            <li> Like how it goes on so easy</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t paying attention, you could easily streak since you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;ve done.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily</li>
            <li> I used a light lotion before spraying in the shower so that it would go on more smoothly</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is really, really strong.</li>
            <li> not being too strong.  </li>
            <li> you get the strong &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> One of the best parts about this spray is it works upside down and is easy to grip.</li>
            <li> We followed directions and he sprayed me down just perfect.</li>
            <li> Best one I have used hands down.</li>
            <li> I have a light medium complexion and I tan easily.</li>
            <li> The spray falls from gravity and will cover those areas just fine.  </li>
            <li> I was able to see a nice glow within an hour and as time went on it developed very nicely and naturally.</li>
            <li> I am super fair and two light coats or one heavy coat will give me a color I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li> You do need to let the color develop overnight because you won&#x27;t get an accurate reading otherwise.  </li>
            <li> It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores).  </li>
            <li> The light mist seems to cover evenly</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally light (\\&quot;Ivory\\&quot; if we&#x27;re using Clinique foundation).  </li>
            <li> one get one free --</li>
            <li> i also used a bronzer with it but its an awesome product ive showered a few times</li>
            <li> and it goes on streak free</li>
            <li> The final color was really great.</li>
            <li> Not too much, just a nice sun kissed glow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**This goes on in a light mist.</li>
            <li> It falls lightly on the skin.</li>
            <li> I also put a light spritz on my face before bed and woke up looking like I had been kissed by the sun on a beach.</li>
            <li> I will order again if its available.  </li>
            <li> The color is natural, it sprays evenly and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I tried Neutrogena airbrush before trying the L&#x27;Oreal and the L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze was FAR superior.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to save so much money and still be satisfied with my tan!  </li>
            <li> I love the tan that I got from this product but make sure to be in a very WELL ventilated area when using it.</li>
            <li> And maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a fair skinned person, but it doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect fix to being pale.</li>
            <li> color is lovely, the price is right, and the smell is--GONE.  </li>
            <li> loved the fact it was such a fine light mist, and it was so easy to apply myself.</li>
            <li> you almost think its not working but DON&#x27;T over spray because it doesn&#x27;t take much to give you a beautiful natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Even coverage, quick drying &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good, very convenient to apply, not too expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> find this product to be a quick and easy way to deepen an already existing tan.</li>
            <li> This product gives an even tan and is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> did spray quickly and lightly on my face and neckline and its given me a very satisfying natural looking color.</li>
            <li> This is the easiest and most natural self tanner I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li> If you want to go bold spray lightly.</li>
            <li> Admittedly it&#x27;s not my favorite, but it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> no orangeyness - and super super fine application.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to fix with another coat, &amp; as I use it more I&#x27;m getting better at applying it evenly.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few years and it sprays on nice and even, easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> all the areas that should have special attn</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion and even have trouble tanning in a bed.  </li>
            <li> If I missed a spot the first time I get a second chance to cover it up, lol.</li>
            <li> I like it, I used it and got a great tan color, but be careful with sweat and sun.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately my first time I didn&#x27;t do such a great job.</li>
            <li> After the fourth application I thought it looked really good.</li>
            <li> Its a good product overall</li>
            <li> Overall I loved the rest of the color of my body.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice, natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> and 1 good spray will last 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> and 1 good spray will last 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> I am a fairly overweight albino male and I&#x27;ve always longed to have the skin color of a navel orange.</li>
            <li> It dries fairly &amp;#34;quickly&amp;#34;, and definitely a lot quicker than the neutrogena one.</li>
            <li> This product really needs better directions...</li>
            <li> Overall good color and</li>
            <li> I get a nice medium natural color by using it on my legs two nights in a row.</li>
            <li> Color is good, but not enough aerosol in can.</li>
            <li> but overall it was a good product.</li>
            <li> There was an odor, but it was not very strong and was kind of nice.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite aspects because there was no shocking fake made-up looking color, just a nice glow that developed into a great tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light.</li>
            <li> It give a nice light color, if your looking a little natural color this is great.  </li>
            <li> It has great coloring but leaves a lot of streaks ..and read the other reviews do not sprat ur hands or feet</li>
            <li> beautiful color, very easy to apply, no discoloring of hands/nails, easy hold bottle, fast dry, can carry it in purse if you wanted to, decently priced, fast coloring.     </li>
            <li> Also dries quickly so you can move on with your life.   </li>
            <li> I start with my legs and spray in a quick, circular motion.</li>
            <li> Dries really quickly.</li>
            <li> While spraying, make sure you move around the room, but make sure you don&#x27;t just go back and forth between two spots.</li>
            <li> I noticed a spot on my wrist from the quick touch-up job I had done on my calves.  </li>
            <li> Although the tan looks better the 3rd day its still orange not my favorite product out there.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t flip the bottle over when you go to apply it; it stops working pretty quickly if you do that!</li>
            <li> it sputters, lucky if it sprays 8 inches.</li>
            <li> So my feet bottoms are super orange</li>
            <li> Luckily I had 4 days off work</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Finally a self tanner that looks NATURAL on fair skin!</li>
            <li> Arrived and sprayer works great unlike another distributors spray product I ordered for less cost.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff so much i just bought it yesterday from the place i work at and was willing to try it cuz before i was using a lotion tanner</li>
            <li> So I loved the Sublime Bronze instant tan stuff, forgot the exact name</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and evenly but no way to see how much has been applied and is way toooo orange.</li>
            <li> I love it - doesn&#x27;t streak or look &amp;#34;orangish,&amp;#34; and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> The spray is a very fine mist that goes on lightly and dries instantly.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this product and look forward to using it more over the summer!</li>
            <li> I used the WHOLE CAN on my legs &amp; NO color appeared!!</li>
            <li> If I go into the sun for the first time in months, I will burn at first, but I can easily get tanned without overdoing it too soon.  </li>
            <li> Personally, porcelain or dark at the pool is gorgeous, but I&#x27;m all forwhat makes someone else more confident.</li>
            <li> A touch better than Neutrogena&#x27;s spray tan, but I&#x27;m telling you, good results are hard to come by.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the second coat helps for nice even coverage.</li>
            <li> Make sure you look at your arms/legs/face in natural light.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>

            <li> It stays fresh.  </li>
            <li> I guess since I have no skin pigment my body absorbed all the tanning stuff</li>
            <li> This is a nice spray that provides a deep color.  </li>
            <li> The rash issue again may be a deal breaker, but hopefully I can avoid it by showering, applying, and then applying the deodorant in the morning when the spray should be completely absorbed, keep in mind</li>
            <li> Cheers.e rash issue again may be a deal breaker, but hopefully I can avoid it by showering, applying, and then applying the deodorant in the morning when the spray should be completely absorbed, keep in mind</li>
            <li> so-o-o-o much better than the old stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Why more people d o not invest a few dollars into this product, is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;Having a nice tan look to your face and arms in thw winter</li>
            <li> However it dries pretty quick on your skin although it takes time to notice it penetrating</li>
            <li> 3 hours later people will give me compliments on how tan i am makes me feel special:)</li>
            <li> Right now my face is like one shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right now my face is like one shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right now my face is like one shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> i can go to the mall right after using this and</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal got it right with this product.</li>
            <li> right away:&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it dissipated right away.  </li>
            <li> I go to bed right after and have never had a problem with it getting on my sheets or clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rubbing right after because it will be lighter there.</li>
            <li> You have to wash your hands right away afterwards.</li>
            <li> in fact i put lots of lotion on my toe nails and then wash my hands and apply lotion right after to  my hands.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you color right away.</li>
            <li> but because we&#x27;re pinching pennies right now it was something I was going to need to put on hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m writing a review right now is because my husband texted asking if I was going to spray tan him this evening to get a bit darker</li>
            <li> Mainly I love the convenience of this bronzer because you can spray it on you and let it dry (which it does quickly) and be on your way!  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and doesn&#x27;t stink to high heaven days after using.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can say is that I liked the smell compared to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> first application turned out a little streaky, but the second covered it up pretty good to a nice colored &amp; even application.</li>
            <li> and that is key to getting a good, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Maybe an expensive spray is way better, but this is what my budget allows and it works great.</li>
            <li> I grew up going to the beach every weekend from early morning until after dinner and had a beautiful dark tan when school started.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t streak, easy to apply, natural color as a result.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to put on with no mess, no worries about your hands turning orange or your nails.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, best kept secret.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended it to me and her skin looked really pretty</li>
            <li> and i put  this stuff on first</li>
            <li> like I did (the first time)  </li>
            <li> After trying several self tanning products, this is now my favorite.</li>
            <li> I attempted to spray my legs better but this morning I noticed some white patches.</li>
            <li> I can get a real tan on my body and use it to tan my face and the color matches to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> It delivers the same results as many department-store products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been to the beach because I can&#x27;t go in the direct sun light</li>
            <li> I think had I had my husband help with the application it would have turned out a lot better, so Im going to give that a try next time!     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lotions (ie Jergens), and Neutrogena Micro-Mist Spray (VERY orange!).  </li>
            <li> and then if you step in it, the bottom of your feet won&#x27;t look so pretty.</li>
            <li> I first start using this product about 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> May as well go bak to the eighties and use the first ever made.</li>
            <li> The first day I use it, I always exfoliate first.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fairly consistent looking coverage all over - even under boob and butt cheeks...</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will use regular/gradual tanning lotion shortly after spraying this on to make sure things are evened out.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than any instant tan.</li>
            <li> so then I reapplied it again, spraying even more on, and waited, waited, woke up next day, still nothing!!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Very displeased with this product!</li>
            <li> first exfoliate with a sugar scrub</li>
            <li> I have noticed the color rubbing off on the inside of my clothes in areas where I sweat, mostly the neck and upper shoulders, as well as the fact that a lady friend of mine had the color rub off on her hands when she gave me a neck rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner, bought online because did not find it on my local stores.</li>
            <li> More then likely will either try the darker version or another brand.</li>
            <li> Perfect even coverage, and doesn&#x27;t fade in any weird pattern.</li>
            <li> different (wink wink) but not terrible</li>
            <li> After about an hour out together my mom complimented my skin and said I looked really pretty.</li>
            <li> I did my normal facial cleansing routine tonight and the color stayed nicely without any streaking.</li>
            <li> Husband works in hot conditions and after sweating he was still tanned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one is pretty close.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d risk a few dollars to see if L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product would be a good alternative(and</li>
            <li> Yes, you have to take some extra time and follow the tips of other users if you want the best look possible, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> making sure I was keeping the bottle far enough away from my body to get even coverage and to move the bottle quickly.    </li>
            <li> It left a yellow orange tint all over my bathroom floor (which wiped off rather easily) but make sure to remove any floor rugs or the shower curtain if you are in close proximity.</li>
            <li> This product has made it possible for me to have a nice, natural (but darker) color to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have patches because I sprayed extra in some spots thinking I didn&#x27;t get it good enough.</li>
            <li> Only good thing, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my white sheets.</li>
            <li> I sprayed in perfect lines right down my legs a few times.</li>
            <li> I find a quick spritz after an exfoliating shower about every other day gives me a nice glow and natural, gradual build up of color when I go to FL in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I will be much happier with it when I can find a method to apply it evenly, on a consistent basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I think the product has potential, and I believe that most of the negatives can be negated by more careful preparation and application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s nice if it looks good, but a week is very painful when your legs splotchy and orange.</li>
            <li> You know how it is, you want a little color, so I thought ok why not!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, you wake up the next morning</li>
            <li> make sure you are completely dry before applying.  </li>
            <li> has a certain tan shade forming in certain areas...</li>
            <li> So now I have large orange shin, and the rest of my body is still transparent.   </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t say how far away to spray it, which I think is pretty important, can&#x27;t be too close or it will be drippy, and can&#x27;t be too far, because it won&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> I have had streaking on the back of my legs before, but its easily ex-foliated off and I should have been more careful.  </li>
            <li> it goes on with such a fine mist</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the spray tan at first, like all other tanning products.</li>
            <li> This tanner has such a fine mist that I really wasn&#x27;t worried.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with splotches &amp; stripes on my legs, because you can&#x27;t tell where or how much is being applied.  </li>
            <li> and it wasnt really getting all the spots on my body</li>
            <li> I am VERY anal about how my self tanner looks.</li>
            <li> But I really feel like the spray provides very even coverage.</li>
            <li> my favorite spray on tan, I never get globs of wet spray tan on me when using this product.</li>
            <li> I attribute that to spraying it too fast.</li>
            <li> I did the face fast because, again, I didn&#x27;t want an orange face.</li>
            <li> I attribute that to spraying it too fast.</li>
            <li> I did the face fast because, again, I didn&#x27;t want an orange face.</li>
            <li> I did the face fast because, again, I didn&#x27;t want an orange face.</li>
            <li> but if you added to much it got streaky.</li>
            <li> I spray my face as well and it looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I would suggest a real spray tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a very restricted budget and can&#x27;t afford a case of this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I have so much skin area that I needed a case of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It sprays well, way better than the neutrogena one that tries to copy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not sticky (unless you spray on way too much in one sitting).  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tan very well</li>
            <li> I am brunette with freckles, but get very tan in the summer</li>
            <li> Thanks folks - J</li>
            <li> Very blotchy.</li>
            <li> were not spotted thanks to doing it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Came out very well.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> but for real life... forget about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it had a color to it when spraying it on because it kept drying so fast</li>
            <li> so you dont have spray marks that are really close to your body</li>
            <li> I stood in the shower and tried to spray as evenly as possible and used a light coat on my face.</li>
            <li> : It doesn&#x27;t really work very well in terms of color strength, sometimes once it sets it still has a sticky finish to it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the spray.  </li>
            <li> I have hairy legs, applying the spray to my legs does absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and dries in a reasonable color.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is such an improvement over what was available a decade ago....</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> .. use too much and you WILL become orange...</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much luck with self tanners.</li>
            <li> I tend to apply it 3 times a week as the tan it provides is gradual, which comes in handy given that it has been rather inconsistently uneven in my experience with it</li>
            <li> However, so far, I seem to be able to hit everywhere evenly by the third day.</li>
            <li> i was a little nervous to go out right away until i got a more even apperance</li>
            <li> did she know I was trying my new L&#x27;Oreal tanning spray for the first time.</li>
            <li> Does give a decent LIGHT tan to very white people.</li>
            <li> I use other product for my face.  :)</li>
            <li> The color appears within an hour, like it says on the bottle, but if you apply a coat every day (after exfoliating) then after the first few applications you get a gorgeous bronze (not yellow) color.</li>
            <li> It dries instantly, keeps your hands clean and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> Finally a brand got the self tanners right!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately your \\&quot;tan\\&quot; will have a strong orange color instead of a nice bronze or brown color.</li>
            <li> the spray is really consistent, easy to hold down, and although you&#x27;d never use it as perfume, it smells</li>
            <li> Its not going to overpower your normal scents after it dries for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and did NOT spray my feet, hands, knees, or elbows.</li>
            <li> You only get about one full body coverage with this can.</li>
            <li> But I was able to scrub my feet and tone down the color to what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Positives: Complimented often, nobody has called me out on having a fake tan without me admitting it first, product is cheap, dries fast, and the product is safe for your skin.</li>
            <li> Enough of the spray floats down in the air to those areas that it will cover it nicely without looking obvious or having a huge color difference versus your legs.</li>
            <li> The color was a very natural bronze and not orange like most other self tanners.</li>
            <li> Less is more.</li>
            <li> Such a quick fix without turning orange.</li>
            <li> I rarely write negative reviews unless the product genuinely warrants it, and this does!</li>
            <li> The color is very natural looking, but not when it is really streaky...  </li>
            <li> #34;i used it yesterday &amp; got no results!!&amp;#34;- buildable is better in case you mess up somehow</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from it and decided to rub this in with my left hand while I sprayed with my right hand.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> My feet, elbows and knees were a lovely dark shade of brownish-orange!</li>
            <li> cons: goes on clear and you can&#x27;t see where it has been applied to, therefore making it easier to end up with streaking, says it has a \\&quot;scent\\&quot; to it when really it just smells like a self tanner    </li>
            <li> a tip - you really don&#x27;t need to directly spray your ankles and feet if using on your legs.</li>
            <li> Bought a few more cans for my upcoming trip to Vegas.</li>
            <li> I obviously don&#x27;t need this, but I have fun seeing the effects of stuff like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally landed on the L&#x27;Oreal spray, which sprays on clear, dries fairly quickly, and if you apply it evenly, tans evenly.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed color right away same day.</li>
            <li> (although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it right next to clothes or anything).</li>
            <li> &quot; right out of the blue.</li>
            <li> They are right, the mist falls enough to give you even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Make sure to let it dry for around 20 minutes before getting dressed or climbing into bed; I found on several occasions that my bra and panties were left with an orange tint as was my light blue bedding even after I thought I was more than dry enough to climb in!!!</li>
            <li> It went on pretty clean, a few streaks but nothing noticeable unless I pointed it out.</li>
            <li> I had a shopping date with my daughter and mother for school shoes and decided to give my new spray tanner a whirl before going out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be a new staple in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Brand new</li>
            <li> So I decided to try something new after reading reviews I went with this one.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that on my skin it takes a good 8+ hours to develop color</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly...</li>
            <li> Have used it daily for a full week and barely see any difference.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and find that it takes a couple applications to see results (which I think is much more natural looking than one layer of intense color).  </li>
            <li> I do not spray my feet or hands, as the spray lands on them anyway and ends up looking very natural.</li>
            <li> The color leaves a very natural looking glow, not orange or &amp;</li>
            <li> It looks very natural, not orangey at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I simply applied the spray directly there (the next day) and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very natural looking and even, it has a subtle scent and it works better than any spray tan I&#x27;ve ever gotton in a salon because I can highlight certain spots if I want (shoulders, etc</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the exact same.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the exact same.</li>
            <li> I also rubbed lightly with a towel over my knees and elbows to ensure that the tanner was not to dark in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Are these old bottles?!</li>
            <li> spray feet or hands, the excess will cover normally and naturally.  </li>
            <li> Take your time and evenly apply it everywhere, if you didn&#x27;t get it enough the first time, you can always try again tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work with my super pale skin (way too orange) but worked pretty well on my darker friend</li>
            <li> I usually seem to have a nice golden brown/very slightly orangish glow.</li>
            <li> I sprayed my face twice and within a few hours my skin was a pretty golden brown.</li>
            <li> I think the problem with the spray is that it goes uncontrollably everywhere, whereas with the lotion I control with my hand exactly where it goes, therefore avoiding sensitive areas such as the sides of my feet and knees.</li>
            <li> It looks better than the last custom spray I got, not as dark but it warmed me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: To blend in those larger tan spots I used pure acetone on a QTip to rub in the area and the spots lighten quite a bit or completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She began asking me all kinds of questions about the product (do you have to rub it in, does it smell, etc...) and was really excited to find out that it was a spray mist and dried pretty much instantly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, after MULTIPLE attempts to get this orange, terrible looking excuse for a &#x27;tan&#x27; off me... I was very unsuccessful and had to look like an umpa lumpa for my high school best friend&#x27;s wedding.. and I was wearing a satin mid thigh strapless to top it</li>
            <li> I went to use it and all it sprayed was clear, nothing happened.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear</li>
            <li> I got professionally airbrushed a week before I tried this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My professional airbrush tan was fading, so I decided to try and give it some help.  </li>
            <li> so i decided to give this a try it goes on fast and its very simple!!!</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old natural blond with lupus, an autoimmune disease that doesn&#x27;t allow me to stay in the sun.</li>
            <li> I suggest standing on an old rag, or else the bottom of your feet will turn orange.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT spray your hands or feet or they will be discolored (they will get color naturally from the excess spray falling on them).&lt;br</li>
            <li> only real downfall is that the smell isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;prettiest.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near</li>
            <li> The color is as close to natural as it comes and is not orange at all, not even in natural daylight.  </li>
            <li> I found that if I avoid anything that would cause exfoliation with my bath or shower the tan lasted longer (up to nearly 5 days.)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would completely recommend, and at $6 what a bargain.</li>
            <li> This deffinitly fixed that problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and keeps me from looking completely</li>
            <li> I picked this product up for 2 reasons, I can&#x27;t seem to tan naturally, or in a bed.</li>
            <li> strategy thus far...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve made it this far</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve made it this far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say these are old products being sold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan because my mom has gotten skin cancer from natural tanning</li>
            <li> It looks natural, not orange.</li>
            <li> then others like my legs were VERY spotty and even some on my back as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for some time because of it&#x27;s natural look.  </li>
            <li> if your using for full body have someone else spray you down</li>
            <li> Secondly, because I work out a lot, and tan skin shows more definition than deathly pale skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Pretty laughable, so definitely do not use if you have an important, bare-legs event coming up, or God forbid, try this stuff on your face if you haven&#x27;t experimented first!</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it I was worried because I looked really splotchy</li>
            <li> i was the airbrush tannning tech at a day spa for 2 years and so far this is by far the closest thing i have found to the actual $30 professional spray tans!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended alternative to skin cancer and pasty white legs.</li>
            <li> : Shower, dry myself carefully so as not to take off much of the color, air dry further, then apply again, paying special attention to places that I missed on Sunday (always seems to happen).&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday:</li>
            <li> All of it is caught by the hair, and when I go to the gym with pale white calves and a nice tan up top looks laughable, so I&#x27;ve taken a layer off my arms and legs with a shaver to see if this helps.</li>
            <li> My daughter jokingly said, \\&quot;Mom, now your hand matches your arm color.\\&quot; &lt;~I&#x27;m a medium complexioned black person, so please if you&#x27;re white or light DON&#x27;T do that rub barehanded.</li>
            <li> One mentioned that I looked orange (close friend who I assumed would mock me as soon as I began tanning, so he can be written off) and one coworker who mentioned that my face was a little streaky, probably due to me touching my face, mostly rubbing my eyes late at night before bed when I apply the stuff.</li>
            <li> Even after having it on for 12+ hours it did not leave a tan and the I really thought it would, just because of how dark it tints when you first apply it, but after I showered the next day...</li>
            <li> This not only dry very fast, it is also natural looking.</li>
            <li> I think maybe the first time I didn&#x27;t let it dry completely before I got dressed because one of the splotches was on the back of my leg where my shorts would have rubbed.</li>
            <li> only con to this is the smell, which I can live with for the price.  </li>
            <li> I remember putting it on, and waiting 6 whole hours for the stuff to dry.</li>
            <li> , TAN LAST SEVERAL DAYS, , FAST SERVICE.</li>
            <li> It takes a few hours to show up and a few days to build, but I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I used only very soft washcloths, liquid moisturizing body wash and avoided using anything abrasive (loofa or sponges.)  </li>
            <li> Even with my other spray-on tanners, I found myself giving a quick rub-in after it dried a little, just to make sure it was even.  </li>
            <li> My skin is LIGHT, and this is the only product that has a fine enough mist to help me augment my difficult to tan legs.</li>
            <li> its not extreme.  </li>
            <li> but my arms certain areas didnt take to it and through out half the next day my face looked really blochy</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get a ton of color in each application, but my theory is \\&quot;slow and steady wins</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I have had no luck with the product naturally settling on my hands, my hands are always shades whiter, and applying it lightly to my hands resulted in a dirt like effect from the knuckles down.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating is important (duh).</li>
            <li> But generally almost fool proof.</li>
            <li> I only look orange in soft lighting, such as my bedroom, and another reviewer is VERY CORRECT in saying that the sun makes the entire tan look different.</li>
            <li> When overused, this barely makes one look orange</li>
            <li> After I put on my body spray (about 45 mins after) I could barely even detect it.</li>
            <li> Especially on the feet (and I never sprayed directly on my feet.</li>
            <li> I like a healthy looking tan--but without the unhealthy results of sunshine.  </li>
            <li> You can kinda see the results after an hour but the true test of the color you&#x27;ll get will be a few hours later.</li>
            <li> This Bronzer is SO easy to put on- as it is in an airbrush type of bottle and you can spray it on your back and hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> First, I washed my hands and the water ran down my arms causing streaking.</li>
            <li> This dries quickly and there is very little streaking.  </li>
            <li> Its a no mess application and the color builds from daily applications and the color lasts.</li>
            <li> I looked like a hot mess</li>
            <li> The tanning effects are great (got several compliments on my tan!), but I found it a little tough to spray on without ending up with streaks/bare spots - you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;ve sprayed &amp; it takes a few hours for the color to really show.</li>
            <li> be very careful on how you apply it and how much product you apply.</li>
            <li> : You MUST go outside at some point the next morning to see what it looks like in natural lighting.</li>
            <li> I found that indoors you look completely tan with no splotches, but when I left work and went outside, I noticed that I missed a lot of areas on my legs.</li>
            <li> : You MUST go outside at some point the next morning to see what it looks like in natural lighting.</li>
            <li> I found that indoors you look completely tan with no splotches, but when I left work and went outside, I noticed that I missed a lot of areas on my legs.</li>
            <li> You can get some results for later the same evening if you do it early in the morning.</li>
            <li> First buy the dark deep one.  </li>
            <li> My knees have a large dark patch on front.</li>
            <li> so if you have a dark complexion you might not see much darkenening.</li>
            <li> (I know, obvious, but I have a natural inclination to flip it over when I&#x27;m doing my back and the back of my legs!).</li>
            <li> I tried a few days after the first time, just to even out the areas where there was seemingly no color, but I still have areas that look like there is nothing.  </li>
            <li> First off, when spraying it is very hard to tell what area you have sprayed and how much.</li>
            <li> It was not much more color than the Jergens stuff, but if you leave it on for about 8 hours it gives you just a little glow, if you are looking for more drastic color  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either, which in the past has bothered me with other products.</li>
            <li> and I guess i&#x27;m just too overweight as the whole bottle only managed to cover from my knee down.</li>
            <li> It only seems to work when you keep the can straight up and down.</li>
            <li> Lastly, and most importantly, I had some sort of reaction with my old spice deodorant and the spray that resulted in a red and painful rash under the armpits, the rash appeared under both arms on the same day, I read about it online, stopped using deodorant for a week (in case it was fungal) and it cleared up within a few days.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t bend legs more than 90 degrees for probably an hour, I have a line behind my knees, even though I waited until it felt dry to sit.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, although after a few hours it does begin to smell like all fake tanners but much more faint.  </li>
            <li> After several hours, I started noticing a little color, but really noticed the difference the next day.  </li>
            <li> Good or bad, the tan seems to last about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better at doing it, but it&#x27;s annoying to do everyday.  </li>
            <li> I let the first coat dry for a few minutes and then apply a second coat.</li>
            <li> and i got another tube of the other stuff i was useing which is jergens natural glow daily moistuizer</li>
            <li> It faded only slightly and again remained very natural</li>
            <li> Need quite a few applications to show a decent tan.  </li>
            <li> This also has the nozzle behind a small shield to protect your fingers from the spray, which I found to be a nice design.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING under the Sun as far as self tanners go- even the super expensive ones....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second..exfoliate your body during a shower at least BEFORE the first use and don&#x27;t lotion</li>
            <li> The lotion does not last that long - it will go bad&lt;</li>
            <li> So I heard the ladies at work talking about self spray tanning, and I thought to myself, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll show them no skin pigment, and not having the ability to go outside without a hat and jeans and a long sleeve shirt!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> How long does this stuff last?</li>
            <li> I tan and use a self tanning solution to get an even darker deeper long lasting tan and</li>
            <li> last long.</li>
            <li> I did three applications of this product on my legs, the first two applications were on back to back days, while the the third application was approximately three days after the second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spray up close or press hard on the nozzle trying to make it more of a &#x27;hard spray&#x27;.</li>
            <li> But then it just looks natural, too, like you have a slight strap mark like being in the sun would leave.</li>
            <li> Roughly a dozen people have asked me if I&#x27;ve been tanning over the last 2 weeks, and only two of them have mentioned negatives.</li>
            <li> I am normally very pale and can&#x27;t stay in the sun too much.</li>
            <li> I applied with small circular movements instead of a straight line application, let dry for 20 seconds, and then rubbed in The Body Shop&#x27;s Spa Wisdom</li>
            <li> spray your feet directly or they will look too dark though!</li>
            <li> I mainly use this for my legs, so it does fade unevenly since I shave my legs every day (to be expected).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very streaky and hard to identify where it was applied</li>
            <li> Now I get to cover my legs for a week, or however long it takes for this stuff to fade.  </li>
            <li> Just for the face, arms and neck area, one can lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> if I stayed too long in one area, parts of my leg would be darker than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if I stayed too long in one area, parts of my leg would be darker than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it applies evenly, as long as you hold it about 6 inches from your face</li>
            <li> I had streaks/lines of tan all over because the spray nozzle wasn&#x27;t wide enough).  </li>
            <li> I had to go buy a long skirt to wear to the wedding.</li>
            <li> I am not directly spraying my armpits.</li>
            <li> I am not directly spraying my armpits.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you apply it, check instruction and internet video about how to used, remenber also Instantly effects are applied not have to wait 2 or 3 hours to see effects</li>
            <li> I really do not like the sun that much, especially sun burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely knocking this product, becasue it does make you tan.</li>
            <li> Not only did my perfectly (newly) shaved legs have dark little dots on all my pores and hair root...</li>
            <li> I have tried twice to do this on my legs, the first time it came out very uneven, parts are dark and some parts have nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a big deal as no one should be looking at the bottom of my feet, but now I stand in the same place or spray half body in the bathroom, and move to another room to do the rest (although now I&#x27;m noticing my cream carpet in the guest bedroom</li>
            <li> The mist comes out so fine that it is really easy to build color without going overboard and foolproof because it is nearly impossible to get streaks!</li>
            <li> This seemed like a simple way to apply self-tanner without a giant mess or streaks...</li>
            <li> Normally I stay out of the sun and have a very pale complection all over.</li>
            <li> and they all lasted for that long!</li>
            <li> and I can feel it dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient to just spray after a shower and let dry while I put on my make up.  </li>
            <li> Just stand in front of a fan or something if you want it to dry faster.</li>
            <li> I waited 30 min to see it dry and</li>
            <li> I would spray after I showered at night and would let it dry for about 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Then when fully dry, I&#x27;d go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I always apply it in the shower after I&#x27;ve showered, exfoliated, and am completely dry.  </li>
            <li> FOREVER to dry.</li>
            <li> Everytime I would check to see if it was dry, it would smudge.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I exfoliated and did not sweat after applying it to my dry body.</li>
            <li> I showered, exfoliated, &amp; used the product, let it dry, &amp; went to bed.</li>
            <li> It was dry within seconds and there is no rubbing it</li>
            <li> Wait to dry.</li>
            <li> I get red and then go back to being pale.</li>
            <li> but this sprayer plugged up every single time.</li>
            <li> My feet did come out too dark but only because of my over spraying them.  </li>
            <li> so if I help another poor pale soul, then this will all be worth it!</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about this product is I feel like it lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, unlike some other sprays I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This spray is such a fine mist that it is almost impossible to cause streaks.</li>
            <li> I was previously using the loreal sublime bronze gel (that shows instant color)and</li>
            <li> showered, dried completely and had my husband spray me down.</li>
            <li> Because it goes on clear its hard to tell where you are putting it, that is why i spray 3 times, letting dry in between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spray itself seemed fine, but the smell drove my wife crazy.</li>
            <li> Gives you the extra glow you need when you have not been out in the sun or just want a little color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe, but I wish I had my white legs back.  </li>
            <li> small minor downside is it is not as deep of a color as I was hoping...</li>
            <li> Not what i expected</li>
            <li> Yes, it goes on clear, but if you apply it slowly &amp; at arms length, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with streaking.</li>
            <li> Those three products together were roughly $80.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> i am way too impatient to tan outside!!!</li>
            <li> You have to be careful around your feet and knees.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful spraying it because if you spray it too close to your skin, you can create streaks.</li>
            <li> It comes out in a clear mist and slowly develops color on your skin.</li>
            <li> Holding it about 8 to 10 inches away and not lingering very long and repeating several days in a row will help to diminish any streaking or tanning areas that don&#x27;t usually tan evenly (fingers, feet, underside of the arms)</li>
            <li> I have such pale skin</li>
            <li> and I was left as pale as I was to begin with.</li>
            <li> Ended up with patches of tan that took a while to wear off, this looked worse than the bright white legs I was hoping to cover.  :(</li>
            <li> just subtle natural glow.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try last weekend when a group of friends and I were attending a little black dress event.</li>
            <li> And a big plus to the product is there is VERY little smell to it when applying it</li>
            <li> The generic spray was much darker, didn&#x27;t leave random little spots from the sprayer like usual, and didn&#x27;t wipe off on my towel after showering the next day.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt streak like other tanners either.</li>
            <li> and then when it dries i put the other stuff on</li>
            <li> I read other reviews which recommended moving around</li>
            <li> With my other spray-on tanners, I would notice the smell in my office throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> In fact (after buying a 10 pack) she gave the other 9 bottles away at work (not to friends).</li>
            <li> I spray this over my face &amp; chest every other day, and I get lots of compliments about my glow &amp;</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a T and followed advice of other users put on lotion before yada yada.</li>
            <li> I did not spray my hands, feet or ankles and all the other reviewers</li>
            <li> Be careful of drips!</li>
            <li> I only had a few blotches but no strealing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just unsubscribed this product because it just doesn&#x27;t work that well compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the tanning lotions on hubby in the past and it took an entire week to see any result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used this a few days ago and it stays long.</li>
            <li> After two coats I feel like it does take a little while to dry all the way</li>
            <li> If you have never used a mist, be VERY careful.  </li>
            <li> I wore pants and long sleeves and scrubbed my skin raw on my feet and hands</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply evenly and looks yellow rather than tan!</li>
            <li> I tried both this one and a neutrogena product, and although the results were similar, the nozzle on the neutrogena was so hard to hold down that I had to take breaks to shake out the muscles in my hand.</li>
            <li> The product applies clear (the reason for 4 not 5 stars - would be SO much easier to see where you&#x27;re spraying to ensure even coverage), and the smell is not overwhelming or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Product not worth buying (unless you want orange feet).</li>
            <li> I either do two coats of medium over my face after a shower or one coat of dark.</li>
            <li> I used fingernail polish remover to remove the dark spot.</li>
            <li> You will have streaks or dark blotches..</li>
            <li> I just ordered Sun lab ultra dark tanning</li>
            <li> But in the bathroom, you should stand on a towel and wipe down the floors, walls, cabinets soon afterwards.  </li>
            <li> even sprays upside down.</li>
            <li> all the tinted stuff just washed down the drain</li>
            <li> It was what came down from spraying the rest of my body).</li>
            <li> I have less streaking with this product than I do with lotion.</li>
            <li> (I would forget a knee here...or half my calf there...).  </li>
            <li> At the end of the week I was patchy and didn&#x27;t know it until I went outside, I looked ridiculous.</li>
            <li> A warning though - it eventually does fade into the typical self-tanner smell, but it takes about an hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even less the equivilent of the fragrance of sunblock or suntan oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff ended up blotchy, uneven, and made me have dark freckles where I had none before.  </li>
            <li> Huge disappointment, even after doing everything \\&quot;right.\\&quot; Sad that Loreal can get by with selling such a product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what others are using or how, but this stuff created a mess.</li>
            <li> The results: dark streaks running up-down the front of my legs, and uneven tan throughout.</li>
            <li> I used this tanning spray in conjunction with laying out by the pool to get a richer tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st attempt&#x3D; uneven tanning because I didn&#x27;t put enough on and the can sprays larger droplets with the mist that created random tan spots.  </li>
            <li> and it does look a little too dark for my skin tone, but others not as pale as myself could probably get away with it.</li>
            <li> Your body is a little tacky for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I get results over time and can get as much or as little as I want.</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a little carried away because it came out streaky and patchy.</li>
            <li> It smells a little funky but it bronzes evenly and doesnt give the orange stains.</li>
            <li> I usually wear every other day on my face or every two days, makes me look tan all the time.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today my little girl was home after school about an hour or so</li>
            <li> A little goes a looooong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it stays tacky for a little while.</li>
            <li> 24 hours later, I tried to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; the mess, and made it worse.  </li>
            <li> you can see results within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> and I have to use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> I use it every few days to maintain the color.</li>
            <li> I had to take a shower from feeling a sticky, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Everyday  </li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t touch it, it dried in minutes, and I never even had to wash my hands after (let alone scrub with tons of soap to prevent orange fingers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After spraying, do not rub, it takes a few minutes to air-dry.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know if you missed a few spots or not.&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely blotchy.</li>
            <li> i sprayed a few layers on my face arms shoulders</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not one of those with a super-pale complexion that can&#x27;t tan without burning; I&#x27;m one of those that completely avoids the sun without sunscreen and wouldn&#x27;t use a tanning bed or booth if you paid me.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on something that didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> Casper-the-ghost-like if I haven&#x27;t seen sunlight in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This could be a deal breaker as I do not enjoy skipping on my deodorant.</li>
            <li> If at the end of your spray a few drops come out heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> spray on stuff can be uneven.</li>
            <li> It sprays evenly and dries quickly - No Streaks!</li>
            <li> I buy them in bulk on Amazon for about half of what they sell for in drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loves!</li>
            <li> Let me preface this but saying I am pale and I don&#x27;t tan.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed the creases inside my elbows tend to be darker as the skin touches when you bend at the elbow, this last application looked terrible, but I believe it was due to me holding the spray a little bit too close to my arms and applied it a bit too directly, my fault.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week twice a day an seen very little results.</li>
            <li> The mist is so fine you can&#x27;t see at all where it&#x27;s gone, and the color is so dark (and I used the Medium) that the streaks are horrific.  </li>
            <li> No joke that was the only giveaway the tan was fake.</li>
            <li> Why do they make the bottle so small?</li>
            <li> It has been an hour since applying and I am noticing a small glow.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of my usual spray-on tanner because it was cheaper and prime-eligible.  </li>
            <li> Sprays unevenly unless you have eight-foot arms!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for multiple years now and it never seems to fail me.  </li>
            <li> usually apply the product three times (three days in a row) to get the desired color.  </li>
            <li> However, I did have a small area just under my calf muscle on each leg</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four cans of this in the past two months-</li>
            <li> It created the most horrific streaks and splotches on my legs.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim at the end of the summer season last year from overly expensive Rite-Aid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews and really not sure why it didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of self tanners in the past, so I do know how to apply it.</li>
            <li> not really satisfied with the results...</li>
            <li> I usually use the spray Neutrogena tanner.  </li>
            <li> I have used sunless tanners in the past.</li>
            <li> My husband, however, doesn&#x27;t hold a tan well and is very pale.</li>
            <li> The product makes your skin slightly tacky for approximately 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I also avoided rubbing too hard with the towel afterward and used a blotting type motion to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did exfoliate and applied lotion before the spray.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell where it was going and the overspray made it hard to breathe.</li>
            <li> And this CAN give you that I wont lie, but it&#x27;s hard to get.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell where it&#x27;s going</li>
            <li> But I would suggest having someone spray it on for you for even coverage and hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> I think I saw somewhere that it claims to take at least 8 hours to take effect.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> Spray slowly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to figure out how to get this crap to fade fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> It lasts longer than other bronzers I&#x27;ve tried and it doesn&#x27;t come off weird or streaky.  </li>
            <li> and I do mean NEVER straks , runs or turns orange fwg</li>
            <li> realize I&#x27;m giving a crazy long review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the lotion for the last 10 years and was afraid to change it up and afraid of the horrible orange skin that comes with most self tanners.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the scent fades after a couple hours and you still end up smelling like self tanner.</li>
            <li> It is not nearly as good as the Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> Not truly horrible, but it was strange to smell like the beach in the middle of a workday.  </li>
            <li> so wearing shorts and being pale makes me a bit insecure.</li>
            <li> (Something I struggle with in other artificial tanners).</li>
            <li> Also I like to wear slippers while I spray it because if you step barefoot over the areas you were spraying, the soles of your feet get dark and kinda dirty</li>
            <li> I followed all of the directions given and have NOT experienced any streaking or \\&quot;splochiness\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> frustrating.</li>
            <li> It does fill the room with the spray, which is not a great smell, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my skin smelling like self tanner.</li>
            <li> As a result, I became so pale that I looked sick</li>
            <li> Very much wrong.</li>
            <li> It does have a disturbing smell afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of different products like this over the years that were horrible.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Dont feel as if there is any streaking or weird non tan lines anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> which can be a weird place.&lt;br /&gt;Feet</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> So I stick to the fake tans.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No need they might look weird and overtan if you do.</li>
            <li> and I hate when I&#x27;m pale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never wrote a negative review before, but felt I had to in this case. :(</li>
            <li> Worst, the sides of my feet got dark staining, making it embarrassing to wear sandals.</li>
            <li> Maybe not &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; to some people, but at least the glare is gone!!!</li>
            <li> I was afraid</li>
            <li> I was afraid</li>
            <li> So - like a crazy person</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look like I have something wrong with me!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> The spray also has an unpleasant smell after about fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> Very weird smell that I can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> it starts to wash off), and it&#x27;s impossible to get even coverage with the 10 seconds of spray they allow you</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I kinda like the smell, it isn&#x27;t too bad, and the smell fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It wasnt bad.</li>
            <li> a bad can - but save your money &amp; don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this product isn&#x27;t bad although the packaging lies.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like &#x27;citrus&#x27; like it says but the smell isn&#x27;t really bad.</li>
            <li> and she was shocked that it was a spray tan.</li>
            <li> I tried two applications and was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> boy was that a bad idea!</li>
            <li> This spray worked well to even out my tan lines, but worked terribly for my husband.</li>
            <li> Hate getting off the plane looking like Casper!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t horrible, either.  </li>
            <li> There is a smell, it isn&#x27;t horrible, but it is there.  </li>
            <li> Even after three separate coats it was blotchy and when it started fading away it looked awful</li>
            <li> This saves me the horrific time and experience of laying out in the sun and getting skin cancer.  </li>

            <li> WORK GREAT , TAN LAST SEVERAL DAYS, , FAST SERVICE.</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned, and have been happily using tanning products (lotions) for years.  If you have never used a mist, be VERY careful.  I ended up with splotches &amp; stripes on my legs, because you can&#x27;t tell where or how much is being applied.  24 hours later, I tried to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; the mess, and made it worse.  Now I get to cover my legs for a week, or however long it takes for this stuff to fade.  Pretty laughable, so definitely do not use if you have an important, bare-legs event coming up, or God forbid, try this stuff on your face if you haven&#x27;t experimented first!</li>
            <li> Ad said goes oneny, streaks. Very much wrong. Will try to fill in spots and see what happens. Not what i expected</li>
            <li> This spray worked well to even out my tan lines, but worked terribly for my husband. I have a deep tan already, so the spray just bronzed and evened out my tan. My husband, however, doesn&#x27;t hold a tan well and is very pale. This spray caused him to look blotchy, even after repeated and even applications. It also caused him to break out severely on his shoulders. We followed all of the directions on the bottle. The spray also has an unpleasant smell after about fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now.  I find a quick spritz after an exfoliating shower about every other day gives me a nice glow and natural, gradual build up of color when I go to FL in the winter.  Just for the face, arms and neck area, one can lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve tried it on my legs ...  would be better if a friend could help.  Holding it about 8 to 10 inches away and not lingering very long and repeating several days in a row will help to diminish any streaking or tanning areas that don&#x27;t usually tan evenly (fingers, feet, underside of the arms) when doing it yourself.  No obnoxious smell, easy to apply, and no orange color.</li>
            <li> Finally a self tanner that looks NATURAL on fair skin! It doesnt streak like other tanners either. Its a no mess application and the color builds from daily applications and the color lasts. Love it. Bought a few more cans for my upcoming trip to Vegas. Hate getting off the plane looking like Casper! Lol.</li>
            <li> I got professionally airbrushed a week before I tried this stuff.  My professional airbrush tan was fading, so I decided to try and give it some help.  This stuff ended up blotchy, uneven, and made me have dark freckles where I had none before.  I would never try this again.  Also, the smell is really, really strong.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it I was worried because I looked really splotchy and I had tried my best to apply it evenly. I think maybe the first time I didn&#x27;t let it dry completely before I got dressed because one of the splotches was on the back of my leg where my shorts would have rubbed. My sister recommended it to me and her skin looked really pretty so I kept using it. After the fourth application I thought it looked really good. It evened out and the color was nice. I&#x27;m very fair so if you have a dark complexion you might not see much darkenening. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and it still looks great.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff so much i just bought it yesterday from the place i work at and was willing to try it cuz before i was using a lotion tanner and it wasnt really getting all the spots on my body and i got this stuff and i got another tube of the other stuff i was useing which is jergens natural glow daily moistuizer and i put  this stuff on first and then when it dries i put the other stuff on and it looks great together ive never seen my body so tan in my life...will deffinutly buy this stuff again..</li>
            <li> I use this on my arms and decolletage.  I haven&#x27;t found a way to spray my legs that doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, so I use a different product on my legs.  I love that I can just spray it and go.  It dries within 5 minutes and I can feel it dry.  It&#x27;s so convenient to just spray after a shower and let dry while I put on my make up.  For the price, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Its a good product overall it does its job. However it dries pretty quick on your skin although it takes time to notice it penetrating be very careful on how you apply it and how much product you apply. It lasts for a good 1 week and while showering nothing really comes off. It does have a disturbing smell afterwards.</li>
            <li> i love the color it gives u might wanna buy 2 cans to maintain the color and be carefull with the bottom of your feet:)</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and looks likes a real, straight from the beach tan! However, I agree with Kathryn DO NOT spray on your feet or ankles! I made that mistake and ended up looking like the Aflac duck! No joke that was the only giveaway the tan was fake. I did find a cure to eventually get rid of my stained feet (although I am not advocating it) - nail polish remover. Yuck. Overall I loved the rest of the color of my body. BTW I did not use on face - I use Jergens for that.Good luck!</li>
            <li> I like a healthy looking tan--but without the unhealthy results of sunshine.  So this spray tan is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> I used this.  I am VERY anal about how my self tanner looks. It&#x27;s really the best I&#x27;ve ever used as far as going on evenly and color and smell. Also dries quickly so you can move on with your life.   OH, AND you dont have to rub it in at all!!!! no orange fingers!!!  Here is what I reccommend:    1.  shower and exfoliate knees, feet, elbows. etc.    2.  the bottle doesnt say to do this, but I have been and I think it helps the tan develop more evenly-- immediately following my shower I towel dried and applied lotion to whole body. arms and legs especially ankles, feet, knees, hands and elbows.      3.  Then immediately following the lotion I stepped into the shower and applied the spray- (stood in shower so i wouldnt get spray everywhere).  making sure I was keeping the bottle far enough away from my body to get even coverage and to move the bottle quickly.    DO NOT SPRAY YOUR FEET OR ANKLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  TRUST ME!!!!  You&#x27;re already spraying your upper body and the excess is falling onto your feet.  If you spray your ankles and feet like I did (the first time)  your feet will be a totally diff color than the rest of your body.  So I stopped spraying the ankles and feet and I&#x27;m looking goood!!!!!  Same goes for hands!         you can see results within a few hours.  also, not glittery.  just subtle natural glow.</li>
            <li> arrived as promised.  I love this product - perfect way to look like you have been at the beach for a week.</li>
            <li> I got this because my sister as it.  I totally recommend it.  I put my lotion on then spray away.  I use other product for my face.  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I am really white and I have to use it almost everyday or it looks streaky.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better at doing it, but it&#x27;s annoying to do everyday.  Does give a decent LIGHT tan to very white people.</li>
            <li> After trying several self tanning products, this is now my favorite. It gives a nice, natural looking tan.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, goes on quickly, and in my opinion, it smells better than most tanning products. After showering, I stand in my shower so the spray doesn&#x27;t get all over the bathroom. I start with my legs and spray in a quick, circular motion. I do not spray my feet or hands, as the spray lands on them anyway and ends up looking very natural. I let the first coat dry for a few minutes and then apply a second coat. I feel like the second coat helps for nice even coverage. If I missed a spot the first time I get a second chance to cover it up, lol. But I really feel like the spray provides very even coverage. I have less streaking with this product than I do with lotion. After two coats I feel like it does take a little while to dry all the way and that is key to getting a good, natural looking tan. Another thing I like about this product is I feel like it lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, unlike some other sprays I&#x27;ve tried.  Anyway, I think this is a great product for the price. Maybe an expensive spray is way better, but this is what my budget allows and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tanning sprays I have found.  I think the color goes on nicely. I have very pale skin and find that it takes a couple applications to see results (which I think is much more natural looking than one layer of intense color).  I always get compliments, especially when I tan my face (this is the best face tanner ever!! It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores).  I have had streaking on the back of my legs before, but its easily ex-foliated off and I should have been more careful.  One of the best parts about this spray is it works upside down and is easy to grip.</li>
            <li> Year after year I try self-tanner after self-tanner. I am so happy to have finally found one that works great! It&#x27;s inexpensive, easy to use &amp; I love the color. Yes, it goes on clear, but if you apply it slowly &amp; at arms length, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with streaking. It&#x27;s perfect, I have no cons whatsoever about this product. The color appears within an hour, like it says on the bottle, but if you apply a coat every day (after exfoliating) then after the first few applications you get a gorgeous bronze (not yellow) color. Such a wonderful product!!!</li>
            <li> This dries quickly and there is very little streaking.  You need to apply about twice a week to keep up the color but so far has worked great.</li>
            <li> Very weird smell that I can&#x27;t get rid of. The product does work well.</li>
            <li> I love the color and smell! I think it&#x27;s the best way to tan!</li>
            <li> my favorite spray on tan, I never get globs of wet spray tan on me when using this product.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this spray self tanner! I have tried EVERYTHING under the Sun as far as self tanners go- even the super expensive ones.... and I love this one the best. The color is natural, it sprays evenly and smells good too. I would highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I am a redhead so I don&#x27;t tan, ever. I&#x27;ve been using the Mystic Tan at the tanning place but it costs $25 bucks per use, does NOT last a week like they say (2 days TOPS, as soon as you take a shower it starts to wash off), and it&#x27;s impossible to get even coverage with the 10 seconds of spray they allow you - so you&#x27;re always streaky somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going on vacation in 2 days and of course I don&#x27;t want to look like Casper on the beach so I thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl based on the reviews. I, of course, had horror stories running through my mind of turning into an oompa loompa, but thankfully that didn&#x27;t happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I recommend spraying it on maybe an hour or two before bed. You can kinda see the results after an hour but the true test of the color you&#x27;ll get will be a few hours later. It&#x27;s easiest to do it before bed so you wake up tan! I read other reviews which recommended moving around so the spray didn&#x27;t collect on your feet. So I would spray my legs, and then move a foot. Spray my arms, move a foot. So on and so on. But I noticed by doing so, you were stepping in the tan that had fallen to the ground, thus resulting in oompa loompa feet. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal as no one should be looking at the bottom of my feet, but now I stand in the same place or spray half body in the bathroom, and move to another room to do the rest (although now I&#x27;m noticing my cream carpet in the guest bedroom has a certain tan shade forming in certain areas...whoops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Another review said not to spray hands or feet. I spray mine because I don&#x27;t like the cut off line on my wrist. I also spray the tops and sides of my feet. I just don&#x27;t linger too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you question whether to spray your face, I did it. I just made sure all my make up was off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Dries really quickly. Your body is a little tacky for about 5 minutes. Just stand in front of a fan or something if you want it to dry faster. If you&#x27;ve ever used the Mystic Tan it&#x27;s the exact same. Only with the Mystic you have to rub the excess off. There is NO RUBBING with this - so again, as another reviewer said, no tan palms :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS: You MUST go outside at some point the next morning to see what it looks like in natural lighting. I found that indoors you look completely tan with no splotches, but when I left work and went outside, I noticed that I missed a lot of areas on my legs. I attribute that to spraying it too fast. I was afraid if I stayed too long in one area, parts of my leg would be darker than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to add to the must dos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Make sure you look at your arms/legs/face in natural light.&lt;br /&gt;2) Take time to spray your face. I did the face fast because, again, I didn&#x27;t want an orange face. But you need to give it a good spray. Right now my face is like one shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and 1 good spray will last 4-5 days. I just reapply another coat once a week after the initial.he Mystic Tan it&#x27;s the exact same. Only with the Mystic you have to rub the excess off.

I just reapply another coat once a week after the initial.plied the spray tan again all over my body. I attempted to spray my legs better but this morning I noticed some white patches. So - like a crazy person - I stood outside my office building spraying my legs and taking MY TIME. I sprayed in perfect lines right down my legs a few times. Hopefully that does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to add to the must dos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Make sure you look at your arms/legs/face in natural light.&lt;br /&gt;2) Take time to spray your face. I did the face fast because, again, I didn&#x27;t want an orange face. But you need to give it a good spray. Right now my face is like one shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;3) While spraying, make sure you move around the room, but make sure you don&#x27;t just go back and forth between two spots. Big mistake. The bottoms of my feet are tan. But no one should be looking at the bottom of my feet so what do I care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize I&#x27;m giving a crazy long review but I&#x27;ve never been tan natually a day in my life so if I help another poor pale soul, then this will all be worth it!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but in the case of this product I have used for over 7 years, I felt compelled to!  Here is a summary of the top 10 reasons I love this product so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I can get a real tan on my body and use it to tan my face and the color matches to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Color develops quickly - with one spray on my face and neck, I get color within 3-5 hours, so if I am going out that night, I can apply it at noon, and the color is great by 5 pm.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It stays fresh.  I purchased 9 cans years ago, in fear it would be discontinued and they all lasted for that long! The lotion does not last that long - it will go bad&lt;br /&gt;4.  It allows-you to reach hard-to-reach places on your body (such as your back), because it is a spray, without anyone helping you!&lt;br /&gt;5.  It does not smell&lt;br /&gt;6.  It does not get on your hands&lt;br /&gt;7.  It is not orange in color&lt;br /&gt;8.  It delivers the same results as many department-store products&lt;br /&gt;9.  You do not need a bronzer to create an even tan....it applies evenly, as long as you hold it about 6 inches from your face and you go back and forth in an even manner.&lt;br /&gt;10. You can spray-on another layer to enhance the effect very easily, within an hour of applying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps you make your decision!</li>
            <li> I have tried the rub in Loreal brand it wasn&#x27;t bad but if you added to much it got streaky. This however is a perfect even coat and I noticed color right away same day. I use it every few days to maintain the color. Love it and will be tan all winter lol</li>
            <li> this product did not go on as promised.  I used it 2 or 3 times and did not see any results.  I ordered 2 cans because of the great reviews &amp; will not finish them</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I had to for this product because it is AMAZING!!!! I tried Neutrogena airbrush before trying the L&#x27;Oreal and the L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze was FAR superior. The mist comes out so fine that it is really easy to build color without going overboard and foolproof because it is nearly impossible to get streaks! The color was a very natural bronze and not orange like most other self tanners. The smell was actually really pleasant too! The only bad thing is that the scent fades after a couple hours and you still end up smelling like self tanner. Make sure you use lotion before to prevent streaking and continue to use lotion to prolong your tan!</li>
            <li> I spray tan in a booth once a week but after 2 or 3 days it wears off of my face. I can&#x27;t spray again because my body will look orange.  I bought this to try just for my face in between weekly sprays.  I sprayed my face twice and within a few hours my skin was a pretty golden brown. Actually a better color than I get from the booth.  No streaking or orange color. I will buy more and use this always.  No need to wear foundation. Only downside is it has no color so you must watch wear you spray and feel for it and make sure you&#x27;ve covered every area.</li>
            <li> This tanner was such a pleasant surprise!  I had been using St. Tropez body tanner and face tanner - which you also need a remover for, otherwise you will never get it off your hands.  Those three products together were roughly $80.&lt;br /&gt;Then I found out about this awesome product, which is under $10, and is FAR BETTER than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I was so excited to save so much money and still be satisfied with my tan!  The light mist seems to cover evenly and I had no streaking whatsoever.  I spray my face as well and it looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;The only con to this is the smell, which I can live with for the price.  It&#x27;s kind of musty smelling, not citrusy like the bottle says.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, great price.  Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much.  When I need a quick tan on my legs, this is the best way to get it.  Have been using this for a few years and it sprays on nice and even, easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even want to give it one star, I received the product timely but that didn&#x27;t matter. I went to use it and all it sprayed was clear, nothing happened. I waited 30 min to see it dry and any change, nothing! I had to take a shower from feeling a sticky, what a waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this product.  It streaks and does not give an even tan color.  I had to spray my legs over several days in spots to try and get even coverage and color.  I ended up using Neutregenia which even out the tone.</li>
            <li> Like how it goes on so easy</li>
            <li> It was not much more color than the Jergens stuff, but if you leave it on for about 8 hours it gives you just a little glow, if you are looking for more drastic color  I would suggest a real spray tan</li>
            <li> i am way too impatient to tan outside!!! so i decided to give this a try it goes on fast and its very simple!!! it works in about an hour which is great i can go to the mall right after using this and 3 hours later people will give me compliments on how tan i am makes me feel special:) oh i also tan very easily and no streaks!!! i LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t received yet but I&#x27;ve used before. Best self tanner.</li>
            <li> I like it, I used it and got a great tan color, but be careful with sweat and sun. Prolongated exposure to sun will darken the color and sweat may cause striking in the color.</li>
            <li> Product not worth buying (unless you want orange feet). Huge disappointment, even after doing everything \\&quot;right.\\&quot; Sad that Loreal can get by with selling such a product.</li>
            <li> Finally a brand got the self tanners right! Kuddos to L&#x27;Oreal! I have tried tons of different products like this over the years that were horrible. L&#x27;Oreal got it right with this product. The sprayer is what makes the product in my opinion. I can spray it evenly on every part of my body in any direction getting the perfect tan every time! The scent is light and doesn&#x27;t stink to high heaven days after using. I like that I get results over time and can get as much or as little as I want. Great job L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> I am a fairly overweight albino male and I&#x27;ve always longed to have the skin color of a navel orange. So I heard the ladies at work talking about self spray tanning, and I thought to myself, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll show them no skin pigment, and not having the ability to go outside without a hat and jeans and a long sleeve shirt!\\&quot;  I read the label and followed the instructions and I guess i&#x27;m just too overweight as the whole bottle only managed to cover from my knee down. Why do they make the bottle so small? So now I have large orange shin, and the rest of my body is still transparent.   How long does this stuff last? How many bottles will I need to cover the rest of my body? I&#x27;m on a very restricted budget and can&#x27;t afford a case of this stuff. Everyday  I look at my leg and think about all the tanned studs at the beach. I&#x27;ve never been to the beach because I can&#x27;t go in the direct sun light or I will burst into flames, but I can imagine what they look like from all the pics I&#x27;ve seen.  If you want to look orange and mysterious and weigh model skinny, then I guess this product is for you. I guess since I have no skin pigment my body absorbed all the tanning stuff and I have so much skin area that I needed a case of this stuff.  Good luck with your purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a light medium complexion and I tan easily. I use this to even out a tan or fill in untanned spot (like straps). It sprays well, way better than the neutrogena one that tries to copy it. The spray covers a larger area and I have not had an issue with any glopping or spotting or streaking (like having a darker streak because of the way the spray aims...I DID have this issue with the neutrogena one...I had streaks/lines of tan all over because the spray nozzle wasn&#x27;t wide enough).  I&#x27;m happy with this color and brand a would not switch. It dries fairly &amp;#34;quickly&amp;#34;, and definitely a lot quicker than the neutrogena one. It&#x27;s also not sticky (unless you spray on way too much in one sitting).  You do need to let the color develop overnight because you won&#x27;t get an accurate reading otherwise.  I would spray after I showered at night and would let it dry for about 1 hour. Then when fully dry, I&#x27;d go to bed.  Tip: You do need to watch where you spray it. I do it in the bathroom because I don&#x27;t want a tan carpet. But in the bathroom, you should stand on a towel and wipe down the floors, walls, cabinets soon afterwards.  Otherwise, you WILL see some residue building up.</li>
            <li> I bought this self spray tan about four hours ago for an event that is happening tonight. I followed all of the directions given and have NOT experienced any streaking or \\&quot;splochiness\\&quot;...It has been an hour since applying and I am noticing a small glow. This product does work but I would recommend using it gradually a couple days prior to the event you are using it for. I would recommend it..I only gave it four stars because it is a gradual build and not an instant tan.</li>
            <li> works great, very natural.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what others are using or how, but this stuff created a mess. I&#x27;m sitting here with blotchy skin. Can&#x27;t get it even. Thought it might be because I&#x27;m a man and it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well with hair, but I&#x27;ve noticed it still absorbs in hairy spots, but not in others. Grrrr. frustrating.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of my usual spray-on tanner because it was cheaper and prime-eligible.  Used it this morning and noticed two things right away:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It did not stink!  There was an odor, but it was not very strong and was kind of nice.  And it dissipated right away.  With my other spray-on tanners, I would notice the smell in my office throughout the day.  Not truly horrible, but it was strange to smell like the beach in the middle of a workday.  This one smells like NOTHING.  I&#x27;m so happy about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I didn&#x27;t have to rub it in.  Even with my other spray-on tanners, I found myself giving a quick rub-in after it dried a little, just to make sure it was even.  This tanner has such a fine mist that I really wasn&#x27;t worried.  So I didn&#x27;t touch it, it dried in minutes, and I never even had to wash my hands after (let alone scrub with tons of soap to prevent orange fingers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is lovely, the price is right, and the smell is--GONE.  Hurray!</li>
            <li> In all honesty this product is okay. I&#x27;ve used better self tanning sprays that gave better results faster. I tan and use a self tanning solution to get an even darker deeper long lasting tan and this product just didn&#x27;t work. I used it for a week twice a day an seen very little results. However this product has gotten a lot of good results this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I sprayed evenly on my legs and top of feet at 12-inch distance. The results: dark streaks running up-down the front of my legs, and uneven tan throughout. Worst, the sides of my feet got dark staining, making it embarrassing to wear sandals. My knees have a large dark patch on front. This is the first time I tried a spray, as I usually use sunless tanning lotion (L&#x27;oreal or Neutrogena), and never had a problem.  I think the problem with the spray is that it goes uncontrollably everywhere, whereas with the lotion I control with my hand exactly where it goes, therefore avoiding sensitive areas such as the sides of my feet and knees. I&#x27;m never using self spray tan again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It goes on very natural looking and even, it has a subtle scent and it works better than any spray tan I&#x27;ve ever gotton in a salon because I can highlight certain spots if I want (shoulders, etc) I even use it on my face and it looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I am a very.. very very fair skinned person and I can&#x27;t tan very well *more like burn* and have never had really great results from doing the lotion tanners. I decided to give this a try last weekend when a group of friends and I were attending a little black dress event. You know how it is, you want a little color, so I thought ok why not! Let me say that the color came out beautifully! I even let one of my girl friends try it! It was so easy to put on with no mess, no worries about your hands turning orange or your nails. For the night it looked awesome, but the next day I decided that I would try it again.. I may have gotten a little carried away because it came out streaky and patchy. I think had I had my husband help with the application it would have turned out a lot better, so Im going to give that a try next time!     pros: beautiful color, very easy to apply, no discoloring of hands/nails, easy hold bottle, fast dry, can carry it in purse if you wanted to, decently priced, fast coloring.     cons: goes on clear and you can&#x27;t see where it has been applied to, therefore making it easier to end up with streaking, says it has a \\&quot;scent\\&quot; to it when really it just smells like a self tanner    Overall I would recommend this product and look forward to using it more over the summer!</li>
            <li> I have tried different sunless tanners and I loved this one!  I had two problems, but probably because of my lack of knowledge of putting on sunless tanning sprays. First, I washed my hands and the water ran down my arms causing streaking. Now I know not to do this. And second, the tops of my feet got EXTRA tan!  This happened because I stood in one spot when spraying myself and the excess spray landed on the top of my feet. Now I move around a bit and problem is solved. For the most part, I spray this on my face a couple times a week so that my face looks tan and it is not extremely different from the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> As a self-tanner addict, I can tell you this is my favorite self tanner. It dries instantly, keeps your hands clean and doesn&#x27;t streak. Exfoliating is important (duh). I use this on my face without issue, too. I just spray it on after my moisturizer, wait 5-10 min, then apply makeup if its daytime. Like another person said, this is great for nighttime application and wake up tan! I prefer to use a self tanning lotion on my legs because this isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for after shaving. I use this over the lotion to ensure there are no streaks. I am super fair and two light coats or one heavy coat will give me a color I&#x27;m happy with. Maybe not &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; to some people, but at least the glare is gone!!! Lol</li>
            <li> Use liberally, it does not look orange at all. I am brunette with freckles, but get very tan in the summer and I hate when I&#x27;m pale. I either do two coats of medium over my face after a shower or one coat of dark. Highly recommended, best kept secret.</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old natural blond with lupus, an autoimmune disease that doesn&#x27;t allow me to stay in the sun. I grew up going to the beach every weekend from early morning until after dinner and had a beautiful dark tan when school started. I haven&#x27;t had that beautiful tan until the first time I purchased this product. I love it - doesn&#x27;t streak or look &amp;#34;orangish,&amp;#34; and is very natural looking. I get compliments on it all of the time. The nozzle allows even coverage on even the hardest areas to get to. DEFINITELY a deal!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with: I am VERY fair skinned.  Tanning beds make me burn, and that&#x27;s about it.  I&#x27;ve tried lotions (ie Jergens), and Neutrogena Micro-Mist Spray (VERY orange!).  I finally landed on the L&#x27;Oreal spray, which sprays on clear, dries fairly quickly, and if you apply it evenly, tans evenly.  I always apply it in the shower after I&#x27;ve showered, exfoliated, and am completely dry.  I suggest standing on an old rag, or else the bottom of your feet will turn orange.  After several hours, I started noticing a little color, but really noticed the difference the next day.  It took me several applications to get the hang of applying it evenly (I would forget a knee here...or half my calf there...).  Last time I applied it, I was paranoid and applied it twice, within an hour or two, and I was VERY happy with the results.  I mainly use this for my legs, so it does fade unevenly since I shave my legs every day (to be expected).  The smell isn&#x27;t horrible, either.  I think I am going to try the L&#x27;Oreal towelettes next.</li>
            <li> Worked well.  I was not tan at all so I went with the lighter version.  It takes a few hours to show up and a few days to build, but I really liked it.  If you hold the bottle to close to you while spraying, it will look blotchy.  But if you hold it away from your body, like the directions state, you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues.  The smell isn&#x27;t great, but I don&#x27;t know any tanners that smell good.  I just turn on the fan in my bathroom and spray away.  I would probably spray while standing in the shower or tub, because it does get on the floor and then if you step in it, the bottom of your feet won&#x27;t look so pretty.</li>
            <li> I was worried about streaks and looking orange.  This product did not do either.  My feet did come out too dark but only because of my over spraying them.  But I was able to scrub my feet and tone down the color to what I wanted.  I have a very fair complexion and even have trouble tanning in a bed.  This product has made it possible for me to have a nice, natural (but darker) color to my skin.  I love it and recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I first start using this product about 3 years ago. Before I used some creams, and some foams but they leave streaks. This not only dry very fast, it is also natural looking. I am normally very pale and can&#x27;t stay in the sun too much. I totally recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> The spray itself seemed fine, but the smell drove my wife crazy. In fact (after buying a 10 pack) she gave the other 9 bottles away at work (not to friends). She prefers the Neutrogena Deep MicroMist as it does not stink at all. This Loreal smell does stay with her all day, and honestly I can also smell it (but I am nice and say nothing). Thanks folks - J</li>
            <li> Sprays unevenly unless you have eight-foot arms! Very blotchy. May as well go bak to the eighties and use the first ever made.</li>
            <li> I spray this over my face &amp; chest every other day, and I get lots of compliments about my glow &amp; how refreshed I look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for multiple years now and it never seems to fail me.  My skin is naturally light (\\&quot;Ivory\\&quot; if we&#x27;re using Clinique foundation).  If I go into the sun for the first time in months, I will burn at first, but I can easily get tanned without overdoing it too soon.  The reason I use self-tanners is that I don&#x27;t like the effects of sun-damage but do not want to be the whitest person when traveling to Florida (from Boston).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply the product three times (three days in a row) to get the desired color.  You don&#x27;t get a ton of color in each application, but my theory is \\&quot;slow and steady wins the race.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t feel as if I look Orange like some people and attribute it in part to it not being too strong.  The first day I use it, I always exfoliate first.  You need to hold the can about a foot away from where your spraying and make sure that you pay attention to where you&#x27;ve sprayed (since you can&#x27;t see it going on).  If you aren&#x27;t paying attention, you could easily streak since you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;ve done.  Spray slowly and evenly.  DO NOT spray your hands or feet or they will be discolored (they will get color naturally from the excess spray falling on them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spraying, do not rub, it takes a few minutes to air-dry.  I always put a lotion on afterwards too.  I go to bed right after and have never had a problem with it getting on my sheets or clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real downfall is that the smell isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;prettiest.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s not the worst, but it&#x27;s not the best.  To me, it smells like waffles and syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the third application, I tend to spray myself once or twice a week to maintain the color.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer, and after only paying attention to rave reviews, I purchased it. It was all downhill from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-I kinda like the smell, it isn&#x27;t too bad, and the smell fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t make you orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Takes FOREVER to dry. I remember putting it on, and waiting 6 whole hours for the stuff to dry. Everytime I would check to see if it was dry, it would smudge.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t show up on your skin when applying, so you don&#x27;t know if you missed a few spots or not.&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely blotchy. I looked like I had a skin disease with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t last long. Went away after 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;-Not a lot of product in bottle. I got two uses out of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite tanner of all time. Goes on easy and turns a nice color. Not too expensive. Win Win Win.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. After having read reviews, got in the shower to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Worked great. Dont feel as if there is any streaking or weird non tan lines anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly consistent looking coverage all over - even under boob and butt cheeks...which can be a weird place.&lt;br /&gt;Feet were not spotted thanks to doing it in the shower. Lightly sprayed face and hoped for the best. Came out very well.&lt;br /&gt;Only small minor downside is it is not as deep of a color as I was hoping...but thats all good. Less is more. And i can layer it to get a deeper color I feel sure.</li>
            <li> It made me feel tan and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Even coverage, quick drying &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The tanning effects are great (got several compliments on my tan!), but I found it a little tough to spray on without ending up with streaks/bare spots - you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;ve sprayed &amp; it takes a few hours for the color to really show. I may have been holding it too close to my skin, but I ended up with tan/white stripes on my arms. Easy enough to fix with another coat, &amp; as I use it more I&#x27;m getting better at applying it evenly. Sometimes I will use regular/gradual tanning lotion shortly after spraying this on to make sure things are evened out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an &#x27;even tan&#x27;  for a short notice wedding.... boy was that a bad idea! I was impressed by the actual design of the packaging, I thought.. &#x27;Hey, theses guys know what they&#x27;re doing&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showered, dried completely and had my husband spray me down. We followed directions and he sprayed me down just perfect. We made sure to get every spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it took hours to show up and when it did... let me tell you... I was blotchy EVERYWHERE! Not only did my perfectly (newly) shaved legs have dark little dots on all my pores and hair root... but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after MULTIPLE attempts to get this orange, terrible looking excuse for a &#x27;tan&#x27; off me... I was very unsuccessful and had to look like an umpa lumpa for my high school best friend&#x27;s wedding.. and I was wearing a satin mid thigh strapless to top it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would be a great addition to your Snooki costume.. but for real life... forget about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is good thought. That was a plus, you do get what you pay for it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> I do not understand  how this stuff has so many good reviews. I bought it after a lot of searching and reading reccomdations and I felt confident this was a good choice. I tan very easily and well but was looking for an alternative to damaging tanning beds. This is not it! A couple hours after I applied this it looked good. Smooth, no splotches I was happy. I woke up this morning and my legs are orange, like burnt orange with splashes of stteaky brown. I followed the instructions to a T and followed advice of other users put on lotion before yada yada. Now I have to figure out how to get this crap to fade fast so I don&#x27;t look like I have something wrong with me!</li>
            <li> I like this product better than any instant tan. Goes on easy, you wake up the next morning and you have a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on sale at Rite Aid this week and was thrilled to try the top rated (CR) self tanning product.  I&#x27;ve got to say, it smelled nice, but the method of application just doesn&#x27;t work.  My legs are embarrassingly blotched.  It looks like orange/tan impetigo and since I haven&#x27;t been able to wash it off,  I don&#x27;t think I will be able to wear shorts for weeks.  It&#x27;s hard to believe, but I wish I had my white legs back.  Never again.</li>
            <li> This product really needs better directions... it doesn&#x27;t say how far away to spray it, which I think is pretty important, can&#x27;t be too close or it will be drippy, and can&#x27;t be too far, because it won&#x27;t do anything...  I have tried twice to do this on my legs, the first time it came out very uneven, parts are dark and some parts have nothing at all.  I tried a few days after the first time, just to even out the areas where there was seemingly no color, but I still have areas that look like there is nothing.  I don&#x27;t know what to do to get even coverage.  The color is very natural looking, but not when it is really streaky...  There is a smell, it isn&#x27;t horrible, but it is there.  I wouldn&#x27;t bend legs more than 90 degrees for probably an hour, I have a line behind my knees, even though I waited until it felt dry to sit.</li>
            <li> This is a nice spray that provides a deep color.  I only use it about once a week but I can see results.  You have to be careful around your feet and knees.  It does fill the room with the spray, which is not a great smell, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my skin smelling like self tanner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tan evenly.  Ended up with patches of tan that took a while to wear off, this looked worse than the bright white legs I was hoping to cover.  :(</li>
            <li> I exfoliated and did not sweat after applying it to my dry body. I looked like I had a skin disease. I wore pants and long sleeves and scrubbed my skin raw on my feet and hands so it wouldn&#x27;t show. It was quite yellowish, too.</li>
            <li> So I loved the Sublime Bronze instant tan stuff, forgot the exact name but it was a daily use thing, washed off with water, so I figured I&#x27;d try this airbrush thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the fact it was such a fine light mist, and it was so easy to apply myself. I wish it had a color to it when spraying it on because it kept drying so fast I&#x27;d forget where it was on. Anyways, I waited 2hrs and I got absolutley no color, so then I reapplied it again, spraying even more on, and waited, waited, woke up next day, still nothing!! I&#x27;m going to try it again and again till the bottle is gone, but I doubt things will change!</li>
            <li> I had been using the Neutrogena product and loved it. I saw this product on the shelf -- buy one get one free -- so I decided to try it. Streaks. It only seems to work when you keep the can straight up and down. I tried two applications and was extremely disappointed. I haven&#x27;t even used the second bottle. The only positive thing I can say is that I liked the smell compared to Neutrogena. But, in my experience, Neutrogena is the one to go for.</li>
            <li> Need quite a few applications to show a decent tan.  Probably would be best if someone was very fair or ghostly, but for medium tan naturally as I am, doesn&#x27;t show much difference.</li>
            <li> Sprays great, but no way of telling where you have sprayed it!  I started rubbing it in after spraying (even though it says not to) and that seems to keep me from streaking.  The smell is ok when sprayed, but after it is on for about an hour you get the strong &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and evenly but no way to see how much has been applied and is way toooo orange.</li>
            <li> i bought this product friday and exfoliated etc all the areas that should have special attn i sprayed a few layers on my face arms shoulders and it came out great perfect tan lines but my arms certain areas didnt take to it and through out half the next day my face looked really blochy i dont know if it was from the makeup that i had applied i also used a bronzer with it but its an awesome product ive showered a few times and i still have a tan like appearance and im not orange or oompa loompa looking my suggestion if your using for full body have someone else spray you down so you dont have spray marks that are really close to your body i would deff buy it again its more trail and error kind of thing i was a little nervous to go out right away until i got a more even apperance</li>
            <li> The mist is so fine you can&#x27;t see at all where it&#x27;s gone, and the color is so dark (and I used the Medium) that the streaks are horrific.  I&#x27;m going to have to wear pants until it wears off.</li>
            <li> I wish I could post a picture of my blotchy orange legs with the color dripping into my ankles.  Almost as funny as the excellent reviews this product got on a compare website.  Save your money and your dignity.  I had to go buy a long skirt to wear to the wedding. BTW this is not Dan but his wife my account, my order, my legs, my review, and viola amazon shows it as Dan.</li>
            <li> Works like advertised.  Lasts for days.  Best way to tan my legs.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, once you get the hang of it it is quite easy to use. As said before, DON&#x27;T SPRAY YOUR FEET!!!!  The excess from sprayng your body will fall on tops of your feet and trust me, they will still be pleny tan!  Overall good color and the more you use it the more even the tan becomes. Will be getting through subscribe and save for sure!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan at all. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not one of those with a super-pale complexion that can&#x27;t tan without burning; I&#x27;m one of those that completely avoids the sun without sunscreen and wouldn&#x27;t use a tanning bed or booth if you paid me. I have used spf on my face for decades but began using it anywhere that is exposed to the sun about 7 years ago.  As a result, I became so pale that I looked sick (but I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles! ;) As another reviewer has written, spray tanning at a salon is expensive when you do it on a regular basis and with the economy the way it is, I was looking for a cheaper and more convenient alternative that wouldn&#x27;t make me look or feel like an orange oompa loompa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it!  This spray is such a fine mist that it is almost impossible to cause streaks. The color is as close to natural as it comes and is not orange at all, not even in natural daylight.  The smell is pleasant, although after a few hours it does begin to smell like all fake tanners but much more faint.  It takes several hours to fully develop so I would also recommend using it at night an hour or two before bed.  It lasts several days! I found that if I avoid anything that would cause exfoliation with my bath or shower the tan lasted longer (up to nearly 5 days.)  I used only very soft washcloths, liquid moisturizing body wash and avoided using anything abrasive (loofa or sponges.)  I also avoided rubbing too hard with the towel afterward and used a blotting type motion to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did exfoliate and applied lotion before the spray.  I allowed the lotion to fully absorb into the skin before applying the tanner.  I stood in the shower and tried to spray as evenly as possible and used a light coat on my face. I did not spray my hands, feet or ankles and all the other reviewers are correct - you don&#x27;t need to. The spray falls from gravity and will cover those areas just fine.  However, I did have a small area just under my calf muscle on each leg thatwas white.  I simply applied the spray directly there (the next day) and it worked just fine.  After applying the spray, I rinsed the palms of my hands and soles of my feet and rubbed with water between fingers and toes, just to make sure there wasn&#x27;t any tanning solution there. I also rubbed lightly with a towel over my knees and elbows to ensure that the tanner was not to dark in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day two I noticed a spot on my wrist from the quick touch-up job I had done on my calves.  I used fingernail polish remover to remove the dark spot. It worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was extremely pleased with the results.  Yes, you have to take some extra time and follow the tips of other users if you want the best look possible, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great! Beautiful color. Be careful of drips!</li>
            <li> PROS: It smells pretty good, very convenient to apply, not too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It doesn&#x27;t really work very well in terms of color strength, sometimes once it sets it still has a sticky finish to it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product so I didn&#x27;t have to wear panty hose, mostly to avoid another bulge showing through my clothes. Or to just not have white legs in Capri season. I prefer another gel product for my upper back/arms. I get a nice medium natural color by using it on my legs two nights in a row. Some of it does get shaved off, but I&#x27;d say just 20%. I spray, spread and rub with my hand. Go to the next area, repeat. Even on the tops of my feet. it will tend to accumalate in spots, like on the heal of your foot, so just do one application there. You can get some results for later the same evening if you do it early in the morning. I think I saw somewhere that it claims to take at least 8 hours to take effect. Try not to have any shoe straps or bra straps, etc. rubbing right after because it will be lighter there. But then it just looks natural, too, like you have a slight strap mark like being in the sun would leave. You have to wash your hands right away afterwards. Just spraying doesn&#x27;t come out looking even.</li>
            <li> I get this on subscribe and save. Doesn&#x27;t streak, easy to apply, natural color as a result. Highly recommended alternative to skin cancer and pasty white legs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the spray.  I couldn&#x27;t tell where it was going and the overspray made it hard to breathe. Even after three separate coats it was blotchy and when it started fading away it looked awful and I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff off.  I recommend the Banana Boat lotion. Used it for years and it goes on streak free and when it starts to fade you can exfoliate it off and reapply.</li>
            <li> It smells a little funky but it bronzes evenly and doesnt give the orange stains. I perfer it 100x over lotions.</li>
            <li> I use this spray tan all the time. This is the perfect fix to being pale. Such a quick fix without turning orange.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work with my super pale skin (way too orange) but worked pretty well on my darker friend</li>
            <li> i was the airbrush tannning tech at a day spa for 2 years and so far this is by far the closest thing i have found to the actual $30 professional spray tans! it goes on with such a fine mist you almost think its not working but DON&#x27;T over spray because it doesn&#x27;t take much to give you a beautiful natural looking tan. My only complaint is that on my skin it takes a good 8+ hours to develop color so i have to schedule out when to spray myself if i want a noticeable tan for whatever i&#x27;m doing... but it does develop into a gorgeous color! And a big plus to the product is there is VERY little smell to it when applying it and none after it dries! which is very rare with sunless tanning products!</li>
            <li> Best one I have used hands down. Best part is that you can&#x27;t feel it or smell it very much at all. I like the color, does not turn orange on me at all. You do have to be careful spraying it because if you spray it too close to your skin, you can create streaks. It looks better than the last custom spray I got, not as dark but it warmed me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would completely recommend, and at $6 what a bargain. I can use it 4 times.</li>
            <li> Not even.  Runny. Did not like the color.</li>
            <li> When overused, this barely makes one look orange (Something I struggle with in other artificial tanners). Reasonable price for a good product. To spray arms and face daily is about 15 uses.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who received this product, used it, &amp; didn&#x27;t see ANY color appear?! Are these old bottles?! I showered, exfoliated, &amp; used the product, let it dry, &amp; went to bed. When I woke up, NOTHING! I used the WHOLE CAN on my legs &amp; NO color appeared!! Very displeased with this product! I wasted my money on something that didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the 360 sprayer hits every angle but unfortunately your \\&quot;tan\\&quot; will have a strong orange color instead of a nice bronze or brown color. Although the tan looks better the 3rd day its still orange not my favorite product out there. I wish the 360 sprayer was on all spray tans it works great</li>
            <li> First buy the dark deep one.  its not extreme.  spray yourself 3 times taking breaks in between and drying off with a blow dryer med heat.  Because it goes on clear its hard to tell where you are putting it, that is why i spray 3 times, letting dry in between.&lt;br /&gt;shower first exfoliate with a sugar scrub make sure you are completely dry before applying.  make sure you also shake can continuously.  I even sprayed my face and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;never spray feet or hands, the excess will cover normally and naturally.  in fact i put lots of lotion on my toe nails and then wash my hands and apply lotion right after to  my hands.  Not your body.  good luck.  Best self tanner yet at a low cost.</li>
            <li> I have to say this product is better than any sunless lotion I have used. My legs seem not to tan aswell as my upper body, so I gave this product a try. I used this sunless spray about 5 times in one day since it said in the directions use daily. I must have missunderstood.&lt;br /&gt;First I used my CT maximizer (california tan) lotion, its like a clear gel that smells great! I boughr this from my tanning salon for spray tams, to help prevent streaking from spray tans. I sprayed the sunless spray on my legs, &amp; the next morning they looked great! I only had a few blotches but no strealing! To fix the darker spots I used CT body buffer exfoliator w/ warm water on a wash cloth pressing lightly. This deffinitly fixed that problem.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use daily (as in 5times/day) seeming it came out tad orange, but eveb the Veraspa I use at my tanning salon has a orange tint aswell.&lt;br /&gt;I am fair skinned &amp; use tanning beds everyother day, but need more help from spray tans to reach a good tan color. I would deffinitly reccomend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Another til, spray tans at a salon cost me 15$, so 10$ on L&#x27;oreal sunless tan is much better for me! &amp; I can fix my mistakes of any blotching.</li>
            <li> It wasnt bad. It went on pretty clean, a few streaks but nothing noticeable unless I pointed it out. The final color was really great. The thing is you can tell its a spray tan. If your not gonna see people for a while, and you can say you&#x27;ve been tanning for a while its a great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four cans of this in the past two months- I get it with the subscribe and save program and since I also signed up for amazon mom, I&#x27;ve been getting 20% off all my subscribe and save products.  I&#x27;ve just unsubscribed this product because it just doesn&#x27;t work that well compared to other brands.  I realized how underwhelmed I was with it after buying a store brand self tanner while out of town.  The generic spray was much darker, didn&#x27;t leave random little spots from the sprayer like usual, and didn&#x27;t wipe off on my towel after showering the next day.  I&#x27;ve noticed that not every can works the same- one can I received just didn&#x27;t work at all.  I have to apply this product daily to maintain the color, and the generic Walgreens tanner lasted days longer.  I did not have any problems with this product before this summer, so I&#x27;m wondering if L&#x27;Oreal changed the formula to something that just doesn&#x27;t agree with my chemistry.  Regardless, I&#x27;m back on the hunt for a different tanner.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; airbrush tan. It goes on evenly and keeps me from looking completely Casper-the-ghost-like if I haven&#x27;t seen sunlight in a few weeks. It it somewhat &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; looking so keep that in mind if that&#x27;s not a look you like. Don&#x27;t flip the bottle over when you go to apply it; it stops working pretty quickly if you do that! (I know, obvious, but I have a natural inclination to flip it over when I&#x27;m doing my back and the back of my legs!). I think I managed to get 4 or 5 uses out of it before the bottle ran out.</li>
            <li> I picked this product up for 2 reasons, I can&#x27;t seem to tan naturally, or in a bed. Period. English/Irish/German mix. Secondly, because I work out a lot, and tan skin shows more definition than deathly pale skin like mine. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks. I tend to apply it 3 times a week as the tan it provides is gradual, which comes in handy given that it has been rather inconsistently uneven in my experience with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My strategy thus far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday: Shower, and exfoliate THOROUGHLY. I&#x27;m talking all of the color, all of the way off, starting fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Monday: Shower, dry myself carefully so as not to take off much of the color, air dry further, then apply again, paying special attention to places that I missed on Sunday (always seems to happen).&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday: Repeat Mondays process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of Tuesday I usually seem to have a nice golden brown/very slightly orangish glow. I only look orange in soft lighting, such as my bedroom, and another reviewer is VERY CORRECT in saying that the sun makes the entire tan look different. However, so far, I seem to be able to hit everywhere evenly by the third day. Roughly a dozen people have asked me if I&#x27;ve been tanning over the last 2 weeks, and only two of them have mentioned negatives. One mentioned that I looked orange (close friend who I assumed would mock me as soon as I began tanning, so he can be written off) and one coworker who mentioned that my face was a little streaky, probably due to me touching my face, mostly rubbing my eyes late at night before bed when I apply the stuff. I will likely also spread out the applications to a day between. At the end of the week I was patchy and didn&#x27;t know it until I went outside, I looked ridiculous. All in all, I am fairly satisfied with the product. I will be much happier with it when I can find a method to apply it evenly, on a consistent basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I&#x27;m overly thorough but, here are some key points.&lt;br /&gt;Positives: Complimented often, nobody has called me out on having a fake tan without me admitting it first, product is cheap, dries fast, and the product is safe for your skin. No aging for this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: There are a lot, but I don&#x27;t think the product is un-savable. It can be tricky to put on evenly (I do it myself with no help) I have noticed the creases inside my elbows tend to be darker as the skin touches when you bend at the elbow, this last application looked terrible, but I believe it was due to me holding the spray a little bit too close to my arms and applied it a bit too directly, my fault. Unlike other reviewers, I have had no luck with the product naturally settling on my hands, my hands are always shades whiter, and applying it lightly to my hands resulted in a dirt like effect from the knuckles down. I am a guy. I have hairy legs, applying the spray to my legs does absolutely NOTHING. All of it is caught by the hair, and when I go to the gym with pale white calves and a nice tan up top looks laughable, so I&#x27;ve taken a layer off my arms and legs with a shaver to see if this helps. Lastly, and most importantly, I had some sort of reaction with my old spice deodorant and the spray that resulted in a red and painful rash under the armpits, the rash appeared under both arms on the same day, I read about it online, stopped using deodorant for a week (in case it was fungal) and it cleared up within a few days. This could be a deal breaker as I do not enjoy skipping on my deodorant. I have noticed the color rubbing off on the inside of my clothes in areas where I sweat, mostly the neck and upper shoulders, as well as the fact that a lady friend of mine had the color rub off on her hands when she gave me a neck rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I think the product has potential, and I believe that most of the negatives can be negated by more careful preparation and application. I will continue to use it a bit longer to see if I can&#x27;t roll out the issues. The rash issue again may be a deal breaker, but hopefully I can avoid it by showering, applying, and then applying the deodorant in the morning when the spray should be completely absorbed, keep in mind I am not directly spraying my armpits. If you&#x27;ve made it this far I&#x27;m sure you appreciate the detail, I for one do not buy and apply a product that I don&#x27;t thoroughly understand beforehand. If I remember, I&#x27;ll make an update detailing whether or not I find a way to apply it more evenly.

            <li> This stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found. Goes on evenly and dries in a reasonable color.</li>
            <li> This tanner sprays evenly, dries quickly, and leaves a subtle tan. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either, which in the past has bothered me with other products. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Great spray mechanism.  Provides excellent coverage.  No orange color.  Purchased at a great price with superfast shipping.  Will continue with this brand.  A+++</li>
            <li> This Bronzer is SO easy to put on- as it is in an airbrush type of bottle and you can spray it on your back and hard to reach spots.  I also love that this bronzer doesn&#x27;t get my hands all yucky like most lotions do.  This bronzer has gone on very smoothly for me and it doesn&#x27;t streak.  It lasts longer than other bronzers I&#x27;ve tried and it doesn&#x27;t come off weird or streaky.  Mainly I love the convenience of this bronzer because you can spray it on you and let it dry (which it does quickly) and be on your way!  There isn&#x27;t any rubbing in or scrubbing your hands afterwords to make sure they don&#x27;t get stained from the bronzer.  I was also nervous before trying this bronzer that it might spray all over my bathroom but it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve even done it in my carpeted room on my legs before heading out and I haven&#x27;t noticed it getting on anything (although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it right next to clothes or anything).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you color right away. I saw color 24 hours later &amp; the color that I did gain went away in two days. You only get about one full body coverage with this can. NOT WORTH IT!!</li>
            <li> You can not control how it apply s. If at the end of your spray a few drops come out heavy. You will have streaks or dark blotches.. USE LOTION for even application..</li>
            <li> TURNS ORANGE AND BLOTCHY!</li>
            <li> It has great coloring but leaves a lot of streaks ..and read the other reviews do not sprat ur hands or feet I looked like a hot mess lol try on the weekend with no plans lol ..or just do the nest best buy it in the lotion ..much better and goes on even still streaks if not careful..must use gloves ...and if u buy this do itself a favor and make sure u rub it in good do not just spray and leave</li>
            <li> I bought this to get some tan before going on vacation so I wouldn&#x27;t be two toned. It takes more then two sprays for it to work but it does work. I would tell people to buy this product</li>
            <li> Love this self tanner, bought online because did not find it on my local stores. Would buy again. Gives you the extra glow you need when you have not been out in the sun or just want a little color. I usually wear every other day on my face or every two days, makes me look tan all the time.</li>
            <li> Left me with streaks and discolored all over, I will never buy this stuff again. I just ordered Sun lab ultra dark tanning and im gonna try that out next wish me luck</li>
            <li> This is such an improvement over what was available a decade ago....the spray is really consistent, easy to hold down, and although you&#x27;d never use it as perfume, it smells so-o-o-o much better than the old stuff. I tried both this one and a neutrogena product, and although the results were similar, the nozzle on the neutrogena was so hard to hold down that I had to take breaks to shake out the muscles in my hand. This also has the nozzle behind a small shield to protect your fingers from the spray, which I found to be a nice design.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use this again.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you apply it, check instruction and internet video about how to used, remenber also Instantly effects are applied not have to wait 2 or 3 hours to see effects</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned (not porcelain but definitely light) and this is one of the better self-tanner products I&#x27;ve used. The color leaves a very natural looking glow, not orange or &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; noticeable that others know I&#x27;ve been using self tanner. I did three applications of this product on my legs, the first two applications were on back to back days, while the the third application was approximately three days after the second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this product is very easy, you just hold it about 12in from the desired area and spray; the can will spray evenly upside-down and sideways too! The product applies clear (the reason for 4 not 5 stars - would be SO much easier to see where you&#x27;re spraying to ensure even coverage), and the smell is not overwhelming or unpleasant. The product makes your skin slightly tacky for approximately 5-10 minutes. A warning though - it eventually does fade into the typical self-tanner smell, but it takes about an hour. So, I would recommend applying before bed and rinsing off in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first application turned out a little streaky, but the second covered it up pretty good to a nice colored &amp; even application. I risked it and did a third application and it does look a little too dark for my skin tone, but others not as pale as myself could probably get away with it. However, it does not look streaky or orange. Side note - even with 3 applications on my legs, I still have some use left in the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip - you really don&#x27;t need to directly spray your ankles and feet if using on your legs. Enough of the spray floats down in the air to those areas that it will cover it nicely without looking obvious or having a huge color difference versus your legs. I would assume this would be the same for your hands.</li>
            <li> Bought this because we&#x27;re leaving for a cruise in Dec and wanted to test out diff brands before taking off. I&#x27;m alrdy tan but I knw when winter comes I sure wont be. This spay covers great and yes gives u color but for me it&#x27;s just 1 shade darker, and personally I would like to be darker. More then likely will either try the darker version or another brand.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have such pale skin, I use it almost like pray on pantyhose when I wear dresses lol. Perfect even coverage, and doesn&#x27;t fade in any weird pattern. LOVE it, and will probably be a life time user. I love the way tan skin looks! But am anti tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Arrived and sprayer works great unlike another distributors spray product I ordered for less cost. Used this already for my vitaligo (no skin pigment) to give my skin a health appearance and need. If the cost is lowered or remains low I&#x27;ll order again from this distributor. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love the tan that I got from this product but make sure to be in a very WELL ventilated area when using it. It left a yellow orange tint all over my bathroom floor (which wiped off rather easily) but make sure to remove any floor rugs or the shower curtain if you are in close proximity. I would also turn the ceiling fan on to lessen the strong fumes! Make sure to let it dry for around 20 minutes before getting dressed or climbing into bed; I found on several occasions that my bra and panties were left with an orange tint as was my light blue bedding even after I thought I was more than dry enough to climb in!!!</li>
            <li> i have zero complaints. sprays evenly, smells...different (wink wink) but not terrible, u can BUILD the color- ppl shouldnt say &amp;#34;i used it yesterday &amp; got no results!!&amp;#34;- buildable is better in case you mess up somehow or you dont like the color.. use too much and you WILL become orange...BUILD IT :)</li>
            <li> I rarely write negative reviews unless the product genuinely warrants it, and this does! I will NEVER buy again! It is hard to apply evenly and looks yellow rather than tan!</li>
            <li> My feet, elbows and knees were a lovely dark shade of brownish-orange! Thank you. The rest of me remains Irish white. Even followed the instructions.</li>
            <li> I had a shopping date with my daughter and mother for school shoes and decided to give my new spray tanner a whirl before going out. After about an hour out together my mom complimented my skin and said I looked really pretty. \\&quot;You got some sun, you look great!\\&quot; Little did she know I was trying my new L&#x27;Oreal tanning spray for the first time. I told her what I was using and she was shocked that it was a spray tan. She began asking me all kinds of questions about the product (do you have to rub it in, does it smell, etc...) and was really excited to find out that it was a spray mist and dried pretty much instantly. She&#x27;s running out to get some for herself! She remarked how nice my skin looked and it didn&#x27;t look fake. She said she couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between my L&#x27;Oreal tan and a suntan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today my little girl was home after school about an hour or so and she said \\&quot;Mom you look GOOD!\\&quot; \\&quot;Your tan looks good!\\&quot; right out of the blue. It was another really great compliment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM SO HAPPY with this product. I don&#x27;t tan...I burn. Normally I stay out of the sun and have a very pale complection all over. I considered going to a salon for spray tanning but because we&#x27;re pinching pennies right now it was something I was going to need to put on hold. I thought I&#x27;d risk a few dollars to see if L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s product would be a good alternative(and a way to spare my modesty...LOL). I&#x27;m so glad I took the risk. It&#x27;s worth every penny. It&#x27;s going to be a new staple in my beauty regimen. Now I look like I have a nice glow all over. Not too much, just a nice sun kissed glow. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This goes on in a light mist. Don&#x27;t spray up close or press hard on the nozzle trying to make it more of a &#x27;hard spray&#x27;. It falls lightly on the skin. A little goes a looooong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This is not an \\&quot;insta-tan\\&quot; product. It comes out in a clear mist and slowly develops color on your skin. I was able to see a nice glow within an hour and as time went on it developed very nicely and naturally. This is one of my favorite aspects because there was no shocking fake made-up looking color, just a nice glow that developed into a great tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light. Admittedly it&#x27;s not my favorite, but it fades pretty quickly. It&#x27;s even less the equivilent of the fragrance of sunblock or suntan oil. After I put on my body spray (about 45 mins after) I could barely even detect it. Its not going to overpower your normal scents after it dries for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and did NOT spray my feet, hands, knees, or elbows. They are right, the mist falls enough to give you even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did spray quickly and lightly on my face and neckline and its given me a very satisfying natural looking color. I did my normal facial cleansing routine tonight and the color stayed nicely without any streaking. It faded only slightly and again remained very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also... another nice detail...no residue color on my clothes or on my bedsheets overnight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a KEEPER.</li>
            <li> goes on evenly. even sprays upside down.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a simple way to apply self-tanner without a giant mess or streaks...WRONG! I tried this once and immediately threw it away. It created the most horrific streaks and splotches on my legs. It&#x27;s almost like it sputtered out and left a lasting mark. Good or bad, the tan seems to last about a week. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s nice if it looks good, but a week is very painful when your legs splotchy and orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard and read great things about this product but mine showed NO COLOR. I even sprayed it on a white towel and no color. I&#x27;d say these are old products being sold. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> My skin is LIGHT, and this is the only product that has a fine enough mist to help me augment my difficult to tan legs. It&#x27;s worth every penny! Finest mist I&#x27;ve ever found. Great stuff, nice color - no orangeyness - and super super fine application. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I like this self tanner.  For one, the application process is super easy!  It give a nice light color, if your looking a little natural color this is great.  I have even used it on my face and it didn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Why more people d o not invest a few dollars into this product, is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;Having a nice tan look to your face and arms in thw winter helps you look healthier and often if you look healthier, you&#x27;ll increase your desire to be healthier.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to keep that funeral director paled complexion where everyone passing by your casket says, &amp;#34;Oh doesn&#x27;t he look natural?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Jesus Katy Key rice think about that comment--then buy tL&#x27;Oreal Sublime&lt;br /&gt;Artistically yours,&lt;br /&gt;Francisps It never and I do mean NEVER straks , runs or turns orange fwg</li>
            <li> Color is good, but not enough aerosol in can. Brand new it sputters, lucky if it sprays 8 inches. Maybe I got a bad can - but save your money &amp; don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> This saves me the horrific time and experience of laying out in the sun and getting skin cancer.  I really do not like the sun that much, especially sun burn.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim at the end of the summer season last year from overly expensive Rite-Aid.  If you&#x27;ve ever read my reviews, you&#x27;ll know I obviously don&#x27;t need this, but I have fun seeing the effects of stuff like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ginger husband and eldest daughter are very fair skinned.  I pulled this out and decided to see what it had.  I&#x27;ve used the tanning lotions on hubby in the past and it took an entire week to see any result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First...good people you need a kind friend to spray this stuff on you.  Based on reviews I&#x27;m reading, not having help is a no no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second..exfoliate your body during a shower at least BEFORE the first use and don&#x27;t lotion up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third..Don&#x27;t trust the \\&quot;no rub\\&quot; bit.  I didn&#x27;t expect much from it and decided to rub this in with my left hand while I sprayed with my right hand.  I&#x27;ll be using a glove from now on because I have a left hand that&#x27;s the same color of the skin running up the inside of my arm.  My daughter jokingly said, \\&quot;Mom, now your hand matches your arm color.\\&quot; &lt;~I&#x27;m a medium complexioned black person, so please if you&#x27;re white or light DON&#x27;T do that rub barehanded. My husband has a lovely none orange tan going after one application!  He doesn&#x27;t tan, but instead turns red; even his neck is a brown shade now.  I&#x27;m still sporting a brown palm after being in shampoo, lotion, dish liquid, etc.  Husband works in hot conditions and after sweating he was still tanned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOURTH:  Do stand in front of a fan afterwards like someone else said.  You&#x27;ll be a bit damp feeling. We did his tan about 2hrs before bed.  No signs of coloring on anything like bedding or clothes so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m writing a review right now is because my husband texted asking if I was going to spray tan him this evening to get a bit darker and I&#x27;m on the hunt for more of this product.  He&#x27;s looking forward to looking tan at the pool. Personally, porcelain or dark at the pool is gorgeous, but I&#x27;m all forwhat makes someone else more confident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews and really not sure why it didn&#x27;t do a thing. Because my only thought is &amp;#34;This stuff is J-U-N-K&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used lots of self tanners in the past, so I do know how to apply it. Even after having it on for 12+ hours it did not leave a tan and the I really thought it would, just because of how dark it tints when you first apply it, but after I showered the next day...nothing...all the tinted stuff just washed down the drain and I was left as pale as I was to begin with. I used it for 4 days in a row this way and still...nothing. I&#x27;ve never wrote a negative review before, but felt I had to in this case. :(</li>
            <li> A touch better than Neutrogena&#x27;s spray tan, but I&#x27;m telling you, good results are hard to come by.  Stick with a lotion form of sunless tanner and you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li> fades after 2-3 days but does the job for events etc..</li>
            <li> not really satisfied with the results...</li>
            <li> Product works great...but the company L&#x27;Oreal has become too Liberal for me and has lost my business.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better sunless tanners.  It sprays evenly and dries quickly - No Streaks!</li>
            <li> did streak... did turn orange ....dissapointing going back to sally hansen airbrush legs..!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the spray tan at first, like all other tanning products. I&#x27;ve used the lotion for the last 10 years and was afraid to change it up and afraid of the horrible orange skin that comes with most self tanners. And this CAN give you that I wont lie, but it&#x27;s hard to get.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice now and have a nice glowing tan. A warmer color. I can tan, I&#x27;m Native American, but I don&#x27;t tan because my mom has gotten skin cancer from natural tanning and I don&#x27;t want that to happen to me. So I stick to the fake tans.&lt;br /&gt;I used this a few days ago and it stays long. It goes on easily but unfortunately my first time I didn&#x27;t do such a great job. I got patches that were darker and some were lighter. Since you can&#x27;t see it you will wonder \\&quot;well did I get that spot good enough?\\&quot; and you will hit that spot again. Don&#x27;t do it! I have patches because I sprayed extra in some spots thinking I didn&#x27;t get it good enough. Take your time and evenly apply it everywhere, if you didn&#x27;t get it enough the first time, you can always try again tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the replies said to not spray your feet, I did. And TRUST THE REVIEWS! My tops of the feet aren&#x27;t orange but they are about 3 shades darker than the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;The only part that turned orange on me were the bottoms of my feet from moving around and the spray settling on the floor. So my feet bottoms are super orange but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;There were NO streaks, only blotches from where I did and extra spray to \\&quot;make sure I got everything\\&quot;. Luckily I had 4 days off work so I have time to scrub it off and even it out.&lt;br /&gt;Go with this spray, it works great, but trust the reviews! They don&#x27;t lie, and they know what they are talking about</li>
            <li> I usually use the spray Neutrogena tanner.  It&#x27;s winterband I can&#x27;t get it now, so I got this.  It is not nearly as good as the Neutrogena.  I will stock up on it next summer.</li>
            <li> After spraying you could not tell you had even used the spray.  I used it several times and it did not work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use to go to tanning salons quite often and since I know they are harmful I started trying different self tanners. I was previously using the loreal sublime bronze gel (that shows instant color)and while I liked it quite a bit it did at times make me feel \\&quot;orange\\&quot; but overall it was a good product. This one is even better in my opinion. The spray is a very fine mist that goes on lightly and dries instantly. It was dry within seconds and there is no rubbing it it it just dries on it&#x27;s own. I also put a light spritz on my face before bed and woke up looking like I had been kissed by the sun on a beach. No product is going to be 100% perfection but this one is pretty close. I would defiantly buy this again.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this but saying I am pale and I don&#x27;t tan. I get red and then go back to being pale. I am also chubby so wearing shorts and being pale makes me a bit insecure. I&#x27;ve never had much luck with self tanners. The lotions never go on evenly and everything else is just orange. I will also say this isn&#x27;t the product I meant to buy, I meant to get the mousse as a girl at work says she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this product isn&#x27;t bad although the packaging lies. It doesn&#x27;t smell like &#x27;citrus&#x27; like it says but the smell isn&#x27;t really bad. It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly...well it kind of does but it stays tacky for a little while. It also doesn&#x27;t develop in an hour. More like 5+. It goes on clear so it&#x27;s hard to tell where it&#x27;s going which means you&#x27;re likely to put it on patchy. I recommend doing it on a day you have nothing to do, starting in the morning and keeping an eye on it. The colour is nice though and very easy to build up. It looks natural, not orange. I can&#x27;t wait to try the mousse!</li>
            <li> I have used sunless tanners in the past. So I decided to try something new after reading reviews I went with this one. First off, when spraying it is very hard to tell what area you have sprayed and how much. I did everything they said to do before hand -shower/ exfoliate and when I woke up the next morning everything was tan not orange EXCEPT for my feet ,toes, and ankles. I even put a cream on all the areAs before hand ( knees, ankles, feet and elbows) because of the dryer skin. I was horrified when I woke up to see the spray was darker in some areas then others like my legs were VERY spotty and even some on my back as well. I used a lemon and sugar rub mix in the bath the next morning to try to scrub off the splotches and it worked .. I&#x27;m not completely knocking this product, becasue it does make you tan. But I would suggest having someone spray it on for you for even coverage and hard to reach spots. And be very very carful when doing your legs and feet!!!</li>
            <li> Orange orange and orangeeeee.... That is all</li>
            <li> The color was very nice and brown, however, you can&#x27;t tell where you&#x27;ve applied it. It smells..  I will be wearing pants all week.</li>
            <li> This is the easiest and most natural self tanner I&#x27;ve been able to find. No comparison to Nutrogenia. The smell is tolerable. If you just do a light spray daily your color stays perfect. Don&#x27;t over spray at once! If you want to go bold spray lightly. Wait to dry. Spray again. DO NOT SPRAY YOUR FEET. No need they might look weird and overtan if you do. But generally almost fool proof. The best and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> I bought this because someone had suggested it to me, they loved it and so do I! IT doesn&#x27;t leave you with streaks or orange!</li>
            <li> The sprayer plugged up constantly and it left spray spots all over me. Not thrilled with this product. I used a light lotion before spraying in the shower so that it would go on more smoothly but this sprayer plugged up every single time. When it DID finally spray, it would still leave the spray marks where it would start to plug up and not spray evenly. And maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a fair skinned person, but it doesn&#x27;t look natural. It&#x27;s not orange, but rather kind of a dirt looking brown. Especially on the feet (and I never sprayed directly on my feet. It was what came down from spraying the rest of my body).</li>
            <li> I used this tanning spray in conjunction with laying out by the pool to get a richer tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st attempt&#x3D; uneven tanning because I didn&#x27;t put enough on and the can sprays larger droplets with the mist that created random tan spots.  I plan to find a company that has a better spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd attempt&#x3D; desired results.  I applied with small circular movements instead of a straight line application, let dry for 20 seconds, and then rubbed in The Body Shop&#x27;s Spa Wisdom Polynesia Monoi Miracle (smells like yummy Gardenia) body oil to the area misted to insure even tanning and a nice smell.  I applied everywhere but my face and upper back and it looks nice and even.  I used my hands to rub the oil in and washed them immediately after each section done so it wouldn&#x27;t stain my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: To blend in those larger tan spots I used pure acetone on a QTip to rub in the area and the spots lighten quite a bit or completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product to be a quick and easy way to deepen an already existing tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for some time because of it&#x27;s natural look.  Will continue to buy it through Amazon as the price is better!</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. It sprays on evenly and doesn&#x27;t make you look patchy. I use it all over my body, especially my face because SPF keeps it from tanning. It looks very natural, not orangey at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spray your feet directly or they will look too dark though! Before applying put lotion all over your feet to protect them from over-tanning. Also I like to wear slippers while I spray it because if you step barefoot over the areas you were spraying, the soles of your feet get dark and kinda dirty looking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, best tanner I&#x27;ve used. And saves you a bunch of money on Versa Spa type spray tans that fade in a week anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go through a can every 3 weeks or so and I will never stop!!! I buy them in bulk on Amazon for about half of what they sell for in drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loves!</li>
            <li> Definatly a good product.  I will order again if its available.  This product gives an even tan and is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> worked on my face arms and chest but didnt work at all on my legs, i would get just for upper body</li>
            <li> spray on stuff can be uneven.</li>
            <li> I chose it because a a very good you tube video.&lt;br /&gt;It was very streaky and hard to identify where it was applied</li>
            <li> Not understanding the rave reviews.  Have used it daily for a full week and barely see any difference.  Only good thing, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my white sheets.</li>
