            <li>I like the smell of it because it&#x27;s warm and slightly exotic, not chemical like a lot of colognes</li>

            <li>I love this perfume -</li>
            <li>I still love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I feel like quite the confident vixen in this alluring, exotic scent...</li>
            <li>and I am glad that it is still around.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>It tends to be very strong when you first spray it, then it tapers off nicely while still sticking around.</li>
            <li>Hoping to find the original scent somewhere, in a store!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t handle most scents due to allergies, this works perfectly well with my body chemistry!</li>
            <li>and I was able to get it on amazon for the price I paid when I was 16 &amp; bought it for the first time!!</li>
            <li>There are many out there that are not the original scents.  </li>
            <li>It has a comforting clean smell that I love.</li>
            <li>I take responsibility for not reading the fine print about the return policy.</li>
            <li>I wore this my senior year of high school and still love the scent!</li>
            <li>The musk that so sweetly lasted fades away very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is still the original scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a great fragrance that will take you right back to the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Would be so nice if they would make the Coty Wild Musk Oil again.</li>
            <li>I always loved this scent when I was younger and sought to buy it now.  </li>
            <li>so i love it but will continue buuying the same in the more concentrated version.</li>
            <li>I love Coty Wild Musk, and I am a huge fan of Amazon, but I will never order perfume from them again.</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh, not overpowering</li>
            <li>My older teen cousin used to wear this when I was a tyke, I always loved it on her &amp; thought she was the sexiest gal around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s woodsy and natural and not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something you might wear with a darker, more mysterious or alluring look.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better is if it was the oil, not spray.</li>
            <li>The scent used to be very unique, and I would receive compliments on it almost daily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a pretty sundress kind of scent.  </li>
            <li>Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really describe it.  </li>
            <li>I was very upset that I couldn&#x27;t return it.  </li>
            <li>this is light enough not to give me a reaction.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t as light as their White Musk scent, but if you like musky perfumes, this is the winner</li>
            <li>This makes the second bottle that I&#x27;ve gotten that has smelled more like alcohol than the actual perfume.</li>
            <li>This is came in a smooth bottle and is not the same fragrance as the old bumpy bottle.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I used to wear this scent in high school....</li>
            <li>From now on I&#x27;ll just pay a few more bucks and get it at the store.</li>
            <li>Date on the bottom of this bottle reveals that it is 2 years old...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too pungent, whereas the original scent was soft, yet heady.  </li>
            <li>I normally wear essential oil blends instead of cologne/perfume, but this is one of two colognes that make my list.    </li>
            <li>The new one is definitely &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Well this perfume is soft and all-day lasting, I feel that women should use this perfume</li>
            <li>When I clicked on the icon there were two different sizes listed, naturally I chose the larger size.</li>
            <li>Like a lot of people, I was trying to find the long lost fragrance of Coty&#x27;s Wild Musk from the 70&#x27;s.</li>

            <li> I had some of the oil version of this from a long time ago, and I ordered the cologne when I realized I was almost out.  </li>
            <li> Coty has been around for a long time!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they did, but it&#x27;s different.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to find it at Walgreen&#x27;s, but haven&#x27;t seen it there in a while either :(</li>
            <li> Should have listened to some of the other reviews I had read thru the Amazon site.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as harsh as the men&#x27;s version and yet not particularly feminine either.  </li>
            <li> Should have taken the other reviewers seriously.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I received but its not for women.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was mislabeled</li>
            <li> She is now in her 50s &amp; I in my late 30s.</li>
            <li> This does have that fragrance, but it is very weak.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bad as some reviewers have said, but it&#x27;s definitely not as good.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Coty has been around for a long time! The smell has not change, it is one of the best smelling musk out there.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Used as a gift, my mother loves this scent. Great price. Very well packaged. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had some of the oil version of this from a long time ago, and I ordered the cologne when I realized I was almost out.  I like the smell of it because it&#x27;s warm and slightly exotic, not chemical like a lot of colognes are.  I normally wear essential oil blends instead of cologne/perfume, but this is one of two colognes that make my list.    It&#x27;s something you might wear with a darker, more mysterious or alluring look.  It&#x27;s not a pretty sundress kind of scent.  Winter rather than spring.  Seductress rather than sorority girl.    It tends to be very strong when you first spray it, then it tapers off nicely while still sticking around.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers here regarding the scent.  I&#x27;m not sure what they did, but it&#x27;s different.  The scent used to be very unique, and I would receive compliments on it almost daily.  It&#x27;s not as bad as some reviewers have said, but it&#x27;s definitely not as good.  It&#x27;s a little too pungent, whereas the original scent was soft, yet heady.  Can&#x27;t really describe it.  But I will no longer buy this online.  Hoping to find the original scent somewhere, in a store!  I used to be able to find it at Walgreen&#x27;s, but haven&#x27;t seen it there in a while either :(</li>
            <li> good price great shipping</li>
            <li> I love this perfume - I have used it for 28 years and I was able to get it on amazon for the price I paid when I was 16 &amp; bought it for the first time!!</li>
            <li> The cologne arrived sooner then expected, in 48 hours.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and will continue to do business with this dealer.</li>
            <li> Well this perfume is soft and all-day lasting, I feel that women should use this perfume it&#x27;s the best...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with product itself. My issue with Amazon and how they listed it.  There are two types of Coty Musk, one is an oil and one is a perfume spray. I wanted to purchase the oil version. When I clicked on the icon there were two different sizes listed, naturally I chose the larger size. When I received the item it was the spray not the oil. I was very upset that I couldn&#x27;t return it.  I take responsibility for not reading the fine print about the return policy. However, these items should be listed seperately as the are two very different products.</li>
            <li> The formula appears to be the same as 20 years ago.  I still love the scent.  I consider it a unisex scent.  It&#x27;s not as harsh as the men&#x27;s version and yet not particularly feminine either.  If you like the smell of musk, you&#x27;re bound to like this one.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this</li>
            <li> Been using this cologne for years.....one of my favs! It has a comforting clean smell that I love. Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue it!</li>
            <li> I like musk fregnance. I order,because the best musk is from Coty.&lt;br /&gt;I like price ,and is good for. Gift</li>
            <li> Like a lot of people, I was trying to find the long lost fragrance of Coty&#x27;s Wild Musk from the 70&#x27;s. This does have that fragrance, but it is very weak. And I don&#x27;t know if anyone else can sense it, but by the time I get where I&#x27;m going I can no longer smell it. Would be so nice if they would make the Coty Wild Musk Oil again. Guess some of the best things are gone for good.</li>
            <li> This product was just as described</li>
            <li> The only real complaint is this doesn&#x27;t last as long as the concentrated. So although you pay a little more and get a little less it&#x27;sworth it.  Still the scent is wonderful and mixes well with my body chemistry so i love it but will continue buuying the same in the more concentrated version.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, but the recipient loves it. Delivered as promised by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I received but its not for women.  I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for over 20 yrs and this smells like the men&#x27;s cologne.  It actually gave me a headache.  Not sure if it was mislabeled but the bottle doesn&#x27;t say either way.</li>
            <li> I am keeping the product but ........it is not the same product that I purchased for years at stores.  I still have and am still using my last bottle purchased at a store and there is no comparison to the strength of the cologne.  The new one is definitely &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;.  I knew as soon as I saw the bottle that it was not the same thing.  Should have listened to some of the other reviews I had read thru the Amazon site.</li>
            <li> My older teen cousin used to wear this when I was a tyke, I always loved it on her &amp; thought she was the sexiest gal around. She is now in her 50s &amp; I in my late 30s. I have since purchased her a bottle &amp; myself 2...today, I am ordering 5 more bottles for fear of this going obsolete! I feel like quite the confident vixen in this alluring, exotic scent...my guy loves it on me, too! I can&#x27;t handle most scents due to allergies, this works perfectly well with my body chemistry! Hope it NEVER goes away...in my lifetime, anyway!</li>
            <li> This is my signature fragrance and I am glad that it is still around.</li>
            <li> I always loved this scent when I was younger and sought to buy it now.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it used to.  The musk that so sweetly lasted fades away very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love Coty Wild Musk, and I am a huge fan of Amazon, but I will never order perfume from them again. This makes the second bottle that I&#x27;ve gotten that has smelled more like alcohol than the actual perfume. Date on the bottom of this bottle reveals that it is 2 years old...no wonder! From now on I&#x27;ll just pay a few more bucks and get it at the store.</li>
            <li> I miss seeing this in the stores. so glad I was able to find it here!! I wore this my senior year of high school and still love the scent!</li>
            <li> order got mixed up !!</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance that will take you right back to the 70&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s woodsy and natural and not too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I love it.  Smells so fresh, not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this cologne considering I have a sensitivity to alot of perfumes (they give me a splitting headache and a queasy stomach) this is light enough not to give me a reaction.  It also mixes well with different scents from lotion, deodorant, etc...</li>
            <li> I used to wear this scent in high school....and while I was browsing the smells on Amazon, I came across it again...and bought it...when I got it....awesomeness! It still smells as great as it did then....it isn&#x27;t as light as their White Musk scent, but if you like musky perfumes, this is the winner</li>
            <li> Great perfume, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is the cologne I&#x27;ve been wearing for years!  This is still the original scent.  I am very happy to be able to find this item.  There are many out there that are not the original scents.  I can&#x27;t imagine not being able to wear this cologne, it&#x27;s my perfect scent!</li>
            <li> No problems and received timely.</li>
            <li> Should have taken the other reviewers seriously.  This is came in a smooth bottle and is not the same fragrance as the old bumpy bottle.  The picture is incorrect.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. The only thing that would make it better is if it was the oil, not spray.</li>
