            <li>It is a nice powder.</li>
            <li>I really loved how finely milled this powder was...</li>
            <li>skin looks very smooth and even when she wears it.</li>
            <li>It feels so light, so airy, and it has a wonderful soft touch.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t needed to apply it more than once per day.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love nars</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the HD powder is one of ELF&#x27;s biggest sellers.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying any more Nars powder.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying any more Nars powder.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Crystal gives a beautiful soft focus finish, diminishing fine lines and pores.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really into status makeup, then spend money on the Nars powder, it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>It is invisible on...not white, and sets makeup beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I heart this lovely loose powder, beautiful finish&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the setting powder, but it so fine and the container spills,</li>
            <li>But it really makes me happy when I can save a considerable sum without sacrificing quality.  </li>
            <li>But it really makes me happy when I can save a considerable sum without sacrificing quality.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending money on high end products as long as they work and make me look more beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending money on high end products as long as they work and make me look more beautiful.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t see anything special about the powder.</li>
            <li>so I was in fact walking around in a full face of makeup.  </li>
            <li>No one is more surprised at this fact than I am.  </li>
            <li>when I first use it, it&#x27;s very fine and made my skin seems soft.</li>
            <li>Years ago, I noticed that catching glimpses of myself in certain lighting or especially when my skin has a shine reveals all the crags and peaks and valleys of my skin and makes me feel monstrous.  </li>
            <li>After all, that&#x27;s why women wear makeup in the first place, right?  </li>
            <li>After all, that&#x27;s why women wear makeup in the first place, right?  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very brand loyal.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very brand loyal.  </li>
            <li>it felt very light on, and it didn&#x27;t have a chalky white residue.</li>
            <li>Love this as the final touch to my make-up routine.</li>
            <li>I also love Nars lipsticks (but not the sheer ones) and eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>and it lasts so much longer!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go so far as to call it a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; because it hasn&#x27;t fixed the problems that make me self-conscious, but it masks them better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other setting powders, but I definitely like this best.</li>
            <li>Afterwards you took a large brush to brush the excess powder off...</li>
            <li>I saw a video on you tube saying the loose powder was better than the compact.  </li>
            <li>I wear a loose powder close to my complexion, but this alone works better.</li>
            <li>(This is relevant to the product review because, as an adult male, I can&#x27;t really get away with walking around in a full face of makeup.)  </li>
            <li>It prevents oily shine during the day but absolutely does not settle into lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s expensive,but so far this has been worth it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife, she absolutely loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Her</li>
            <li>Very Silky</li>
            <li>My mind is blown with how much this product costs and the lack of coverage</li>
            <li>Was excited initially</li>
            <li>It was just okay and not nearly as &#x27;exciting&#x27; as described in the ad.  </li>
            <li>I love this for setting my under eye concealer, it&#x27;s the exact same thing as the Laura Mercier Secret Brightening Powder except you get way more product for your money</li>
            <li>I have used Nars makeup for many years and am a devoted fan of several Nars products, including The Multiple in Malibu and Orgasm and the Velvet Matte lip pencil in Bettina, Sex Machine and Dolce Vita.  </li>
            <li>SEPHORA COLLECTION Classic Travel Refillable Powder]]</li>
            <li>Once in a while, a drugstore cosmetic product beats the high end brands and this is the case here</li>
            <li>Not only is it fantastically cheap, but it has the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the package, I thought I had wasted 55 bucks on sugar-white powder, but I applied it with a paint brush (I didn&#x27;t realize it doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of applicator) and discovered that not only does it really reduce shine and make my skin look much improved, but despite looking like talcum powder, it is completely translucent and doesn&#x27;t appear white on the skin.  </li>
            <li>There is a recessed top with small holes under the cap that prevents it (unless you don&#x27;t keep it upright).</li>
            <li>i put in on very last with a large powder brush.  </li>
            <li>I have a little bit of redness on my face and this powder is amazing at not only providing natural coverage but also lasting.</li>
            <li>I recommend the Nars powder in Crystal, but only if your disposable income is considerable and you absolutely must have the Nars package on your dressing table.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the Nars powder in Crystal, but only if your disposable income is considerable and you absolutely must have the Nars package on your dressing table.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s light reflecting her pictures, selfies, and random snaps look much better than with just regular powder.</li>
            <li>They all provide an invisible soft focus finish that adds no color, doesn&#x27;t look powdery and doesn&#x27;t cake.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, which decreases the overall cost to the consumer.</li>
            <li>Nars sets my tinted moisturizer and looks natural.</li>
            <li>The only thing we have noticed is that it can sometimes settle into a few wrinkle lines, but it&#x27;s easily remedied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I currently live in the Pacific Northwest, but am planning a move to Florida later this year.</li>
            <li>Had a little difficulty with loosing it in the post, but the seller was very attentive and resent one without hassle which arrived just a few days ago.</li>
            <li>Just because it&#x27;s feels light doesn&#x27;t mean put it on lightly... you need to put a liberal amount on with a medium wide round brush.</li>
            <li>If you have an old empty Bare Minerals container, you can put the Nars in there because of the travel conscious click shut off valve.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals Mineral Veil didn&#x27;t last at all, but it had the same airy quality.</li>

            <li> I have finally begun using this, after using up all the other powder my grandmother left me.</li>
            <li> I have been a devoted user of Nars powder for almost as long as the line has existed.  </li>
            <li> I spent my $6 at Target and was so blown away by the finish, the next day I bought the remaining two packages on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> I need powder not only because my skin is slightly oily but it also sets my foundation and concealer and helps my makeup last all day.  </li>
            <li> After I stopped using it, no more new blemishes...</li>
            <li> I am a male with severe acne scarring that makes me extremely self-conscious and affects my day to day life.  </li>
            <li> However few days later some blemishes appeared and I suspect it clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> I prefer translucent coverage in a powder, simply because colored powders look too heavy.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I will be facing extreme humidity, and am looking forward to discovering if this will hold up as well in Florida as it has for me here, where there is almost no humidity.</li>
            <li> I have a small MUF HD Powder compact in my purse and the only reason I do is because ELF doesn&#x27;t make one.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews it does not spill.</li>
            <li> Only complaint for Nars  is I did need to reapply every 3 hours.</li>
            <li> That being said, I won&#x27;t miss Dermablend at all... it was thick, chalky white, and my face looked like a mask.</li>
            <li> I used to use Dermablends setting powder and you had to pat it on heavy with a powderpuff.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive products  can be found in drugstores and beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Disappointing and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m no longer spending an outrageous amount and am getting the same perfecting results.  </li>
            <li> The casing would be impossible to transport in your purse and would spill out as soon as you opened it.</li>

            <li> Great coverage and helps prevent shine on skin</li>
            <li> I like the setting powder, but it so fine and the container spills, no matter how carefully I open it.  A great deal of the product ends up on my counter each time I use it.  Perhaps it&#x27; a flaw in the container.....pretty wasteful.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews I&#x27;d seen elsewhere, and because I was searching for a replacement to the powder my beloved grandmother introduced me to. I have finally begun using this, after using up all the other powder my grandmother left me. I absolutely love this! It feels so light, so airy, and it has a wonderful soft touch.

Because it&#x27;s light reflecting her pictures, selfies, and random snaps look much better than with just regular powder. It helps deflect attention from any blemishes too! The only thing we have noticed is that it can sometimes settle into a few wrinkle lines, but it&#x27;s easily remedied.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> Controls oil in the T zone without being cakey. I use as a setting powder after use of powder foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> I am a male with severe acne scarring that makes me extremely self-conscious and affects my day to day life.  (This is relevant to the product review because, as an adult male, I can&#x27;t really get away with walking around in a full face of makeup.)  Years ago, I noticed that catching glimpses of myself in certain lighting or especially when my skin has a shine reveals all the crags and peaks and valleys of my skin and makes me feel monstrous.  I tried a number of different face powders to reduce shine, and a few did that job moderately well, but all were visibly caked on and none really matched my complexion...so I was in fact walking around in a full face of makeup.  A (male) friend told me to try NARS loose powder, so I bought it.  When I opened the package, I thought I had wasted 55 bucks on sugar-white powder, but I applied it with a paint brush (I didn&#x27;t realize it doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of applicator) and discovered that not only does it really reduce shine and make my skin look much improved, but despite looking like talcum powder, it is completely translucent and doesn&#x27;t appear white on the skin.  I won&#x27;t go so far as to call it a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; because it hasn&#x27;t fixed the problems that make me self-conscious, but it masks them better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> Love this as the final touch to my make-up routine. It softens the look, which is great for photos.</li>
            <li> I like it, but was hoping for flawless skin.  Maybe I&#x27;m not applying enough?  Any suggestions?  i put in on very last with a large powder brush.  I saw a video on you tube saying the loose powder was better than the compact.  And that this women&#x27;s makeup looked perfectly airbrushed after using it....</li>
            <li> It was recommended on a Taiwan variety show hence decided to try it. Was excited initially when I first use it, it&#x27;s very fine and made my skin seems soft. However few days later some blemishes appeared and I suspect it clogged my pores. After I stopped using it, no more new blemishes... Disappointing and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It is invisible on...not white, and sets makeup beautifully.  It feels like silk.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again. I have an oily t zone and within hours im shining . This product keeps me matte for a longer time and smoothen out the skin complexion. I use it with nars foundation and powder. Love nars</li>
            <li> ELF HD powder is a perfect dupe for Nars&#x27; Crystal powder.  Crystal gives a beautiful soft focus finish, diminishing fine lines and pores.  But so does ELF and ELF is $6!!  No one is more surprised at this fact than I am.  I have been a devoted user of Nars powder for almost as long as the line has existed.  But I&#x27;m no longer spending an outrageous amount and am getting the same perfecting results.  ELF even has more product in the package!  I prefer translucent coverage in a powder, simply because colored powders look too heavy.  I need powder not only because my skin is slightly oily but it also sets my foundation and concealer and helps my makeup last all day.  I saw a YouTube video makeup guru&#x27;s review of MakeUpForever&#x27;s HD powder and ELF HD powder where the two products went head to head and ELF won.  Not only is it fantastically cheap, but it has the same ingredients.  I assumed that ELF would win over Nars powder too.  And it did.  I spent my $6 at Target and was so blown away by the finish, the next day I bought the remaining two packages on the shelf.  Once in a while, a drugstore cosmetic product beats the high end brands and this is the case here (mascara is another example).  If you&#x27;re really into status makeup, then spend money on the Nars powder, it&#x27;s a good product.  But if you&#x27;d like to save some cash without sacrificing quality, then try ELF.  I have used Nars makeup for many years and am a devoted fan of several Nars products, including The Multiple in Malibu and Orgasm and the Velvet Matte lip pencil in Bettina, Sex Machine and Dolce Vita.  I also love Nars lipsticks (but not the sheer ones) and eyeshadow.  I have a small MUF HD Powder compact in my purse and the only reason I do is because ELF doesn&#x27;t make one.  I kid you not, the Nars powder in Crystal, MUF&#x27;s HD powder and ELF HD powder are identical.  They all provide an invisible soft focus finish that adds no color, doesn&#x27;t look powdery and doesn&#x27;t cake.  I&#x27;m sure the HD powder is one of ELF&#x27;s biggest sellers.  I don&#x27;t mind spending money on high end products as long as they work and make me look more beautiful.  After all, that&#x27;s why women wear makeup in the first place, right?  I spend a fortune on my hair products and makeup and I&#x27;m very brand loyal.  But it really makes me happy when I can save a considerable sum without sacrificing quality.  I won&#x27;t be buying any more Nars powder.  I&#x27;m an ELF convert.  I recommend the Nars powder in Crystal, but only if your disposable income is considerable and you absolutely must have the Nars package on your dressing table.  As for me, I&#x27;ll be saving more than $30 and will buy myself the gorgeous lilac Nars eyeshadow instead.biggest sellers.

            <li> This is the best powder. I wear a loose powder close to my complexion, but this alone works better. Love it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice powder. Contrary to other reviews it does not spill. There is a recessed top with small holes under the cap that prevents it (unless you don&#x27;t keep it upright). It also make using it easier since you can dispense a minute amount at a time. You don&#x27;t need to use much, which decreases the overall cost to the consumer. However, I don&#x27;t see anything special about the powder. I put it on and all the shadows and winkles show. I haven&#x27;t received any compliments, such as You look so rested.</li>
            <li> It was just okay and not nearly as &#x27;exciting&#x27; as described in the ad.  Much less expensive products  can be found in drugstores and beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I really loved how finely milled this powder was... it felt very light on, and it didn&#x27;t have a chalky white residue. I&#x27;ve tried several other setting powders, but I definitely like this best. Bare Minerals Mineral Veil didn&#x27;t last at all, but it had the same airy quality. Just because it&#x27;s feels light doesn&#x27;t mean put it on lightly... you need to put a liberal amount on with a medium wide round brush. I used to use Dermablends setting powder and you had to pat it on heavy with a powderpuff. Afterwards you took a large brush to brush the excess powder off... it was wasteful-but (until now) it was the only setting powder with staying power. The powder can&#x27;t dry and seal your liquid makeup if you don&#x27;t put enough on. That being said, I won&#x27;t miss Dermablend at all... it was thick, chalky white, and my face looked like a mask. I was also shiny again after a couple hours in the Florida heat. Nars sets my tinted moisturizer and looks natural. Only complaint for Nars  is I did need to reapply every 3 hours. The casing would be impossible to transport in your purse and would spill out as soon as you opened it. If you have an old empty Bare Minerals container, you can put the Nars in there because of the travel conscious click shut off valve. Otherwise you can buy a [[ASIN:B008EPXFZK SEPHORA COLLECTION Classic Travel Refillable Powder]] which is what I&#x27;ll be doing.</li>
            <li> Works Great !!!!! Very Silky</li>
            <li> Best powder! I have a little bit of redness on my face and this powder is amazing at not only providing natural coverage but also lasting.</li>
            <li> My mind is blown with how much this product costs and the lack of coverage it gives.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I heart this lovely loose powder, beautiful finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also suggest getting something closer to your tone and not translucent just for an extra kick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good packaging and on time</li>
            <li> Had a little difficulty with loosing it in the post, but the seller was very attentive and resent one without hassle which arrived just a few days ago. Great seller, great product! I love this for setting my under eye concealer, it&#x27;s the exact same thing as the Laura Mercier Secret Brightening Powder except you get way more product for your money and it lasts so much longer! Thank you guys!</li>
            <li> excellent product, very much recommended!</li>
