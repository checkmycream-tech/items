            <li>Leaves a power/paste on your skin, kind of like toothpaste on the corner of your mouth.</li>
            <li>From a distance it looks just ok.</li>
            <li>You need to apply it smoothly and not too generously to get a nice effect.</li>
            <li>I love it for a fresh look</li>
            <li>The product works great, but the new box of 50 was actually a box of 49.</li>
            <li>It works right away and lasts pretty much all day, and I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bummer because I had VERY high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Works really really well with bags under eyes</li>
            <li>Too much is Casey too little U need more.</li>

            <li> Product seemed to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product, it left a powdery look and is very noticeable</li>
            <li> this does work for a limited time.</li>
            <li> Bought a box to split with a friend which won&#x27;t work out equally, not sure if the manufacturer is shorting the count on purpose.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate the packaging....</li>

            <li> good Morning. I read in a comment that the box comes with 49 sachets. are 49 or 50 sachets?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what the videos portrayed.</li>
            <li> I ordered 50 paches, however only 7 were delivered.</li>
            <li> The product works great, but the new box of 50 was actually a box of 49. Bought a box to split with a friend which won&#x27;t work out equally, not sure if the manufacturer is shorting the count on purpose.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product, it left a powdery look and is very noticeable</li>
            <li> I hate the packaging.... It doesn&#x27;t work well in the sachets....They need to go back to resealable tubes...</li>
            <li> I did not care for the product. It felt awful on my face.</li>
            <li> this does work for a limited time.</li>
            <li> Garbage. Nothing else to say.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t get the results that others are raving about here or on YouTube.  I barely saw any change at all in my skin and in addition to that, my skin was left very dry with a chalky residue.  It&#x27;s a bummer because I had VERY high hopes for this product. Maybe I got an old batch.</li>
            <li> Works really really well with bags under eyes</li>
            <li> Product seemed to dry skin. For me only lasted about an hour. That said, it did work as claimed for that time period.</li>
            <li> This truly works but u need to play with it. Too much is Casey too little U need more. Best when applied with no makeup on but if u need makeup use waterproof and apply over ur makeup</li>
            <li> This made my skin look like it was peeling. I will try again tomorrow and try a different routine. I put on after moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Leaves a power/paste on your skin, kind of like toothpaste on the corner of your mouth. I had watched the videos on this product before ordering and thought WOW I NEED THIS! I was disappointed.  From a distance it looks just ok. But if you plan on talking to anyone face to face, you might want to pass on this one.</li>
            <li> I though it was terrific. You need to apply it smoothly and not too generously to get a nice effect. I love it for a fresh look</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It does what the ads say it does. It works right away and lasts pretty much all day, and I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse so I do sweat and need to touch up my makeup throughout the day. For the price and convenience I recommend this to everyone who is wondering whether it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; or not. It IS!  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> achei que seria melhor</li>
    </ol>
