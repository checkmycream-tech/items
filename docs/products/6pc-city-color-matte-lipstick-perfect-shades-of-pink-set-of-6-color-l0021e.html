            <li> I have never worn matte lip color, these shades made be a true believer!</li>
            <li> Omg i love this combinations..i just hope it works well when i receive them</li>
            <li> Very nice range of colors, especially the pinks (which was what I was looking for).  Only reason for witholding one star is that they are&lt;br /&gt;extremely matt.  I really have to add a more moist top layer.  But the shades are good and they do last.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the lipsticks, love the way the color last so long, I have gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying these, yeah they are matte but the quality is terrible they dint last more than an hour without smearing.</li>
            <li> no irritation but I would recommend a chap stick or gloss before this lipstick.&lt;br /&gt; it dose come off easy</li>
            <li> I like that its really matte, but this.does not last long on the lips</li>
            <li> Feel great on my lips but they are a little drying and crumble a little after a couple hours. They also get on my straw or cup when I take a drink.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these lipsticks they last all day!</li>
            <li> Drying, short-lasting,</li>
            <li> Colors are VERY bright. So if you&#x27;re looking for something that has a lot of pop, these will do. The lipsticks are not smooth to apply however. More of a matte finish and difficult to apply. Cheap $$$ but I&#x27;d rather get an inexpensive brand at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Love all the colors !! And love the smell</li>
            <li> Makes My Lips Itch But The Colors Are Really Nice ðŸ˜•</li>
            <li> Omg the colors are really cute .... I lovvvvvvve it</li>
            <li> Great product, they stay on all day.</li>
            <li> Great lipstick! Very vibrant colors, stays on pretty well! Goes on smoothly and feels nice on the lips.</li>
            <li> Love this brand!!! You sincerely cannot go wrong!!! The blue undertones make teeth appear whiter which is an absolute +</li>
            <li> the colors are well&lt;br /&gt;its durability during the day is not good&lt;br /&gt;and gives a feeling of heavy lips.</li>
            <li> Love the matte finish of these lipsticks!!</li>
            <li> Some of these are too light for my taste, but they still look pretty when applied.</li>
            <li> Nice pigmented color. Beautiful a d bright.</li>
            <li> Just like all shade of Pink lipstick</li>
            <li> I like that they were not tested on animals. Colors good if you put lip gloss over your lips. Threw out two colors because you could not see it on lips. Bought for fun and cost. Lasts a long time better than more expensive brands. Lips had no allergic reaction. Ordered other setðŸ˜Š</li>
