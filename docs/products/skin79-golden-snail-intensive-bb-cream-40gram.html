            <li>I am very fair, so I can get away with it, but most people are going to need a bronzer with this.</li>
            <li>The color was too bright</li>
            <li>One of the good ones out of my dozens tubes of BB creams on my table.</li>
            <li>This is a really good BB cream for those with really fair skin.</li>

            <li>LOVE this BB cream!</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it may be good for people with very light skin because they ensure that you see that you apply it adjusts to your skin tone but did not happen to my skin tone</li>
            <li>It felt amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my honest reviews with my own words.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li>The Gold one is really good, but I like this one better.  </li>
            <li>Nice neutral color (I am an nc2).great wear.</li>
            <li>Good skin covering ... easy seperate</li>
            <li>It spreads very easily on your face and gives a silky non-powdery feeling.</li>
            <li>And it also absorbs into your face unlike Etude House which comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and kind of water in substance</li>
            <li>It has that wonderful dewy glow that I particularly find appealing about Skin 79 products.</li>
            <li>although I can understand why some have referred it to a &amp;#34;grandma perfume&amp;#34; smell) and the coverage is good (light - medium, buildable).</li>
            <li>(it isn&#x27;t completely weightless though), and the finish is *flawless</li>
            <li>My skin feels great right now.  </li>
            <li>Does not state that the color is beige and very light.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m okay with using this bb</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the price and the timeliness of the shipment.</li>
            <li>Love this formula, will buy it again.  </li>
            <li>As always, I love the Skin79 pump-packaging and the SPF (45).</li>
            <li>but it is better than the orange BB cream in that aspect</li>
            <li>It was ok  for coverage.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many brands of BB cream.</li>
            <li>but if you use a bronzer on top</li>
            <li>but I love the scent and the way it smooths my skin.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Everything is okay</li>
            <li>i like the product,it works well my skin, has a better coverage and sun skin protection.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still battling, but it&#x27;s getting better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking much better care of my skin and getting smarter about what I use.  </li>
            <li>have to say that I love this product</li>
            <li>I love this B.B. Cream.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found out about it.</li>
            <li>Overall great product and prompt seller!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say, I am not disappointed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After mixing the pink and orange and this Snail white together, the oil control and color tone become perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good BB cream!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty good cream.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s that effective as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great, and after you wash it off your face feels great and smooth.</li>
            <li>I dislike most fragrances but the fragrance is light and lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the pink bottle of Skin79 and the gold bottle, I&#x27;m very happy with both of those.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and luxurious application with overall great coverage.</li>
            <li>And physical sunscreen is supposed to be the good stuff, score!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, but something I am not used to.  </li>
            <li>If used with a setting powder, it will be fine.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would not work well with my skintone (Caucasian, very fair with pink undertones).</li>
            <li>was a great product in a large bottle I should have order darker but did not know what color it really was.</li>
            <li>45 PA+++&lt;br /&gt;- light to med</li>
            <li>Light weight watery</li>
            <li>I received sample from different website and it showed great result.</li>
            <li>is light beige</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent (</li>
            <li>But the ones from SKIN79 are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I know it will fit my skin in the winter though, so</li>
            <li>However, I am happy with its coverage and will definitely keep buying this product from this seller (I was not expecting it to be here until the 30th, I received it the 24th!).</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it for a light coverage (did not cover my freckles,</li>
            <li>So far it seems to work good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~ quick and easy to apply</li>
            <li>As some reviewers mentioned, it is best for dry skin as it&#x27;s very creamy.</li>
            <li>smell, is a bit, overwhelming, at first.  </li>
            <li>It has a very good coverage, and if you don&#x27;t mind an odd flowery scent</li>
            <li>Great coverage, keeps my skin moist and doesn&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li>my skin tone though (you know, before my skin turned bright red)</li>
            <li>So, being smarter now, instead of purchasing the full bottle of this product, I decided to go for the samples.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in the process of purchasing two full sized bottles.  </li>
            <li>I did not buy the full 40g but purchased the 3 samples from ebay and used it for about a week.</li>
            <li>&lt;-- for indoor that did not exposed to sun)However, If you exposed to sun then adjustment time become super</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a super sensitve skin</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty cool to watch it oxidize.</li>
            <li>love is BB CREAM velvet leaves my skin a natural finish and also moisturizing for all components that has Thank you</li>
            <li>However, It&#x27;s meant for more mature skin</li>
            <li>Great for people with pale skin&lt;</li>
            <li>I bought this because I heard snail products are the trend right now</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Since this one has a SPF of 45, so it feels more oily than other one, or maybe because my T-zone easily get oily.</li>
            <li>However, out of the 4 BBcreams I have tried from SKIN79, this one blended with my skin the best and didn&#x27;t highlight dry patches like other products.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using bb cream Please be sure use make-up remover and deep cleanser.</li>
            <li>As noted by many other reviews, there is a unique smell, but it will go away about 10-15 min after applying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While I was a bit hesitant at first because of the &amp;#34;snail secretion&amp;#34; aspect of this, I decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a tiny bit more color to it.</li>
            <li>I first pumped some into my hand, I was a bit hesitant because it is a greyish brown color</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>Although again, this cream is more for Asian skin than Caucasian skin as it is a bit on the rubber-mask looking dewy side.</li>
            <li>may be it&#x27;s fine with an appropriate foundation, but really, I got kinda scared to use it in Summer when I get slight tan.</li>
            <li>It comes out very light and very grey tinted.</li>
            <li>blemish prone-skin and super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t strike me as strong, but you can definitely smell it.  </li>
            <li>oh! and large pore on my T-zone.</li>
            <li>Get the goods, hurry to open, packaging and image consistent, a little flavor, but do not know how effective, would go a trial period!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for those with mature skin and who want to liven up dull skin.</li>
            <li>I whole heartedly agree with the reviewer who named this color &amp;#34;Corpse.&amp;#34; It leaves you a gray mushroom color of death.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But in the summer when I am NW-15 or so it works really well.</li>
            <li>However, it is not very noticeable and fades into a more neutral undertone with your skin once it settles and oxidizes.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be very drying on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m just throwing the whole bottle after one-try.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and lightweight.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say much from that perspective.</li>
            <li>... wish they hadn&#x27;t put so much perfume in this,</li>
            <li>the applicator doesn&#x27;t really get messy either, so I think that is nice.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts at first, but decided to wear it daily for a full week to how it worked (I almost never wear makeup</li>
            <li>Like most Asian-brand BB creams it is meant for those skin tones typical of eastern Asians</li>
            <li>High SPF</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this product a try.  </li>
            <li>Skin79 typically has a sticker at the top over the nozzle button to prove that it is a new item, but this one did not have this sticker either.</li>
            <li>I really like how soft it makes my face feels.</li>
            <li>products are normally my go to product.</li>
            <li>would not recommend to anyone or repurchase due to the cheap fragrance smell.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try a new BBcream.  </li>
            <li>This is my new replacement for foundation.  </li>
            <li>It has a pink undertone whereas the orange one has a more yellow undertone.</li>
            <li>Made my skin very soft and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a few, but It&#x27;s getting so much better thanks to the Olay total blemish clearing face wash I use.  </li>
            <li>Usually high SPF sunscreen tend to be very thick to effectively block out the sun.</li>
            <li>But overall, I might purchase the full 40g along with Skin 79&#x27;s VIP Gold as my BB cream collection in the future.</li>
            <li>Or, if you&#x27;re lucky, your local beauty store might actually carry this product and might have samples of it give away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been pretty excited about this, I mean it&#x27;s snail BB Cream by SKIN79</li>
            <li>After using the Orange Super Plus/Hot Pink/Gold BB Creams for a while, I decided to try other BB creams from the Skin79 line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to clear up my acne for years and years.  </li>
            <li>the prestige, Vital Orange and Oriental Gold.)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I use this everyday for a light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>heavily  and allergic cheap fragance smell, item marked 121010, nearly 2 years ago from seller named Toktok</li>
            <li>Using one pump is enough to cover my whole face and then some.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using BB cream, but a lot of my friends use BB cream for a long time.</li>
            <li>Since I was sixteen years old.  </li>
            <li>So I won&#x27;t get too far off topic.  </li>
            <li>So far none of the BB creams I&#x27;ve used ever broke me out</li>
            <li>so needed the extra seal while I slept, and ALSO because the shade of this absolutely does not match my skin tone and never will.</li>
            <li>The color is essentially the same as Etude House light beige but a teeny bit on the grey side.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It has less coverage than the orange BB cream, but I found this product to be less viscous and thus, easier to build up and more natural looking.</li>
            <li>My only problem with this product is that the fragrance is a little too strong for my liking, and it doesn&#x27;t go away for several hours, if at all.</li>
            <li>stuff is pretty fantastic and for 17.00 you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li>(I purchased not only snail one; I also have Hot pink, Vip Gold, Diamond</li>
            <li>got the samples a few days ago, and tried this right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this Snail one is has a better color than skin79 pink (which is too grey) and the skin79 orange (which is too yellow), this one tend to be pale.</li>
            <li>Extremely light, not for anyone at or beyond NC20 at least!</li>
            <li>Just a little bit can cover the whole face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I can honestly say, I am not disappointed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After mixing the pink and orange and this Snail white together, the oil control and color tone become perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good BB cream!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty good cream.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s that effective as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great, and after you wash it off your face feels great and smooth.</li>
            <li> I dislike most fragrances but the fragrance is light and lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the pink bottle of Skin79 and the gold bottle, I&#x27;m very happy with both of those.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and luxurious application with overall great coverage.</li>
            <li> And physical sunscreen is supposed to be the good stuff, score!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong, but something I am not used to.  </li>
            <li> If used with a setting powder, it will be fine.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would not work well with my skintone (Caucasian, very fair with pink undertones).</li>
            <li> was a great product in a large bottle I should have order darker but did not know what color it really was.</li>
            <li> 45 PA+++&lt;br /&gt;- light to med</li>
            <li> Light weight watery</li>
            <li> I received sample from different website and it showed great result.</li>
            <li> is light beige</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent (</li>
            <li> But the ones from SKIN79 are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I know it will fit my skin in the winter though, so</li>
            <li> However, I am happy with its coverage and will definitely keep buying this product from this seller (I was not expecting it to be here until the 30th, I received it the 24th!).</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it for a light coverage (did not cover my freckles,</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~ quick and easy to apply</li>
            <li> As some reviewers mentioned, it is best for dry skin as it&#x27;s very creamy.</li>
            <li> smell, is a bit, overwhelming, at first.  </li>
            <li> It has a very good coverage, and if you don&#x27;t mind an odd flowery scent</li>
            <li> Great coverage, keeps my skin moist and doesn&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li> my skin tone though (you know, before my skin turned bright red)</li>
            <li> So, being smarter now, instead of purchasing the full bottle of this product, I decided to go for the samples.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in the process of purchasing two full sized bottles.  </li>
            <li> I did not buy the full 40g but purchased the 3 samples from ebay and used it for about a week.</li>
            <li> &lt;-- for indoor that did not exposed to sun)However, If you exposed to sun then adjustment time become super</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a super sensitve skin</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty cool to watch it oxidize.</li>
            <li> love is BB CREAM velvet leaves my skin a natural finish and also moisturizing for all components that has Thank you</li>
            <li> However, It&#x27;s meant for more mature skin</li>
            <li> Great for people with pale skin&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard snail products are the trend right now</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Since this one has a SPF of 45, so it feels more oily than other one, or maybe because my T-zone easily get oily.</li>
            <li> However, out of the 4 BBcreams I have tried from SKIN79, this one blended with my skin the best and didn&#x27;t highlight dry patches like other products.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using bb cream Please be sure use make-up remover and deep cleanser.</li>
            <li> As noted by many other reviews, there is a unique smell, but it will go away about 10-15 min after applying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While I was a bit hesitant at first because of the &amp;#34;snail secretion&amp;#34; aspect of this, I decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a tiny bit more color to it.</li>
            <li> I first pumped some into my hand, I was a bit hesitant because it is a greyish brown color</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> Although again, this cream is more for Asian skin than Caucasian skin as it is a bit on the rubber-mask looking dewy side.</li>
            <li> may be it&#x27;s fine with an appropriate foundation, but really, I got kinda scared to use it in Summer when I get slight tan.</li>
            <li> It comes out very light and very grey tinted.</li>
            <li> blemish prone-skin and super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t strike me as strong, but you can definitely smell it.  </li>
            <li> oh! and large pore on my T-zone.</li>
            <li> Get the goods, hurry to open, packaging and image consistent, a little flavor, but do not know how effective, would go a trial period!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for those with mature skin and who want to liven up dull skin.</li>
            <li> I whole heartedly agree with the reviewer who named this color &amp;#34;Corpse.&amp;#34; It leaves you a gray mushroom color of death.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> But in the summer when I am NW-15 or so it works really well.</li>
            <li> However, it is not very noticeable and fades into a more neutral undertone with your skin once it settles and oxidizes.</li>
            <li> and I found it to be very drying on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m just throwing the whole bottle after one-try.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and lightweight.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say much from that perspective.</li>
            <li> ... wish they hadn&#x27;t put so much perfume in this,</li>
            <li> the applicator doesn&#x27;t really get messy either, so I think that is nice.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts at first, but decided to wear it daily for a full week to how it worked (I almost never wear makeup</li>
            <li> Like most Asian-brand BB creams it is meant for those skin tones typical of eastern Asians</li>
            <li> High SPF</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this product a try.  </li>
            <li> Skin79 typically has a sticker at the top over the nozzle button to prove that it is a new item, but this one did not have this sticker either.</li>
            <li> I really like how soft it makes my face feels.</li>
            <li> products are normally my go to product.</li>
            <li> would not recommend to anyone or repurchase due to the cheap fragrance smell.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try a new BBcream.  </li>
            <li> This is my new replacement for foundation.  </li>
            <li> It has a pink undertone whereas the orange one has a more yellow undertone.</li>
            <li> Made my skin very soft and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a few, but It&#x27;s getting so much better thanks to the Olay total blemish clearing face wash I use.  </li>
            <li> Usually high SPF sunscreen tend to be very thick to effectively block out the sun.</li>
            <li> But overall, I might purchase the full 40g along with Skin 79&#x27;s VIP Gold as my BB cream collection in the future.</li>
            <li> Or, if you&#x27;re lucky, your local beauty store might actually carry this product and might have samples of it give away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been pretty excited about this, I mean it&#x27;s snail BB Cream by SKIN79</li>
            <li> After using the Orange Super Plus/Hot Pink/Gold BB Creams for a while, I decided to try other BB creams from the Skin79 line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to clear up my acne for years and years.  </li>
            <li> the prestige, Vital Orange and Oriental Gold.)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for a light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li> heavily  and allergic cheap fragance smell, item marked 121010, nearly 2 years ago from seller named Toktok</li>
            <li> Using one pump is enough to cover my whole face and then some.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB cream, but a lot of my friends use BB cream for a long time.</li>
            <li> Since I was sixteen years old.  </li>
            <li> So I won&#x27;t get too far off topic.  </li>
            <li> So far none of the BB creams I&#x27;ve used ever broke me out</li>
            <li> so needed the extra seal while I slept, and ALSO because the shade of this absolutely does not match my skin tone and never will.</li>
            <li> The color is essentially the same as Etude House light beige but a teeny bit on the grey side.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It has less coverage than the orange BB cream, but I found this product to be less viscous and thus, easier to build up and more natural looking.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this product is that the fragrance is a little too strong for my liking, and it doesn&#x27;t go away for several hours, if at all.</li>
            <li> stuff is pretty fantastic and for 17.00 you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> (I purchased not only snail one; I also have Hot pink, Vip Gold, Diamond</li>
            <li> got the samples a few days ago, and tried this right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this Snail one is has a better color than skin79 pink (which is too grey) and the skin79 orange (which is too yellow), this one tend to be pale.</li>
            <li> Extremely light, not for anyone at or beyond NC20 at least!</li>
            <li> Just a little bit can cover the whole face.</li>
            <li> the snail nutrition really evens out my skin tone and helps my skin to recover from past problems.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how small the samples were, but they were only samples.  </li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t believe the amount of coverage, the only other BB cream I tried was Mabeline</li>
            <li> My skin is dry, it loves the moisture this cream gives it.</li>
            <li> A bit oily on T-zone, dry on cheeks,</li>
            <li> Didt dry me out and sebum control is great.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a lot of improvement as the snail nutrition claims, but at least breakouts tend to be less frequent and less severe after several months of using it daily.</li>
            <li> But I live in LA and not sure when I will have a chance to test it with less sun...</li>
            <li> A little too white for my skin tone</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well priced - not an arm and a leg to try and look a little younger.  </li>
            <li> after few weeks later using this bb cream founds out..</li>
            <li> Pink undertone&lt;</li>
            <li> It was only two dollars and some change to get quite a few samples delivered to me.  </li>
            <li> It was covering the red marks and few bumps, but it didn&#x27;t look like foundation does when you try to cover up flaws.  </li>
            <li> Dewy finish with white pale pink-tone.</li>
            <li> This color is down right creepy.</li>
            <li> It does look weird when you first put it on</li>
            <li> Recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy like other</li>
            <li> Yes, it does immediately due to the color of the cream.</li>
            <li> I wish this came in shades other than &amp;#34;corpse&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Seriously folks, this smells straight up like an old lady&#x27;s perfume mixed with mothballs, it is THAT bad.</li>
            <li> It is probably too dark for me in the winter as I run NW-10 then.</li>
            <li> I thought that if I didn&#x27;t like it, at least it would only be two dollars and some change, instead of</li>
            <li> It was little pricy on other website</li>
            <li> The reason I wear it for night though is because I have very dry skin, [up until a few days ago was] living in a harsh desert climate</li>
            <li> Mizon is slightly less dewy looking and natural-looking than Skin 79.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to those who are looking for a casual, everyday light/medium coverage with some SPF.</li>
            <li> Made me a little oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was a wasted purchase.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday.</li>
            <li> so I had to give it a few stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried bronzers to help it, mixed it with a super dark foundation, mixed it with moisturizer to thin it out, and it&#x27;s simply awful.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I can not return the usate only in the area of eyes to give an effect of luminosity because otherwise I look like a geicha  as to texture and smell no complaints</li>
            <li> a small amount)&lt;br /&gt;~ makes skin look brighter and smoother once it has melted in</li>
            <li> The ones from American cosmetic companies are utter crap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so hard to match it to my skin.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll find the samples like I did for a very small amount of money.</li>
            <li> For example the Skin79 SPF 50 sunscreen is very thick and oily but this Skin 79 Snail BB cream is very thin and not very oily at all</li>
            <li> but personally I don&#x27;t think it smells that bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have been roped into trying products before (who hasn&#x27;t bought an infommercial product or two) only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Thus looks horrible on my skin and it has a very noticable smell that will cause those with allergies problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about the SPF 45 and PA+++ though because the cream is so thin.</li>
            <li> It is not great for controlling shine for ultra oily skins like mine because for me after 4 hours my skin will become shiny (and I was indoor at my office desk!).</li>
            <li> but it has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical, go search the web</li>
            <li> Kinda weird...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this BB cream if you find buying Mizon is too expensive.</li>
            <li> it was truly a sad day....</li>
            <li> I use this BB cream at night and it lives up to all the hype generated by people like me obsessed with snail products.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had acne for 19 years and counting &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Besides the color, it settles into every wrinkle and makes the texture of my skin look terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am sensitive to strong smells. The second I opened this I was overwhelmed !&lt;br /&gt;Returned it</li>
            <li> I whole heartedly agree with the reviewer who named this color &amp;#34;Corpse.&amp;#34; It leaves you a gray mushroom color of death. I&#x27;ve tried bronzers to help it, mixed it with a super dark foundation, mixed it with moisturizer to thin it out, and it&#x27;s simply awful. Besides the color, it settles into every wrinkle and makes the texture of my skin look terrible. I&#x27;ve used the pink bottle of Skin79 and the gold bottle, I&#x27;m very happy with both of those. This color is down right creepy. The scent did not stand out to me.</li>
            <li> LOVE this BB cream! Very smooth and luxurious application with overall great coverage. As some reviewers mentioned, it is best for dry skin as it&#x27;s very creamy.</li>
            <li> A little too white for my skin tone</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s work on my skin type.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t come with an authenticity sticker as shown in the picture. Skin79 typically has a sticker at the top over the nozzle button to prove that it is a new item, but this one did not have this sticker either. Going to return.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because of the protection and the \\&quot;snail\\&quot; factor. But it turned my skin into white! I don&#x27;t know, may be it&#x27;s fine with an appropriate foundation, but really, I got kinda scared to use it in Summer when I get slight tan. But I live in LA and not sure when I will have a chance to test it with less sun...</li>
            <li> My skin is dry, it loves the moisture this cream gives it. And I can&#x27;t believe the amount of coverage, the only other BB cream I tried was Mabeline and it was like a tinted lotion. This is way different. And physical sunscreen is supposed to be the good stuff, score! It does look weird when you first put it on, it&#x27;s pretty cool to watch it oxidize.</li>
            <li> I purchased this skin79 snail bb cream from prettyandcute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: MAC NC 30 (Asian with yellow undertone)&lt;br /&gt;My Skin type: A bit oily on T-zone, dry on cheeks, blemish prone-skin and super sensitive skin oh! and large pore on my T-zone. ~.~\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and after few weeks later using this bb cream founds out..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- High SPF 45 PA+++&lt;br /&gt;- light to med coverage.&lt;br /&gt;- Made my skin very soft and moist.&lt;br /&gt;- Pink undertone&lt;br /&gt;- Great for people with pale skin&lt;br /&gt;- Did not break me out.&lt;br /&gt;- Dewy finish with white pale pink-tone. (Need longer adjustment time to change to your skin tone. &lt;-- for indoor that did not exposed to sun)However, If you exposed to sun then adjustment time become super fast.&lt;br /&gt; I found out with Skin79 BB creams are like this. (I purchased not only snail one; I also have Hot pink, Vip Gold, Diamond the prestige, Vital Orange and Oriental Gold.)&lt;br /&gt;- Light weight watery texture.&lt;br /&gt;- flowery scent.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m a super sensitve skin and I&#x27;m okay with using this bb cream.&lt;br /&gt;- Didt dry me out and sebum control is great.&lt;br /&gt;- Not cakey nor melting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using bb cream Please be sure use make-up remover and deep cleanser. Otherwise, skin will break up badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my honest reviews with my own words.&lt;br /&gt;:) Thanks</li>
            <li> love is BB CREAM velvet leaves my skin a natural finish and also moisturizing for all components that has Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream! It has that wonderful dewy glow that I particularly find appealing about Skin 79 products. I dislike most fragrances but the fragrance is light and lovely. It is probably too dark for me in the winter as I run NW-10 then. But in the summer when I am NW-15 or so it works really well. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my skin. I received sample from different website and it showed great result. It was little pricy on other website so I bought it on Amazon. Recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> One of the good ones out of my dozens tubes of BB creams on my table. I don&#x27;t see a lot of improvement as the snail nutrition claims, but at least breakouts tend to be less frequent and less severe after several months of using it daily. It is not great for controlling shine for ultra oily skins like mine because for me after 4 hours my skin will become shiny (and I was indoor at my office desk!). As noted by many other reviews, there is a unique smell, but it will go away about 10-15 min after applying.&lt;br /&gt;I always mix 3-5 different BB cream together to archive the correct color tone. I&#x27;d say this Snail one is has a better color than skin79 pink (which is too grey) and the skin79 orange (which is too yellow), this one tend to be pale. After mixing the pink and orange and this Snail white together, the oil control and color tone become perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very good BB cream!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected. I&#x27;m satisfied with the price and the timeliness of the shipment. The product is the best, too.</li>
            <li> it may be good for people with very light skin because they ensure that you see that you apply it adjusts to your skin tone but did not happen to my skin tone is light beige and unfortunately I can not return the usate only in the area of eyes to give an effect of luminosity because otherwise I look like a geicha  as to texture and smell no complaints</li>
            <li> Love this formula, will buy it again.  Love the fragrance and it work great for my 40, almost 50 something needs!</li>
            <li> After using the Orange Super Plus/Hot Pink/Gold BB Creams for a while, I decided to try other BB creams from the Skin79 line. While I was a bit hesitant at first because of the &amp;#34;snail secretion&amp;#34; aspect of this, I decided to try it anyway. It has a pink undertone whereas the orange one has a more yellow undertone. However, it is not very noticeable and fades into a more neutral undertone with your skin once it settles and oxidizes. I enjoy the scent (although I can understand why some have referred it to a &amp;#34;grandma perfume&amp;#34; smell) and the coverage is good (light - medium, buildable). It has less coverage than the orange BB cream, but I found this product to be less viscous and thus, easier to build up and more natural looking. As always, I love the Skin79 pump-packaging and the SPF (45). I use this everyday for a light to medium coverage. I wouldnâ€™t say that this product has very good oil control but it is better than the orange BB cream in that aspect (I have combination skin and it works well for me). I highly recommend this product to those who are looking for a casual, everyday light/medium coverage with some SPF.</li>
            <li> This is a really good BB cream for those with really fair skin. It has a very good coverage, and if you don&#x27;t mind an odd flowery scent it&#x27;s a pretty good cream. However, It&#x27;s meant for more mature skin and I found it to be very drying on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone with darker skin tones, or someone who likes their BB cream to have a calming, moisturizing effect. It&#x27;s great for those with mature skin and who want to liven up dull skin.</li>
            <li> Extremely light, not for anyone at or beyond NC20 at least! Even if it was the perfect shade, I would have to wear a gas mask while applying this stuff. Seriously folks, this smells straight up like an old lady&#x27;s perfume mixed with mothballs, it is THAT bad. Try before you buy!</li>
            <li> Good skin covering ... easy seperate</li>
            <li> I like it but it has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> It was ok  for coverage. Made me a little oily. If used with a setting powder, it will be fine.</li>
            <li> Get the goods, hurry to open, packaging and image consistent, a little flavor, but do not know how effective, would go a trial period!</li>
            <li> Love it. Love it. I have tried so many brands of BB cream. This is the best ! Great coverage. Just a little bit can cover the whole face. Don&#x27;t buy any of the drug store BB cream. I used them all, and they can&#x27;t even come close to the BB cream from Asia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several BB creams.  The ones from American cosmetic companies are utter crap.  But the ones from SKIN79 are fantastic.  The Gold one is really good, but I like this one better.  Not only is is cheaper, but the snail goop tightens pores and sagging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, if you are caucasian this will turn you into a corpse.  It has whiteners in it (they all do) but if you use a bronzer on top it&#x27;s no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is pretty fantastic and for 17.00 you can&#x27;t go wrong.  If nothing else it&#x27;s excellent sunscreen for your face and chest that also covers imperfections and I use it that way sometimes too.</li>
            <li> heavily  and allergic cheap fragance smell, item marked 121010, nearly 2 years ago from seller named Toktok</li>
            <li> I do actually like this BB cream. I just wish it had a tiny bit more color to it. It comes out very light and very grey tinted. It&#x27;s just so hard to match it to my skin. I know it will fit my skin in the winter though, so I don&#x27;t think it was a wasted purchase. Using one pump is enough to cover my whole face and then some. the applicator doesn&#x27;t really get messy either, so I think that is nice.</li>
            <li> Execellent product. I like it very much! Thank you.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks like heaven every time I put it on! It&#x27;s very light and kind of water in substance but I love the scent and the way it smooths my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the 3rd and already received it by the 12th,  2 weeks before the estimated delivery date! So far it seems to work good, so happy with it. You do not need to use a lot, it covers great and I know some people comment on how the product smells but personally I don&#x27;t think it smells that bad. I would definitely recommend trying this product to see if its for you!</li>
            <li> It feels great when it&#x27;s on (it isn&#x27;t completely weightless though), and the finish is *flawless*. My only problem with this product is that the fragrance is a little too strong for my liking, and it doesn&#x27;t go away for several hours, if at all. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB cream, but a lot of my friends use BB cream for a long time. Since this one has a SPF of 45, so it feels more oily than other one, or maybe because my T-zone easily get oily. I really like how soft it makes my face feels. the snail nutrition really evens out my skin tone and helps my skin to recover from past problems. It has a fast delivery too. definitely repurchase it again!</li>
            <li> This bb cream is great i love it i use it everyday. When i run out i will definitly repurchasing</li>
            <li> Everything is okay but I just can&#x27;t stand with its smell!&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend to anyone or repurchase due to the cheap fragrance smell. In fact, I&#x27;m just throwing the whole bottle after one-try.</li>
            <li> What a great product - I am very impressed - use sparingly - hides the wrinkles like nothing I have&lt;br /&gt;used before and it&#x27;s well priced - not an arm and a leg to try and look a little younger.  Will reorder&lt;br /&gt;in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard snail products are the trend right now and I wanted to try a new BBcream.  I can honestly say, I am not disappointed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One I first pumped some into my hand, I was a bit hesitant because it is a greyish brown color and I thought it would not work well with my skintone (Caucasian, very fair with pink undertones). However, out of the 4 BBcreams I have tried from SKIN79, this one blended with my skin the best and didn&#x27;t highlight dry patches like other products.  Also, it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy like other BBcreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, is a bit, overwhelming, at first.  It&#x27;s not too strong, but something I am not used to.  However, I am happy with its coverage and will definitely keep buying this product from this seller (I was not expecting it to be here until the 30th, I received it the 24th!).</li>
            <li> i like the product,it works well my skin, has a better coverage and sun skin protection. as of now i cant find any flaws with the product</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!  Does not state that the color is beige and very light.  Thus looks horrible on my skin and it has a very noticable smell that will cause those with allergies problems.  This being said I can not give it time to work.  Whitening?  Yes, it does immediately due to the color of the cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.I have bought it several times. Very moisturizing. Nice neutral color (I am an nc2).great wear.</li>
            <li> I wish this came in shades other than &amp;#34;corpse&amp;#34;. I am very fair, so I can get away with it, but most people are going to need a bronzer with this.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that my skin is a nightmare.  I&#x27;ve been trying to clear up my acne for years and years.  Since I was sixteen years old.  I&#x27;m thirty-one (going on thirty-two this year) and I&#x27;m still battling, but it&#x27;s getting better.  I&#x27;ve been taking much better care of my skin and getting smarter about what I use.  Especially my make-up now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have bumps all over my face.  I&#x27;ve got a few, but It&#x27;s getting so much better thanks to the Olay total blemish clearing face wash I use.  I swear by it and recommend it to anyone.  However, this review is not for Olay.  It&#x27;s for Skin79 Snail Nutrition.  So I won&#x27;t get too far off topic.  I promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been roped into trying products before (who hasn&#x27;t bought an infommercial product or two) only to be disappointed.  Make-up, face wash, creams.  So, being smarter now, instead of purchasing the full bottle of this product, I decided to go for the samples.  It was only two dollars and some change to get quite a few samples delivered to me.  I thought that if I didn&#x27;t like it, at least it would only be two dollars and some change, instead of almost twenty dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the samples a few days ago, and tried this right away.  I was surprised by how small the samples were, but they were only samples.  I thought that it would take all three, though, to get the coverage I needed to cover the acne scars and red marks.  I opened one of the samples and put it on the back of my hand.  As soon as I started brushing the product on my face, I was amazed.  It matched my skin tone perfectly!  It was covering the red marks and few bumps, but it didn&#x27;t look like foundation does when you try to cover up flaws.  It didn&#x27;t feel like foundation.  It felt amazing.  My skin feels great right now.  I feel natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I love this product and I&#x27;m in the process of purchasing two full sized bottles.  This is my new replacement for foundation.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.  If you&#x27;re skeptical, go search the web and you&#x27;ll find the samples like I did for a very small amount of money. Or, if you&#x27;re lucky, your local beauty store might actually carry this product and might have samples of it give away.  It can&#x27;t hurt to ask.  I love this B.B. Cream.  It is a wonderful product and I&#x27;m so glad I found out about it.</li>
            <li> was a great product in a large bottle I should have order darker but did not know what color it really was.</li>
            <li> Great BB.  Very moisturizing and lightweight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too white!  Doesn&#x27;t blend into skin as well as it should.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  I had my doubts at first, but decided to wear it daily for a full week to how it worked (I almost never wear makeup - maybe 2-3 times a year)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~ quick and easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;~ you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it for a light coverage (did not cover my freckles, but again I only used a small amount)&lt;br /&gt;~ makes skin look brighter and smoother once it has melted in&lt;br /&gt;~ leaves skin feeling soft&lt;br /&gt;~ oxidizes quickly&lt;br /&gt;~ did NOT cause a breakout! (I&#x27;ve had acne for 19 years and counting &#x3D;( even makeup advertised as non-comedogenic causes my skin to breakout)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;~ best if removed with makeup removing cleanser/wipe (another item to purchase $)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;It does have a flowery smell that reminds me of my mom LOL! It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t strike me as strong, but you can definitely smell it.  However after a week of using this product I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore. Snail mucin? Kinda weird... but you wouldn&#x27;t know if no one told you, right?</li>
            <li> Not only the benefits of complexion coverage and sunscreen, but also the satisfaction of knowing that you&#x27;ve covered your face in snail slime. Total bonus.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, keeps my skin moist and doesn&#x27;t dry out and I feel like I look 10 years younger. I&#x27;m very fair and this is the perfect color for me. Love it!</li>
            <li> The color was too bright</li>
            <li> I did not buy the full 40g but purchased the 3 samples from ebay and used it for about a week. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied. The color is essentially the same as Etude House light beige but a teeny bit on the grey side. It spreads very easily on your face and gives a silky non-powdery feeling. And it also absorbs into your face unlike Etude House which comes off very easily. I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about the SPF 45 and PA+++ though because the cream is so thin. Usually high SPF sunscreen tend to be very thick to effectively block out the sun. For example the Skin79 SPF 50 sunscreen is very thick and oily but this Skin 79 Snail BB cream is very thin and not very oily at all so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s that effective as a sunscreen. That part made me a bit uneasy when I go out in the sun wearing it. Other than that it&#x27;s great, and after you wash it off your face feels great and smooth. I would recommend this BB cream if you find buying Mizon is too expensive. Although again, this cream is more for Asian skin than Caucasian skin as it is a bit on the rubber-mask looking dewy side. Mizon is slightly less dewy looking and natural-looking than Skin 79. So those are the things to consider when you decide to purchase this item. So far none of the BB creams I&#x27;ve used ever broke me out so I can&#x27;t say much from that perspective. But overall, I might purchase the full 40g along with Skin 79&#x27;s VIP Gold as my BB cream collection in the future. But as of now I&#x27;m very satisfied with Mizon snail BB cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been pretty excited about this, I mean it&#x27;s snail BB Cream by SKIN79... but it turns out I&#x27;m allergic to something they put in it, I tested it out on my arm and it burned... it was truly a sad day....&lt;br /&gt;matched my skin tone though (you know, before my skin turned bright red) so I had to give it a few stars... wish they hadn&#x27;t put so much perfume in this, SKIN79 products are normally my go to product.</li>
            <li> I use this BB cream at night and it lives up to all the hype generated by people like me obsessed with snail products. The reason I wear it for night though is because I have very dry skin, [up until a few days ago was] living in a harsh desert climate so needed the extra seal while I slept, and ALSO because the shade of this absolutely does not match my skin tone and never will. Like most Asian-brand BB creams it is meant for those skin tones typical of eastern Asians and I am mixed-race (Hispanic and white), so if you are not eastern Asian I do not recommend this for daytime wear. It is especially ill-fitting for those with yellow undertones like myself and will make you appear ashy. I do not recommend this for daily wear if your skin is on the oily or oily/combination side. My sister has the latter skin type though and found it worked well when mixed with Missha Cho Bo Yang BB. Overall great product and prompt seller!</li>
