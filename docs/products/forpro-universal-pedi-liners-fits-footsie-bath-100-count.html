            <li>Fixs perfect and much cheaper .</li>
            <li>i would still purchase it because of the price and after all it is only used once so the quality doesn&#x27;t have to be the best</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>A lil thinner but perfect &amp; fits the same as footsie bath</li>
            <li>but I have had many with leaks.</li>
            <li>Great reasonable priced replacement.</li>
            <li>so I always make sure to put two in at a time just in case the one leaks.</li>
            <li>Way better price than the brand name....</li>
            <li>I agree and like them better...</li>
            <li>And price is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love the liners</li>
            <li>Thought it was a fluke since the first two batches I ordered were good, but this one has damaged liners too.</li>
            <li>They fit the Footsie Bath and were better quality than the Footsie Liners.  </li>
            <li>They actually fit better in the footsie bath.  </li>
            <li>Overall good value/product though!</li>
            <li>the material is a lot thinner than the normal footsie bath liner so there will be times when i get a batch where a good number of the liners will leak.  </li>
            <li>for half the price as the Footsie bath liners these are great!  </li>
            <li>fit footsie just fine.</li>
            <li>A little thinner then footsie bath brand but works great!!!!</li>
            <li>Great product have bought several times.</li>
            <li>Nicer than the original liners.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even fit right in the Footsie bath</li>
            <li>item shipped quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>And, much cheaper!!  </li>
            <li>Could be 4 stars if you&#x27;re critical on the match.&lt;br /&gt;Not as well made or as sturdy, but perfect for single use &amp;</li>
            <li>They are just as good, if not better than the Original brand...</li>
            <li>In the past I have been pretty happy with them.  </li>
            <li>My first order was the brand name.  </li>
            <li>Better than buying wholesale locally.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sturdy!</li>
            <li>We need to use two at same time to feel safe.</li>
            <li>The first 5 or 6 had to be thrown away because they were so mangled.  </li>
            <li>and i am pleased to say i have not had a single problem with leaking or sticking.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell the difference , besides the color.</li>
            <li>and they are very</li>
            <li>very well put together.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these which are a fraction of the price of the brand name producat.</li>
            <li>Thin but good for price</li>
            <li>i found that other liners i bought fit so snugly together that they would stick then when pried apart</li>
            <li>They may fit the footsie pedicure pan, but these are not the same quality, my nail techs had to double and triple line because they had holes in them.  </li>
            <li>The  first  10 or do were ok,  thin,  but</li>
            <li>but much prefer the clear brand name over these blue liners.</li>
            <li>was my old review....</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t love that at least 10 of them will leak during the service.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have the heat turned on high, I only use them 1 time and dispose of it immediately, but I still manage to have leaks in about 10 liners.  </li>
            <li>Such great replacement for the expensive footsie bath liners!!</li>

            <li> These may be SLIGHTLY thinner than the originals</li>

            <li> these are slightly (and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper but half of them have cracks on the bottom and won&#x27;t hold the water.</li>
            <li> This is such poor customer service and not worth the headache.</li>
            <li> so I now am doubling them,  just a waste</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t buy &amp;#34;just likes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a nail tech in past</li>
            <li> Not worth, the tickness of the plastic is to thin</li>
            <li> I ordered on Industry Source, but were less expensive here.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, may have been a bad batch, but I ordered two cases and got less then a case out of it.....Will not reorder again</li>
            <li> It feels like totally weak and it will break and spill the water.</li>
            <li> Poor quality</li>

            <li> But I was VERY disappointed in my last shipment.</li>
            <li> Out of 3 packs, 2 have had terrible leaks throughout the pack</li>

    <ol>
            <li> They leak and crack on the bottom</li>
            <li> A little thinner then footsie bath brand but works great!!!!</li>
            <li> the price is great.  the material is a lot thinner than the normal footsie bath liner so there will be times when i get a batch where a good number of the liners will leak.  i would still purchase it because of the price and after all it is only used once so the quality doesn&#x27;t have to be the best but thought i should note out the cons for the makers</li>
            <li> They liners are a perfect fit for  my footsie bath. Can&#x27;t really tell the difference , besides the color. Client&#x27;s tell me they don&#x27;t feel any different. Definitely will order again!</li>
            <li> These liners are wonderful! They are just as good, if not better than the Original brand...for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Thin but good for price</li>
            <li> A lot of them leaked,  I&#x27;ll just spend the extra money next time...I ruined my Foot Spa using these.   The  first  10 or do were ok,  thin,  but no leaking  then the next  &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34; in the stack all had what appears to be a cut or SLICE  in the bottom,  disaster. ..water all on the floor. ...so I now am doubling them,  just a waste..got what I paid for. ..and I usually don&#x27;t buy &amp;#34;just likes&amp;#34; type of this because of stuff like this.   Poor quality</li>
            <li> Love these. A lil thinner but perfect &amp; fits the same as footsie bath</li>
            <li> Arrived as stated. Good price</li>
            <li> item shipped quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> This item is not what it says. They don&#x27;t even fit right in the Footsie bath and they are very thin.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again,or recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Work great. Fit my Footsie spa perfectly. Like the savings.</li>
            <li> My first order was the brand name.  I read the reviews stating that the quality of these was not as good.  I was hesitant to order these. I have not found these to be of poor quality at all.  I am about a third of the way through a 100 pack and have not encountered one that is cracked.  These may be SLIGHTLY thinner than the originals but if so, the difference is so minute as to be inconsequential.  I highly recommend these which are a fraction of the price of the brand name producat.</li>
            <li> Half of them leaked and had tears on the bottom. Thought it was a fluke since the first two batches I ordered were good, but this one has damaged liners too. Never buying them again. Rather spend the time taking care of my clients than worrying about whether or not the liner is going to leak all over.</li>
            <li> Good price! And fit in my footsie bath perfectly</li>
            <li> Great value but I have had many with leaks. Out of 3 packs, 2 have had terrible leaks throughout the pack</li>
            <li> Great buy!  I will look to buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Affordable  price, works great!</li>
            <li> Bought these to save money_ Ha!!!  They may fit the footsie pedicure pan, but these are not the same quality, my nail techs had to double and triple line because they had holes in them.  Waste of money, may have been a bad batch, but I ordered two cases and got less then a case out of it.....Will not reorder again</li>
            <li> About 10 or 15 leaked last batch, this batch has not...</li>
            <li> These are perfect,&lt;br /&gt;Such a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> Great product have bought several times.</li>
            <li> Great reasonable priced replacement. Could be 4 stars if you&#x27;re critical on the match.&lt;br /&gt;Not as well made or as sturdy, but perfect for single use &amp; the client won&#x27;t care &#x27;cause only you know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t affect the quality of the foot bath.</li>
            <li> Better than buying wholesale locally. A couple of the liners had holes in them but with such a large quantity, I can&#x27;t be too mad.  They&#x27;re very sturdy!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  They fit the Footsie Bath and were better quality than the Footsie Liners.  No holes in these! And, much cheaper!!  I ordered on Industry Source, but were less expensive here.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper then the regular but I have had several leak so I always make sure to put two in at a time just in case the one leaks.</li>

            <li> Works great, better than the leading brand love the price. Please bring this product back for the same cost.</li>
            <li> Nicer than the original liners.  They actually fit better in the footsie bath.  And price is so much better.  Very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a nail tech in past i found that other liners i bought fit so snugly together that they would stick then when pried apart they would leak and it was such a headache to deal with. these are slightly (and i mean ever so slightly) big in the footsie bath but once the water in in you can&#x27;t even tell. i&#x27;ve used just under half my order so far and i am pleased to say i have not had a single problem with leaking or sticking. very well put together. defenitly will be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> poor quality, would not buy again</li>
            <li> It was cheaper than the pack for usd100.00. Not worth, the tickness of the plastic is to thin and we did not like. It feels like totally weak and it will break and spill the water. We need to use two at same time to feel safe.</li>

            <li> They fit and were the best price I could find!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering these liners for my Footsie Bath. I love the liners, I don&#x27;t love that at least 10 of them will leak during the service.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have the heat turned on high, I only use them 1 time and dispose of it immediately, but I still manage to have leaks in about 10 liners.  So, just be mindful of how you separate the liners to ensure you don&#x27;t get any tiny crack.</li>
            <li> Great color and great quality</li>
            <li> A bit thin but they work.</li>
            <li> Some of the liners have holes, they leak.</li>
            <li> I must have received a good batch because I&#x27;ve had no problems with these liners as of yet. I do keep one lined in case of any cracks and only about 1 has leaked out of about 10 pedicures. The material is thin but it is doing the job well.</li>
            <li> These liners have a great price.  In the past I have been pretty happy with them.  But I was VERY disappointed in my last shipment. They looked like they were just thrown together,  I had a difficult time fitting them into the usual storage spot.  The first 5 or 6 had to be thrown away because they were so mangled.  Still coming across several that are leaking due to cracks.  In the future I will spend the extra money and buy a different brand.  This is such poor customer service and not worth the headache.</li>
            <li> fit footsie just fine.</li>
