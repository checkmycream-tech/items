    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The best part about this lotion is it is eco-friendly and non-toxic to all sealife.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>Awesome, works all day.  </li>
            <li>Best lotion i have ever used</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, and I never burn with this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is fair and I was very happy to come home from Cancun with no burn at all.</li>
            <li>We have used it for a couple years now and it works great</li>
            <li>This product worked just great.  </li>
            <li>It is great for the reefs and works good.</li>
            <li>not as good as &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; spf45</li>
            <li>Where we could use the product, it did seem to offer good protection.</li>
            <li>Very pleased-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Reef Safe Sunscreens and sun care products for years!</li>
            <li>It was nice to know that my family and I were save from the sun but weren&#x27;t affecting the animals we were swimming with.</li>
            <li>So despite being a very effective biodegradable sunscreen, may not be the best choice in an area where CORALS are present.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this excellent sunscreen!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a soon-to-be marine ecologist, I wanted a sunscreen that would be SAFE FOR REEFS.</li>
            <li>The name Reef Safe is misleading, ok for fish but not coral.</li>
            <li>Was ok as sun screen at pools.</li>
            <li>How can they call it reef safe when it contains ingredients that are harmful to coral?  </li>
            <li>I love how I can protect myself and protect our ocean as well.</li>
            <li>To determine the impact of its sun care products on coral reefs, Reef Safe engaged the world-renown Mote Marine Tropical Research Laboratory to test the toxicity of Reef Safe’s formulations, containing varying levels of sunscreen actives, including oxybenzone, on corals representative of inshore and offshore habitats.</li>
            <li>However, with Reef Safe, it&#x27;s not just about the ingredients; it&#x27;s about how those ingredients are processed.</li>
            <li>All testing was conducted in the Mote Marine Tropical Research Laboratory to scientifically substantiate Reef Safe’s claim that their sunscreens do not harm corals.</li>
            <li>For the research, Mote Marine Laboratory tested Reef Safe’s SPF 50, SPF 45 and SPF 30 (no oxybenzone) formulas against a control setting with no product.</li>

            <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>For a bit more security on ensuring no sun rays can penetrate the skin..this is the product..</li>
            <li>Sunscreens containing benzene derivatives are not reef safe.</li>
            <li>You will not be allowed to take this into many water parks around the world and should not wear it around reef</li>
            <li>This is a 45 spf but was more like a 0 spf</li>
            <li>I did notice some crumbling once, but that was mostly on the hand I was using to apply it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily, but you need to rub it in.  </li>
            <li>Protection is most important and none of the family got sunburned even though it is very hot the day we were on the beach.</li>
            <li>Fantastic waterproof properties</li>
            <li>It protected us from the sun, didn&#x27;t wash off very quickly and of course, kept the water clean.</li>
            <li>Cost more to return that its worth.</li>
            <li>I wiped on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product, wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li>It lasted a long time, and prevented burning; but best of all it is the responsible and caring thing to do when it comes to our oceans and lakes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think Reef Safe is on their radar, but if it&#x27;s approved to go snorkeling in environmentally sensitive areas, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While fish are important in a reef ecosystem, corals are much more sensitive to disturbances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need a bio safe product such as,(Mexitan, Badger, Corral Safe, Carrribean Solutions brands).</li>
            <li>This sunscreen feels different, and not greasy like most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Reef Safe is Harmless to Corals and Causes No Visual Impact</li>
            <li>Research findings concluded Reef Safe formulas showed no visual signs of stress, bleaching or mortality to corals at any level of sunscreen treatments over periods 24 hours, 96 hours and 20 days.    </li>
            <li>Further testing included simulating snorkel boats with equivalent of 2,984 snorkelers wearing Reef Safe formulas battering the reef twice a day.”    </li>
            <li>All tanks were placed in the laboratory’s temperature controlled raceway and supplied filtered seawater at a temperature of 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit under natural light conditions.</li>
            <li>(.050) observed at any level of exposure of test fragments relative to controls, therefore proving the safety of Reef Safe SunCare products on these corals.    </li>
            <li>Safe™ SunCare    Reef Safe SunCare, was introduced in 1996 by Tropical Seas of Ormond Beach, FL, as a sunscreen scientifically proven to biodegrade in oceans, lakes and rivers; thus protecting fragile ecosystems while protecting skin.</li>
            <li>Reef Safe sunscreens were subjected to a comprehensive series of independent laboratory tests to support and authenticate the biodegradability of the lotions.</li>
            <li>contact person made sure that we received it before we left for our trip.</li>
            <li>I used this to go snorkeling (for the first time) in Bermuda.  </li>
            <li>I wear it on a daily basis and I haven&#x27;t gotten any sun on my easily tanned arms.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t work and my whole family fried.....</li>
            <li>“This test was designed to simulate conditions found at coral reef sites impacted by large volumes of bathers, snorkelers and scuba divers, all using Reef Safe formulated sunscreens, which includes oxybenzone as one of the active ingredients.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the other reviews...</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re on a beach (or anywhere) that&#x27;s not near a coral reef, I would think it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>Research also found that Reef Safe’s waterproof formula allows less than three percent of the product to come off in water.    </li>
            <li>it spreads just as easily as any other sunscreen and we didn&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li>When applying, you must immediately and completely rub in or it remains very noticeable on the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it goes on really nicely, it&#x27;s not thick or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It provided adequate protection, the only downside is that it leaves a white film on the skin.  </li>
            <li>cake up like some reviews stated, they just used too much and didn&#x27;t take the time to rub it in properly.</li>
            <li>small quantity for huge price.</li>
            <li>The research found that Reef Safe SunCare products biodegrade, on average, less than 90 days in seawater and freshwater.</li>
            <li>just read other reviews (and subsequently some research) about active ingredient OXYBENZONE not being reef safe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that a little bit of this lotion goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s true that a little bit of this lotion goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was not chemical free, and was not allowed into the nature reserve.</li>
            <li> This being said after a week long trip out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Corals were ranked on a scale of 1-6 for tissue loss and color; 1 being no live tissue and 6 being no loss of tissue.    </li>
            <li> A little on the pricy side for the smaller bottle, but then again, it seems that all sunscreens are now.</li>
            <li> No evidence of toxicity to microorganisms nor other sea life was detected.</li>
            <li> sunscreen contains 6.0% OXYBENZONE as an active ingredient.</li>
            <li> There are four typical sunscreen ingredients known to cause bleaching of reefs, they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the same as order I receive a differ I do not use is no good</li>
            <li> This lotion does not sting my eyes like other sunscreens in the past have.</li>
            <li> The test results revealed at the end of the 20 day study there were no mortalities and no significant difference</li>
            <li> This item may be a little bit over priced but it did prevent sunburn.</li>
            <li> For those that do not know, oxybenzone is a chemical know to harm the fragile coral that composed reefs and it is suspected to have very negative health</li>
            <li> First time for bad review ever,</li>
            <li> product is NOT safe for corals (will cause coral bleaching)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ordered two bottles of this only to get them in the mail and realize that they ARE NOT reef</li>
            <li> “Coral Reefs have been subjected to damage over the past decades, and one of the supposed contributing factors is the effect that sunscreen chemicals have on the health of corals,” commented Dan Knorr, President and C.E.O of Tropical Seas.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or make it look weird and zinc-y, and, the label says you can be in the water for 80 minutes before re-applying.  </li>
            <li> Hard corals tested were representative of inshore and offshore habitats.</li>
            <li> descriptions of products like this indicate that it is can be hard to apply (that it gets crumbly).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After snorkeling, I applied a regular sunscreen and ended the day without any bad effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> we took this with to mexico and needed to use at least 3 bottles in 7 days!</li>
            <li> poor value.</li>
            <li> I usually only use sunscreens that are recommended by the EWG (Environmental Working Group), as I&#x27;ve learned sunscreens can have some awful ingredients that you don&#x27;t need (or want).  </li>
            <li> did not use on my face because I had not tried it and was a bit afraid of a reaction since I have a tendancy to break out.</li>
            <li> will never buy this sunscreen again and I am quite appalled that they are trying to market it as something specifically for people that want to protect reefs and are looking for \\&quot;earth-friendly\\&quot; products!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE DIVING/SNORKELING/SWIMMING IN REEFS!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is NOT safe for corals (will cause coral bleaching)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a soon-to-be marine ecologist, I wanted a sunscreen that would be SAFE FOR REEFS. Especially since I was going to be scuba diving in the already-degraded Caribbean reefs. Unfortunately, I ordered two bottles of this only to get them in the mail and realize that they ARE NOT reef safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen contains 6.0% OXYBENZONE as an active ingredient. For those that do not know, oxybenzone is a chemical know to harm the fragile coral that composed reefs and it is suspected to have very negative health aspects.&lt;br /&gt;It also contains 7.5% OCTINOXATE, another compound known to have harmful effects on corals and people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;reef-safe\\&quot; test only is for fish NOT for corals (i.e. they tested this product on animals to determine whether or not it would kill the fish). While fish are important in a reef ecosystem, corals are much more sensitive to disturbances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this sunscreen again and I am quite appalled that they are trying to market it as something specifically for people that want to protect reefs and are looking for \\&quot;earth-friendly\\&quot; products! Stick with safer zinc-based sunscreen people! I, personally, will be going to go with Badger sunscreen from now on (http://www.badgerbalm.com/s-35-coral-reef-safe-sunscreen.aspx).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that a little bit of this lotion goes a long way.  It spreads easily, but you need to rub it in.  Fantastic waterproof properties and I would use this product again as I didn&#x27;t get an ounce of sun damage after 7 days in the Hawaiian sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I thought this lotion protects you from the suns harmful rays without harming the fragile reef system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read other reviews (and subsequently some research) about active ingredient OXYBENZONE not being reef safe. So despite being a very effective biodegradable sunscreen, may not be the best choice in an area where CORALS are present.  I understand it is not harmful to fish though.  So if you&#x27;re on a beach (or anywhere) that&#x27;s not near a coral reef, I would think it&#x27;s just fine.  If you will be swimming in and amongst the coral reef, I have researched that a biodegradable zinc oxide based sunscreen is the safest.</li>
            <li> We did not receive the sunscreen before our trip Mexico. Though i had ordered it well ahead of our departure. So we will have to save it for another time. It was recommended by our snorkel guide.</li>
            <li> There are four typical sunscreen ingredients known to cause bleaching of reefs, they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxybenzone (benzophenone-3)&lt;br /&gt;Butylparaben&lt;br /&gt;Octinoxate&lt;br /&gt;4-methylbenzylidene camphor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains two of these ingredients, as indicated by the MSDS here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> It is great for the reefs and works good. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It was nice to know that my family and I were save from the sun but weren&#x27;t affecting the animals we were swimming with.</li>
            <li> Not the same as order I receive a differ I do not use is no good I went to cancun. And the tell me I can&#x27;t used</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. It protected us from the sun, didn&#x27;t wash off very quickly and of course, kept the water clean.</li>
            <li> This product is not allowed in parks in Mexico,harms the reefs.The spray contains oxybenzone, octinoxate both banded at parks.The name Reef Safe is misleading, ok for fish but not coral.Was ok as sun screen at pools.Cost more to return that its worth.You need a bio safe product such as,(Mexitan, Badger, Corral Safe, Carrribean Solutions brands). First time for bad review ever,</li>
            <li> How can they call it reef safe when it contains ingredients that are harmful to coral?  I feel I was duped.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen feels different, and not greasy like most sunscreens. I never got burnt while wearing this product. This being said after a week long trip out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Reef Safe Sunscreens and sun care products for years! I am very fair skinned, and I never burn with this product.  This lotion does not sting my eyes like other sunscreens in the past have. The best part about this lotion is it is eco-friendly and non-toxic to all sealife. I love how I can protect myself and protect our ocean as well. They also list their testing on their website:    REEF SAFE™ SUNCARE PROVEN NON-TOXIC TO TESTED CORALS  **Study Conducted by Mote Marine Tropical Research Laboratory Reveals Reef Safe is Harmless to Corals and Causes No Visual Impact**    Ormond Beach, FL (March 2, 2016) To determine the impact of its sun care products on coral reefs, Reef Safe engaged the world-renown Mote Marine Tropical Research Laboratory to test the toxicity of Reef Safe’s formulations, containing varying levels of sunscreen actives, including oxybenzone, on corals representative of inshore and offshore habitats. Research findings concluded Reef Safe formulas showed no visual signs of stress, bleaching or mortality to corals at any level of sunscreen treatments over periods 24 hours, 96 hours and 20 days.    “Coral Reefs have been subjected to damage over the past decades, and one of the supposed contributing factors is the effect that sunscreen chemicals have on the health of corals,” commented Dan Knorr, President and C.E.O of Tropical Seas. “This test was designed to simulate conditions found at coral reef sites impacted by large volumes of bathers, snorkelers and scuba divers, all using Reef Safe formulated sunscreens, which includes oxybenzone as one of the active ingredients. However, with Reef Safe, it&#x27;s not just about the ingredients; it&#x27;s about how those ingredients are processed. Further testing included simulating snorkel boats with equivalent of 2,984 snorkelers wearing Reef Safe formulas battering the reef twice a day.”    All testing was conducted in the Mote Marine Tropical Research Laboratory to scientifically substantiate Reef Safe’s claim that their sunscreens do not harm corals. For the research, Mote Marine Laboratory tested Reef Safe’s SPF 50, SPF 45 and SPF 30 (no oxybenzone) formulas against a control setting with no product. Hard corals tested were representative of inshore and offshore habitats. Each of the coral fragments (100 each) were distributed equally between 20 tanks with five of each species in a given 20 liter aquarium. All tanks were placed in the laboratory’s temperature controlled raceway and supplied filtered seawater at a temperature of 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit under natural light conditions. Before starting the test, each fragment was visually inspected to evaluate the health of the corals, to be compared up to 20 days or the completion of the study. All corals were visually assessed using a coral health code established by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC).    Each day before the sunscreen was added to the tanks, a condition survey was completed to note each individual coral&#x27;s health. Corals were ranked on a scale of 1-6 for tissue loss and color; 1 being no live tissue and 6 being no loss of tissue.    The test results revealed at the end of the 20 day study there were no mortalities and no significant difference (.050) observed at any level of exposure of test fragments relative to controls, therefore proving the safety of Reef Safe SunCare products on these corals.    About Reef Safe™ SunCare    Reef Safe SunCare, was introduced in 1996 by Tropical Seas of Ormond Beach, FL, as a sunscreen scientifically proven to biodegrade in oceans, lakes and rivers; thus protecting fragile ecosystems while protecting skin. Reef Safe sunscreens were subjected to a comprehensive series of independent laboratory tests to support and authenticate the biodegradability of the lotions. The research found that Reef Safe SunCare products biodegrade, on average, less than 90 days in seawater and freshwater. No evidence of toxicity to microorganisms nor other sea life was detected. Research also found that Reef Safe’s waterproof formula allows less than three percent of the product to come off in water.

            <li> We utilized this sunscreen in Cozumel.  It provided adequate protection, the only downside is that it leaves a white film on the skin.  When applying, you must immediately and completely rub in or it remains very noticeable on the skin.  Protection is most important and none of the family got sunburned even though it is very hot the day we were on the beach.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was not chemical free, and was not allowed into the nature reserve. Could not use it. Harmful to reefs.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  We have used it for a couple years now and it works great</li>
            <li> Awesome, works all day.  Best lotion i have ever used</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  I usually only use sunscreens that are recommended by the EWG (Environmental Working Group), as I&#x27;ve learned sunscreens can have some awful ingredients that you don&#x27;t need (or want).  I don&#x27;t think Reef Safe is on their radar, but if it&#x27;s approved to go snorkeling in environmentally sensitive areas, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it goes on really nicely, it&#x27;s not thick or sticky.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or make it look weird and zinc-y, and, the label says you can be in the water for 80 minutes before re-applying.  I wear it on a daily basis and I haven&#x27;t gotten any sun on my easily tanned arms.  I highly recommend this excellent sunscreen!</li>
            <li> poor value. small quantity for huge price. Doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> This product worked just great.  It lasted a long time, and prevented burning; but best of all it is the responsible and caring thing to do when it comes to our oceans and lakes.</li>
            <li> For a bit more security on ensuring no sun rays can penetrate the skin..this is the product..no burn, or tan with this one.</li>
            <li> No sunburn! My skin is fair and I was very happy to come home from Cancun with no burn at all.</li>
            <li> not as good as &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; spf45</li>
            <li> Very nice product, wish it came in a bigger bottle! we took this with to mexico and needed to use at least 3 bottles in 7 days!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know until I saw the ingredient list after I purchased and received the item. I should have paid more attention to the other reviews... I did not even use this sunscreen because it has ingredients that I&#x27;m trying to avoid. I won&#x27;t buy this again. It has Octinoxate, Octisalate, Oxybenzone, Methylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea, and Propylparaben.</li>
            <li> This item may be a little bit over priced but it did prevent sunburn. It didn. cake up like some reviews stated, they just used too much and didn&#x27;t take the time to rub it in properly.</li>
            <li> We went snorkeling in Cancun and bought this. Very pleased- it spreads just as easily as any other sunscreen and we didn&#x27;t get burned. A little on the pricy side for the smaller bottle, but then again, it seems that all sunscreens are now.</li>
            <li> The service was beyond what anyone could expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contact person made sure that we received it before we left for our trip.</li>
            <li> Sunscreens containing benzene derivatives are not reef safe. You will not be allowed to take this into many water parks around the world and should not wear it around reef systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See: Danovaro, Bongioni, Corinaldesi: Sunscreens cause coral bleaching by promoting viral infections.  NIH, 2008, PMC2291018.</li>
            <li> When we visited an &amp;#34;ecopark&amp;#34; in Mexico (Yal-ku Lagoon in Maya Riviera area) they reviewed at the ingredients on the bottle and would not permit us to use it in the park and we had to shower off before we could enter the water.  Where we could use the product, it did seem to offer good protection.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work and my whole family fried.....This is a 45 spf but was more like a 0 spf</li>
            <li> I used this to go snorkeling (for the first time) in Bermuda.  I applied about 1-2 hours before I actually went into the water (just because that&#x27;s when I got dressed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some descriptions of products like this indicate that it is can be hard to apply (that it gets crumbly).  I had no problem.  I wiped on smoothly.  I did notice some crumbling once, but that was mostly on the hand I was using to apply it.  I rinsed my hand and continued applying the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After snorkeling, I applied a regular sunscreen and ended the day without any bad effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use on my face because I had not tried it and was a bit afraid of a reaction since I have a tendancy to break out.</li>
