            <li>I have to say, most of the Axe hair products aren&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the fancy $30+ dinky 2 oz items who&#x27;s branding is more successful than their product.</li>
            <li>Recommended buy for sure!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>In fact it&#x27;s best to wash completely before trying to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>So much better than AmericanCrew and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li>Hold lasts an hour at most...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Axe Shine Pomade because it keeps my hair in place all day, even in rain.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Working some water into it makes it a bit more versatile.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the key with this stuff, I think, is to choose the one that&#x27;s best for your hair type.</li>
            <li>great thing about this stuff, then, is that it offers an approximation of the outstanding hold of oil-based pomades (nickel-sized?</li>
            <li>Amazon has a great bulk deal and it reduces the price per item considerably.</li>
            <li>it smells great, feels great, overall highly recommended.</li>
            <li>a greasy look is too easy achieve.</li>
            <li>easy.</li>
            <li>it leaves no residue and easy to wash off in the shower</li>
            <li>Strong hold, too.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong though.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product that will leave your hair shiny without a strong hold, this is your product.</li>
            <li>It was a good experience to try new Gel.</li>
            <li>find it&#x27;s best to use right after I get out of the shower and towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li>this axe stuff is a little lighter and pliable, but still has excellent hold properties.</li>
            <li>fortunately, i found some of this leftover in a container that WAS THROWN</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m buying 2 and getting one free.</li>
            <li>This pomade is great because not only does it hold hair in place</li>
            <li>By far the most effective hair product I&#x27;ve ever used, and</li>
            <li>I love the way the Pomade looks, and it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li>B001LFHYOI Groom &amp; Clean Greaseless Hair Control, 4.5 oz.]]for a light hold) and looks metal as f</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s got a good but soft hold, smells pretty nice, and puts a decent shine on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;when</li>
            <li>the hold is very good, but the ability to style with it takes a little effort.</li>
            <li>Cool container.</li>
            <li>the scent is a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>But it should hold better than it does which is maybe an hour at the most, and that&#x27;s only SOMETIMES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you wear a cap all day and then think you&#x27;re just going to quickly throw some product in and go</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff for several years and it is just as good as it was when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the smell is also pleasant and it does the job just as well as say american crew which costs 3 times as much.</li>
            <li>If I wait till later on in the day it doesn&#x27;t style quite as easy and needs a lot more.</li>
            <li>this only looks good in my hair when it&#x27;s exactly the right length.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Axe shine pomade for a few months now and think it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite pomade.</li>
            <li>if you want to look like the Fonz...easy to apply and fun to wear...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only going to be buying this stuff online from now one because it was so nice to get a jar that hasn&#x27;t already got some strangers fingers plunged into it.</li>
            <li>Sleek is the right word for it.  </li>
            <li>It is water based and definitely washes off real easy for which I am very thankful.</li>
            <li>I can never find this in my local stores, I think it&#x27;s pretty popular.</li>
            <li>The best part about it is that it makes my black hair shine without actually \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; greasy.</li>
            <li>When I was looking for a new Gel to use to Smooth my hair.</li>
            <li>The container didnt have much in which i ran out of it really quick.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much</li>
            <li>It reminds me very much of a distilled Groom &amp; Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that the classic hairstyles of the fifties are coming back, people are looking for products that give them this clean and sophisticated look - sleek</li>
            <li>Great product, works like it is claimed to, smooths a little more than i had expected</li>
            <li>The price has doubled since I first bought it so hopefully it has leveled out now.</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>Though the price is a bit high, particularly retail (~$11), this pomade is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I recieved this pretty fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>It is a fraction of the cost of American Crew, but offers the same great shine and moldable hold all day.</li>
            <li>Takes very little to get a great hold and keeps my hair looking natural.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for any male looking for a classy smooth clean look in their hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing this particular brand of pomade since it first came out</li>
            <li>They always gave you spiky, hard hair which was more fitting for a 16 year old.</li>
            <li>The product recommends putting it on wet hair for better hold.</li>
            <li>look without much effort.  </li>
            <li>if you use too much, if leaves your hair feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>and I not only feel comfortable throughout my work day</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The shine this pomade leaves allows for a coat on my hair that the ladies can not resist and flock to like bees on honey, except they are more rough</li>
            <li>much needed</li>
            <li>The Gel dont give much of a hold.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>but I really like the product and have been using the stuff for years since.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and flake off where you look like you have crazy dandruff.</li>
            <li>but she really likes it for her flyaway hairs.</li>
            <li>This product has been working very well for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;PACKAGING &amp; PRESENTATION:&lt;br /&gt;axe is marketed to impressionable young men with the hopes of scoring a lovely female for the night or eternity.</li>
            <li>There are alot of other pomades that are better.</li>
            <li>When I first apply it to my hair it felt rough but after it makes the hair smooth.</li>
            <li>If you want nice slick non greasy looking hair than</li>
            <li>you can get different types of hold depending on how much you use - use a little bit and get a lighter, flexible, more natural look/hold, or use a lot to get a super-shiny, strong hold.</li>
            <li>I went back to the sophisticated American Crew products and they always delivered.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and it gives me just the right amount of shine (but not too much).  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>This is what I was looking for, great shine with just enough hold to keep my hair in place but not to make it heavy and sticky, it comes off very easly as well, a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be waxier, with a little more tack to it.  </li>
            <li>If it gets out of place, I can run a comb through it without adding water and it goes right back to the way I started the day.</li>
            <li>As I got older I began to question how mature gels looked.</li>
            <li>I like this pomade more than Murray&#x27;s or just regular hair gel because it&#x27;s not really sticky</li>
            <li>Very soft and keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li>The shine is just enough and not cheesy at all.</li>
            <li>However, this may be true for other products of this type.</li>
            <li>This product is not only what i was expecting but it has surpassed my expectations and brought my \\&quot;game\\&quot; to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>the jar is plastic, but unlike most pomade containers that are circular, there are little \\&quot;wings\\&quot; that protrude from the jar, making it easier to open and close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even better, since it&#x27;s water-based, you can restyle if necessary with a little bit of water, and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair with dishsoap to remove</li>
            <li>Even better, since it&#x27;s water-based, you can restyle if necessary with a little bit of water, and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair with dishsoap to remove</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a hard time gripping to get it opened.</li>
            <li>Then when you wash your hair it makes it so soft and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happily, this stuff offers a hold strong enough for my hair, but it dries with a matte finish that darkens my hair slightly while bringing out some natural variations.</li>
            <li>I have tried countless water based and oil based pomades to achieve a neat side part and classic haircut.</li>
            <li>As a college student living in the snowy/windy Troy, NY area, I highly recommend this product to any and all hair enthusiast and occasional stylist.</li>
            <li>I instantly think high school locker room and douche bags.</li>
            <li>I like about it, and my hair is a bit long right now, when it dries, the hair stays the same.  </li>
            <li>Need to use relatively quickly as it does seem to dry out and harden up a bit if you leave it unused for too long.</li>
            <li>&amp; APPEARANCE:&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a light blue color with a little silver.</li>
            <li>Or at least not as strong and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I was at a major pharmacy yesterday and they were selling ONE container of this stuff for almost $10.  </li>
            <li>All of that said, the hold that pomades offer is the only thing strong enough to tame my mane without a helmet-headed gel</li>
            <li>Unlike that of standard hairgels this product does not harden, but instead holds hair in place in a soft yet durable fashion.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t something that I would recommend especially if you want your hair to be all soft.</li>
            <li>I will not ever go back to old fashioned pomade.</li>
            <li>Plus, my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy or hard and it holds amazing with just a little hair spray.</li>
            <li>i was pleasantly surprised because my only experience with pomade before this was the murray&#x27;s pomade, which is super thick and waxy.</li>
            <li>yet it still keeps your hair in place without the typical hard, crunchy feel of most hair get products.  </li>
            <li>*** when long, the in-between is a nightmare of goofy looking waves and parts that inevitably result in one side of my head looking sloppy and childish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was a last ditch attempt at giving some tiny bit of order to my frizzy black hair, tried a lot of waxes and gels in the past, none worked (hold was too strong and shine was too low).</li>

            <li> B001LFHYOI Groom &amp; Clean Greaseless Hair Control, 4.5 oz.]]for a light hold) and looks metal as f</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s got a good but soft hold, smells pretty nice, and puts a decent shine on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;when</li>
            <li> the hold is very good, but the ability to style with it takes a little effort.</li>
            <li> Cool container.</li>
            <li> the scent is a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> But it should hold better than it does which is maybe an hour at the most, and that&#x27;s only SOMETIMES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you wear a cap all day and then think you&#x27;re just going to quickly throw some product in and go</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for several years and it is just as good as it was when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the smell is also pleasant and it does the job just as well as say american crew which costs 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> If I wait till later on in the day it doesn&#x27;t style quite as easy and needs a lot more.</li>
            <li> this only looks good in my hair when it&#x27;s exactly the right length.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Axe shine pomade for a few months now and think it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li> By far my favorite pomade.</li>
            <li> if you want to look like the Fonz...easy to apply and fun to wear...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only going to be buying this stuff online from now one because it was so nice to get a jar that hasn&#x27;t already got some strangers fingers plunged into it.</li>
            <li> Sleek is the right word for it.  </li>
            <li> It is water based and definitely washes off real easy for which I am very thankful.</li>
            <li> I can never find this in my local stores, I think it&#x27;s pretty popular.</li>
            <li> The best part about it is that it makes my black hair shine without actually \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; greasy.</li>
            <li> When I was looking for a new Gel to use to Smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> The container didnt have much in which i ran out of it really quick.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much</li>
            <li> It reminds me very much of a distilled Groom &amp; Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that the classic hairstyles of the fifties are coming back, people are looking for products that give them this clean and sophisticated look - sleek</li>
            <li> Great product, works like it is claimed to, smooths a little more than i had expected</li>
            <li> The price has doubled since I first bought it so hopefully it has leveled out now.</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> Though the price is a bit high, particularly retail (~$11), this pomade is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I recieved this pretty fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> It is a fraction of the cost of American Crew, but offers the same great shine and moldable hold all day.</li>
            <li> Takes very little to get a great hold and keeps my hair looking natural.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for any male looking for a classy smooth clean look in their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this particular brand of pomade since it first came out</li>
            <li> They always gave you spiky, hard hair which was more fitting for a 16 year old.</li>
            <li> The product recommends putting it on wet hair for better hold.</li>
            <li> look without much effort.  </li>
            <li> if you use too much, if leaves your hair feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> and I not only feel comfortable throughout my work day</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The shine this pomade leaves allows for a coat on my hair that the ladies can not resist and flock to like bees on honey, except they are more rough</li>
            <li> much needed</li>
            <li> The Gel dont give much of a hold.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> but I really like the product and have been using the stuff for years since.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and flake off where you look like you have crazy dandruff.</li>
            <li> but she really likes it for her flyaway hairs.</li>
            <li> This product has been working very well for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;PACKAGING &amp; PRESENTATION:&lt;br /&gt;axe is marketed to impressionable young men with the hopes of scoring a lovely female for the night or eternity.</li>
            <li> There are alot of other pomades that are better.</li>
            <li> When I first apply it to my hair it felt rough but after it makes the hair smooth.</li>
            <li> If you want nice slick non greasy looking hair than</li>
            <li> you can get different types of hold depending on how much you use - use a little bit and get a lighter, flexible, more natural look/hold, or use a lot to get a super-shiny, strong hold.</li>
            <li> I went back to the sophisticated American Crew products and they always delivered.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it gives me just the right amount of shine (but not too much).  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for, great shine with just enough hold to keep my hair in place but not to make it heavy and sticky, it comes off very easly as well, a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be waxier, with a little more tack to it.  </li>
            <li> If it gets out of place, I can run a comb through it without adding water and it goes right back to the way I started the day.</li>
            <li> As I got older I began to question how mature gels looked.</li>
            <li> I like this pomade more than Murray&#x27;s or just regular hair gel because it&#x27;s not really sticky</li>
            <li> Very soft and keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li> The shine is just enough and not cheesy at all.</li>
            <li> However, this may be true for other products of this type.</li>
            <li> This product is not only what i was expecting but it has surpassed my expectations and brought my \\&quot;game\\&quot; to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> the jar is plastic, but unlike most pomade containers that are circular, there are little \\&quot;wings\\&quot; that protrude from the jar, making it easier to open and close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even better, since it&#x27;s water-based, you can restyle if necessary with a little bit of water, and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair with dishsoap to remove</li>
            <li> Even better, since it&#x27;s water-based, you can restyle if necessary with a little bit of water, and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair with dishsoap to remove</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a hard time gripping to get it opened.</li>
            <li> Then when you wash your hair it makes it so soft and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Happily, this stuff offers a hold strong enough for my hair, but it dries with a matte finish that darkens my hair slightly while bringing out some natural variations.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless water based and oil based pomades to achieve a neat side part and classic haircut.</li>
            <li> As a college student living in the snowy/windy Troy, NY area, I highly recommend this product to any and all hair enthusiast and occasional stylist.</li>
            <li> I instantly think high school locker room and douche bags.</li>
            <li> I like about it, and my hair is a bit long right now, when it dries, the hair stays the same.  </li>
            <li> Need to use relatively quickly as it does seem to dry out and harden up a bit if you leave it unused for too long.</li>
            <li> &amp; APPEARANCE:&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a light blue color with a little silver.</li>
            <li> Or at least not as strong and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I was at a major pharmacy yesterday and they were selling ONE container of this stuff for almost $10.  </li>
            <li> All of that said, the hold that pomades offer is the only thing strong enough to tame my mane without a helmet-headed gel</li>
            <li> Unlike that of standard hairgels this product does not harden, but instead holds hair in place in a soft yet durable fashion.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t something that I would recommend especially if you want your hair to be all soft.</li>
            <li> I will not ever go back to old fashioned pomade.</li>
            <li> Plus, my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy or hard and it holds amazing with just a little hair spray.</li>
            <li> i was pleasantly surprised because my only experience with pomade before this was the murray&#x27;s pomade, which is super thick and waxy.</li>
            <li> yet it still keeps your hair in place without the typical hard, crunchy feel of most hair get products.  </li>
            <li> *** when long, the in-between is a nightmare of goofy looking waves and parts that inevitably result in one side of my head looking sloppy and childish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was a last ditch attempt at giving some tiny bit of order to my frizzy black hair, tried a lot of waxes and gels in the past, none worked (hold was too strong and shine was too low).</li>
            <li> i have straight, coarse, fairly thick (almost 24 Years old at the time of writing this) hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many other waxes and other pomades in the past but this takes the medal!</li>
            <li> i slick my hair back for a clean, neat, everyday kinda look.</li>
            <li> It does not get soft or lose it&#x27;s shape or gets puffy as with other types of gels or liquid products that when they dry they harden.....</li>
            <li> One tub actually goes a long long way.  </li>
            <li> While this works really well for a short, messy style (no work whatsoever, with just a little [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Sad to see that it is no longer available.</li>
            <li> otherwise, settle for monkey brains pomade if you don&#x27;t want to pay for perceived sex appeal.</li>
            <li> have ridiculously thick dirty-blonde hair with waves that battle cowlicks in a fashion that makes it stand straight up when I towel dry it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any white flaking as some other gels cause.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair in place, I have thick Italian Hair, and all my hair for 61 Years old, Thank you Lord</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair, but not ridiculously thick.</li>
            <li> This pomade is close to American Crew or even Aveda, for much much less.  </li>
            <li> They all use the same haircut, but I need my hair to be a little longer to use this.</li>
            <li> When my hands are wet</li>
            <li> I bought this product roughly around 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> A caveat, though, is that this is contingent on your hair-type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t clump in the hair, it really holds the style for a long time (which is hard to find for my boyfriend because he has really thick hair)</li>
            <li> Worse, oil-based pomades are difficult to get out of your hair and stain pretty much everything your head comes into contact with.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS if you have thin or easily manageable hair--if this product leaves your scalp oily or weird no matter how little you use, then clearly it&#x27;s not right for your hair type.some natural variations.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long well as</li>
            <li> no greasy feeling like with some other pomades out</li>
            <li> combing it through the first time is difficult as well.</li>
            <li> Gives your hair shine and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky/greasy like other products.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it gives a greasier feel than expected, even when using the recommended amount (about the size of a dime) or less.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS if you have thin or easily manageable hair--if this product leaves your scalp oily or weird no matter how little you use, then clearly it&#x27;s not right for your hair type.</li>
            <li> I use less than what&#x27;s recommended.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I typically despise all Axe products, their marketing strategy, their smell, and everything they stand for.</li>
            <li> quite expensive for any hairstyling product, especially when there&#x27;s only 2.64oz of it, and you&#x27;re on a tight budget like me.</li>
            <li> in the past, but--in contrast to guys with pomade in their black hair, giving it a patent-leather finish--these darken my hair just enough to make it look nasty, on top of the oily sheen, no matter how well</li>
            <li> I have that as the day progresses, no matter how little I use, the pomade will spread and leave the forehead feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Has a little bit of shine but not &amp;#34;hair gel&amp;#34; shine.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I watched too much Hulu when AXE was doing their commercials like crazy years ago</li>
            <li> With this stuff, you can go with the messy, spikey, clean-cut, etc.</li>
            <li> but I started using this a few days ago</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a few problems with it:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments about how my hair looks after using this product.</li>
            <li> Gives hair shine without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> but the hold is nonexistent and the product builds up in your hair pretty badly.</li>
            <li> Does not give you a hard gel look.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hands feeling all oily and it makes my hair all hard.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores sometimes</li>
            <li> A hard feature to find in a water based pomade is pliabilty all day without drying.</li>
            <li> I like this product it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair product that works with my strait thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I chose this one because there is a picture of an obviously thick, longish hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean my hair stands up strait for about 4 inches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> the feel of it is VERY thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an odor or that crusty look or feel that gel can leave behind.</li>
            <li> at the end of the day, it leaves your head feeling really stiff, dirty, and greasy.</li>
            <li> only downside is that Axe hair products are stupid expensive.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s probably the reason why it&#x27;s so EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> bad thing is my wife likes it too.</li>
            <li> I like Murray&#x27;s hold, style, and shine, but I&#x27;m sick of how Murray&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t come out of your hair until you shave your head.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a great buy for the price at the time.</li>
            <li> This pomade smells really good. It gives the hair shine and has good hold. The product recommends putting it on wet hair for better hold. It&#x27;s very easy to wash off. Does not give you a hard gel look.</li>
            <li> This pomade is close to American Crew or even Aveda, for much much less.  I would highly recommend.  I don&#x27;t like the packaging (seems overly bulky for no reason).</li>
            <li> buying the 3-pack definitely saves you some money as opposed to buying individually at the store.  also gives great shine and product dries nicely once applied.  no greasy feeling like with some other pomades out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell is also pleasant and it does the job just as well as say american crew which costs 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> Cool container. Enough of the stuff in there to last you a while. Strong hold, too. My only complaint is that it gives a greasier feel than expected, even when using the recommended amount (about the size of a dime) or less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this particular brand of pomade since it first came out and I gotta say: This stuff is awesome!  Unlike that of standard hairgels this product does not harden, but instead holds hair in place in a soft yet durable fashion.  As a college student living in the snowy/windy Troy, NY area, I highly recommend this product to any and all hair enthusiast and occasional stylist.</li>
            <li> I grew up using American Crew&#x27;s Pomade and throughout my teenage years I started using gels. As I got older I began to question how mature gels looked. They always gave you spiky, hard hair which was more fitting for a 16 year old. I went back to the sophisticated American Crew products and they always delivered. I didn&#x27;t like the Pomade for my hair style, so I used their Fiber and it did the job.    Now that the classic hairstyles of the fifties are coming back, people are looking for products that give them this clean and sophisticated look - sleek it turns out is a good name for this Pomade.     I have to say, most of the Axe hair products aren&#x27;t great. This one isn&#x27;t like any of them. Axe has found a perfect balance of control, shine, and aroma with this product and I&#x27;d buy it any day over the more expensive \\&quot;salon brand\\&quot; Pomades.       Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Axe shine pomade for a few months now and think it&#x27;s a great product.  You don&#x27;t have to use very much yet it still keeps your hair in place without the typical hard, crunchy feel of most hair get products.  With this stuff, you can go with the messy, spikey, clean-cut, etc. look without much effort.  A little goes a long way...if you use too much, if leaves your hair feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that Axe hair products are stupid expensive.  I was at a major pharmacy yesterday and they were selling ONE container of this stuff for almost $10.  Amazon had 3 for around $11+ on sale.  You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a 3 pack back in november finally through it all. Sad to see that it is no longer available. You will be missed. By far the most effective hair product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used the fancy $30+ dinky 2 oz items who&#x27;s branding is more successful than their product.</li>
            <li> I can never find this in my local stores, I think it&#x27;s pretty popular. Amazon has a great price for this pomade and I recieved this pretty fast in the mail. I like this pomade more than Murray&#x27;s or just regular hair gel because it&#x27;s not really sticky, it doesn&#x27;t clump in the hair, it really holds the style for a long time (which is hard to find for my boyfriend because he has really thick hair) and it&#x27;s really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Barring the Axe bias found among adults I have found that this pomade works fairly well.  The scent is a bit strong though.  A little goes a long well as a greasy look is too easy achieve. I have that as the day progresses, no matter how little I use, the pomade will spread and leave the forehead feeling oily. However, this may be true for other products of this type.</li>
            <li> SUBJECT:&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m Chinese. i have straight, coarse, fairly thick (almost 24 Years old at the time of writing this) hair. i don&#x27;t have a rockabilly pompadour, neither do i do waves. i slick my hair back for a clean, neat, everyday kinda look. I like Murray&#x27;s hold, style, and shine, but I&#x27;m sick of how Murray&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t come out of your hair until you shave your head. at the end of the day, it leaves your head feeling really stiff, dirty, and greasy. My comb can testify to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE:&lt;br /&gt;this goes for about $6-7 at walmart. quite expensive for any hairstyling product, especially when there&#x27;s only 2.64oz of it, and you&#x27;re on a tight budget like me. fortunately, i found some of this leftover in a container that WAS THROWN AWAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING &amp; PRESENTATION:&lt;br /&gt;axe is marketed to impressionable young men with the hopes of scoring a lovely female for the night or eternity. that&#x27;s probably the reason why it&#x27;s so EXPENSIVE! the jar is plastic, but unlike most pomade containers that are circular, there are little \\&quot;wings\\&quot; that protrude from the jar, making it easier to open and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE &amp; APPEARANCE:&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a light blue color with a little silver. the feel of it is VERY thick and sticky. the scent is a light fresh scent. the hold is very good, but the ability to style with it takes a little effort. combing it through the first time is difficult as well. there&#x27;s a moderate amount of shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WASHABILITY:&lt;br /&gt;washes out like water. easy. done. no mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER:&lt;br /&gt;n/a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve got the means, get it. otherwise, settle for monkey brains pomade if you don&#x27;t want to pay for perceived sex appeal.</li>
            <li> This was a last ditch attempt at giving some tiny bit of order to my frizzy black hair, tried a lot of waxes and gels in the past, none worked (hold was too strong and shine was too low). Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair but I started using this a few days ago and I not only feel comfortable throughout my work day but I am already getting compliments for how nice my hair looks now. I am very glad I made this purchase. It is water based and definitely washes off real easy for which I am very thankful. American crew smells nicer to me but that&#x27;s a different review. I think this product does what it claims to do. The best part about it is that it makes my black hair shine without actually \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; greasy. Great product! Recommended buy for sure!</li>
            <li> Definitely leaves your hair shiny and looking like you just got out of some water but the hold is nonexistent and the product builds up in your hair pretty badly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolute best!! So much better than AmericanCrew and at a fraction of the cost. The shine is just enough and not cheesy at all. Great hold too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair, but not ridiculously thick. There&#x27;s a few problems with it:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell. It&#x27;s not minty. It&#x27;s not good. It&#x27;s not awful. Just something that could maybe be.. say.. nonexistent? Or at least not as strong and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;2. Greasy. I feel like I just took a bath in french fries when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;3. Hold lasts an hour at most... sometimes. It&#x27;s not gel, it&#x27;s not going to harden. That&#x27;s why I use it. But it should hold better than it does which is maybe an hour at the most, and that&#x27;s only SOMETIMES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good things:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price isn&#x27;t expensive&lt;br /&gt;2. It will last a while given you are using the recommended amount. I use less than what&#x27;s recommended.&lt;br /&gt;3. The shape of the container is nice. When my hands are wet I don&#x27;t have a hard time gripping to get it opened.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be waxier, with a little more tack to it.  However, it does the job quite well.</li>
            <li> Great product, works like it is claimed to, smooths a little more than i had expected but it&#x27;s just great. Probably going to get the rest of the collection. If you want nice slick non greasy looking hair than this is what you want.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair product that works with my strait thick hair.  I mean my hair stands up strait for about 4 inches. This is the only pomade i&#x27;ve found that does the trick and puts my hair in its place for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Pomade!&lt;br /&gt;I place some on my fingers, rub it in my hair and it holds it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it, and my hair is a bit long right now, when it dries, the hair stays the same.  It does not get soft or lose it&#x27;s shape or gets puffy as with other types of gels or liquid products that when they dry they harden.....&lt;br /&gt;I will get this again......</li>
            <li> I love it. Looks great, stays in place and has a light shine, not a greasy shine. The price has doubled since I first bought it so hopefully it has leveled out now. If it keeps going up I&#x27;ll be looking for another brand.</li>
            <li> I love Axe Shine Pomade because it keeps my hair in place all day, even in rain. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments about how my hair looks after using this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave an odor or that crusty look or feel that gel can leave behind.</li>
            <li> There are alot of other pomades that are better. While I realize this pomade is intended to leave your hair shiny, I think its too shiny and leaves a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> good stuff at a good price</li>
            <li> It leaves my hands feeling all oily and it makes my hair all hard.  This isn&#x27;t something that I would recommend especially if you want your hair to be all soft.</li>
            <li> This product is not only what i was expecting but it has surpassed my expectations and brought my \\&quot;game\\&quot; to a whole new level. The shine this pomade leaves allows for a coat on my hair that the ladies can not resist and flock to like bees on honey, except they are more rough ;). I would recommend this for any male looking for a classy smooth clean look in their hair.</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found. When I bought the 3 pack at this time, it worked out to b around $4 per pomade😊👍</li>
            <li> Gives your hair shine and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky/greasy like other products.  If you&#x27;re looking for a product that will leave your hair shiny without a strong hold, this is your product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Takes very little to get a great hold and keeps my hair looking natural.  Has a little bit of shine but not &amp;#34;hair gel&amp;#34; shine.  One tub actually goes a long long way.  Hard to find in stores sometimes so it&#x27;s easier just to order the 3 packs.</li>
            <li> Unilever stopped importing this product to Canada, so this was the only way to get it. By far my favorite pomade.</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for, great shine with just enough hold to keep my hair in place but not to make it heavy and sticky, it comes off very easly as well, a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless water based and oil based pomades to achieve a neat side part and classic haircut. A hard feature to find in a water based pomade is pliabilty all day without drying. I typically despise all Axe products, their marketing strategy, their smell, and everything they stand for. I instantly think high school locker room and douche bags. But this is the one product I will buy from Axe. It is a fraction of the cost of American Crew, but offers the same great shine and moldable hold all day. If it gets out of place, I can run a comb through it without adding water and it goes right back to the way I started the day. An excellent product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is really great. i was pleasantly surprised because my only experience with pomade before this was the murray&#x27;s pomade, which is super thick and waxy. this axe stuff is a little lighter and pliable, but still has excellent hold properties. you can get different types of hold depending on how much you use - use a little bit and get a lighter, flexible, more natural look/hold, or use a lot to get a super-shiny, strong hold. it smells great, feels great, overall highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have three hairstyles. One without gel, one with the Axe Putty, and one with this. They all use the same haircut, but I need my hair to be a little longer to use this. I love the way the Pomade looks, and it&#x27;s pretty strong. It gives my hair a nice, shiny, greased look. I put on a leather jacket, jeans, leather boots, and I&#x27;m just like a greaser. Except asian.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works great.</li>
            <li> use it for slicking my hair backwards&lt;br /&gt;the smell lasts for a while as well&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s a good smell</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for several years and it is just as good as it was when I first purchased it. Amazon has a great bulk deal and it reduces the price per item considerably. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Great for a smooth looking hair&lt;br /&gt;Not much needed so 3 packs can last you</li>
            <li> Great product. Gives hair shine without making it stiff. Very soft and keeps hair in place. Great price, compared to in store purchase where it comes to $7 a bottle. I feel like I&#x27;m buying 2 and getting one free. Definitely buying again. Higley recommend, if you want to save money and have great hair.</li>
            <li> When I was looking for a new Gel to use to Smooth my hair. I found Axe gel and decided to try it out. When I first apply it to my hair it felt rough but after it makes the hair smooth. The Gel dont give much of a hold. The container didnt have much in which i ran out of it really quick. It was a good experience to try new Gel.</li>
            <li> Good stuff if you want to look like the Fonz...easy to apply and fun to wear...chicks dig it...out of words</li>
            <li> eh.  this only looks good in my hair when it&#x27;s exactly the right length.  Working some water into it makes it a bit more versatile.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s got a good but soft hold, smells pretty nice, and puts a decent shine on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;when will a cream get back on subscribe and save?</li>
            <li> This pomade is great because not only does it hold hair in place well but it also provides a superior shine. I have used many other waxes and other pomades in the past but this takes the medal!</li>
            <li> I bought this product roughly around 2 weeks ago. I will not ever go back to old fashioned pomade. With this stuff, it brings out my waves and curls while still keeping me looking trim. Plus, my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy or hard and it holds amazing with just a little hair spray. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I like this product it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard and it lets me manage my hair so yeah I really like it</li>
            <li> Maybe I watched too much Hulu when AXE was doing their commercials like crazy years ago but I really like the product and have been using the stuff for years since. It smells great and is really easy to use. The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and flake off where you look like you have crazy dandruff. Then when you wash your hair it makes it so soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it&#x27;s best to use right after I get out of the shower and towel dry my hair. If I wait till later on in the day it doesn&#x27;t style quite as easy and needs a lot more. Definitely doesn&#x27;t work with hat hair at the end of the day! If you wear a cap all day and then think you&#x27;re just going to quickly throw some product in and go you&#x27;re mistaken. In fact it&#x27;s best to wash completely before trying to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only going to be buying this stuff online from now one because it was so nice to get a jar that hasn&#x27;t already got some strangers fingers plunged into it. That&#x27;s just gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is my wife likes it too. Not just on me but she really likes it for her flyaway hairs. I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great product! This is he only place I could find it.</li>
            <li> it leaves no residue and easy to wash off in the shower</li>
            <li> Though the price is a bit high, particularly retail (~$11), this pomade is fantastic. A caveat, though, is that this is contingent on your hair-type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ridiculously thick dirty-blonde hair with waves that battle cowlicks in a fashion that makes it stand straight up when I towel dry it. While this works really well for a short, messy style (no work whatsoever, with just a little [[ASIN:B001LFHYOI Groom &amp; Clean Greaseless Hair Control, 4.5 oz.]]for a light hold) and looks metal as f*** when long, the in-between is a nightmare of goofy looking waves and parts that inevitably result in one side of my head looking sloppy and childish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used pomades like [[ASIN:B000AAU2B2 Royal Crown Hair Dressing, 5 oz.]] in the past, but--in contrast to guys with pomade in their black hair, giving it a patent-leather finish--these darken my hair just enough to make it look nasty, on top of the oily sheen, no matter how well it&#x27;s groomed. Worse, oil-based pomades are difficult to get out of your hair and stain pretty much everything your head comes into contact with. All of that said, the hold that pomades offer is the only thing strong enough to tame my mane without a helmet-headed gel effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this stuff, then, is that it offers an approximation of the outstanding hold of oil-based pomades (nickel-sized? Ha! I have to use a quarter-sized amount), but it is water-based. It reminds me very much of a distilled Groom &amp; Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the key with this stuff, I think, is to choose the one that&#x27;s best for your hair type. Ignore the names that Axe has slapped on these three varieties and look at the differing hairstyles that are pictured on each of its three (four?) pomade types. I chose this one because there is a picture of an obviously thick, longish hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happily, this stuff offers a hold strong enough for my hair, but it dries with a matte finish that darkens my hair slightly while bringing out some natural variations. I attribute this to whatever the sparkles in it are. Even better, since it&#x27;s water-based, you can restyle if necessary with a little bit of water, and you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair with dishsoap to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, before you buy a three-pack of this stuff, do yourself a favor and take a trip to your drugstore to check out the hairstyles pictured on each variety to find out which one matches your own. DO NOT BUY THIS if you have thin or easily manageable hair--if this product leaves your scalp oily or weird no matter how little you use, then clearly it&#x27;s not right for your hair type.some natural variations.

            <li> no different than their regular pomade.</li>
            <li> This product has been working very well for me.  I don&#x27;t get any white flaking as some other gels cause.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair in place, I have thick Italian Hair, and all my hair for 61 Years old, Thank you Lord</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it gives me just the right amount of shine (but not too much).  Sleek is the right word for it.  Need to use relatively quickly as it does seem to dry out and harden up a bit if you leave it unused for too long.</li>
