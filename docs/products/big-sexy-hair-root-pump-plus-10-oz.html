            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase from this seller and recommend it to others!</li>
            <li>Great product, Speedy Shipping!</li>
            <li>Does a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent for fine hair.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in good time</li>
            <li>Quality hair product, I would recommend to anyone needing a good mousse.</li>
            <li>Love this product, use it all the time!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s GREAT if you have fine hair and want volume - it also holds up well in the humidity/ summer.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not nasty or sticky.</li>
            <li>Works well but does anyone else notice more hair falling out than before using it.</li>
            <li>I love this product -</li>
            <li>Also something I noticed is as my hair got oily it still had some volume, even after not washing my hair for 2-3 days!&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product, can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than others since this is my first product like it.</li>
            <li>I only use this product and I was happy to find an online seller who is so courteous and there for the customer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product before &amp; I love how it gives great volume to my long bob haircut.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I really need this to lift my fine and thinning hair!</li>
            <li>Good stuff and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Recently my hair has become very fine because of a disease I have so maybe it would work better on others with course to normal hair.</li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount of lift and layer separation to keep my hair always looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray design is a bit challenging to get used to, but it will ultimately keep your hands from getting sticky.  </li>

            <li>this works really well too!</li>
            <li>Love this product, although I would have saved by buyingit local.</li>
            <li>Big Sexy Hair Root Pump was first introduced to me at my hair salon.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>But can gunk up if you use too much product.</li>
            <li>Really helps with the humidity issue.</li>
            <li>The shipping speed was great, but I received the wrong product.  </li>
            <li>By the time shipping was added to each individual item it really cost!</li>
            <li>I use this I don&#x27;t spray directly into hair.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a faded bottle someone had left in the sun for too long, but with some Google research I figured out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that I can use to keep my wavy beachy hair a natural look.</li>
            <li>It makes makes my hair dull and really doesn&#x27;t add that much volume.  </li>

            <li> Spray into the roots and lift your hair while you blow dry to achieve volume.  </li>
            <li> how you blow dry does matter.</li>
            <li> Oily roots dry ish ends.</li>

            <li> This is one of the only mousses I&#x27;ve tried that I actually feel does something for me.  The spray design is a bit challenging to get used to, but it will ultimately keep your hands from getting sticky.  Spray into the roots and lift your hair while you blow dry to achieve volume.  It won&#x27;t work without your help-- how you blow dry does matter.</li>
            <li> For starters I have thin, straight, Neck length hair. Oily roots dry ish ends. Little to no volume without products.&lt;br /&gt;When I use this I don&#x27;t spray directly into hair. I spray into hands and massage into roots all over head, then brush out. Blow dry up and to the oppisite side I want my hair to lay.&lt;br /&gt;As for the results, this is the first volumizing product I&#x27;ve used. It gives me volume and makes my hair feel/look thicker. I can feel it in my hair after drying but it&#x27;s not nasty or sticky. Also something I noticed is as my hair got oily it still had some volume, even after not washing my hair for 2-3 days!&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product, can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than others since this is my first product like it.</li>
            <li> The shipping speed was great, but I received the wrong product.  The item was labeled with a sticker that said it was the product I ordered, but it was just the root pump, not the root pump plus.  Must have been mislabeled, then shipped according to that.  No one checked the actual product itself.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in good time but I don&#x27;t like how the products works on my hair.  It makes makes my hair dull and really doesn&#x27;t add that much volume.  Recently my hair has become very fine because of a disease I have so maybe it would work better on others with course to normal hair.</li>
            <li> Works well but does anyone else notice more hair falling out than before using it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit thrown off when the Breast Cancer Awareness bottle showed up. At first I thought it was a faded bottle someone had left in the sun for too long, but with some Google research I figured out it was just a different package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product before &amp; I love how it gives great volume to my long bob haircut. It&#x27;s the only product that I can use to keep my wavy beachy hair a natural look. It gives just the right amount of lift and layer separation to keep my hair always looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase from this seller and recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> It really does work. I use it on the crown of my head and blow dry upside down.  I have an impossible cowlic that makes me look like I am going bald at the back of my head if I don&#x27;t style it! Needles to say this product is a must for me!  helps hold curls in too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have also used instant thick [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; this works really well too! But can gunk up if you use too much product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Love this product, although I would have saved by buyingit local. By the time shipping was added to each individual item it really cost!</li>
            <li> Good stuff and lasts a long time.  Excellent for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, Speedy Shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this product - it&#x27;s GREAT if you have fine hair and want volume - it also holds up well in the humidity/ summer.  If you&#x27;re looking for lift, get this!</li>
            <li> I really need this to lift my fine and thinning hair!</li>
            <li> Quality hair product, I would recommend to anyone needing a good mousse. It keeps in hair well and does not make hair feel icky.</li>

            <li> Big Sexy Hair Root Pump was first introduced to me at my hair salon.  I have very, very thin hair.  Without this product, I always looked &amp;#34;wilted&amp;#34; and frumpy.  My hair just would not hold a style.  Since using this product, I actually get compliments on my hair.  My hair has volume and thickness. This is one hair styling aid that I will never be without.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. Would purchase again. Does a great job on my hair. Really helps with the humidity issue.</li>
