            <li>The price is good for the product!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It applies nicely to the lower lash line and there&#x27;s no smudging at the end of the day (this is great for my oily eyelids).  </li>
            <li>No complaints, good product.</li>
            <li>It might be good for a smokey eye look, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Also, I love the applicator tip!</li>
            <li>But I must say I love Revlon!</li>
            <li>so I love it!</li>
            <li>Okay product for the price!</li>
            <li>I wish there was more liquid in the liner!.</li>
            <li>Be sure to snag it here on Amazon because it&#x27;s always sold out in stores!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>The applicator is the absolute BEST of any brand, as it&#x27;s the perfect size and super easy to use!</li>
            <li>This makeup is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Fantastic so happy with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing price too.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming that I would have liked this eyeliner, although I never received it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good, I forgot that it wasn&#x27;t waterproof, so I rubbed my eyes and looked like a raccoon!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It applies so easy and smoothly it feels great and doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t use a brush, it has a very fine felt tip that allows for precision application.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li>The liner brush is great for fine and detailed eyework</li>
            <li>Perfect for your eyes.. is very Black, i love it!!</li>
            <li>Before I use I tap the tip lightly into a paper a couple of time to make the applicator a bit more flexible, hope this helps!</li>
            <li>Favorite eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a believer in liquid liner now :)</li>
            <li>I was hoping I&#x27;d have better luck with a name brand like Revlon.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eyeliner, I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  </li>
            <li>it comes to makeup I am frugal, I will spend a bit more on things if I feel the quality and ingredients cannot be matched by a lower cost brand</li>
            <li>This drugstore brand is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>but I love this liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I was able to find the Black/Brown...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it alone, for daytime-work, and sometimes I use a gel liner to make a bolder top line and use this for the bottom line.</li>
            <li>I just love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite eyeliner for many years.</li>
            <li>Have used this liquid eye liner for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>&amp; it didnt smudge &amp; it looked like i just applied it :)</li>
            <li>I had a dollar-store eyeliner once that did a better job than this one.</li>
            <li>think it works a bit better than Smashbox Limitless Liner</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought it to tide me over.</li>
            <li>I have tried many liquid eyeliners in my life and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this on your top eyelid.</li>
            <li>wear :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the makeup forever aqua liner, the sephora liquid eyeliner, the kat von d tattoo liner, and so many more.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite, no question about it.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for??</li>
            <li>I have repurchased this product many times and will continue to.</li>
            <li>This has been my standby favorite eyeliner for years.  </li>
            <li>It has the best applicator- precise but still soft.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many liquid liners, but this one is up at the top.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.  </li>
            <li>loved it ever sice the first day i used it..</li>
            <li>Not a miracle product but pretty damn good in a pinch</li>
            <li>So cheap and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best liquid liner I have found, the shape of the tip makes it very easy to apply as well.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s great for people new to liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Good if you hold it a certain way.</li>
            <li>Overall, nice and easy product to use that delivers a nice sold matte colour, which gives a nice even finish.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, it does crack a little more than Stila and Make Up For Ever, but if I use a setter like Model in a Bottle, it stays on flawlessly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a lot easier to apply than the gel eyeliners &amp; comes off easily with eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>It makes her eye more defined, seductive, attractive and somewhat mysterious.  </li>
            <li>It will smudge really easily.</li>
            <li>it is really easy to apply and does not smear easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>You have a lot of control of line width with this easy to use applicator.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It easily trumps MAC and</li>
            <li>Overall, the product is great, but the application could be better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and I feel the color is full and robust.</li>
            <li>It has a fine brush tip, and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;run&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>The felt tip makes it easy to apply an even, precise line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and applies a smooth line.</li>
            <li>The brush applicator makes precise drawing easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product if you are used to a precise brush applicator, or if you want makeup to stay put without smudging.</li>
            <li>The brush is a felt tip which helps with an smooth application process.</li>
            <li>This liner goes on smoothly and stays on until you take it off.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, especially for its price!</li>
            <li>I find this easy to use, and like that I can change the look from day time look to special occasion look.</li>
            <li>brush is small and easy to work with and creates perfect cat eye&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real nice eyeliner if you are into liquid eyeliners and it&#x27;s really easy to put on and the color is really black</li>
            <li>This applicator definitely makes application easy and precise, without catching on most of my eyelashes like some brushes do.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It came within the original package</li>
            <li>This is by far my most fave eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Its super easy to apply; much easier than liquid eyeliner that has a brush, and a bit easier than pencil eyeliner!!</li>
            <li>I have been a long time liquid liner wearer and have &amp;#34; worn them all &amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I had settled on using stila&#x27;s stay all day liner (which is flawless except for the near $20 price)</li>
            <li>But still easy to apply and great for cat eyes and even just everyday</li>
            <li>Dries quickly so</li>
            <li>its really nice, come out as a nice heavy line, so you don&#x27;t have to keep going over.</li>
            <li>Its super runny after 30 minutes of application</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bold like a gel liner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other eyeliners and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>After a while if you put it on top of eye shadow the color will dilute but then at this price you just buy a new one.</li>
            <li>The tip of the applicator is too large, and would not make precise lines.</li>
            <li>However these are only noticeable if I&#x27;m very close up to a mirror, and those without oily skin or who use a good primer may not have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite for color and price and ease of application.  </li>
            <li>the shipping and packaging was good, but I find myself needing to apply more than I used to when I got it at the store, it is not really &amp;#34;black black&amp;#34; and it seems water down, I still use it because I love the applicator</li>
            <li>It was good and very easy to use; however, the item from this seller is poor quality.</li>
            <li>Love how dark the pigment is, but of course, any bit of liquid touching it after it dries makes it runny.</li>
            <li>It works fine , but it is a pretty small amount , but I loved it</li>
            <li>Recently bought this at Blackest Black and it works awesomely :D&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It could stay a little better (one star off), but it does stay better than anything I have ever tried before.</li>
            <li>At around $5 at Wal-Mart and Target, it&#x27;s a new cosmetic staple that can fit into almost every budget.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically use liquid liner because it is tricky to make it look good.  </li>
            <li>After my favorite brand of liquid eyeliner was discontinued, I thought I would try this one in a slew of various brands.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy this in different shades! :)</li>
            <li>The color is opaque the first time.</li>
            <li>Several girlfriends have asked me what I use, and now they love this too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner and this is the first one I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>It is also pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li>anyone out there who has second thought buy this liner you will love it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully it&#x27;s good for an entire day o.o</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is really good, the brush doesn&#x27;t move so you don&#x27;t get uneven lines.</li>
            <li>Easy to fix the shape of the black with a q-tip and washes off easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product is the brush; it&#x27;s not too long</li>
            <li>Love the way it lasts all day long!</li>
            <li>I ran out of my precious stila and had a working interview at a blow dry bar  </li>
            <li>, here&#x27;s a tip: when the brush is starting to come out dry because you&#x27;re running out, just add a drop of water to the bottle, shake it up, and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>What really attracted me to this was the applicator.  </li>
            <li>thanks for selling this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Before using this I used wet n wild liquid liner and it was not as easy and clean a line as I get with this.</li>
            <li>I recommend this liner to anyone who wants to start using liquid liner.</li>
            <li>it is a very doable eyeliner and for the price</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t disappear or smudge as much.</li>
            <li>I wear this brand this kind of eyeliner every day, and before I started using liquid liner, I was intimidated because the brushes always made uneven lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a great BLACKEST BLACK liquid liner and have tried every price range high to low....</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t start fading after an hour like many other liquid liners do.</li>
            <li>It last all day even when you sweet</li>
            <li>Hands down my FAVORITE eye liner.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the bottle lasts months longer than the high-end brands for the same daily use.</li>
            <li>It has become harder to find in stores recently, and I was thrilled to find it online.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Quick application tip:</li>
            <li>I just thought the tip/applicator would be a lot more agile and intricate in the way I could apply my eyeliner in a very thin</li>
            <li>I bought this product for halloween makeup, and was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to apply cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is has a felt tip but does not come as a pen, a form in which I feel the product does not last as long as it should.  </li>
            <li>, it is a bit stiff the first couple of uses but softens up allowing for a smooth continuous line.  </li>
            <li>It lasts sometimes until the next day if used with the right eye primer</li>
            <li>I prefer the Blackest Black as it is the most bold black liquid liner I have found for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>too old very dry and color too light</li>
            <li>This is my new go to eyeliner.</li>
            <li>tiny brush really helps keep your line straight.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and had no reaction from this product.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It stayed on all day through  my naturally oily skin, through watering eyes and through high heat (blowdryer in my face kinda</li>
            <li>Came quickly, within a few days, exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, so you are guaranteed to get your money&#x27;s worth from this product.</li>
            <li>It provides a rich black color and lasts all day without smudging.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is old?</li>
            <li>By far the easiest to use applicator for liquid liner.</li>
            <li>You know I love this product to bypass the brown and actually go through the trouble of ordering it and waiting for it to be delivered.</li>
            <li>The applicator is good, however (pointed tip, no brush for random bristles to stick out).</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this eyeliner, but it doesn&#x27;t live up to the brand&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eyeliners, this one not only irritates my eyelids, it goes on black but shortly after fades to a light black.</li>
            <li>Only liner I have ever been able to find that had such a dark pigment and didn&#x27;t run was Asphalt - Walk The Line by Hardcandy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too old for thick line retro looks these days! :)</li>
            <li>Exactly what i expected</li>
            <li>only thing that sort of bothered me but not too much was that it was late on shipping and the product arrived a few days later than the estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great product, will order again in the future!!</li>
            <li>I used to be a huge fan of the pencil style, but I tried this a few years ago and there&#x27;s no going back for me!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the applicator could be better.</li>
            <li>No other product comes close to this eye liner and trust me I have tried them all.</li>
            <li>I bought the black and it goes light grey and watery.</li>
            <li>I am one of those girls that wears thick eyeliner every single day, so I&#x27;ve tested all sorts of liquid eyeliner products, some high end and some cheap.</li>
            <li>long lasting nice dark black.....</li>
            <li>I have used this product, Revlon ColorStay Liquid Liner, Blackest Black 251, for a while now and really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am lazy with makeup and so usually wouldn&#x27;t put on eyeliner anymore, but I find myself using this more often because it is much easier to apply than other liquid liners</li>
            <li>the color is a dark, true black.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> my sephora one ran out and this one looked  good.</li>
            <li> The price is good for the product!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It applies nicely to the lower lash line and there&#x27;s no smudging at the end of the day (this is great for my oily eyelids).  </li>
            <li> No complaints, good product.</li>
            <li> It might be good for a smokey eye look, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The applicator tip is rather good and performs well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good eyeliner</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day (including a full day of school + gym class) without having to do any touch ups, which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> Very precise lining, it looks great.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very pleased to that</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and especially easy to learn how to use.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Also, I love the applicator tip!</li>
            <li> But I must say I love Revlon!</li>
            <li> so I love it!</li>
            <li> Okay product for the price!</li>
            <li> I wish there was more liquid in the liner!.</li>
            <li> Be sure to snag it here on Amazon because it&#x27;s always sold out in stores!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> The applicator is the absolute BEST of any brand, as it&#x27;s the perfect size and super easy to use!</li>
            <li> This makeup is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Fantastic so happy with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing price too.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that I would have liked this eyeliner, although I never received it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good, I forgot that it wasn&#x27;t waterproof, so I rubbed my eyes and looked like a raccoon!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It applies so easy and smoothly it feels great and doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t use a brush, it has a very fine felt tip that allows for precision application.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li> The liner brush is great for fine and detailed eyework</li>
            <li> Perfect for your eyes.. is very Black, i love it!!</li>
            <li> Before I use I tap the tip lightly into a paper a couple of time to make the applicator a bit more flexible, hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Favorite eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer in liquid liner now :)</li>
            <li> I was hoping I&#x27;d have better luck with a name brand like Revlon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeliner, I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  </li>
            <li> it comes to makeup I am frugal, I will spend a bit more on things if I feel the quality and ingredients cannot be matched by a lower cost brand</li>
            <li> This drugstore brand is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> but I love this liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I was able to find the Black/Brown...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it alone, for daytime-work, and sometimes I use a gel liner to make a bolder top line and use this for the bottom line.</li>
            <li> I just love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite eyeliner for many years.</li>
            <li> Have used this liquid eye liner for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> &amp; it didnt smudge &amp; it looked like i just applied it :)</li>
            <li> I had a dollar-store eyeliner once that did a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> think it works a bit better than Smashbox Limitless Liner</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought it to tide me over.</li>
            <li> I have tried many liquid eyeliners in my life and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this on your top eyelid.</li>
            <li> wear :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the makeup forever aqua liner, the sephora liquid eyeliner, the kat von d tattoo liner, and so many more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, no question about it.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for??</li>
            <li> I have repurchased this product many times and will continue to.</li>
            <li> This has been my standby favorite eyeliner for years.  </li>
            <li> It has the best applicator- precise but still soft.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many liquid liners, but this one is up at the top.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  </li>
            <li> loved it ever sice the first day i used it..</li>
            <li> Not a miracle product but pretty damn good in a pinch</li>
            <li> So cheap and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best liquid liner I have found, the shape of the tip makes it very easy to apply as well.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s great for people new to liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Good if you hold it a certain way.</li>
            <li> Overall, nice and easy product to use that delivers a nice sold matte colour, which gives a nice even finish.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, it does crack a little more than Stila and Make Up For Ever, but if I use a setter like Model in a Bottle, it stays on flawlessly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot easier to apply than the gel eyeliners &amp; comes off easily with eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> It makes her eye more defined, seductive, attractive and somewhat mysterious.  </li>
            <li> It will smudge really easily.</li>
            <li> it is really easy to apply and does not smear easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> You have a lot of control of line width with this easy to use applicator.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It easily trumps MAC and</li>
            <li> Overall, the product is great, but the application could be better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and I feel the color is full and robust.</li>
            <li> It has a fine brush tip, and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;run&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> The felt tip makes it easy to apply an even, precise line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and applies a smooth line.</li>
            <li> The brush applicator makes precise drawing easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product if you are used to a precise brush applicator, or if you want makeup to stay put without smudging.</li>
            <li> The brush is a felt tip which helps with an smooth application process.</li>
            <li> This liner goes on smoothly and stays on until you take it off.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, especially for its price!</li>
            <li> I find this easy to use, and like that I can change the look from day time look to special occasion look.</li>
            <li> brush is small and easy to work with and creates perfect cat eye&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real nice eyeliner if you are into liquid eyeliners and it&#x27;s really easy to put on and the color is really black</li>
            <li> This applicator definitely makes application easy and precise, without catching on most of my eyelashes like some brushes do.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It came within the original package</li>
            <li> This is by far my most fave eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Its super easy to apply; much easier than liquid eyeliner that has a brush, and a bit easier than pencil eyeliner!!</li>
            <li> I have been a long time liquid liner wearer and have &amp;#34; worn them all &amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I had settled on using stila&#x27;s stay all day liner (which is flawless except for the near $20 price)</li>
            <li> But still easy to apply and great for cat eyes and even just everyday</li>
            <li> Dries quickly so</li>
            <li> its really nice, come out as a nice heavy line, so you don&#x27;t have to keep going over.</li>
            <li> Its super runny after 30 minutes of application</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bold like a gel liner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eyeliners and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> After a while if you put it on top of eye shadow the color will dilute but then at this price you just buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The tip of the applicator is too large, and would not make precise lines.</li>
            <li> However these are only noticeable if I&#x27;m very close up to a mirror, and those without oily skin or who use a good primer may not have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite for color and price and ease of application.  </li>
            <li> the shipping and packaging was good, but I find myself needing to apply more than I used to when I got it at the store, it is not really &amp;#34;black black&amp;#34; and it seems water down, I still use it because I love the applicator</li>
            <li> It was good and very easy to use; however, the item from this seller is poor quality.</li>
            <li> Love how dark the pigment is, but of course, any bit of liquid touching it after it dries makes it runny.</li>
            <li> It works fine , but it is a pretty small amount , but I loved it</li>
            <li> Recently bought this at Blackest Black and it works awesomely :D&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It could stay a little better (one star off), but it does stay better than anything I have ever tried before.</li>
            <li> At around $5 at Wal-Mart and Target, it&#x27;s a new cosmetic staple that can fit into almost every budget.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use liquid liner because it is tricky to make it look good.  </li>
            <li> After my favorite brand of liquid eyeliner was discontinued, I thought I would try this one in a slew of various brands.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy this in different shades! :)</li>
            <li> The color is opaque the first time.</li>
            <li> Several girlfriends have asked me what I use, and now they love this too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner and this is the first one I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> It is also pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li> anyone out there who has second thought buy this liner you will love it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully it&#x27;s good for an entire day o.o</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is really good, the brush doesn&#x27;t move so you don&#x27;t get uneven lines.</li>
            <li> Easy to fix the shape of the black with a q-tip and washes off easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is the brush; it&#x27;s not too long</li>
            <li> Love the way it lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I ran out of my precious stila and had a working interview at a blow dry bar  </li>
            <li> , here&#x27;s a tip: when the brush is starting to come out dry because you&#x27;re running out, just add a drop of water to the bottle, shake it up, and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> What really attracted me to this was the applicator.  </li>
            <li> thanks for selling this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Before using this I used wet n wild liquid liner and it was not as easy and clean a line as I get with this.</li>
            <li> I recommend this liner to anyone who wants to start using liquid liner.</li>
            <li> it is a very doable eyeliner and for the price</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t disappear or smudge as much.</li>
            <li> I wear this brand this kind of eyeliner every day, and before I started using liquid liner, I was intimidated because the brushes always made uneven lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a great BLACKEST BLACK liquid liner and have tried every price range high to low....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t start fading after an hour like many other liquid liners do.</li>
            <li> It last all day even when you sweet</li>
            <li> Hands down my FAVORITE eye liner.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the bottle lasts months longer than the high-end brands for the same daily use.</li>
            <li> It has become harder to find in stores recently, and I was thrilled to find it online.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Quick application tip:</li>
            <li> I just thought the tip/applicator would be a lot more agile and intricate in the way I could apply my eyeliner in a very thin</li>
            <li> I bought this product for halloween makeup, and was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to apply cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I love that this is has a felt tip but does not come as a pen, a form in which I feel the product does not last as long as it should.  </li>
            <li> , it is a bit stiff the first couple of uses but softens up allowing for a smooth continuous line.  </li>
            <li> It lasts sometimes until the next day if used with the right eye primer</li>
            <li> I prefer the Blackest Black as it is the most bold black liquid liner I have found for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> too old very dry and color too light</li>
            <li> This is my new go to eyeliner.</li>
            <li> tiny brush really helps keep your line straight.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and had no reaction from this product.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It stayed on all day through  my naturally oily skin, through watering eyes and through high heat (blowdryer in my face kinda</li>
            <li> Came quickly, within a few days, exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, so you are guaranteed to get your money&#x27;s worth from this product.</li>
            <li> It provides a rich black color and lasts all day without smudging.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is old?</li>
            <li> By far the easiest to use applicator for liquid liner.</li>
            <li> You know I love this product to bypass the brown and actually go through the trouble of ordering it and waiting for it to be delivered.</li>
            <li> The applicator is good, however (pointed tip, no brush for random bristles to stick out).</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this eyeliner, but it doesn&#x27;t live up to the brand&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eyeliners, this one not only irritates my eyelids, it goes on black but shortly after fades to a light black.</li>
            <li> Only liner I have ever been able to find that had such a dark pigment and didn&#x27;t run was Asphalt - Walk The Line by Hardcandy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old for thick line retro looks these days! :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> only thing that sort of bothered me but not too much was that it was late on shipping and the product arrived a few days later than the estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great product, will order again in the future!!</li>
            <li> I used to be a huge fan of the pencil style, but I tried this a few years ago and there&#x27;s no going back for me!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the applicator could be better.</li>
            <li> No other product comes close to this eye liner and trust me I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> I bought the black and it goes light grey and watery.</li>
            <li> I am one of those girls that wears thick eyeliner every single day, so I&#x27;ve tested all sorts of liquid eyeliner products, some high end and some cheap.</li>
            <li> long lasting nice dark black.....</li>
            <li> I have used this product, Revlon ColorStay Liquid Liner, Blackest Black 251, for a while now and really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am lazy with makeup and so usually wouldn&#x27;t put on eyeliner anymore, but I find myself using this more often because it is much easier to apply than other liquid liners</li>
            <li> the color is a dark, true black.  </li>
            <li> It makes a good thick or thin line and</li>
            <li> It also smudges and doesnt last very long, after the first few uses it turned into basically water.</li>
            <li> The color is distinct and the application is simple, I have tried other liquid liners in the past and none of them have given me the line or color that this brand has.  </li>
            <li> My other half only wears make up on certain occasion (maybe a couple of times a week).</li>
            <li> It is long lasting however and does not give the dreaded raccoon eyes</li>
            <li> Long lasting quality product, so 5 stars</li>
            <li> heat)&lt;br /&gt;After about 7 hours the carbon black color starts to wear and look a little more grey and loses a lot</li>
            <li> My skin is not particularly oily, but it keeps smudging off on my upper eye lid and creasing.</li>
            <li> For my partner this eyeliner is her current favourite, the other brands that she has used is Mac, Clinique, and a plethora of others - but for the current time this is the one for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run, stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> his color is must like a palid grey.</li>
            <li> it lasts so long, i wore it for a wedding</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, stays on all day.</li>
            <li> The liquid somewhat irritates my eyes over a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it stays put all day long.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pigmented enough, especially if you apply it over eyeshadow, it turns grey instead of black.</li>
            <li> Although this is not waterproof there have been no issues wearing it outside to the movies and other functions.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry when putting it on, and doesn&#x27;t run all over or smudge either.</li>
            <li> Once mine starts getting dry, I do this every day</li>
            <li> The color is dark and stays on throughout the day, I can only think of once or twice when I needed to reapply the eyeliner, and that was after I went swimming.</li>
            <li> Over time, the fibers start to become loose and come out, so you have to watch that</li>
            <li> I would not recommend mixing it with water when it starts to get low, as that breaks down the components which make this an eyeliner</li>
            <li> It is definitely not the darkest black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been to Three Drug Stores and my local Krogers and they were all out of Revlon ColorStay Liquid Liner in Blackest Black.</li>
            <li> She matches it with black mascara (from a different brand) and they complement each other well.</li>
            <li> As someone who has a really bad makeup addiction, I&#x27;ve tried many eyeliners.</li>
            <li> theres not much time for smudging.</li>
            <li> Not very opaque.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s rough on my eye.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that sometimes I&#x27;ll notice tiny little balls of black gloop in the inner corners of my eyes after a long day of wear.  </li>
            <li> It takes like 2-3 applications for you to get a solid black color or else the color will be a watered down black.</li>
            <li> The ONLY eyeliner that stays put on me once it is dried!</li>
            <li> I usually use a black ink eyeliner that you can only get from India.  </li>
            <li> Clear thin lines.</li>
            <li> least they refunded my money, but I&#x27; was left without eyeliner...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a liquid eyeliner fanatic, and I have to say this liner is a big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> The blackest black is hard to find at the local drugstores as it always seems to be sold out.  </li>
            <li> Even breaking down and using a higher-priced liner until this eye liner arrived.</li>
            <li> but my town was sold out of the black.</li>
            <li> This formula is also as black as can be.</li>
            <li> and you end up with just a running, murky colored mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply, doesn&#x27;t stay one and is fairly dry.  </li>
            <li> The pigment is dark and the consistency is just as it should be!</li>
            <li> It smudges after a few hours and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing eyeliner everyday for about 8 years.</li>
            <li> my advice... don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I come in at the wrong angle or have too much eyeliner on the tip, then I&#x27;m having thick eyeliner today.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you have even slightly oily skin, do not buy this eye liner!</li>
            <li> , it makes a very tight line on the eye</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s impossible to get a clean, thin line with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Usually need to apply twice for longer wear but</li>
            <li> Not sure I will order again via mail order.</li>
            <li> The tip is just too thick and hard, it catches on the skin and just makes a mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to apply, in that it smudges and the tip is too hard, so it ends up actually scraping the eyeliner already in place.</li>
            <li> my englis is not very good</li>
            <li> The brush however is very stiff?</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t hard taking off and during taking it off it doesn&#x27;t make me a raccoon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to beat the price .&lt;br</li>
            <li> you wont be dissapointed...thin to thick lines.....</li>
            <li> high-end liquid eyeliners and this one works just as well, if not better!</li>
            <li> the product is about equivalent to Make Up For Ever and Stila, but what I&#x27;m really crazy about is the applicator and how long the bottle lasts!</li>
            <li> and I seriously get about another 3 months out of it.</li>
            <li> You can do it as thin or thick as you want it</li>
            <li> Sometimes they don&#x27;t give me a problem, but at other times the application feels very tedious.  </li>
            <li> Very thick, and watery.&lt;br /&gt;when used it drips into your eye, causing irratated eyes, and messed up makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> The darkest grey, maybe : (</li>
            <li> i like how thin the brush is</li>
            <li> One thing I hate about other liquid eyeliners is the brush applicator.  </li>
            <li> I find this somewhat difficult to use.</li>
            <li> And this is coming from a girl whose obsessed with doing a cat eye.</li>
            <li> or you end up with weird lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong  -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really weird!</li>
            <li> BUT i was wrong!</li>
            <li> Forget about winging it out, you&#x27;ll just get frustrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried it on and in my opinion its terrible!</li>
            <li> , I get nasty smudges in the corner of my eyes - it looks horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff, and I feel the color is full and robust. I posted a photo of wearing the eyeliner on a wrinkly part of my hand and after 16 hours of wear, it was still there, albeit not as \\&quot;deep\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone. Everyone needs liquid eyeliner in their bag.</li>
            <li> This is the only liquid liner i use, doesnt become sticky after a while. You can do perfect lines, perfect size to have it in ur purse.</li>
            <li> Favorite eyeliner.  I&#x27;ve tried other eyeliners and this is by far the best.  I think it&#x27;s a good price and very good product</li>
            <li> I find this easy to use, and like that I can change the look from day time look to special occasion look.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> Excellent liquid liner! I have very sensitive eyes and had no reaction from this product. Once the liner dries, it stays in place all day.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Clear thin lines. Dries quickly so theres not much time for smudging. Love it!</li>
            <li> After my favorite brand of liquid eyeliner was discontinued, I thought I would try this one in a slew of various brands. The tip of the applicator is too large, and would not make precise lines. Within 2 hours of wearing this, my eyes looked like raccoons! I had greyish gunk all over my eyelid, and under my eyes. I would not recommend this product if you are used to a precise brush applicator, or if you want makeup to stay put without smudging.</li>
            <li> I find this somewhat difficult to use. There are definitely others out there that are easier to manipulate. It is long lasting however and does not give the dreaded raccoon eyes</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is really good, the brush doesn&#x27;t move so you don&#x27;t get uneven lines. It last all day and even night. its really nice, come out as a nice heavy line, so you don&#x27;t have to keep going over.</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop selling this liner. It doesn&#x27;t use a brush, it has a very fine felt tip that allows for precision application. I wear this brand this kind of eyeliner every day, and before I started using liquid liner, I was intimidated because the brushes always made uneven lines. This makeup is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this since I have oily skin. Doesn&#x27;t run, stays on for a long time. I only need to re-apply if it&#x27;s on longer than around eight hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner yesterday and I must say I am impressed. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and stays all day. Also, I love the applicator tip! I am big fan of liquid eyeliners. I switched from MAC Liquidlast Liner ([...]) because 1) It smudges after a few hours and 2)When I tried to remove this eyeliner, it comes out in layers! It&#x27;s really weird! But I must say I love Revlon! I am going to buy this in different shades! :)</li>
            <li> I usually use a black ink eyeliner that you can only get from India.  When I ran out of that product I tried this one. It can&#x27;t compare. It&#x27;s hard to apply, doesn&#x27;t stay one and is fairly dry.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> It goes on okay but will smudge after it&#x27;s been on for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner to get me out of a pinch cause my sephora one ran out and this one looked  good. I tried it on and in my opinion its terrible! It takes like 2-3 applications for you to get a solid black color or else the color will be a watered down black. Its super runny after 30 minutes of application it was already on my eyelids and at the end of the day it doesnt even stay on . Definitely going back to the sephora eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this liquid eyeliner for a number of years, &amp; I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if Revlon ever discontinues it.  It&#x27;s the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever found that will stay on my eyes &amp; last all day without smearing, fading or flaking.  I never have to worry about looking in the mirror &amp; discovering that I have &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s also a lot easier to apply than the gel eyeliners &amp; comes off easily with eye makeup remover.  The blackest black is hard to find at the local drugstores as it always seems to be sold out.  So I&#x27;m very pleased to that I&#x27;ve found an online seller that carries it.</li>
            <li> I was scared it was going to expired liquid liner that probably wont show any color BUT i was wrong! The pigment is dark and the consistency is just as it should be! It came within the original package so I know it hasn&#x27;t been tampered with. The liner brush is great for fine and detailed eyework so I love it! You can do it as thin or thick as you want it and that&#x27;s always a plus in my book. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use liquid liner because it is tricky to make it look good.  I bought this product for halloween makeup, and was pleasantly surprised by how simple it was to apply cleanly.  I&#x27;m a believer in liquid liner now :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pigmented enough, especially if you apply it over eyeshadow, it turns grey instead of black. I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for your eyes.. is very Black, i love it!!</li>
            <li> The only eyeliner that does not smudge! It last all day even when you sweet it looks still amazing!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Like another (cheaper) eyeliner I tried, this one stings my eyelids. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for sensitive skin. I was hoping I&#x27;d have better luck with a name brand like Revlon. The applicator is good, however (pointed tip, no brush for random bristles to stick out).</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyeliner, I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  The color is distinct and the application is simple, I have tried other liquid liners in the past and none of them have given me the line or color that this brand has.  I like the applicator for this product quite well, it is a bit stiff the first couple of uses but softens up allowing for a smooth continuous line.  I prefer the Blackest Black as it is the most bold black liquid liner I have found for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to makeup I am frugal, I will spend a bit more on things if I feel the quality and ingredients cannot be matched by a lower cost brand but this eyeliner in my eyes has not been matched.  I&#x27;ve tried gel liners, liquid jar liners, and pen liners but I always find myself going back to this product.</li>
            <li> this wasnt great at all</li>
            <li> I have used the product bdfore I brought it. It was good and very easy to use; however, the item from this seller is poor quality. It is definitely not the darkest black. The darkest grey, maybe : (</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  Usually need to apply twice for longer wear but tiny brush really helps keep your line straight.</li>
            <li> The ONLY eyeliner that stays put on me once it is dried!</li>
            <li> Hands down my FAVORITE eye liner. I am one of those girls that wears thick eyeliner every single day, so I&#x27;ve tested all sorts of liquid eyeliner products, some high end and some cheap. This drugstore brand is phenomenal. The brush applicator makes precise drawing easy and smooth. The color is opaque the first time. Easy to fix the shape of the black with a q-tip and washes off easily at the end of the day. Several girlfriends have asked me what I use, and now they love this too.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a makeup pro. But this stuff makes me look like I know what I&#x27;m doing ha.</li>
            <li> It makes her eye more defined, seductive, attractive and somewhat mysterious.  She now looks like a tiger on the prowl.</li>
            <li> Lasts about 4 hours before you have to re-apply on the sides. Definitely not water proof or sweat proof! It will smudge really easily. Okay product for the price!</li>
            <li> I thought the bottle would be bigger but I love this liquid eyeliner. I&#x27;m a beginner and this is the first one I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li> Reckon ColorStay Liquid Liner is great!  It has a fine brush tip, and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;run&#x27;.  It is also pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is perfect!! It stays on all day (including a full day of school + gym class) without having to do any touch ups, which is perfect for me. Haven&#x27;t had a raccoon eyed day since purchace. Its super easy to apply; much easier than liquid eyeliner that has a brush, and a bit easier than pencil eyeliner!! The price is good for the product!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that sort of bothered me but not too much was that it was late on shipping and the product arrived a few days later than the estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great product, will order again in the future!!</li>
            <li> i like how thin the brush is, it makes a very tight line on the eye</li>
            <li> Not very opaque.I bought the black and it goes light grey and watery.</li>
            <li> What a pain. I&#x27;d been to Three Drug Stores and my local Krogers and they were all out of Revlon ColorStay Liquid Liner in Blackest Black. I was able to find the Black/Brown... but my town was sold out of the black. You know I love this product to bypass the brown and actually go through the trouble of ordering it and waiting for it to be delivered. No other product comes close to this eye liner and trust me I have tried them all. Even breaking down and using a higher-priced liner until this eye liner arrived. The high-priced liner went in the trash the moment my Amazon package arrived.</li>
            <li> too old very dry and color too light</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best liquid liner I have found, the shape of the tip makes it very easy to apply as well. After a while if you put it on top of eye shadow the color will dilute but then at this price you just buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a very good eyeliner and for the price it is so amazing. it is really easy to apply and does not smear easily.</li>
            <li> This is garbage. I&#x27;ve tried many eyeliners, this one not only irritates my eyelids, it goes on black but shortly after fades to a light black. It also smudges and doesnt last very long, after the first few uses it turned into basically water.</li>
            <li> I love it. It lasts sometimes until the next day if used with the right eye primer&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i would change it the wand. I&#x27;d rather it be a brush.</li>
            <li> one of the best eyeliners....long lasting nice dark black.....you wont be dissapointed...thin to thick lines.....perfect for any occasion..loved it ever sice the first day i used it..</li>
            <li> Revlon is one of my go-to products and I finally decided to give this a try.  What really attracted me to this was the applicator.  One thing I hate about other liquid eyeliners is the brush applicator.  Sometimes they don&#x27;t give me a problem, but at other times the application feels very tedious.  I love that this is has a felt tip but does not come as a pen, a form in which I feel the product does not last as long as it should.  This applicator definitely makes application easy and precise, without catching on most of my eyelashes like some brushes do.  It makes a good thick or thin line and the color is a dark, true black.  It applies nicely to the lower lash line and there&#x27;s no smudging at the end of the day (this is great for my oily eyelids).  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and it dries very quickly.  The only negative I have is that sometimes I&#x27;ll notice tiny little balls of black gloop in the inner corners of my eyes after a long day of wear.  However these are only noticeable if I&#x27;m very close up to a mirror, and those without oily skin or who use a good primer may not have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a product I&#x27;d recommend.  It provides a rich black color and lasts all day without smudging.  It allows for great control when drawing your line and I think it&#x27;s great for people new to liquid eyeliner.  At around $5 at Wal-Mart and Target, it&#x27;s a new cosmetic staple that can fit into almost every budget.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, Revlon ColorStay Liquid Liner, Blackest Black 251, for a while now and really like it. Sometimes I use it alone, for daytime-work, and sometimes I use a gel liner to make a bolder top line and use this for the bottom line. Works well for both. You have a lot of control of line width with this easy to use applicator. This doesn&#x27;t take forever to dry when putting it on, and doesn&#x27;t run all over or smudge either. Long lasting quality product, so 5 stars</li>
            <li> I just love this eyeliner. it stays on all day without fading until you take it off. Revlon is a brand name that you could trust. the price was great. anyone out there who has second thought buy this liner you will love it...thanks for selling this product.</li>
            <li> I could not find this in stores anymore so I ordered several.  It&#x27;s been my favorite eyeliner for many years.</li>
            <li> I recommend it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Came quickly, within a few days, exactly what it says. No complaints, good product. And this is coming from a girl whose obsessed with doing a cat eye.</li>
            <li> Paris Jackson brought me here!. This eyeliner is spectacular! It applies so easy and smoothly it feels great and doesn&#x27;t smudge and it doesn&#x27;t flake off.  It isn&#x27;t hard taking off and during taking it off it doesn&#x27;t make me a raccoon. I wear this daily to school and at home and last all day. I can even wear it in gym class without a smudge or a touch up. I wish there was more liquid in the liner!. I inform you to use baby wipes to take off your makeup.</li>
            <li> Have used this liquid eye liner for years and absolutely love it. Stays on throughout the entire day and does not smudge.</li>
            <li> it wasent what i expect. i request that liquid liner from venezuela because we hace a seriusshortage in every thing. That liquid liner is nor creamy it doent paint uniformly. his color is must like a palid grey. And the color dosent stay. my englis is not very good but i hope that you can understanme. Bote mi dinero a la basura ! no sirve para nada, no pinta, la tintura es aguada y para ser Revlon, la decepcion fue peor... And the price y almost cry !</li>
            <li> I like this liner but when I purchased it online it seems to be a bit different. Perhaps it is old? it just doesn&#x27;t glide on well like when I purchases it in a store. Not sure I will order again via mail order.</li>
            <li> takes some practice ... as does all liquid liners, but the effect is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite eyeliner. My only complaint is that the applicator could be better. Over time, the fibers start to become loose and come out, so you have to watch that or you end up with weird lines.</li>
            <li> Very thick, and watery.&lt;br /&gt;when used it drips into your eye, causing irratated eyes, and messed up makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a great BLACKEST BLACK liquid liner and have tried every price range high to low.... So far this is my favorite for color and price and ease of application.  Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Quick application tip: Before I use I tap the tip lightly into a paper a couple of time to make the applicator a bit more flexible, hope this helps!</li>
            <li> i love this eyeliner!! it lasts so long, i wore it for a wedding and it lasted all night &amp; it didnt smudge &amp; it looked like i just applied it :)</li>
            <li> This is my new go to eyeliner. Super easy to apply. I do a winged liner every time I wear make up and this works great for that!</li>
            <li> cannot even think of using another eyeliner! so perfect...pigmented applicator does the job jus an amazing product!!</li>
            <li> So cheap and easy to apply! Doesn&#x27;t start fading after an hour like many other liquid liners do.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner. Lasts a long time, stays on all day. By far the easiest to use applicator for liquid liner. Before using this I used wet n wild liquid liner and it was not as easy and clean a line as I get with this. Wonderful product!!!</li>
            <li> Love how dark the pigment is, but of course, any bit of liquid touching it after it dries makes it runny. Only liner I have ever been able to find that had such a dark pigment and didn&#x27;t run was Asphalt - Walk The Line by Hardcandy.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this eyeliner, but it doesn&#x27;t live up to the brand&#x27;s name. It&#x27;s difficult to apply, in that it smudges and the tip is too hard, so it ends up actually scraping the eyeliner already in place. When I wear it on a windy day and my eyes get a bit watery, I get nasty smudges in the corner of my eyes - it looks horrible! And if the eyeliner gets in my eye, it stings and causes irritation and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s impossible to get a clean, thin line with this eyeliner. The tip is just too thick and hard, it catches on the skin and just makes a mess. Forget about winging it out, you&#x27;ll just get frustrated. It might be good for a smokey eye look, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed. I had a dollar-store eyeliner once that did a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> Recently bought this at Blackest Black and it works awesomely :D&lt;br /&gt;I think it works a bit better than Smashbox Limitless Liner /:&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it&#x27;s good for an entire day o.o</li>
            <li> Fantastic so happy with it</li>
            <li> I have been a long time liquid liner wearer and have &amp;#34; worn them all &amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I had settled on using stila&#x27;s stay all day liner (which is flawless except for the near $20 price) I ran out of my precious stila and had a working interview at a blow dry bar  , I had a coupon and decided to try the revlon color stay instead and at $6 at cvs it&#x27;s hard to beat the price .&lt;br /&gt;The brush is small and easy to work with and creates perfect cat eye&lt;br /&gt;It stayed on all day through  my naturally oily skin, through watering eyes and through high heat (blowdryer in my face kinda heat)&lt;br /&gt;After about 7 hours the carbon black color starts to wear and look a little more grey and loses a lot or it&#x27;s lasting power, and if you wipe at it at this stage it will go EVERYWHERE .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought it to tide me over. Not a miracle product but pretty damn good in a pinch</li>
            <li> I have tried many liquid eyeliners in my life and this is definitely my favorite. The brush is a felt tip which helps with an smooth application process. It is easy to use and especially easy to learn how to use. The felt tip makes it easy to apply an even, precise line. I would recommend using this on your top eyelid. The color is dark and stays on throughout the day, I can only think of once or twice when I needed to reapply the eyeliner, and that was after I went swimming. It lasts a long time, so you are guaranteed to get your money&#x27;s worth from this product. I would not recommend mixing it with water when it starts to get low, as that breaks down the components which make this an eyeliner and you end up with just a running, murky colored mess.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eyeliner I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been wearing eyeliner everyday for about 8 years. I used to be a huge fan of the pencil style, but I tried this a few years ago and there&#x27;s no going back for me! It doesn&#x27;t smudge, it lasts all day (and into the night), and I honestly get compliments all the time on how perfect my eyeliner looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, here&#x27;s a tip: when the brush is starting to come out dry because you&#x27;re running out, just add a drop of water to the bottle, shake it up, and it&#x27;s good to go. Once mine starts getting dry, I do this every day and I seriously get about another 3 months out of it. Honestly, this is the best eyeliner out there in my opinion!</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid liner on the market, even compared to stuff you can get at Sephora or MAC. It&#x27;s easy to hold and applies a smooth line. I recommend this liner to anyone who wants to start using liquid liner.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a faulty product, but the eye liner I got starting wearing off literally 30 minutes after I put it on. My skin is not particularly oily, but it keeps smudging off on my upper eye lid and creasing. I keep having to return to the mirror and wipe it off my upper lid. Very disappointed. Ladies, if you have even slightly oily skin, do not buy this eye liner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that I would have liked this eyeliner, although I never received it.  After 2 or 3 weeks of waiting and trying to track it, I saw that they sent it to another State, and it was waiting for &#x27;pick-up&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least they refunded my money, but I&#x27; was left without eyeliner...</li>
            <li> Pretty good, I forgot that it wasn&#x27;t waterproof, so I rubbed my eyes and looked like a raccoon! But still easy to apply and great for cat eyes and even just everyday wear :) The color may fade throughout the day, so you might have to apply it every couple of hours. Great for liquid liner, though! Also a good price!</li>
            <li> This liner goes on smoothly and stays on until you take it off.  Wears all day. Great product for the money.  Beautiful eyes.</li>
            <li> Good if you hold it a certain way.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most fave eyeliner! The felt tip makes applying it a breeze even for me, yay!</li>
            <li> As someone who has a really bad makeup addiction, I&#x27;ve tried many eyeliners. I&#x27;ve tried the makeup forever aqua liner, the sephora liquid eyeliner, the kat von d tattoo liner, and so many more. This is my favorite, no question about it. My favorite thing about this product is the brush; it&#x27;s not too long and it&#x27;s easy to apply. Liquid liner is a tricky thing, and with this product my wings are always on fleek!! This formula is also as black as can be. It&#x27;s an amazing price too. What more could you ask for?? I have repurchased this product many times and will continue to.</li>
            <li> Best liquid eyeliner out there</li>
            <li> My partner only uses liquid eyeliner and not a pencil product. My other half only wears make up on certain occasion (maybe a couple of times a week). For my partner this eyeliner is her current favourite, the other brands that she has used is Mac, Clinique, and a plethora of others - but for the current time this is the one for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some liquid eyeliner add-in glitter to their eyeliners this then just makes the product lose its lustre but this Revlon items does not do this. She matches it with black mascara (from a different brand) and they complement each other well. Although this is not waterproof there have been no issues wearing it outside to the movies and other functions. There have been no smudge events, no irritation on use or having the product ‘weep’. The applicator tip is rather good and performs well. Overall, nice and easy product to use that delivers a nice sold matte colour, which gives a nice even finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a liquid eyeliner fanatic, and I have to say this liner is a big thumbs up! I have used MAC, Make Up For Ever, Stila, etc. high-end liquid eyeliners and this one works just as well, if not better! It easily trumps MAC and the product is about equivalent to Make Up For Ever and Stila, but what I&#x27;m really crazy about is the applicator and how long the bottle lasts! The applicator is the absolute BEST of any brand, as it&#x27;s the perfect size and super easy to use! On top of that, the bottle lasts months longer than the high-end brands for the same daily use. I have to admit, it does crack a little more than Stila and Make Up For Ever, but if I use a setter like Model in a Bottle, it stays on flawlessly. This product is great, especially for its price! Be sure to snag it here on Amazon because it&#x27;s always sold out in stores! (:</li>
            <li> It works fine , but it is a pretty small amount , but I loved it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good eyeliner don&#x27;t get me wrong  - I just thought the tip/applicator would be a lot more agile and intricate in the way I could apply my eyeliner in a very thin fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I come in at the wrong angle or have too much eyeliner on the tip, then I&#x27;m having thick eyeliner today. The liquid somewhat irritates my eyes over a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is a very doable eyeliner and for the price it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real nice eyeliner if you are into liquid eyeliners and it&#x27;s really easy to put on and the color is really black and it stays that way.</li>
            <li> This has been my standby favorite eyeliner for years.  It has become harder to find in stores recently, and I was thrilled to find it online.  It has the best applicator- precise but still soft.  And it stays put all day long. I hope they keep making it!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It could stay a little better (one star off), but it does stay better than anything I have ever tried before. I also like the skinny applicator because I like a thinner line that I can soften with some shadow over it. I&#x27;m too old for thick line retro looks these days! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am lazy with makeup and so usually wouldn&#x27;t put on eyeliner anymore, but I find myself using this more often because it is much easier to apply than other liquid liners and it doesn&#x27;t disappear or smudge as much. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> the shipping and packaging was good, but I find myself needing to apply more than I used to when I got it at the store, it is not really &amp;#34;black black&amp;#34; and it seems water down, I still use it because I love the applicator but I will go to the drug store next time instead of ordering here. my advice... don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> Love the way it lasts all day long! :) it&#x27;s a must have for me! Will definitely buy again!!:) woot&lt;br /&gt;-Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Excellent received in Good condition</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! I&#x27;ve used so many liquid liners, but this one is up at the top. Very precise lining, it looks great. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great. It&#x27;s bold like a gel liner. The brush however is very stiff? Not sure if this is normal but it&#x27;s rough on my eye. Overall, the product is great, but the application could be better.</li>
