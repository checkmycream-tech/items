            <li>I looked at several other brands but liked the HAI the best.  </li>
            <li>I looked at several other brands but liked the HAI the best.</li>
            <li>my hair has never been more straight and silky after doing it.</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair and this straightener works perfectly.</li>
            <li>- I went with tried and true</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if these &amp;#34;modern upgrades&amp;#34; are true to claim.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy the same hai because it worked really good on my wavy &amp; freeze hair.  </li>
            <li>It was on sale when I purchased it, so the price was phenomenal, and includes the very nice, zippered travel case (hard cover with felt lining).  </li>

            <li>VERY straight!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and free.</li>
            <li>THIS IS WORTH</li>
            <li>The curls last for hours on my hair, but then agian, that depends on your own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right size to both flatten my kinky roots as well as bend my frizzy ends to a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use it about once a week, but I like being able to change up my style quickly.  </li>
            <li>I only use it about once a week, but I like being able to change up my style quickly.</li>
            <li>and the cord is nice and long which is convienent.</li>
            <li>Every time, my hair is shiny and straight, compliment worthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I used to have this exact item for about 5 years or so.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was stunned at how fast I got my package after ordering!</li>
            <li>Since then I bought another one too, but not because the first one broke.</li>
            <li>I had this exact straightener for about five years before it started to wear out.</li>
            <li>After my last two hair straighteners broke, I did my research to make sure</li>
            <li>the third flat-iron I&#x27;d buy would be of better quality.  </li>
            <li>/BRUSHING THROUGH FIRST.  </li>
            <li>It does not burn my hair, although I have very fine and long hair.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I just love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I chose the HAI brand because of it&#x27;s solid reputation and popularity with the stylists - they recommended the HAI for everyday use because it is sturdy and lasts for years, gives a good glossy end result, heats up superfast, has tourmaline plates that don&#x27;t damage the hair, and is easy to handle and operate.  </li>

            <li>However, the original one I used to use is little bit better.  </li>
            <li>So, for her birthday wishlist this flat iron is one of the top choice that she wants.    </li>
            <li>Gets really really hot fast.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and goes up to a very high heat, if needed.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this straightener!</li>
            <li>and this is the only iron that gets my hair shiny and gives it a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I HAVE REALLY CURLY HAIR THAT REQUIRES A HAI.  </li>
            <li>It heats up really fast,</li>
            <li>I thought it would of lasted me much longer.</li>
            <li>It heats up so so fast, and I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years  now</li>
            <li>and that is more than enough to get you hair super straight or curl it up, which you can do just with a little practice.</li>
            <li>The case comes in handy for when I take this to the spa with me, as leaving there with only blow-dried hair isn&#x27;t sufficient for me due to having very puffy</li>
            <li>Although I had never heard of this Hai brand before, it had amazing reviews and so far has not let me down!  </li>
            <li>it heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t really snag my hair like my old one did.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality, affordable appliance that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li>This is the second Hai Flat iron I have purchased and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Plus, the blue plates are pretty!  </li>
            <li>Plus, the blue plates are pretty!</li>
            <li>ANY OTHER CHEAP MODELS OR</li>
            <li>The storage case is new this time around</li>
            <li>I bought a new one because the wire shorted (traveler packing error) in the one that I purchased 5 yeas ago.  </li>
            <li>The exact same one.</li>
            <li>When I bought the first one at a local beauty supply shop, it cost me about twice what it does now here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it says \\&quot;free high quality storage HARD case\\&quot;, which is untrue, because the case is kinda soft although it&#x27;s sorta rigid around the sides.  </li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Truly professional quality.  </li>
            <li>This iron gets my hair extra straight.</li>
            <li>It is professional grade and does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you are going to get professional grade under $100.00 - but not everybody needs.  </li>
            <li>Also, it only takes me less than 5 min to get my hair super straight.</li>
            <li>In less than 5 minutes, I can run this flat iron through my hair and my hair looks smooth and professional, not fried, with minimal risk of burning myself.  </li>

            <li> WELL EVEN IF YOU DON&#x27;T PUT PRODUCTS BEFORE OR AFTER AS LONG AS YOU FOLLOW MY TIPS.  </li>
            <li> It is so much faster and efficient to straighten my thick, wavy hair in the mornings now.  </li>
            <li> Had this flat iron a few years back.</li>
            <li> Instead of 5 stars I gave 4 because at least in product description there seems to be some modern perks - heat but less drying on the ends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a tight budget these days, so that&#x27;s why I opted for the exact same one even though I&#x27;m not impressed with its durability.  </li>
            <li> , TURN IT UP TO 400 DEGREES, HEAT IT UP, DO SMALL SECTIONS ON DRY HAIR.  </li>
            <li> I have really, really thick, long, slightly wavy blond hair, and sometimes I wake up with my hair going in eight directions.  </li>

            <li> even when you jus run it thru your hair to tame it</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star because the case have a little bad odor that can be aired out for 2-3 days</li>
            <li> Others were too heavy, or the handle was difficult to grip for my small hands, plus the HAI has a swivel cord and simple on/off and temperature buttons/lights.  </li>

            <li> HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED ANY OF THE OTHER EXPENSIVE MODELS LIKE A TOURMALINE, OR ANOTHER TYPE OF CERAMIC FLAT IRON, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE OF A &amp;#34;TRY&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> ITS A HARD CASE, PROTECTS IT</li>

            <li> I had a Hai flat iron for 5 yrs it finally wore out. I bought a Chi and it dried out my hair and damaaged it I went to my local salon to purchase another Hai and they wanted 275.00 for it I went on line and purchased the Hai for 70.00. The exact same one. I will stick to the Hai it doesnt damage my hair. Amazon delivered my purchase sooner than they said and I was totaly happy with my whole experience.</li>
            <li> First of all, it says \\&quot;free high quality storage HARD case\\&quot;, which is untrue, because the case is kinda soft although it&#x27;s sorta rigid around the sides.  I didn&#x27;t expect the case to be lined in fabric.  The case comes in handy for when I take this to the spa with me, as leaving there with only blow-dried hair isn&#x27;t sufficient for me due to having very puffy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I used to have this exact item for about 5 years or so.  I liked it and got good use from it until one day it came apart.  So I bought this one to replace it.  I&#x27;m hopeful that it will last longer, but time will tell.  When I bought the first one at a local beauty supply shop, it cost me about twice what it does now here on Amazon.  I&#x27;m on a tight budget these days, so that&#x27;s why I opted for the exact same one even though I&#x27;m not impressed with its durability.  It heats up really fast and goes up to a very high heat, if needed.  It&#x27;s the right size to both flatten my kinky roots as well as bend my frizzy ends to a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stunned at how fast I got my package after ordering!</li>
            <li> this straightener is amazing. my hair has never been more straight and silky after doing it. even when you jus run it thru your hair to tame it it&#x27;s still perfectly straight. it heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t really snag my hair like my old one did. it&#x27;s really slender which is perfect for my bangs even and makes a nice curl if you do it right. and the cord is nice and long which is convienent. can you tell I love this product? lol</li>
            <li> This is my second Hai flat iron.  I used my last one for 5 years without any problems.  This is a high quality, affordable appliance that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.  The storage case is new this time around but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I order this about 3 or 4 months ago.. It was the best flat Iron I&#x27;d ever purchase. Since then I bought another one too, but not because the first one broke. It was for my friend, she use my iron one day while we were traveling and she loved it. So, for her birthday wishlist this flat iron is one of the top choice that she wants.    Flat iron is exellent. It come with the case too. Minus 1 star because the case have a little bad odor that can be aired out for 2-3 days and then you won&#x27;t notice the smell anymore. Otherwise, 5 stars for the product itself.</li>
            <li> I had this exact straightener for about five years before it started to wear out. I loved it so much that I bought it again and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! It is a great product that is obviously long-lasting and amazing quality. I have really thick hair and this straightener works perfectly. I highly recommend this straightener!</li>
            <li> The only way to go is ceramic, don&#x27;t try to purchase at a salon they ALWAYS rack up the price, sometimes double.</li>
            <li> A great product! After my last two hair straighteners broke, I did my research to make sure the third flat-iron I&#x27;d buy would be of better quality.  Although I had never heard of this Hai brand before, it had amazing reviews and so far has not let me down!  It is so much faster and efficient to straighten my thick, wavy hair in the mornings now.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Very good flat iron.  Heats up very quickly and is very hot.  Truly professional quality.  Works great.  My hairdresser was selling this product for more than three times the price that I paid off Amizon.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I did a lot of research into flat irons before purchasing, talked to my girlfriends and went through the features of each type of flat iron with the owner of the salon I use.  I chose the HAI brand because of it&#x27;s solid reputation and popularity with the stylists - they recommended the HAI for everyday use because it is sturdy and lasts for years, gives a good glossy end result, heats up superfast, has tourmaline plates that don&#x27;t damage the hair, and is easy to handle and operate.  I looked at several other brands but liked the HAI the best.  Others were too heavy, or the handle was difficult to grip for my small hands, plus the HAI has a swivel cord and simple on/off and temperature buttons/lights.  It was on sale when I purchased it, so the price was phenomenal, and includes the very nice, zippered travel case (hard cover with felt lining).  Plus, the blue plates are pretty!  I have really, really thick, long, slightly wavy blond hair, and sometimes I wake up with my hair going in eight directions.  In less than 5 minutes, I can run this flat iron through my hair and my hair looks smooth and professional, not fried, with minimal risk of burning myself.  I only use it about once a week, but I like being able to change up my style quickly.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the second Hai Flat iron I have purchased and I absolutely love it. I have curly frizzy hair and this is the only iron that gets my hair shiny and gives it a smooth finish. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used to have HAI Nu-Stik 1 inch Professional Ceramic Flat Iron but my dog ate the cord so I decided to try this one.  Hai products are all very good, especially for its price.  However, the original one I used to use is little bit better.  It does not burn my hair, although I have very fine and long hair. Also, it only takes me less than 5 min to get my hair super straight. Every time, my hair is shiny and straight, compliment worthy.</li>
            <li> This was a great item to buy and the seller is great.  I called the customer service number and person was nice and provided great customer service.  Shipping was fast and free. Look forward to doing busness in the future.</li>
            <li> This straight iron works great. Has adjustable temperature settings and does not snag hair. This iron gets my hair extra straight.</li>
            <li> Decided to go with the model because I know it.  It is professional grade and does it&#x27;s job.  Instead of 5 stars I gave 4 because at least in product description there seems to be some modern perks - heat but less drying on the ends - I went with tried and true so I don&#x27;t know if these &amp;#34;modern upgrades&amp;#34; are true to claim.  I don&#x27;t think you are going to get professional grade under $100.00 - but not everybody needs.  THICK wavy hair that can sometimes frizz and you want reliability in any season - this is it.</li>
            <li> MY &amp;#34;CLASSIC&amp;#34; CHOICE...I HAVE REALLY CURLY HAIR THAT REQUIRES A HAI.  ANY OTHER CHEAP MODELS OR MADE PRODUCT BURN MY HAIR OR DOESN&#x27;T STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR LIKE I HAI DOES. I HAVEN&#x27;T TRIED ANY OF THE OTHER EXPENSIVE MODELS LIKE A TOURMALINE, OR ANOTHER TYPE OF CERAMIC FLAT IRON, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE OF A &amp;#34;TRY&amp;#34;.  THIS IS WORTH IT, AFTER 10 YEARS OF MY ORIGINAL HAI&#x27;S PLATE BREAKING OFF BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENTAL DROP AND STEP ON MY PART, I REPLACED IT WITH THIS ONE.  LOVE THE CASE!!! ITS A HARD CASE, PROTECTS IT WELL AND EVEN FITS MY COMB AND FLAT IRON DOUBLE BRUSH.  I LIKE THIS ONE BECAUSE YOU CAN DO CURLS WITH IT, I CONSIDERED BUYING THE WIDER PLATE.  TIPS: BRUSH/COMB OUT YOUR HAIR, TURN IT UP TO 400 DEGREES, HEAT IT UP, DO SMALL SECTIONS ON DRY HAIR.  WORKS WELL EVEN IF YOU DON&#x27;T PUT PRODUCTS BEFORE OR AFTER AS LONG AS YOU FOLLOW MY TIPS.  I ACTUALLY USE A DOUBLE BRUSH THAT RESEMBLES A FLAT IRON AFTER COMBING/BRUSHING THROUGH FIRST.  DOING TO BIG OF A SECTION MIGHT GET YOUR HAIR CAUGHT ON  THE SIDE OF THE PLATE AFTER REPEATED BIG SECTIONS, BELIEVE ME, I DID THAT TOO OFTEN BEFORE.</li>
            <li> I had a hai that was given to me and after almost 5 years it stopped working understandable i used it to the the max.  I decided to buy the same hai because it worked really good on my wavy &amp; freeze hair.  I ordered it online on a monday hopping it would get here before saturday because i had a wedding to go to.  To my surprise it arrived on wednesday which i was very happy about it.  It heats up really fast, my straighten really good and fast and the case is wonderful for traveling it fits perfectly the only difference was that it had a different connector but besides that it was the same.  I LOVE IT.</li>

            <li> Love the carrying case. I take it with me everywhere I go.  My daughter can use it with no problems.  Gets really really hot fast.</li>
            <li> After about 9 months, the cord gave out and now I have to constantly play with the cord in order to get it &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; so that it properly heats up the iron. Otherwise, I&#x27;m left with a cold iron and sad face. It&#x27;s a hassle. I thought it would of lasted me much longer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I always get salon quality straightening. I bought a new one because the wire shorted (traveler packing error) in the one that I purchased 5 yeas ago.  This time I bought the case to protect it during travel.</li>
            <li> love it, warms up nicely and leaves my hair nice and straight. the size is perfect for medium lengthe hair</li>
            <li> Had this flat iron a few years back. Loved it. So smooth on my hair. However, after some time there was a short fuse in the cord. But that was probably because I would wrap the cord around the flat iron when I traveled. So this time I got the traveling case!</li>
            <li> I would totally recomend this iron. It heats up so so fast, and I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years  now and it still works just as great as when I first got it. The temperature rages com 0 to 400 degrees or so and that is more than enough to get you hair super straight or curl it up, which you can do just with a little practice. The curls last for hours on my hair, but then agian, that depends on your own.</li>
            <li> I just love this flat iron. After learning how to use it i could not be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> This straightener gets my crazy, wavy, course hair VERY straight! It&#x27;s the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever own. My hair dresser recommended this one and also recommended I buy it on Amazon to get it cheaper. I saved quite a bit too!</li>
