            <li>Beautiful color but very streaky</li>
            <li>But the seller sent this to me very quick and packaged it nice</li>
            <li>Color is nice but chips really easily even with 2 layers of top coat.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>

            <li>I love it even better</li>

            <li>:) thank you</li>
            <li>I had to put on a top coat.</li>
            <li>They sent the package in a timely manner, and made sure it was well wrapped so it wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>and I love the color</li>
            <li>OVerall, I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li>the purplish tint is the only thing I didn&#x27;t like, and how it took 3 or 4 coats to get the perfect color...</li>
            <li>I spend top dollar on this brand</li>
            <li>Such a great color!</li>
            <li>Thought this would be a good color for my sis, but she was complaining the color doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, &amp; that she had to put on so many coats of it on to get the right color.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very nicely and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super cute!</li>
            <li>This is a really bright and pretty color.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had also purchased strawberry glimmer gloss which perked up the color nicely without changing it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very nice color with and without a clear top coat</li>
            <li>I just thought the color was very cool, but I cannot use it.</li>
            <li>I love all Chine Glaze polishes, but this color is very pretty!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bright neon pink, as most bright neon colors</li>
            <li>However when I applied it I needed to apply more than one coat because it is light</li>
            <li>It is the perfect shade of neon pink with a pearlescent touch.</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous and the price appears to be reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The nail polish came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>Most china glaze polishes are super easy to apply an so</li>
            <li>seller was fine.</li>
            <li>Love the shade and it arrived quick.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite for summer!  </li>
            <li>A very bright neon pink.</li>
            <li>Will be buying another, PERFECT  NEON PINK and a MUST have for all girls!!! ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>It was very streaky the color was nice</li>
            <li>Fabulous color.</li>
            <li>looks like a neon orange under the light</li>
            <li>But you definitely need a good top coat, because if you don&#x27;t....</li>
            <li>I recently got this on amazon they packed it very nicely in bubble wrap to ensure that it didn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li>It chips very easily unless you use a clear top coat .</li>
            <li>It look s fantastic with a glitter clear coat on top!</li>
            <li>It is more like a matte but just 1 coat of clear over the top, and you have a gloss finish.  </li>
            <li>buT, its not bad, pretty cute.</li>
            <li>the color is very pretty and the polish goes on smooth</li>
            <li>It shipped right on time too!</li>
            <li>and I had to put it on right after I opened it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bright and solid</li>
            <li>It dries very matte, though, so if you want it shiny,  keep a bottle of clear coat handy!</li>
            <li>It is very neon, but that is what I love about it.  </li>
            <li>Felt like the bottle wasnt full but that might be my imagination.</li>
            <li>True to its color.</li>
            <li>Nice bright pink color, exactly what I wanted, it comes out like a matte color so just put some clear nail polish over top</li>
            <li>Very, very bright hot pink!!</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was just as advertised in color and in looks.</li>
            <li>Did not chip or crack too quickly.</li>
            <li>But the neon pink is amazing!</li>
            <li>I just love china glaze pink is my favorite color</li>
            <li>If you are look for a bright neon pink you have found it!</li>
            <li>but i couldn&#x27;t get it to look right</li>
            <li>Exactly the bright summer pink I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hot pink color!!!!</li>
            <li>By far my favourite neon pink for the summer and all around,I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the color.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast, has a matte finish.</li>
            <li>It took a while for this product to actually be prepared for shipment, but overall it was great.</li>
            <li>Dries very fast but formula affects finish on nails.</li>
            <li>came exactly on time also.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty color on the toes..</li>
            <li>but the colour is really pretty.</li>
            <li>While this may be a very cute color, it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>No gloss, so a top coat is definitely needed.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this color at the nail salon when my regular tech recommended it.</li>
            <li>I recently moved and I did not want to risk them not having my favorite color.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Great color though, find another hot pink in a different brand.</li>
            <li>In the long run, having to use three coats of polish means that I would have to use more coats to obtain the same results if I were using a better polish.  </li>
            <li>I bought this same color a while back and loved it so much that I ran out..</li>
            <li>The product itself is such a bright an and bubbly pink</li>
            <li>Great color, two heavy coats needed for solid coverage</li>
            <li>it dries extremely fast but it does have a matte finish</li>
            <li>More than I expected.</li>
            <li>If you like pink, you will LOVE this polish.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it and it has become one her favorites.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and delivery</li>
            <li>its really giterish</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really pretty pink looks like a bright pink like a bubble gum color</li>
            <li>It does dry matte so if you wanted it shiny, add a clear coat on top.</li>
            <li>It is not sheer, it only takes 2 coats to get the color I want, but you can put 3 and make it even better.  </li>
            <li>Hot hot hot pink.</li>
            <li>The color on the monitor makes it look like a dark pink, but it is a very true bright neon pink.  </li>
            <li>and it doesnt chip as easy as some other brands</li>
            <li>So happy I found it on Amazon for less than half the retail price!</li>
            <li>Takes about 3 coats, just clear over and what a shine!</li>
            <li>so you will need a top coat the pictures are with no top coat</li>
            <li>so everyone buy this nail polish you won&#x27;t be dis-pointed also glows in a black or uv light  </li>
            <li>The upside of it being matte is that I dried very quickly .  </li>
            <li>It is matte and does not change even with a clear coat.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it chips fast..</li>
            <li>I did not know before I purchased this polish that it does not adhere to natural nails.  </li>
            <li>So far day two and no chipping.</li>
            <li>I used a white coat underneath and it really stood out.</li>
            <li>The color is very flat, non-shiny metallic and almost a light, electric pink.</li>
            <li>Ive bought nail polish online before only to get old, gooey polish and this was clearly a brand new, quality product.</li>
            <li>This is the first pink polish I&#x27;ve bought from China glaze</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not really a pink kinda girl.</li>
            <li>it looks really pretty if you apply black crackle over</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a neon pink that pops!</li>

            <li> This is my absolute favorite for summer!  </li>
            <li> A very bright neon pink.</li>
            <li> Will be buying another, PERFECT  NEON PINK and a MUST have for all girls!!! ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> It was very streaky the color was nice</li>
            <li> Fabulous color.</li>
            <li> looks like a neon orange under the light</li>
            <li> But you definitely need a good top coat, because if you don&#x27;t....</li>
            <li> I recently got this on amazon they packed it very nicely in bubble wrap to ensure that it didn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> It chips very easily unless you use a clear top coat .</li>
            <li> It look s fantastic with a glitter clear coat on top!</li>
            <li> It is more like a matte but just 1 coat of clear over the top, and you have a gloss finish.  </li>
            <li> buT, its not bad, pretty cute.</li>
            <li> the color is very pretty and the polish goes on smooth</li>
            <li> It shipped right on time too!</li>
            <li> and I had to put it on right after I opened it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bright and solid</li>
            <li> It dries very matte, though, so if you want it shiny,  keep a bottle of clear coat handy!</li>
            <li> It is very neon, but that is what I love about it.  </li>
            <li> Felt like the bottle wasnt full but that might be my imagination.</li>
            <li> True to its color.</li>
            <li> Nice bright pink color, exactly what I wanted, it comes out like a matte color so just put some clear nail polish over top</li>
            <li> Very, very bright hot pink!!</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was just as advertised in color and in looks.</li>
            <li> Did not chip or crack too quickly.</li>
            <li> But the neon pink is amazing!</li>
            <li> I just love china glaze pink is my favorite color</li>
            <li> If you are look for a bright neon pink you have found it!</li>
            <li> but i couldn&#x27;t get it to look right</li>
            <li> Exactly the bright summer pink I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hot pink color!!!!</li>
            <li> By far my favourite neon pink for the summer and all around,I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the color.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast, has a matte finish.</li>
            <li> It took a while for this product to actually be prepared for shipment, but overall it was great.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast but formula affects finish on nails.</li>
            <li> came exactly on time also.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty color on the toes..</li>
            <li> but the colour is really pretty.</li>
            <li> While this may be a very cute color, it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Pretty</li>
            <li> No gloss, so a top coat is definitely needed.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this color at the nail salon when my regular tech recommended it.</li>
            <li> I recently moved and I did not want to risk them not having my favorite color.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great color though, find another hot pink in a different brand.</li>
            <li> In the long run, having to use three coats of polish means that I would have to use more coats to obtain the same results if I were using a better polish.  </li>
            <li> I bought this same color a while back and loved it so much that I ran out..</li>
            <li> The product itself is such a bright an and bubbly pink</li>
            <li> Great color, two heavy coats needed for solid coverage</li>
            <li> it dries extremely fast but it does have a matte finish</li>
            <li> More than I expected.</li>
            <li> If you like pink, you will LOVE this polish.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it and it has become one her favorites.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and delivery</li>
            <li> its really giterish</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really pretty pink looks like a bright pink like a bubble gum color</li>
            <li> It does dry matte so if you wanted it shiny, add a clear coat on top.</li>
            <li> It is not sheer, it only takes 2 coats to get the color I want, but you can put 3 and make it even better.  </li>
            <li> Hot hot hot pink.</li>
            <li> The color on the monitor makes it look like a dark pink, but it is a very true bright neon pink.  </li>
            <li> and it doesnt chip as easy as some other brands</li>
            <li> So happy I found it on Amazon for less than half the retail price!</li>
            <li> Takes about 3 coats, just clear over and what a shine!</li>
            <li> so you will need a top coat the pictures are with no top coat</li>
            <li> so everyone buy this nail polish you won&#x27;t be dis-pointed also glows in a black or uv light  </li>
            <li> The upside of it being matte is that I dried very quickly .  </li>
            <li> It is matte and does not change even with a clear coat.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it chips fast..</li>
            <li> I did not know before I purchased this polish that it does not adhere to natural nails.  </li>
            <li> So far day two and no chipping.</li>
            <li> I used a white coat underneath and it really stood out.</li>
            <li> The color is very flat, non-shiny metallic and almost a light, electric pink.</li>
            <li> Ive bought nail polish online before only to get old, gooey polish and this was clearly a brand new, quality product.</li>
            <li> This is the first pink polish I&#x27;ve bought from China glaze</li>
            <li> The color is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not really a pink kinda girl.</li>
            <li> it looks really pretty if you apply black crackle over</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a neon pink that pops!</li>
            <li> The color is pretty but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other the other darker China Glaze polishes</li>
            <li> I managed to make it look somewhat decent, but it started chipping within a few hours of applying it.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time also.</li>
            <li> That is how long it took this polish to start wearing off of my nails despite having two coats of the color and a topcoat put on at the salon.</li>
            <li> and when i found it here I didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it to get to me!</li>
            <li> I have about 20 other cg bottles and 2 from the same neon collection.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t any trouble considering it dried so fast.</li>
            <li> Yes, I applied a base coat, top coat, and let it dry completely between each time.  </li>
            <li> I have a desk job and am constantly typing, it lasts a long time if you use the proper base and top coats.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the first time used it the paint chipped the same day .</li>
            <li> The color is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Barbie pink color.</li>
            <li> In the picture it looks like a neon pink, but it&#x27;s not at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about my pink nailpolish</li>
            <li> THE color wasnt what i expected</li>
            <li> I have been looking and looking for a neon pink.</li>
            <li> , i thought it was a pink not really a hot pink.</li>
            <li> This is hot pink that shines a bit blue (just like the name says &amp;#34;voltage&amp;#34;) but it&#x27;s horrible because it peels in flakes in two days</li>
            <li> This color is exactly what I was looking for, unfortunately it started chipping immediately.</li>
            <li> so pink voltage is a winner hands down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly matte so think about that if you&#x27;re going for a shiny pink</li>
            <li> To get a rich color I recommend using a white base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little pink for me though</li>
            <li> , only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t know I was getting a matte color.</li>
            <li> (Pink Voltage-Neon)!!</li>
            <li> I had chipping within less than an hour.</li>
            <li> Chips off after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> so I wasted my money on it</li>
            <li> And it arrived within a few days after I bought it.</li>
            <li> The China Glaze colors are beautiful, however, the polish is very thin; I had to use 3 coats and it still didn&#x27;t cover evenly; no shine and chips horribly!!!  </li>
            <li> the nail polish gives you the look of being a little tan just an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing that it falls right off.</li>
            <li> It has a weird finish and it needs multiple layers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try with just no top coat to see if it still chips.</li>
            <li> Love the color but the formula is horrible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few of china glaze&#x27;s nail polish!</li>
            <li> The polish is very thin, and it took several coats to make my nails look fully covered.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews said, this polish is extremely thin and streaky when layering coats.</li>
            <li> The polish itself just sucks</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend who is obsessed with pink.</li>
            <li> However, this one was pretty horrible.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of color from this Consumer but thia color sucks!</li>
            <li> After all the work putting on the polish I still wasn&#x27;t done, because the polish is very dull and not glossy at all.</li>
            <li> The polish is somewhat thin.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, not a nail polish expert</li>
            <li> I found this color to be very thin.  </li>
            <li> and you have to apply a crazy amount of coats to have sufficient color pay off.</li>
            <li> This is a disappointing item.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Terrible polish from a terrible brand.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Chips off after a few hours.  Yes, I applied a base coat, top coat, and let it dry completely between each time.  It has a weird finish and it needs multiple layers.  I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> This color is so pretty and looks great BUT within 3-4 hours it&#x27;s chipping off. Very disappointing that it falls right off.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS COLOR ITS FABULOUS!!! I was looking to replace my Finger Paints &amp;#34;Warhol Wannabe&amp;#34; and the local Sally&#x27;s Beauty was sold out and I was NOT going to pay $10 online for it so I stumbled upon this and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT I love it even better then what I had! Will be buying another, PERFECT  NEON PINK and a MUST have for all girls!!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ’… it goes on great it dries extremely fast but it does have a matte finish so you will need a top coat the pictures are with no top coat u just wanted you to see the color on! I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same color as it looked online and it glows just like it&#x27;s supposed to. Definitely a great transaction</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the color for a while and when i found it here I didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it to get to me! I was shipped the next day! Love it.</li>
            <li> I recently got this on amazon they packed it very nicely in bubble wrap to ensure that it didn&#x27;t break came exactly on time also. The product itself is such a bright an and bubbly pink it&#x27;s a bright neon pink, as most bright neon colors it looks great on your toes and the nail polish gives you the look of being a little tan just an added bonus! Most china glaze polishes are super easy to apply an so is this one, if you apply two coats this polish is good to go. I was so happy to receive this polish it is going to be a great polish for the summer, all it reminds me of is summer I love it!</li>
            <li> Not shiny. Has more of a chalky look to it &amp; even  with a top coat on it. Still looks blah.</li>
            <li> I love this color  but it takes 3 coats to cover..  It is opaque..U need a topcoat to make it shiny.  This is a pretty color on the toes..</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite for summer!  It&#x27;s so bright and solid that boy does it get noticed!! But you definitely need a good top coat, because if you don&#x27;t.... It will look chalky.  With a great top coat... It&#x27;s by far the best polish yet... More than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love all Chine Glaze polishes, but this color is very pretty! It is durable- I have a desk job and am constantly typing, it lasts a long time if you use the proper base and top coats.</li>
            <li> I bought this and I do admit it looks amazing on the nails. I used seche vite as a top coat as the nail polish is not shiny. I had chipping within less than an hour. Some fingers the entire nail chipped off. It took two coats to cover my nails but even then it wasnt fully covered. Kinda disappointed. I&#x27;m gonna try with just no top coat to see if it still chips. Love the color but the formula is horrible! Wont be buying again. But the seller sent this to me very quick and packaged it nice so I shall buy from them again (: The polish itself just sucks but I cant blame any for that but china glaze!</li>
            <li> Just as you would expect, this nail polish works great.  It came quickly and was just as advertised in color and in looks.</li>
            <li> The nail polish came very quickly in the mail. It was packaged well. The color is what I expected. However when I applied it I needed to apply more than one coat because it is light and it is also a matte nail polish . The upside of it being matte is that I dried very quickly .  Unfortunately the first time used it the paint chipped the same day . It chips very easily unless you use a clear top coat . But, of course by doing so will get rid of the matte effect of the polish . I recommend this product of you like the matte look . It&#x27;s also a very nice color with and without a clear top coat</li>
            <li> A very bright neon pink. It&#x27;s perfect for this time of year (summer). People might say it&#x27;s too bright but i love it.</li>
            <li> I liked how it looks on but I was sent this color instead of the color I ordered(blue). No big deal but I&#x27;m not really a pink kinda girl.</li>
            <li> This is hot pink that shines a bit blue (just like the name says &amp;#34;voltage&amp;#34;) but it&#x27;s horrible because it peels in flakes in two days</li>
            <li> If you like pink, you will LOVE this polish.  It is very neon, but that is what I love about it.  It is not sheer, it only takes 2 coats to get the color I want, but you can put 3 and make it even better.  It is more like a matte but just 1 coat of clear over the top, and you have a gloss finish.  The color on the monitor makes it look like a dark pink, but it is a very true bright neon pink.  Beautiful!</li>
            <li> LOVE this color (Pink Voltage-Neon)!! Exactly the bright summer pink I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This polish is so bright and beautiful, however it chips so easily. The matte formula just does not hold up to daily wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color! It is the perfect shade of neon pink with a pearlescent touch. It was packaged very nicely and shipped fast. It does dry matte so if you wanted it shiny, add a clear coat on top. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it chips fast..I painted my nails today and by the end of the day they had these chips.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit too watery! but the colour is really pretty.</li>
            <li> By far my favourite neon pink for the summer and all around,I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the color. I discovered this color at a nail salon &amp; had to take picture of what the color was called so that I could find it on amazon,so greatful that I did.</li>
            <li> It was very streaky the color was nice but i couldn&#x27;t get it to look right so I wasted my money on it</li>
            <li> I just love china glaze pink is my favorite color so pink voltage is a winner hands down.</li>
            <li> Loooove this color! It&#x27;s slightly matte so think about that if you&#x27;re going for a shiny pink but I love this color. And it arrived within a few days after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Have never used china glaze before. Im Totally in love! It dries super fast, has a matte finish. beautiful! will be my splurge brand.</li>
            <li> While this may be a very cute color, it is not worth the money. It starts chipping almost immediately, even with the top coat on! It&#x27;s a shame because the color is the perfect bright shade of pink.</li>
            <li> Daughter likes it alot.</li>
            <li> Fabulous color. Takes about 3 coats, just clear over and what a shine! Lasts a long time also.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like.  Only china glaze I have had that chipped immediately.  Very disappointed.  Going to give it to a friend.  Great color though, find another hot pink in a different brand.</li>
            <li> I did not know before I purchased this polish that it does not adhere to natural nails.  I just thought the color was very cool, but I cannot use it.</li>
            <li> Color is nice but chips really easily even with 2 layers of top coat. Barbie pink color. Felt like the bottle wasnt full but that might be my imagination.</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend who is obsessed with pink. She absolutely loves it and it has become one her favorites.</li>
            <li> Love the shade and it arrived quick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it looks when it dries. the color is very pretty and the polish goes on smooth, I just don&#x27;t like the matte finish it has.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail polish about two days after I had gotten a pedicure and a manicure so that I could add another coat of polish. That is how long it took this polish to start wearing off of my nails despite having two coats of the color and a topcoat put on at the salon. The color is gorgeous and the price appears to be reasonable.  In the long run, having to use three coats of polish means that I would have to use more coats to obtain the same results if I were using a better polish.  Will use the rest of this color over a period of time, but will not purchase any more of this brand.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this color!! Great brand and great price! Looks very cute and wears well. Only brand I wear.</li>
            <li> I bought this same color a while back and loved it so much that I ran out.. So happy I found it on Amazon for less than half the retail price! Love it - perfect!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really pretty pink looks like a bright pink like a bubble gum color looks nice on my nails with 3 coats on it. the costumer service was great. fast shipping and delivery I would buy china glaze nail polish again. so everyone buy this nail polish you won&#x27;t be dis-pointed also glows in a black or uv light  looks like a neon orange under the light it&#x27;s super cute! :) thank you</li>
            <li> The perfect bright summertime pink</li>
            <li> Pretty but when it dries it has no shine to it you also have to add a white coat underneath for it to look neon.</li>
            <li> Very, very bright hot pink!! Great Summer color!!</li>
            <li> This is a really bright and pretty color. Perfect for the spring of summer plus it looks really pretty if you apply black crackle over</li>
            <li> I really loved this shade, and I usually really love the China Glaze polishes. However, this one was pretty horrible. The polish is very thin, and it took several coats to make my nails look fully covered. After all the work putting on the polish I still wasn&#x27;t done, because the polish is very dull and not glossy at all. I had to put on a top coat. I managed to make it look somewhat decent, but it started chipping within a few hours of applying it. Everything about the polish was frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was fine. They sent the package in a timely manner, and made sure it was well wrapped so it wouldn&#x27;t break. I would buy from this seller again, but I would not buy this polish.</li>
            <li> NOT the color pictured. Like the other reviews said, this polish is extremely thin and streaky when layering coats. In the picture it looks like a neon pink, but it&#x27;s not at all. The color is very flat, non-shiny metallic and almost a light, electric pink. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received in four business days, and the color is just amazing! Hot hot hot pink. No gloss, so a top coat is definitely needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about my pink nailpolish and I found this to be a great shade and it doesnt chip as easy as some other brands</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this color at the nail salon when my regular tech recommended it. I thought maybe just this once but every time I looked at my toes I smiled. I recently moved and I did not want to risk them not having my favorite color. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> THE color wasnt what i expected buT, its not bad, pretty cute. its really giterish , i thought it was a pink not really a hot pink.</li>
            <li> Product was packaged nice and I love the color will be one of my summers favorites! 5 STARS!!!!! I will recommend my friends Thanks!</li>
            <li> Color was not what was advertized.</li>
            <li> True to its color. eat summer color on your toes! and or finger nails. A little pink for me though</li>
            <li> This is the first pink polish I&#x27;ve bought from China glaze and I love it! I have about 20 other cg bottles and 2 from the same neon collection. This is super bright! It arrived before the estimated delivery date which was a plus. I did have to apply a second coat generously but it wasn&#x27;t any trouble considering it dried so fast. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a neon pink that pops!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hot pink color!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice bright pink color, exactly what I wanted, it comes out like a matte color so just put some clear nail polish over top and it looks shiny</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT color! I have been looking and looking for a neon pink. Its so bright and I love it! If you are look for a bright neon pink you have found it!</li>
            <li> Only polish my wife uses. You will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I love the color! I&#x27;ve ordered a few of china glaze&#x27;s nail polish! Great colors, sometimes tend to chip but my nail polish always tends to do that. Great color! I recommend their polish!</li>
            <li> This color is exactly what I was looking for, unfortunately it started chipping immediately. Just beware it doesn&#x27;t last on fingers.</li>
            <li> Great color, two heavy coats needed for solid coverage, only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t know I was getting a matte color. Sorry, not a nail polish expert but maybe that&#x27;s what \\&quot;nail hardeners\\&quot; or nail \\&quot;lacquer\\&quot; means? I really don&#x27;t know but I wish it had just said \\&quot;matte\\&quot; in the description. Luckily, I had also purchased strawberry glimmer gloss which perked up the color nicely without changing it.  So far day two and no chipping.</li>
            <li> Terrible polish from a terrible brand. Guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I have a couple of color from this Consumer but thia color sucks! U have to apply like 4 layers to get a desent color going! Save ur money!</li>
            <li> The color is pretty but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other the other darker China Glaze polishes</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but very streaky and you have to apply a crazy amount of coats to have sufficient color pay off. Dries very fast but formula affects finish on nails. Probably would not repurchase</li>
            <li> very nice bright always happy with china glaze</li>
            <li> this color is sooo bright, it&#x27;s great! The only downside is I had to apply 3 coats to get a uniform color. It look s fantastic with a glitter clear coat on top! It shipped right on time too! OVerall, I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> The color is amazing. The formula is a bit think, and requires 2-3 coats to layer evenly. I used a white coat underneath and it really stood out. It is matte and does not change even with a clear coat. Did not chip or crack too quickly.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a good color for my sis, but she was complaining the color doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, &amp; that she had to put on so many coats of it on to get the right color. My mom said the same. This is a disappointing item.</li>
            <li> I found this color to be very thin.  To get a rich color I recommend using a white base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking that into consideration, it&#x27;s a very bright &amp; fun color, perfect for beach season.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous, and has some kind of purplish tint.... the purplish tint is the only thing I didn&#x27;t like, and how it took 3 or 4 coats to get the perfect color... I spend top dollar on this brand, it should not need that many coats to look perfect</li>
            <li> It took a while for this product to actually be prepared for shipment, but overall it was great. Ive bought nail polish online before only to get old, gooey polish and this was clearly a brand new, quality product. It dries very matte, though, so if you want it shiny,  keep a bottle of clear coat handy!</li>
            <li> The China Glaze colors are beautiful, however, the polish is very thin; I had to use 3 coats and it still didn&#x27;t cover evenly; no shine and chips horribly!!!  Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> The polish is somewhat thin.  The color is exactly what I expected.  I would order the product again and tell others to as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this color! I received it in the mail today and I had to put it on right after I opened it! The color is very bright and dries fairly quick! Has a matte-like finish without a topcoat but it looks great either way be it matte or glossy! Such a great color!</li>
            <li> Color is not even close to picture.</li>
            <li> say hello to my new favorite color!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this color for a fancy dress party for my Barbie look. The colour was spot on. Nice product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t just rate it on color, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  But the neon pink is amazing! And of course China Glaze is a great brand.</li>
