            <li>I&#x27;m VERY happy with that</li>

            <li>This is awesome!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt and found the perfect one!</li>
            <li>a great product!!!</li>
            <li>This tool is perfect for teenagers as not to cut themselves when shaving</li>
            <li>Great item and awesome seller !!!!</li>
            <li>so I am happy for that.  </li>
            <li>I thought the epilator was a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>What you do feel is the vibrations of the motor turning the head  Bottom line, this product works great.</li>
            <li>Great for legs and face; not so great on underarm.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I took it on two trips with me, and I&#x27;m so happy to have that instead of razor blades</li>
            <li>The device is perfectly sized for my hand and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Does a good job</li>
            <li>Not as good as it says</li>
            <li>Really good quality I had Braun before</li>
            <li>but this one good too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say $40 is a good price value for this product.  </li>
            <li>Works good, but needs to be plugged in to work.</li>
            <li>Be sure to lay a towel below too because the plucked hair will fly around.</li>
            <li>I believe it has more power than those that are battery operated, something to consider!</li>
            <li>/&gt;eRase is my first epilator with a shaver head, and I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>It sure beats using a tweezer or waxing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like removing a band-aid, the quicker the better and over before you know it.</li>
            <li>It came on time and was what I ordered, but it breaks off or cuts more hairs than it plucks.</li>
            <li>I use it on my entire face, and it&#x27;s just great!  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a plus to have a 2-in-1 shaver, more convenient than two shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $40 for this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned electric shavers of better quality</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure.  </li>
            <li>Legs are hair free, no pain and within minutes!</li>
            <li>Plucking my eyebrows hurts more.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a cute bag that I stuff in my travel bag.  </li>
            <li>to clean, and I like the little bag for keeping all the parts together - it&#x27;s compact, attractive, and the perfect size to sit discreetly on my bathroom shelf or in my cosmetics</li>
            <li>Well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>.. Be sure to trim longer hair with the trimmer attachment first so it won&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>The manufacturer claims the skin remains smooth till 6 weeks</li>
            <li>compact than my older model; I really like that you can change out attachments, the razor works great.  </li>
            <li>I received a used and full of hair epilator.</li>
            <li>still hurts ALOT on my upper lip, good for chin area and as a shaver on my legs.</li>
            <li>First world problems.ir!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use the plastic cover to lessen the amount of tweezers working in a sensitive area.</li>
            <li>Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, I liked my old one better.</li>
            <li>So the ad did not give enough details concerning where the product is effective.</li>
            <li>The trimming attachment in the razor cuts the hair to the right length for the epilator.</li>
            <li>and maybe this just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;eRase plucks hair more quickly and efficiently than its larger cousins.  </li>
            <li>I still use the larger epilator because I like the feel of something that fills my hands, but the little one is perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the shaver because I wasn&#x27;t interested in the it.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I&#x27;m pleased with the overall results on my face/chin/upper lip/neck.</li>
            <li>First world problems.for</li>
            <li>but this seemed to do more breaking of the hair rather than actual plucking.  </li>
            <li>I may try an epilator again, but I will probably get a better one that can grip very short hairs.</li>
            <li>I had hoped to make this work, but I think I need a higher quality product to do what I really want.</li>
            <li>My wife is utterly displeased with this and wants a full refund!</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to have smooth legs every day, but with this product, I found myself having to grow my hair long enough for the tweezers to get to them.</li>
            <li>This is true, but what I found is that this only happens when I am not following the directions or on very fine hair when high speed is used.</li>
            <li>Really &#x27;yanks&#x27; hair out...</li>
            <li>but really not any better than a razor.  </li>
            <li>And my skin is much happier than with using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pains a little...but works really well</li>
            <li>I bought it to remove light colored hairs from my cheeks, chin, upper lip, jaw line--facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Very soon, like after one or two sessions, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would be able to treat my legs or other large area</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as vibrant as in the picture.</li>
            <li>Like the results so far!!</li>
            <li>When I used it regularly, though, I was able to skip a few days of shaving, so it was useful.</li>
            <li>(what I normally take).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a Philips one that pulls the hair much easier and stronger, so you have to go through the skin less time to have it smooth.</li>
            <li>It may not have gotten every single hair, but it removed most and left no redness or irritation.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m new to epilating I wanted to wait to write a review.</li>
            <li>So only time will tell if I toughen up so it won&#x27;t hut as much!  </li>
            <li>I say only initially, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work well around the public area and you have to run it over and over the same area to remove hair and it will still miss some of the smaller fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Love this little guy!!</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 14 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>electric shaver attachment is okay, not amazing.</li>
            <li>After receiving it and reading the full instructions it says for upper lip and chin only, and individual hairs only.  </li>
            <li>You barely feel the hairs being pulled out.</li>
            <li>In fact, I barely feel it.  </li>
            <li>gentle on my skin than waxing, so the time it needs to calm down is much less.</li>

            <li> gentle on my skin than waxing, so the time it needs to calm down is much less.</li>
            <li> Works OK but was not happy to receive a previously used product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase!no painful at all,easy to use and clean.hardly recommended.</li>
            <li> did I know how small it really is.  </li>
            <li> Totally bearable due to the brevity, although definitely something to get use</li>
            <li> It did not work out for me, as it took a long time for me to shave.  </li>
            <li> There is also breakage of the hair is too long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;d think that for as long as epilator technology has been around, they&#x27;d figure out a way to make it quieter by now...</li>
            <li> as long as epilator technology has been around, they&#x27;d figure out a way to make it quieter by now...</li>
            <li> Got to be very careful not to work the same area for a long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a few days and minimal exfoliating scrub, but all my razor bumps are completely gone.</li>
            <li> It hurts less when following directions too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once because it was a little intimidating.</li>
            <li> Also be careful</li>
            <li> This product was delivered sooner then expected.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve only ever shaved, give it a chance, use it for a few weeks before  you form an opinion.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a waste of money to try as everyone is different</li>
            <li> I bought it over other options because of reviews and because for a first-timer I didn&#x27;t want to drop a ton of cash on something I wouldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> While I scoffed at other comments, the travel bag is indeed well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of reviews complaining about hair breakage.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long (on the face), and I can do it a few times a week to keep up with hair growth cycles.</li>
            <li> Online, the Ejoi eRase looks like any other epilator.  </li>
            <li> It really is not worth the $49 price tag.</li>
            <li> No one can see that shadow of dark hair peeking through.  </li>
            <li> Hope in time I will toughen up and it will hurt less.  </li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few.</li>
            <li> Just a few temporarily, raised follicles, not the redness of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the curves on the face are not easy for the rollers to get an optimal result.</li>
            <li> Takes twice the time than the usual epilators to remove hair.</li>
            <li> Totally waste of time &amp; money!</li>
            <li> Erase is small and compact.</li>
            <li> It is very weak and took long to do a small area in my arm.</li>
            <li> Instead, I used the product on high mode, wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> so I am still learning, like to keep my skin taunt  and not press too hard.</li>
            <li> You know those hairs that you can&#x27;t believe are so hard to pull out?</li>
            <li> I mean, what&#x27;s up with that?</li>
            <li> I mean, what&#x27;s up with that?</li>
            <li> It is a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but this little thing has me obsessed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so disappointing to see that the return period is so limited!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful initially, but gets easier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not dissatisfied with this, because we all know how tough those hairs are to pull out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That too for a person who has very slow hair growth.</li>
            <li> It functions poorly too.</li>
            <li> It removes approximately 90 percent of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not entirely happy.</li>
            <li> , I just think it would be too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> alas, it&#x27;s annoyingly clanky.</li>
            <li> alas, it&#x27;s annoyingly clanky.</li>
            <li> I hate waxing for some reason.</li>

            <li> Love this little guy!! Does a good job.. Be sure to trim longer hair with the trimmer attachment first so it won&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well. It is very weak and took long to do a small area in my arm. I didn&#x27;t use the shaver because I wasn&#x27;t interested in the it. I had a Philips one that pulls the hair much easier and stronger, so you have to go through the skin less time to have it smooth.</li>
            <li> Epilators take a while to test and see results! Hair do not grow back in a day and it&#x27;s so disappointing to see that the return period is so limited! I purchased this for my wife and she believes there&#x27;s practically no difference between this epilator and a razor in terms of the time taken for the hair to grow back. The manufacturer claims the skin remains smooth till 6 weeks and you would notice that you can see hair re-grow within 2 weeks! That too for a person who has very slow hair growth. Why should one purchase a epilator then? She tried giving it a second chance too, but to no use. It functions poorly too. Takes twice the time than the usual epilators to remove hair. My wife is utterly displeased with this and wants a full refund! Please do the needful.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like it said it would. I was left with a lot of hair in my face.</li>
            <li> I received a used and full of hair epilator.Totally waste of time &amp; money! Beware.</li>
            <li> Not as good as it says</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well around the public area and you have to run it over and over the same area to remove hair and it will still miss some of the smaller fine hairs. It does remove the hair eventually though. Also be careful if you try to use it on armpits, my skin kept getting pulled into it.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered sooner then expected.  It is a little uncomfortable. Make sure you use the plastic cover to lessen the amount of tweezers working in a sensitive area. I treated my chin and lip.  It may not have gotten every single hair, but it removed most and left no redness or irritation.  I don&#x27;t think I would be able to treat my legs or other large area, I just think it would be too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Really &#x27;yanks&#x27; hair out...I&#x27;ve only used it once because it was a little intimidating.</li>
            <li> I have never used one so I am still learning, like to keep my skin taunt  and not press too hard. I have not gotten any bumps so I am happy for that.  It does hurt on my upper lip!!! Hope in time I will toughen up and it will hurt less.  Like the results so far!! It sure beats using a tweezer or waxing. I hate waxing for some reason. So only time will tell if I toughen up so it won&#x27;t hut as much!  UP DATE 3-18-15.....still hurts ALOT on my upper lip, good for chin area and as a shaver on my legs. had to change it to a 3.</li>
            <li> Really good quality I had Braun before but this one good too.</li>
            <li> I thought the epilator was a great purchase.  Yes, I read the reviews and prepared myself for the pain or hair removal pinches.  I didn&#x27;t use the safety guard.  Instead, I used the product on high mode, wasn&#x27;t too bad.  It&#x27;s like removing a band-aid, the quicker the better and over before you know it. The only area I haven&#x27;t mastered yet was the bikini area....Ouch!!!  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This product works O.k. but really not any better than a razor.  It did not work out for me, as it took a long time for me to shave.  It really is not worth the $49 price tag.</li>
            <li> Charged it overnight and it didn&#x27;t work.......or even turn on.</li>
            <li> It removes approximately 90 percent of my hair.  It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It came on time and was what I ordered, but it breaks off or cuts more hairs than it plucks. Not entirely happy.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More compact than my older model; I really like that you can change out attachments, the razor works great.  I thought that the dual/opposed heads would speed up the process but it seems to take even longer, I have to go over the same areas multiple times.  Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, I liked my old one better.</li>
            <li> I am a low maintenance gal but this little thing has me obsessed. I&#x27;ve had it about 6 weeks. Since I&#x27;m new to epilating I wanted to wait to write a review. I bought it over other options because of reviews and because for a first-timer I didn&#x27;t want to drop a ton of cash on something I wouldn&#x27;t use. The device is perfectly sized for my hand and easy to use. I got orange. It&#x27;s just as vibrant as in the picture. There is a learning curve, but it works well. The razor attachment is comparable to my husband&#x27;s $40 electric razor. While I scoffed at other comments, the travel bag is indeed well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of reviews complaining about hair breakage. This is true, but what I found is that this only happens when I am not following the directions or on very fine hair when high speed is used. There is also breakage of the hair is too long. It prefers stubble to a week of growth. The trimming attachment in the razor cuts the hair to the right length for the epilator. It hurts less when following directions too. The three problems I had were the face (it only uses one tweezer at a time for the face and says to only use on the upper lip and chin which are not my problem areas), stretching the armpit with one hand, and the cord. Otherwise, great epilator!</li>
            <li> Im not feeling this. I don&#x27;t know if Im using correctly but I get crucial bumps on my neck after using this.</li>
            <li> Best epilator I ever had, and I&#x27;ve had a few.</li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34;designed&#x27; to use on cheeks is just a recommendation. I use it on my entire face, and it&#x27;s just great!  I think the curves on the face are not easy for the rollers to get an optimal result. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m pleased with the overall results on my face/chin/upper lip/neck. My existing razor bumps were gone within a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are use to waxing your face, the pain-curve is non-existent. If you don&#x27;t wax, I can imagine you&#x27;ll get use to it in a fairly short time. Totally bearable due to the brevity, although definitely something to get use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More gentle on my skin than waxing, so the time it needs to calm down is much less. Just a few temporarily, raised follicles, not the redness of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few days and minimal exfoliating scrub, but all my razor bumps are completely gone. I&#x27;m VERY happy with that result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whisker report:  It&#x27;s hit or miss. You know those hairs that you can&#x27;t believe are so hard to pull out? This may or may not remove them. I&#x27;m not dissatisfied with this, because we all know how tough those hairs are to pull out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like a chore, like all the prep and recover of waxing. It doesn&#x27;t take long (on the face), and I can do it a few times a week to keep up with hair growth cycles. And my skin is much happier than with using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric shaver attachment is okay, not amazing. Although it&#x27;s a plus to have a 2-in-1 shaver, more convenient than two shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, and I like the little bag for keeping all the parts together - it&#x27;s compact, attractive, and the perfect size to sit discreetly on my bathroom shelf or in my cosmetics case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $40 for this product. I&#x27;ve owned electric shavers of better quality and I&#x27;d say $40 is a good price value for this product.  It&#x27;s much smaller than you expect it to be, but I think that&#x27;s an advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the designers for the compact travel-friendly design, and that the bag isn&#x27;t an over-sized, logo-crazy, bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d think that for as long as epilator technology has been around, they&#x27;d figure out a way to make it quieter by now...alas, it&#x27;s annoyingly clanky. I mean, what&#x27;s up with that? Don&#x27;t they know we want to be discreet when we groom ourselves? Ha! Ha!  First world problems.for as long as epilator technology has been around, they&#x27;d figure out a way to make it quieter by now...alas, it&#x27;s annoyingly clanky. I mean, what&#x27;s up with that? Don&#x27;t they know we want to be discreet when we groom ourselves? Ha! Ha!  First world problems.ir!  I would say that if you are unsatisfied with this product, then your expectations are out of whack! If you&#x27;ve only ever shaved, give it a chance, use it for a few weeks before  you form an opinion. Yes, the hair will stay away longer, but the hair growth cycle isn&#x27;t on a monthly cycle, so you&#x27;ll use it regularly. And don&#x27;t forget about giving yourself time to learn the best technique. Amazon has a 30 day return policy - so you have time to test it out and nothing to lose except hair!</li>
            <li> pains a little...but works really well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful initially, but gets easier.  Well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does yank out some hair, but not all.  Got to be very careful not to work the same area for a long time or you will get chafing.  Be sure to lay a towel below too because the plucked hair will fly around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase!no painful at all,easy to use and clean.hardly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was me or the epilator but this seemed to do more breaking of the hair rather than actual plucking.  I would spend a lot of time after using the epilator going over spots that this just wouldn&#x27;t work on.  There could be multiple factors for this so it might not be the quality of the product but maybe I just have brittle hair.  I don&#x27;t know for sure.  I did everything according to the directions though.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a waste of money to try as everyone is different and maybe this just wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li> Erase is small and compact. Since hair growns in different directions, don&#x27;t expect all of your hairs to be removed in one swipe. You barely feel the hairs being pulled out. What you do feel is the vibrations of the motor turning the head  Bottom line, this product works great.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says it does.</li>
            <li> excellent does the job perfect for me</li>
            <li> This is awesome! I purchased one from QVC and returned it. I&#x27;ve been on the hunt and found the perfect one! Legs are hair free, no pain and within minutes! I believe it has more power than those that are battery operated, something to consider!</li>
            <li> works well, but takes some getting used to....</li>
            <li> Got it on time.&lt;br /&gt;What a great product!!!</li>
            <li> Works good, but needs to be plugged in to work.</li>
            <li> The info for the product says it can be used on facial hair.  After receiving it and reading the full instructions it says for upper lip and chin only, and individual hairs only.  I bought it to remove light colored hairs from my cheeks, chin, upper lip, jaw line--facial hair.  So the ad did not give enough details concerning where the product is effective.</li>
            <li> Great for legs and face; not so great on underarm. 😊 😞</li>
            <li> Casing is chintzy. Works great.  Just don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
            <li> I had hoped to make this work, but I think I need a higher quality product to do what I really want. I wanted to be able to have smooth legs every day, but with this product, I found myself having to grow my hair long enough for the tweezers to get to them. Now that it is summer time and I am wearing shorts almost every day, I&#x27;ve just quit using it. When I used it regularly, though, I was able to skip a few days of shaving, so it was useful. I may try an epilator again, but I will probably get a better one that can grip very short hairs.</li>
            <li> Works OK but was not happy to receive a previously used product</li>
            <li> Great item and awesome seller !!!!</li>
            <li> Online, the Ejoi eRase looks like any other epilator.  Little did I know how small it really is.  It&#x27;s the smallest epilator I&#x27;ve ever laid eyes on, but this tiny epilator can stand up with the big boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eRase is my first epilator with a shaver head, and I&#x27;m impressed.  The shaver head makes my skin look bald.  No one can see that shadow of dark hair peeking through.  I was tempted to start shaving instead of epilating, but I don&#x27;t want to make time for shaving all the time and stubble doesn&#x27;t become me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the epilator.  People always ask if it hurts.  I say only initially, but it&#x27;s not bad.  Plucking my eyebrows hurts more.  Very soon, like after one or two sessions, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  In fact, I barely feel it.  Listen, my not-yet-teen daughter wanted to remove hair from her legs.  I gave her the choice of epilator or shaving.  She chose epilating and never looked back.  If a kid can do it . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eRase plucks hair more quickly and efficiently than its larger cousins.  I&#x27;m done before I know it.  I still use the larger epilator because I like the feel of something that fills my hands, but the little one is perfect for travel.  It comes with a cute bag that I stuff in my travel bag.  I took it on two trips with me, and I&#x27;m so happy to have that instead of razor blades (what I normally take).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by C&amp;A Marketing.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 14 year old daughter. This tool is perfect for teenagers as not to cut themselves when shaving</li>
