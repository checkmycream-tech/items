            <li> There only reason I didn&#x27;t rate them 5 star is that they are really expensive and I&#x27;ve found less expensive ones that work just as well.</li>

            <li> obagi was forced to change its ingredients so now this line does not work as well nor does it warrant the cost anymore.</li>
            <li> No expiration dates on bottles which always makes me skeptical!</li>
            <li> this product made me brake out so bad.</li>

            <li> I love the Obagi products.  I just wish that it was more affordable to the working class.  If I had the right income, I would certainly order more of it more often.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Arrived late</li>
            <li> I had used this product before so I knew how well it worked. Amazing results! I would recommend this product to anyone with sun damage.</li>
            <li> This skin care system really made a difference in both the texture and appearence of my skin.  I had a huge age spot by my eyebrow, the largest of many on my face, and after 8 weeks of loyal use, following the system instructions, I no longer have that spot by my brow and most of the other spots are gone as well.  My skin feels softer and healthier.  Its not cheap, but just a tad goes a very long way - and deffinately worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This product was fake....be warned</li>
            <li> obagi was forced to change its ingredients so now this line does not work as well nor does it warrant the cost anymore.</li>
            <li> Want to see sun &amp; age damage minimize?  This system is a great way to see wonderful results.  I first used this system under the care of a Medical Aesthitician but now I can purchase the product directly and enjoy results without the extra expense of in-salon services.</li>
            <li> These are effective products.  There only reason I didn&#x27;t rate them 5 star is that they are really expensive and I&#x27;ve found less expensive ones that work just as well.</li>
            <li> I can see results in my skin! So soft and seems to be helping my dark spots to vanish. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi for the past 8 years and it&#x27;s THE Best products in the market!!!!. LOVE IT!!!!! Some of my friends are using Obagi as well!!</li>
            <li> Always will be the best one</li>
            <li> I have been only using for lee than a month and so far I like this product.</li>
            <li> great product well worth the money... but you also need the Nu Derm Blend and Nu Derm FX skin brightening cream.</li>
            <li> Made me break out like crazy! I know it says that it may &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; your skin and that it might get worse before it gets better, but it never got better. I had clear skin, until I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Obagi Nu Derm is the best!  Great price!</li>
            <li> This a wonderful skin care product.  It exfoliates &amp; evens the skin tone beautifully.</li>
            <li> No expiration dates on bottles which always makes me skeptical!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give the Obagi line a try because on of my girlfriends said it worked so well and also my mother used it, but I have yet seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> it took a few message before i got a reply for the seller but was able to get my money back. this product made me brake out so bad. I&#x27;ve used obagi about 6 years ago and i result was totally different</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better! I will continuously used this stuff!They works!</li>
            <li> Thank you for great service, timely delivery and reasonable prices.  I really like the product and though it is expensive it is high quality and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> These products did meet my expectations I would recommend them indeed. I have been using them for the past three years and I have received a lot of compliments on how my skin looks and that inspired me to keep on using them . Most definitly would recommend these products .</li>
