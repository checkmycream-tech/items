            <li>I just received this makeup case and am really happy so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this was a great replacement.</li>
            <li>Great seller and shipped on time.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a tackle box I was using for my cosmetics, which worked great because it was plastic</li>
            <li>Sturdy construction and good hinges.</li>
            <li>and I could clean it, but it wasn&#x27;t very attractive in the powder room.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time, looks great, just the right size for my cosmetics, a very good buy</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s very cute.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>this case was perfect for my 13 year old niece&#x27;s birthday.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Love the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size of this make up case if perfect for me, any bigger</li>
            <li>I need to get used to use it and throw unnecessaries make-ups :)</li>
            <li>Eh its ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and works.</li>
            <li>Bulky and doesn&#x27;t efficiently hold many items.</li>
            <li>The bottom is very deep so everything does fit wonderfully!!</li>
            <li>Small, but love the fabric used inside, plus the compartments fit everything perfectly.</li>
            <li>investment in this make case will ensure I can easily and quickly apply make up in the mornings and never have to worry about finding my toddler eating my lipstick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more pretty than in a picture.</li>
            <li>This one is lovely and looks exactly as shown in the image.</li>
            <li>This came right on time!</li>
            <li>It was very pretty.</li>
            <li>This is very pretty, and it arrived in a box inside another box, so it was well-protected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very compact and easy to travel it.</li>
            <li>(it has a lock and key); or even an elegant tool box to use  inside the house for screwdrivers, picture hangers, Exacto knives, etc.</li>
            <li>The case doesn&#x27;t open enough to have easy access to what you put into it with the exception of the top shelf.</li>
            <li>It lets me keep my scattered makeup in one spot without taking up a large space.</li>
            <li>Item received in reasonable time.</li>
            <li>I switched from a caboodle and it was a struggle fitting my makeup into this case, so I downsized slightly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also heavy despite being mostly plastic.</li>
            <li>This kit is just the right size for my bathroom table, and it doesn&#x27;t tip over when you open the sections out.  </li>
            <li>I had to remove some and adjust the other partitions because the space was inadequate to fit any of my items.</li>
            <li>As far as function and cuteness, it rates well.</li>
            <li>although it doesn&#x27;t have a mirror, it has multiple trays with smaller compartments for a variety of items, and I found that most all the other cases on amazon only had 3 large compartments.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right size for the cosmetics you use daily, so unless you are a professional makeup artist, this should serve your daily purposes.</li>
            <li>I wish I had taken the dimensions more seriously.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality seems decent, drawers open with ease, lock works well.</li>
            <li>I think it could also be re-purposed for many uses: A mani-pedi kit, a sewing kit, a jewelry box, brushes, combs and other hair care items; bills and receipts,paper clips, pens an other office supplies; a place to hide your diary</li>
            <li>My only complaint is very small: it would be nice if I could easily remove the Beautify Cosmetics logo off the side, but I cannot.</li>
            <li>You can clean the outside by wiping it down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plenty long enough for my eyeliner pencils and has lots of space in the bottom for the bulkier products and things I don&#x27;t use very often.</li>

            <li> Item received in reasonable time. Dissapoonted with the quality, flimsy and not practical (lined with felt - difficult to clean).</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this box for all of her nail polish and manicure supplies.  It is a great organizer and opens beautifully.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, looks great, just the right size for my cosmetics, a very good buy</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift and she loved it!</li>

            <li> I love this it&#x27;s not that small and all my make up fits in here. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This came right on time! It&#x27;s the perfect size with plenty of space for all my makeup brushes, eyeshadow kits, lipsticks, eyeliners, etc. It&#x27;s plenty long enough for my eyeliner pencils and has lots of space in the bottom for the bulkier products and things I don&#x27;t use very often. I didn&#x27;t even see that it has a lock on it in the pictures. It lets me keep my scattered makeup in one spot without taking up a large space. Love it!</li>

The size of this make up case if perfect for me, any bigger and it would have been over kill.&lt;br /&gt;The investment in this make case will ensure I can easily and quickly apply make up in the mornings and never have to worry about finding my toddler eating my lipstick again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this case will stand up to the test of time. As far as function and cuteness, it rates well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more pretty than in a picture. Maybe those little storing boxes are maybe a bit too small. I need to get used to use it and throw unnecessaries make-ups :)</li>
            <li> This case is absolutely gorgeous! A lot of other makeup cases seemed tacky in appearance. This one is lovely and looks exactly as shown in the image. It&#x27;s sturdy, and has plenty of extra space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase! My only complaint is very small: it would be nice if I could easily remove the Beautify Cosmetics logo off the side, but I cannot.</li>
            <li> It arrived slightly damaged with a chip on one of the corners and some scattered cuffs. I switched from a caboodle and it was a struggle fitting my makeup into this case, so I downsized slightly. I had to remove some and adjust the other partitions because the space was inadequate to fit any of my items.

I wish I had taken the dimensions more seriously.</li>
            <li> this case was perfect for my 13 year old niece&#x27;s birthday.  although it doesn&#x27;t have a mirror, it has multiple trays with smaller compartments for a variety of items, and I found that most all the other cases on amazon only had 3 large compartments.  it also comes with a lock &amp; keys.  I wanted to get a caboodle like we had back in the day and this was a great replacement.</li>
            <li> Small, but love the fabric used inside, plus the compartments fit everything perfectly. The bottom is very deep so everything does fit wonderfully!! It&#x27;s also very compact and easy to travel it. Do recommend.</li>
            <li> Sturdy construction and good hinges. Beautiful detail. Great seller and shipped on time. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Eh its ok. I wish the sides folded out when you open it. It&#x27;s cute and works. A little deep I feel like I&#x27;m digging around when it is supposed to organize</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, and it arrived in a box inside another box, so it was well-protected.  I&#x27;ve just started using it, so I can&#x27;t comment on durability, but with careful use, it should last. I covered the logo by placing a piece of silver contact paper over that section, so it looks complementary. I bought this to replace a tackle box I was using for my cosmetics, which worked great because it was plastic and I could clean it, but it wasn&#x27;t very attractive in the powder room.  This kit is just the right size for my bathroom table, and it doesn&#x27;t tip over when you open the sections out.  It also complements the chrome in my bathroom. You can clean the outside by wiping it down. It is just the right size for the cosmetics you use daily, so unless you are a professional makeup artist, this should serve your daily purposes. The smaller compartments accommodate the small square eye shadow cases.  The lower compartment is deep enough to store foundation and smaller bottles standing up. I think it could also be re-purposed for many uses: A mani-pedi kit, a sewing kit, a jewelry box, brushes, combs and other hair care items; bills and receipts,paper clips, pens an other office supplies; a place to hide your diary (it has a lock and key); or even an elegant tool box to use  inside the house for screwdrivers, picture hangers, Exacto knives, etc., when you don&#x27;t want to run out to the garage or shed for the big tool box.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect for nail polish.  My daughter uses this for all things nails!!</li>
            <li> Bulky and doesn&#x27;t efficiently hold many items.</li>
