            <li>Feels very nice , no odor , feels light not greasy .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lasts an appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for many years.</li>
            <li>I doubt I will even manage to use it up before purchasing something that works better.  </li>
            <li>I use the Hyaluronic Acid Day Cream and Night Cream and am pleased with both of those</li>
            <li>I wish I could write that it has magically transformed my appearance, it has not.  </li>
            <li>I have read so many reviews that I doubted any of them would work.</li>
            <li>It primes my face for a more smoother look.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and seems more hydrated but at this point do not notice any difference in my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Love the moisture it brings to my eye area.</li>
            <li>Works OK though.  </li>
            <li>Love the moisture without greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I am giving it 4 stars, because I want to wait until I finish the tube to see more results.</li>
            <li>Was working ok for me for 5-7 nights then started making my undereye area swell up and itchy.</li>
            <li>They HAD a wonderful firming moisturizing cream that had the important ingredient DMAE as it&#x27;s second ingredient, but now, to save money I&#x27;m sure, they have reduced the ingredient that made this product work and it is now the SIXTH listed ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I can easily apply makeup over the crème.</li>
            <li>creams go on easily and penetrate well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the results, it has a clean fresh smell that is very light.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing, very gentle, great price.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and this is the first one that I have ever been able to see a difference in the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The Day and Night creams are fabulous -</li>
            <li>The eye cream did not burn or irritate my eyes nor did I see any significant change to my eyes or fine lines.</li>
            <li>One of the best eye creams ever for hydration, doesn&#x27;t do much for dark circles,  but nothing does.</li>
            <li>Sinks right in and is great both at night or under makeup.  </li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I a ma new user of this eye cream, so far so good.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and seems to absorb completely.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t see a different but moisture on my eyes is better than nothing</li>
            <li>Another winner from the pages of Amazon, the first place I go to shop.</li>
            <li>first cream that she had a alergic reaction to.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is gentle and does appear to lessen the dreaded eye lines.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have found that all the products from derma e deliver what they advertise without a lot of hype and very affordable.</li>
            <li>However, this is for real.</li>
            <li>I expected more from derma e.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have finally found an under-eye cream that doesn&#x27;t burn when I put it directly on my under-eye area.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t deal with companies that don&#x27;t care about their customers, and especially when they mess with a good product to save a buck.</li>
            <li>would recommend this brand highly.</li>
            <li>Under eye wrinkles smooth out and don&#x27;t look so rough.</li>
            <li>have had no negative reaction.  </li>
            <li>It does nothing for dark circles, but I have noticed a reduction in fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I noticed a definite difference in the texture of the skin around my eyes by the time I had finished the first tube.</li>
            <li>Makes my eyes look young and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>I would say it is not a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I like the Derma e products I have purchased so far.  </li>
            <li>Although, there are still some noticeable lines around my eyes, it is still too early to tell if this will improve with use.  </li>
            <li>derma e is a company that I trust, and so far I am please with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s not harsh or scented like some eye creams.  </li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin stay away.</li>
            <li>My eye area was really dry, and now it is much better, the wrinkles haven&#x27;t disappeared, but are less noticeable compare to before using this cream.</li>

            <li> Ever since I started using this cream, I noticed that my dark circles have almost disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brand items this last 2 years and many expensive items have created issues with my contacts!  </li>
            <li> You only need one tny little dab, enough for both eyes.</li>
            <li> I use this only at night, as it&#x27;s a tiny bit to heavy for me for day time use.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff but Tooo expensive, keeps raising price for what little amount you get !</li>
            <li> Not very creamy.  </li>
            <li> Expected thicker cream than this for the eye area.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I typically like derma e products but not this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;much happier using a product that has less chemicals.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is no better than any other eye cream I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> Went and bought an expensive name brand at our local Dillard&#x27;s!!!  </li>
            <li> Sorry for my english</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and have very few lines that give away my age.</li>
            <li> It is hard to spread on my eye area.  </li>
            <li> It is thin but yet hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> non irritating and noticeably improves on contact</li>

            <li> It works! Under eye wrinkles smooth out and don&#x27;t look so rough.</li>
            <li> The product always comes promptly and works amazing.  Makes my eyes look young and rejuvenated.  I use the cream once a day in the morning.</li>
            <li> Ok!  So I quit using this for one week.  Went and bought an expensive name brand at our local Dillard&#x27;s!!!  This is the best under eye, cream I have ever used!  No puffy under eyes! Love this!😄❤️❤️💋</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dr. and I love it.  Love the results, it has a clean fresh smell that is very light.  Not perfumey smelling.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for many years. I didn&#x27;t realize how well this cream worked for me until I tried to use another eye cream.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is gentle and does appear to lessen the dreaded eye lines.  I have only used it for a short time so I won&#x27;t suggest it to anyone until later.  I would say it is not a waste of money.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive eyes.  I am so glad to have finally found an under-eye cream that doesn&#x27;t burn when I put it directly on my under-eye area.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye creme about 3 weeks . It is real light and does good job.  It doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful ingredients&lt;br /&gt;in it. I can also tell a difference around my eyes.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I like the Derma e products I have purchased so far.  This is a good size tube and works well.  I will order this again as needed.</li>
            <li> I typically like derma e products but not this eye cream.  It is hard to spread on my eye area.  It is thin but yet hard to rub in.  I doubt I will even manage to use it up before purchasing something that works better.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> I have found that all the products from derma e deliver what they advertise without a lot of hype and very affordable.</li>
            <li> The eye cream did not burn or irritate my eyes nor did I see any significant change to my eyes or fine lines. This product is not for me, I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream.  Sinks right in and is great both at night or under makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for past damage but it does keep the eye area hydrated.</li>
            <li> No expiration date on product</li>
            <li> Great eye moisturizer and even for your lips at night!  Time will tell how it works long-term.</li>
            <li> I use the Hyaluronic Acid Day Cream and Night Cream and am pleased with both of those so I thought I&#x27;d try something specifically for around my eyes.  Although, there are still some noticeable lines around my eyes, it is still too early to tell if this will improve with use.  The Day and Night creams are fabulous - I have been using these for years and have very few lines that give away my age.</li>
            <li> I bought several of the derma e products. I will use them then I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I like that it works and is not greasy</li>
            <li> I have been using this a couple of weeks.  I wish I could write that it has magically transformed my appearance, it has not.  That being said, I do like this product.  It goes on easily and seems to absorb completely.  I can easily apply makeup over the crème. The skin around my eyes stays well hydrated but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I have had no negative reaction.  derma e is a company that I trust, and so far I am please with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review when it&#x27;s time to reorder.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this cream, I noticed that my dark circles have almost disappeared completely. You only need one tny little dab, enough for both eyes. This cream lasts a looong time.</li>
            <li> Another winner from the pages of Amazon, the first place I go to shop. Their deals are unbeatable. Everyone should use the derma e eye cream. I have read so many reviews that I doubted any of them would work. However, this is for real. I encourage you to try derma e products of your choice for a month. You can always return them, but you wont.  Listen, my skin has smoothed out and the circles under my eyes have faded. I never thought this would be possible with just a cream.  Don&#x27;t forget the serum. It primes my face for a more smoother look.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s not harsh or scented like some eye creams.  It does nothing for dark circles, but I have noticed a reduction in fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Is in use, see how it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using the hydrating eye cream for about 2 weeks now.  My skin is softer and seems more hydrated but at this point do not notice any difference in my wrinkles.  It was a great deal!  I have tried several brand items this last 2 years and many expensive items have created issues with my contacts!  I am 66 and do not expect miracles!  LOL  I will continue to use derma e because i have read many good things about their products and have friends who swear by derma e.  I may try another combination cream after I finish this cream.</li>
            <li> Adds nice moisture but so far not really reducing wrinkles. It&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a lot of change.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but Tooo expensive, keeps raising price for what little amount you get !</li>
            <li> Love the moisture it brings to my eye area.</li>
            <li> Not very creamy.  Expected thicker cream than this for the eye area.  Works OK though.  Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> I expected more from derma e.</li>
            <li> save your money, like most eye creams, it didn&#x27;t do anything!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer at night.  It&#x27;s a big reason why my eyes don&#x27;t look as wrinkled as they should after not enough sleep.</li>
            <li> Great thing  i  buy it to my mother as a gift  and she have a alergic reaction for that cream....  first cream that she had a alergic reaction to.  Sorry for my english</li>
            <li> have used a number of derma e products and like them all. creams go on easily and penetrate well.&lt;br /&gt;much happier using a product that has less chemicals. would recommend this brand highly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and this is the first one that I have ever been able to see a difference in the skin around my eyes.  I have very sensitive skin and this has never caused any irritation.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about 4-5 years. Love the moisture without greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  I have been using it for almost two years.  I noticed a definite difference in the texture of the skin around my eyes by the time I had finished the first tube.</li>
            <li> I will get NOTHING from this company again (DERMAE).  This eye cream is no better than any other eye cream I have tried.  And their customer support is a joke.  I sent them emails and also a comment through their website and when I sent them another to ask why I had not received a response they finally sent back a &amp;#34;response&amp;#34; but the text was blank.  They HAD a wonderful firming moisturizing cream that had the important ingredient DMAE as it&#x27;s second ingredient, but now, to save money I&#x27;m sure, they have reduced the ingredient that made this product work and it is now the SIXTH listed ingredient.  I don&#x27;t deal with companies that don&#x27;t care about their customers, and especially when they mess with a good product to save a buck.</li>
            <li> I a ma new user of this eye cream, so far so good. I have been using for a bout 3 weeks now. My eye area was really dry, and now it is much better, the wrinkles haven&#x27;t disappeared, but are less noticeable compare to before using this cream. I am giving it 4 stars, because I want to wait until I finish the tube to see more results.</li>
            <li> Just received my eye cream 2 days ago.. Feels very nice , no odor , feels light not greasy .&lt;br /&gt; If it gets rid of wrinkles that remains to be seen..&lt;br /&gt; Personally I do not believe that any cream can do that..</li>
            <li> I use this only at night, as it&#x27;s a tiny bit to heavy for me for day time use.  That&#x27;s just me though.  My girlfriend uses hers day and night, and she LOVES it. I do feel like the ingredients are good for my skin, so i will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin. If you have sensitive skin stay away. This may irritate your eye area. Was working ok for me for 5-7 nights then started making my undereye area swell up and itchy.</li>
