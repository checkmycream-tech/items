            <li>but i gets the job done, its a really good cologne for night and</li>
            <li>, it was a good experiment, respect for this cologne.</li>

            <li>Amazing Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Belinda</li>
            <li>This is a great cologne and the smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I saw it on Amazon for a great price with free shipping (Prime) and ordered it.</li>
            <li>The price also fit my budget greatly</li>
            <li>This is a great splash on and a cheap one to boot.......</li>
            <li>This is nice.  </li>
            <li>halston always have some nice cologne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 4 colognes on Amazon, and liked 3...</li>
            <li>In fact, if you combined a bunch of dollar store colognes, I think that would give you an honest idea of what this smells like.</li>
            <li>Prospective buyers kindly take note.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is a good value for the quality.</li>
            <li>If you have used this fragrance before and liked it...</li>
            <li>and it was great back then and is still great now!  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to be able to purchase this Halston product.</li>
            <li>Both boys want to grown ups and want their own cologne</li>
            <li>i would recomed it to every man and it would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li>Went nicely with the leather grooming bag I gave him.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have a favorite because both have a good scent.</li>
            <li>I owned Z-14 before, and liked it, but never knew 1-12 existed until doing some research.</li>
            <li>My son really liked this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a cologne connoisseur and lack the requisite vocabulary to effectively describe the difference,</li>
            <li>Once the topnotes fade, this is a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Nice prices on colognes .</li>
            <li>Classic fragrance that smells great at a great price.</li>
            <li>it has a very clean fragrance that is good for a night on the town.</li>
            <li>An awesome fragrance as classic as a pair of jeans.</li>
            <li>It was very reasonably priced, therefore making it ideal for gift-giving...</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product it smells great and is inexpensive!</li>
            <li>excellent product, highly recommend, my son loves the fragrance</li>
            <li>Nice strong manly scent and does not require that you put on a lot in order to smell good.</li>
            <li>So if your looking for Great Scent HALSTON for Men Is a Good choice for a Reasonable Price..</li>
            <li>This cologne has a woodsy,musk,patchouli combination that gives it its wonderful aroma that goes on to one and smells clean and fresh, and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Never understood how Z-14 was more popular versus this scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the value for the price is amazing.  </li>
            <li>An era when fragrances had true character and each was as distinctive and elegant as the great design house whose name it bore -</li>
            <li>I have been using this for some 20 years - yes a bit older than most, but this is great stuff and a good price through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it !</li>
            <li>Great buy for a great price especially for a guy who prefers this Halston fragance.</li>
            <li>Did realize that that my husband had this cologne already, he was surprised when I got this for him, great but and smells good.</li>
            <li>A nice, clean, softly bold scent that is very appealing!</li>
            <li>It has a vintage fragrance which is very smooth, not fruity and doesn&#x27;t fade soon.</li>
            <li>Nice strong smell to it</li>
            <li>Very nice cologne smell, no silly &amp;#34;fresh soap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;ocean mist&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It is very good for people who are with fragrance sensitive partners.</li>
            <li>Halston is a very high end cologne in any dept. store to get it for this price delivered is great.</li>
            <li>Still has a great smell and is not cheap like some knock-offs (some are very good though).  </li>
            <li>So glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This one is okay, but not something I am rushing out to wear too often.     </li>
            <li>Halston Z14 is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>a go again and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Think it&#x27;s time to add couple more &amp;quot;blast from the past.&amp;quot;</li>
            <li>I have worn this fragrance for many, many years</li>
            <li>what more do you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and still love it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent cologne, released shortly after Halston Z-14 around 1976.</li>
            <li>well worth trying if you like good fragrance.</li>
            <li>This review stuff is wonderful, I think I&#x27;ll use my webcam next time to send you my kudos!</li>
            <li>I am now sleeping on a nice big incredibly plush</li>
            <li>I  love the smell of Halston</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had a 4 star rating, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell that great to me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this scent</li>
            <li>my pairs love it ...</li>
            <li>I love it......</li>
            <li>This one is even better than the one for Women .I</li>
            <li>Amazon it the only way to shop for the best price and convenience.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite day time scent on him.  </li>
            <li>Z14 Smells a lot better.</li>
            <li>Halston Z14 has always been a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>Was glad to see they still offer it.  </li>
            <li>Will reorder when I need more.  </li>
            <li>If I had to pick just one I would pick Z-14 for sure.  </li>
            <li>At these prices I bought both and did not worry about it :)</li>
            <li>There are a lot of colognes which are better than this cologne..</li>
            <li>Not the greatest smell but does last a while for a cheaper cologne.</li>
            <li>I was initially worried about ordering this based off reviews, but it was the best online purchase ever!</li>
            <li>A light citrus pine scent works on almost everyone!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s has a polarizing appeal which means either people are going to love it</li>
            <li>Could not have asked for better.</li>
            <li>He was rather pleased by it.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>OK  </li>
            <li>love the smell and the compliments by all the women who smell me.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments from women when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>Its okay-not my favorite.</li>
            <li>satisfied with product</li>
            <li>son and grandson has started using this cologne as well, we all love it&lt;</li>
            <li>Compared to the more wood and cinnamon forward Z-14 by Halston the 1-12 is more floral and mellow while still maintaining those silky musk undertones.  </li>
            <li>but as it settles it smells better  </li>
            <li>so glad I did :)</li>
            <li>what more can I say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve known and used Halston 1-12 for more than 2 decades now.</li>
            <li>I love the price and the value of this perfume.</li>
            <li>My friend was happy with the product and really enjoys it a lot.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>it is my favorite.</li>

            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>great aroma  very manly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it lasts much more than hour.  </li>
            <li>most people I know don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay twice the amount being charged for this elegant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love Halston 1-12 and glad it is still around.</li>
            <li>Very good price and fragante really good ,  It was as expected!</li>
            <li>Right price and good perfume</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but wouldn&#x27;t order it again and good and fast delevery!</li>
            <li>Great deal for less money always makes me happy &amp; that I am.....</li>
            <li>Excellent cost benefit, long lasting smell and a very pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>This is the real thing, quality men&#x27;s cologne at a remarkable price.  </li>
            <li>pretty good smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the original !</li>
            <li>Halston is an original and well established fragrance, and is what a man should smell like!</li>
            <li>I really cant believe I got something this good for so cheap!</li>
            <li>1-12 has always been my favorite cologne; I was pleased to see that 1-12 was still available for purchase.  </li>
            <li>Love the way he smells - the price is fantastic - I will purchase again</li>
            <li>This is a great smelling cologne, not just for old men either.</li>
            <li>no retard the miami and venezuela</li>
            <li>This was not the best smelling Men Cologne as i expected, but it will do for now.</li>
            <li>But if you enjoy confident scents (esp.</li>
            <li>I have used free hotel cologne that smelled better than this, and they are horrendous.</li>
            <li>Good named product at a reasonable price.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li>Overall great product, pretty good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>Items were as described and delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Potent and lasts a good length of time as well as the old formula too.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this cologne but it fades very quickly from the time you put it on...</li>
            <li>it is a good choice, mainly for evening occasions.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t confuse this with Halston Z-14 which is strong and overpowering.  </li>
            <li>dont like the smell has a strong musk odor..</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as Z-14 but lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>He said that it smells too strong for him.</li>
            <li>High priced cologne for a good price.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very good and lasts long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that may be the best way to describe it: a warm, complex cologne that takes you to a comfortable armchair by a fire with your gal in the 1940&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>And trust me, many of us DO enjoy the smell of rich shaving cream and vanilla.</li>
            <li>My husband wore Halston when I first met him, but it was not the spray kind.</li>
            <li>The original was more of a purplish hue in color (this one is more of a golden), and also the fragrance seems to have been blended with a bit of Halstons Z-14.</li>
            <li>..  FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>I have worn this cologne for years and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This cologne is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth, not overpowering on the nose.&lt;br /&gt;classic</li>
            <li>Wife likes it too and that&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li>An indistinct, exceptionally light fougere of no longevity or projection.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how you can beat this value for such a great smelling Cologne.  </li>
            <li>Thats why it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>YOU CAN SMELL THE CHEAP ALCOHOL ADDED INTO THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>and I hope it is forever available.</li>
            <li>i enjoy the scent of both.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing cheap about this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a cheap smell to it; on the contrary, it exudes warmth and class.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance extremely low price</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for offering this great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It smells funny when you first spray it, but after you put it on, it smells really good.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how good you smell.</li>
            <li>Guys 25 and over would most appreciate 1-12, as it doesn&#x27;t have an aquatic flavor to it like so many modern scents do.</li>
            <li>Fantastic clean scent</li>
            <li>older fregrant but nice</li>
            <li>Such an amazing scent!</li>
            <li>I used to use this scent many years ago before I got married and was dating.</li>
            <li>It smells nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>great lasts long time</li>
            <li>but I always found the original 1-12 to be sharply clean but woodsy/musky.  </li>
            <li>Full bodied, without overpowering it lasts long and smells great after a shave or anytime you just want to freshen up.</li>
            <li>An exquisitely crafted masculine fragrance born in an era when fragrances were literally (and painstakingly) &#x27;designed&#x27; and continuously refined from concept to final production.</li>
            <li>Nice masculine smell !</li>
            <li>Smells very good, but does remind me a little of a bar of soap, I prefer Z-14 to 1-12 but for the price I do not regret the purchase.</li>
            <li>Amazon usually has it at the best price and the delivery time is always quick.  </li>
            <li>i personally like it the fragance clean smell &amp; good presentation.</li>
            <li>Another great scent.&lt;br /&gt;As expected</li>
            <li>While those are good, I keep going back to Halston 1-12.  </li>
            <li>Very solid good scent, have received compliments on it already.</li>
            <li>This cologne has an old school smell which doesn&#x27;t even smell nice.</li>
            <li>But its an overall good fall/winter scent.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne, thanks</li>
            <li>I have received good feedback from the ladies, that&#x27;s TWO BIG THUMBS</li>
            <li>I have used this cologne since the mid 80&#x27;s and have loved it ever since.</li>
            <li>ladies love it hahahaha</li>
            <li>i always loved halston and the way it smells on different bodies.will</li>
            <li>That same warm, classically fresh, manly scent from the 80s that I have come to love.</li>
            <li>The search for a true men&#x27;s cologne continues.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a reasonable amount of time,but would not spray,I have to pull the spray top off and shake some in my hand to rub any on.</li>
            <li>A nice classy smell.</li>
            <li>My son loved his Christmas present!!</li>
            <li>to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected.</li>
            <li>1-12 starts off potent and very musky and sweet.</li>
            <li>No, the title I gave doesn&#x27;t sound very positive, but it truly is meant to if you like either of those scents.</li>
            <li>Classic, mature, warm and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It comes on strong for the first 30 seconds and then mellows out.</li>
            <li>And what better testament to that than Halston 1-12, a true classic that has endured for 36 years in the unforgiving and ever-changing world of designer fragrances.</li>
            <li>, this one certainly won&#x27;t disappoint!!</li>
            <li>Prompt &amp; Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne, and the price was much better than I could get locally (even with shipping).</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>buy this product many more times in future</li>
            <li>and the smell is mild</li>
            <li>It is masculine and rich but not all that memorable after all.</li>
            <li>this definitely is a must have cologne, very lovely</li>
            <li>Fresh and cool, I prefer it to the Halston for women.</li>
            <li>(I put the topper right on top of my existing bed) BRAND NEW bed! lol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Happy the price has been less for each of them.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for the scent, its too strong and</li>
            <li>I guess this cologne smells pretty good,if I could get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li>HECK, that is a true, bonafide mattress and thanks to you (and my money,ha!)</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle because it was super cheap on sale and had decent reviews.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Bigger than expected great price!</li>
            <li>The scent transfers to your clothes and they smell fresh.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand of Cologne for over 20 years and It never get old, I love the smell ,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells ok but not a fragrance that would wow me.</li>
            <li>But it seems like a cologne more for old people.</li>
            <li>subtle, delicious awesome smell, not to strong, not to crazy, I like it quite a lot.</li>
            <li>One of my old time favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>This one was the right size for him.</li>
            <li>This time, it didn&#x27;t smell quite right....</li>
            <li>I think if more people realized how quickly perfumes start turning to alcohol and losing their original scent, they wouldn&#x27;t purchase such large amounts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a fantastic smell for older individuals.</li>
            <li>A classic like the HALSTON 1/12 remains a favorite of mine to date, and I am sure it will continue to be on my cologne counter for a long time to come!</li>
            <li>I expected Halston to smell very handsome.</li>
            <li>Halston 1-12 was actually a discontinued scent until EA acquired the brand and brought this back into the industry and did a great job on resurrecting the scent.</li>
            <li>for halston the 12 is a slightly diffrent but still halston ata great price for men, highly recommend this to others</li>
            <li>I like them both very much.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Think a little lighter would be good..</li>
            <li>It seems to have been cheapened a little bit, but the scent is still pretty good.</li>
            <li>Yes, I shower first.  </li>
            <li>Halston fragrances always have just enough hint to be memorable without knocking out everyone in a dining room.  </li>
            <li>thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts all day and into the evening, even in hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li>My husband has been wearing this cologne since I first met him in 1984.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure he&#x27;s got an extra bottle on hand at all times.</li>
            <li>, she keeps telling me how great I smell :) The only problem with this cologne is that it don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>This is a rather larger sized bottle, most premier men&#x27;s colognes that are this size go for around $50-$75.  </li>
            <li>my favorite but 1-12 is a close second Halston scent.  </li>
            <li>Then again, that was many years back.</li>
            <li>First launched in 1976, there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s still around....</li>
            <li>will absolutely be buying this for my husband again!</li>
            <li>Like this a lot better than the Z scent of the same era.  </li>
            <li>i want to try something different than avon cologne which i love my avon</li>
            <li>better deal than in a regular store.</li>
            <li>I feel like I just walked out of a barber shop and really cleaned myself up!</li>
            <li>I remember the store clerk at Macy&#x27;s saying that the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li>Smell Great an last long</li>
            <li>the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li>I get many compliments, from younger women, I might add.....</li>
            <li>When this is first sprayed, it had an aroma I do not like at all.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty dated smell in my opinion</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for at a price I couldn&#x27;t beat.  </li>
            <li>The item was received within a few weeks, in good condition and it was as described.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff and lasts a few hours anyway.</li>
            <li>This scent works very well with me and blends well with my Right Guard deodorant.</li>
            <li>the halston, z-12, is as good as the more expensive z-14 in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>This parfum exceeded my expectations the scent was lasting a whole day on my clothes and the women they love the smell.</li>
            <li>The title pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>This cologne has long been a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>Found this cologne perfect for an older man,  not suitable for a younger person.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having fun rediscovering classic colognes from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, a time when men smell like real men, and not eyebrow plucking metrosexual.</li>
            <li>It also last for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff used to be pretty good as early as earlier this year (2013); I smelled some that had a rich, oakmossy, green opening - looking at the box, I noted that, sure enough, it had oakmoss in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does last all day and if you are the kinda guy who doesn&#x27;t mind being called Rosebud or Daffydill, why I guess this will suit you just fine.</li>
            <li>They have a certain nice to smell property that makes you want to wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>It has a great spicy, cedar, masculine scent that is hard to find these days.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I spray it in the morning and the sexy smell lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>It has a subdued unusual scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering like some can be.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully won&#x27;t fade too much with time, but for now, would make a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really rebuttal as to why others don&#x27;t praise Halston&#x27;s 1-12.In</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s formula is really close to this scent I remember.</li>
            <li>Order arrived fast</li>
            <li>But order was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Maybe the floral scent is derived from real flowers.</li>
            <li>Still, it is a very manly and an all around scent to wear, day or night.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT SMELL LIKE THE REAL HALSTON THET</li>
            <li>I find that is wasteful of the product as you can put too much on</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>very manly smell.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really care for the Z-12 as I prefer the Z-14.  </li>
            <li>the Price is still Reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing halston for 25 years and this is definitely not the genuine cologne.</li>
            <li>And really loves the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Thanks you</li>
            <li>It seems that its entirely different from genuine product.</li>
            <li>-12 was introduced to me thanks to online reviews by folks who like lighter 80&#x27;s powerhouse scents.</li>
            <li>I blind-bought it off Amazon for about 12 dollars, an absolute STEAL considering the size and quality of this cologne.</li>
            <li>This is very close, but wears off quicker.  </li>
            <li>Just dont be &#x27;that guy&#x27; who poors the whole bottle on.</li>
            <li>It is just very musky.</li>
            <li>Plus it really stands apart from all the over-priced metrosexual colognes being marketed these days.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a cologne that is not to costly but at the same time has a nice smell then look no further.</li>
            <li>the new 1-12 had I smelled it first.</li>
            <li>I remember this as being more rich and musky (but might be confusing it with Z-14).</li>
            <li>It has a very laid back clean smell that&#x27;s very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I also wear Z-14 and even some other brands, but Halston 1-12 has always been my favorite and often gets me compliments.  </li>
            <li>so much better than other deals I used to get in Walmart  </li>
            <li>later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be lulled by the very low price - this stuff isn&#x27;t even worth that!</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full five stars is because the formula has changed a bit from the original back in the day.</li>
            <li>the old 1-12 very much, if at all.  </li>
            <li>As long as it is available I will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells exactly like old spice after shave.</li>
            <li>This cologne has true longevity and projection, lasting 8+ hours on my skin.</li>
            <li>When you first spray this cologne is has an old person cologne smell to it</li>
            <li>Its not bad but being 21, so obviously not my style.</li>
            <li>an age when everything is fast &amp; furious, and loud &amp; tacky, and most fragrances are indistinguishable from each other</li>
            <li>It smelled like older stock that had been sitting around for awhile.</li>
            <li>Definitely a classic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like Halston smell because  Halston is older peoples product</li>
            <li>It fits my needs - older Americans will be please with this.</li>
            <li>It is a classic and decided to get it.</li>
            <li>1-12 is definitely a classic.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy it and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly AAA+++</li>
            <li>Cant beat the price for a high end cologne.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I think I know some other guys with this same kind of cologne as well.</li>
            <li>Kind of like I took a shower with Irish Spring or some other redolent anti-prespirant soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either its really old or it is just pure water.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>And its very very woody which is kind of irritating and won&#x27;t be buying it again..</li>
            <li>Green, crisp top notes of bergamot, basil, lemon &amp; mandarin rise through a lush envelope of pine, lavender, juniper and jasmine middle notes, all of which are flawlessly supported by the rich musky base notes of moss, cedar wood, musk &amp; amber.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this product because of its low price but more because other buyers&#x27; positive review.</li>
            <li>Great gift for Secret Santa Grab Bag!</li>
            <li>Straight Up some old man cologne.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 stars is strictly how I feel it was for me.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t last to long, ok for the price</li>
            <li>3.4oz EDT Spray\\&quot; which is a lighter scent, but has no negative impact on my breathing.</li>
            <li>Personally I feel that it suits a more mature gentleman and, looking back</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing this fragrance since the mid 70&#x27;s still smells fresh to me</li>
            <li>Has a unique scent which feels bitter like a neem tree</li>
            <li>I found this when I was searching for a new cologne for my Husband.</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>am a guy who loves to try new thing</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t make it old and out of style, it makes Halston 1-12 a classic</li>
            <li>Nice inexpensive subtle scent.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite cologne for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I like this item and have purchased it many times in the past.  </li>
            <li>It has a very masculine scent and I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>the shape and color of the bottle is very masculine.</li>
            <li>Very masculine and woodsy, never overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The new 1-12 I received smells very heavily &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;, for lack of a better term.  </li>
            <li>When I got it, and first sprayed it on myself, I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same cologne.</li>
            <li>It has a woodsy, musky scent that is a little strong, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>It is a little to strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Took him back to the 80&#x27;s when he was young and hot.</li>
            <li>Very sexy and very subtle.  </li>
            <li>HALSTON 1-12 is a classic scent that is clean and fresh masculine scent that I have been using since the mid to late 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was good, but a little heavy.</li>
            <li>If you have any breathing difficulties, I would recommend you steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li>As cheap as it is, it&#x27;s still a waste of money because all of these must be old stock now</li>
            <li>But I can clearly state that it doesn&#x27;t resemble</li>
            <li>Figured I&#x27;d give an old standby</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 19 year old son as a b&#x27;day gift who did not care for it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to get shipment 1 day early.(shipped by Yamanni, US Mail.)</li>
            <li>classy and vintage as well ..</li>
            <li>This fragrance is overpowering and smells like old musty bar soap.</li>
            <li>Just like Old times...</li>
            <li>An old standby.</li>
            <li>It does smell like a bouquet of flowers maybe, so the \\&quot;inside of an old woman&#x27;s purse\\&quot; is somewhat understandable.</li>
            <li>Everything I get near her</li>
            <li>Old school coo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a longtime user of Halston and my recent purchase has been very satisfactory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Might have sat around in a hot warehouse for too long.  </li>
            <li>It is a woody/spicy scent that is masculine but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>And my grandfather was a damn classy gentleman.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So worth the low low price....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a original, because after two hours I don&#x27;t feel anything , big mistake order this staff, 100% is not real.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is powerful but long lasting and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>One last thing to add,  my older bottle was a splash bottle.  </li>
            <li>Overall a decent product.</li>
            <li>When i first started using it, it was way more expensive.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend to any guy looking for something different.</li>
            <li>I wore this fragrance back in high lschool over 25 years ago.</li>
            <li>This cologne is a light masculine smelling fragrance, it is getting harder and harder to fin this Halston Z-12 at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>That the usual consequence when you buy cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>As long as I have been married this has been my husband&#x27;s one and only aftershave.  </li>
            <li>The sweetness has faded away after an hour, and 1-12 has hunkered down into a long-standing thick, richly lathered shaving cream mixed with light vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine because it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see how this could been seen as a cologne for an older man, however I am only 20 and get plenty of compliments from people of all ages.</li>
            <li>Really manly, its not quite what i expected</li>
            <li>but I went back to my old perfume ( CK )</li>
            <li>this left stains on my new white shirt...hate it</li>
            <li>I sprayed it right after the product arrived and a few friends asked me the brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 78 years old, found my next bottle on Amazon last month</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lemony,a little soapy,lightly woodsy and very animalistic musky.</li>

            <li> Halston is always a good choice.</li>
            <li> but i gets the job done, its a really good cologne for night and</li>
            <li> , it was a good experiment, respect for this cologne.</li>
            <li> Wanted something he could use that he would never buy, cologne, it smells soooooooo good on a man, I hope he likes it.</li>

            <li> It is a good product.</li>

            <li> Amazing Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Belinda</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne and the smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I saw it on Amazon for a great price with free shipping (Prime) and ordered it.</li>
            <li> The price also fit my budget greatly</li>
            <li> This is a great splash on and a cheap one to boot.......</li>
            <li> This is nice.  </li>
            <li> halston always have some nice cologne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 4 colognes on Amazon, and liked 3...</li>
            <li> In fact, if you combined a bunch of dollar store colognes, I think that would give you an honest idea of what this smells like.</li>
            <li> Prospective buyers kindly take note.</li>
            <li> I am sure it is a good value for the quality.</li>
            <li> If you have used this fragrance before and liked it...</li>
            <li> and it was great back then and is still great now!  </li>
            <li> I was delighted to be able to purchase this Halston product.</li>
            <li> Both boys want to grown ups and want their own cologne</li>
            <li> i would recomed it to every man and it would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Went nicely with the leather grooming bag I gave him.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have a favorite because both have a good scent.</li>
            <li> I owned Z-14 before, and liked it, but never knew 1-12 existed until doing some research.</li>
            <li> My son really liked this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a cologne connoisseur and lack the requisite vocabulary to effectively describe the difference,</li>
            <li> Once the topnotes fade, this is a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Nice prices on colognes .</li>
            <li> Classic fragrance that smells great at a great price.</li>
            <li> it has a very clean fragrance that is good for a night on the town.</li>
            <li> An awesome fragrance as classic as a pair of jeans.</li>
            <li> It was very reasonably priced, therefore making it ideal for gift-giving...</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product it smells great and is inexpensive!</li>
            <li> excellent product, highly recommend, my son loves the fragrance</li>
            <li> Nice strong manly scent and does not require that you put on a lot in order to smell good.</li>
            <li> So if your looking for Great Scent HALSTON for Men Is a Good choice for a Reasonable Price..</li>
            <li> This cologne has a woodsy,musk,patchouli combination that gives it its wonderful aroma that goes on to one and smells clean and fresh, and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Never understood how Z-14 was more popular versus this scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the value for the price is amazing.  </li>
            <li> An era when fragrances had true character and each was as distinctive and elegant as the great design house whose name it bore -</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some 20 years - yes a bit older than most, but this is great stuff and a good price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it !</li>
            <li> Great buy for a great price especially for a guy who prefers this Halston fragance.</li>
            <li> Did realize that that my husband had this cologne already, he was surprised when I got this for him, great but and smells good.</li>
            <li> A nice, clean, softly bold scent that is very appealing!</li>
            <li> It has a vintage fragrance which is very smooth, not fruity and doesn&#x27;t fade soon.</li>
            <li> Nice strong smell to it</li>
            <li> Very nice cologne smell, no silly &amp;#34;fresh soap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;ocean mist&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It is very good for people who are with fragrance sensitive partners.</li>
            <li> Halston is a very high end cologne in any dept. store to get it for this price delivered is great.</li>
            <li> Still has a great smell and is not cheap like some knock-offs (some are very good though).  </li>
            <li> So glad to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> This one is okay, but not something I am rushing out to wear too often.     </li>
            <li> Halston Z14 is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li> a go again and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Think it&#x27;s time to add couple more &amp;quot;blast from the past.&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for many, many years</li>
            <li> what more do you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and still love it.  </li>
            <li> Excellent cologne, released shortly after Halston Z-14 around 1976.</li>
            <li> well worth trying if you like good fragrance.</li>
            <li> This review stuff is wonderful, I think I&#x27;ll use my webcam next time to send you my kudos!</li>
            <li> I am now sleeping on a nice big incredibly plush</li>
            <li> I  love the smell of Halston</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had a 4 star rating, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell that great to me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent</li>
            <li> my pairs love it ...</li>
            <li> I love it......</li>
            <li> This one is even better than the one for Women .I</li>
            <li> Amazon it the only way to shop for the best price and convenience.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite day time scent on him.  </li>
            <li> Z14 Smells a lot better.</li>
            <li> Halston Z14 has always been a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Was glad to see they still offer it.  </li>
            <li> Will reorder when I need more.  </li>
            <li> If I had to pick just one I would pick Z-14 for sure.  </li>
            <li> At these prices I bought both and did not worry about it :)</li>
            <li> There are a lot of colognes which are better than this cologne..</li>
            <li> Not the greatest smell but does last a while for a cheaper cologne.</li>
            <li> I was initially worried about ordering this based off reviews, but it was the best online purchase ever!</li>
            <li> A light citrus pine scent works on almost everyone!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s has a polarizing appeal which means either people are going to love it</li>
            <li> Could not have asked for better.</li>
            <li> He was rather pleased by it.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> OK  </li>
            <li> love the smell and the compliments by all the women who smell me.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments from women when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> its okay</li>
            <li> Its okay-not my favorite.</li>
            <li> satisfied with product</li>
            <li> son and grandson has started using this cologne as well, we all love it&lt;</li>
            <li> Compared to the more wood and cinnamon forward Z-14 by Halston the 1-12 is more floral and mellow while still maintaining those silky musk undertones.  </li>
            <li> but as it settles it smells better  </li>
            <li> so glad I did :)</li>
            <li> what more can I say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known and used Halston 1-12 for more than 2 decades now.</li>
            <li> I love the price and the value of this perfume.</li>
            <li> My friend was happy with the product and really enjoys it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>

            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> great aroma  very manly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it lasts much more than hour.  </li>
            <li> most people I know don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay twice the amount being charged for this elegant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love Halston 1-12 and glad it is still around.</li>
            <li> Very good price and fragante really good ,  It was as expected!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ok but wouldn&#x27;t order it again and good and fast delevery!</li>
            <li> Great deal for less money always makes me happy &amp; that I am.....</li>
            <li> Excellent cost benefit, long lasting smell and a very pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> This is the real thing, quality men&#x27;s cologne at a remarkable price.  </li>
            <li> pretty good smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the original !</li>
            <li> Halston is an original and well established fragrance, and is what a man should smell like!</li>
            <li> I really cant believe I got something this good for so cheap!</li>
            <li> 1-12 has always been my favorite cologne; I was pleased to see that 1-12 was still available for purchase.  </li>
            <li> Love the way he smells - the price is fantastic - I will purchase again</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne, not just for old men either.</li>
            <li> no retard the miami and venezuela</li>
            <li> This was not the best smelling Men Cologne as i expected, but it will do for now.</li>
            <li> But if you enjoy confident scents (esp.</li>
            <li> I have used free hotel cologne that smelled better than this, and they are horrendous.</li>
            <li> Good named product at a reasonable price.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Overall great product, pretty good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Items were as described and delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Potent and lasts a good length of time as well as the old formula too.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cologne but it fades very quickly from the time you put it on...</li>
            <li> it is a good choice, mainly for evening occasions.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t confuse this with Halston Z-14 which is strong and overpowering.  </li>
            <li> dont like the smell has a strong musk odor..</li>
            <li> It is not as strong as Z-14 but lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> He said that it smells too strong for him.</li>
            <li> High priced cologne for a good price.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very good and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that may be the best way to describe it: a warm, complex cologne that takes you to a comfortable armchair by a fire with your gal in the 1940&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> And trust me, many of us DO enjoy the smell of rich shaving cream and vanilla.</li>
            <li> My husband wore Halston when I first met him, but it was not the spray kind.</li>
            <li> The original was more of a purplish hue in color (this one is more of a golden), and also the fragrance seems to have been blended with a bit of Halstons Z-14.</li>
            <li> ..  FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for years and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This cologne is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth, not overpowering on the nose.&lt;br /&gt;classic</li>
            <li> Wife likes it too and that&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li> An indistinct, exceptionally light fougere of no longevity or projection.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how you can beat this value for such a great smelling Cologne.  </li>
            <li> Thats why it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN SMELL THE CHEAP ALCOHOL ADDED INTO THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> and I hope it is forever available.</li>
            <li> i enjoy the scent of both.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing cheap about this fragrance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a cheap smell to it; on the contrary, it exudes warmth and class.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance extremely low price</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for offering this great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It smells funny when you first spray it, but after you put it on, it smells really good.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how good you smell.</li>
            <li> Guys 25 and over would most appreciate 1-12, as it doesn&#x27;t have an aquatic flavor to it like so many modern scents do.</li>
            <li> Fantastic clean scent</li>
            <li> older fregrant but nice</li>
            <li> Such an amazing scent!</li>
            <li> I used to use this scent many years ago before I got married and was dating.</li>
            <li> It smells nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> great lasts long time</li>
            <li> but I always found the original 1-12 to be sharply clean but woodsy/musky.  </li>
            <li> Full bodied, without overpowering it lasts long and smells great after a shave or anytime you just want to freshen up.</li>
            <li> An exquisitely crafted masculine fragrance born in an era when fragrances were literally (and painstakingly) &#x27;designed&#x27; and continuously refined from concept to final production.</li>
            <li> Nice masculine smell !</li>
            <li> Smells very good, but does remind me a little of a bar of soap, I prefer Z-14 to 1-12 but for the price I do not regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazon usually has it at the best price and the delivery time is always quick.  </li>
            <li> i personally like it the fragance clean smell &amp; good presentation.</li>
            <li> Another great scent.&lt;br /&gt;As expected</li>
            <li> While those are good, I keep going back to Halston 1-12.  </li>
            <li> Very solid good scent, have received compliments on it already.</li>
            <li> This cologne has an old school smell which doesn&#x27;t even smell nice.</li>
            <li> But its an overall good fall/winter scent.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, thanks</li>
            <li> I have received good feedback from the ladies, that&#x27;s TWO BIG THUMBS</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne since the mid 80&#x27;s and have loved it ever since.</li>
            <li> ladies love it hahahaha</li>
            <li> i always loved halston and the way it smells on different bodies.will</li>
            <li> That same warm, classically fresh, manly scent from the 80s that I have come to love.</li>
            <li> The search for a true men&#x27;s cologne continues.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a reasonable amount of time,but would not spray,I have to pull the spray top off and shake some in my hand to rub any on.</li>
            <li> A nice classy smell.</li>
            <li> My son loved his Christmas present!!</li>
            <li> to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected.</li>
            <li> 1-12 starts off potent and very musky and sweet.</li>
            <li> No, the title I gave doesn&#x27;t sound very positive, but it truly is meant to if you like either of those scents.</li>
            <li> Classic, mature, warm and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> It comes on strong for the first 30 seconds and then mellows out.</li>
            <li> And what better testament to that than Halston 1-12, a true classic that has endured for 36 years in the unforgiving and ever-changing world of designer fragrances.</li>
            <li> , this one certainly won&#x27;t disappoint!!</li>
            <li> Prompt &amp; Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne, and the price was much better than I could get locally (even with shipping).</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> buy this product many more times in future</li>
            <li> and the smell is mild</li>
            <li> It is masculine and rich but not all that memorable after all.</li>
            <li> this definitely is a must have cologne, very lovely</li>
            <li> Fresh and cool, I prefer it to the Halston for women.</li>
            <li> (I put the topper right on top of my existing bed) BRAND NEW bed! lol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Happy the price has been less for each of them.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the scent, its too strong and</li>
            <li> I guess this cologne smells pretty good,if I could get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> HECK, that is a true, bonafide mattress and thanks to you (and my money,ha!)</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle because it was super cheap on sale and had decent reviews.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected great price!</li>
            <li> The scent transfers to your clothes and they smell fresh.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of Cologne for over 20 years and It never get old, I love the smell ,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells ok but not a fragrance that would wow me.</li>
            <li> But it seems like a cologne more for old people.</li>
            <li> subtle, delicious awesome smell, not to strong, not to crazy, I like it quite a lot.</li>
            <li> One of my old time favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> This one was the right size for him.</li>
            <li> This time, it didn&#x27;t smell quite right....</li>
            <li> I think if more people realized how quickly perfumes start turning to alcohol and losing their original scent, they wouldn&#x27;t purchase such large amounts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a fantastic smell for older individuals.</li>
            <li> A classic like the HALSTON 1/12 remains a favorite of mine to date, and I am sure it will continue to be on my cologne counter for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> I expected Halston to smell very handsome.</li>
            <li> Halston 1-12 was actually a discontinued scent until EA acquired the brand and brought this back into the industry and did a great job on resurrecting the scent.</li>
            <li> for halston the 12 is a slightly diffrent but still halston ata great price for men, highly recommend this to others</li>
            <li> I like them both very much.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Think a little lighter would be good..</li>
            <li> It seems to have been cheapened a little bit, but the scent is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> Yes, I shower first.  </li>
            <li> Halston fragrances always have just enough hint to be memorable without knocking out everyone in a dining room.  </li>
            <li> thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts all day and into the evening, even in hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne since I first met him in 1984.  </li>
            <li> I always make sure he&#x27;s got an extra bottle on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> , she keeps telling me how great I smell :) The only problem with this cologne is that it don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> This is a rather larger sized bottle, most premier men&#x27;s colognes that are this size go for around $50-$75.  </li>
            <li> my favorite but 1-12 is a close second Halston scent.  </li>
            <li> Then again, that was many years back.</li>
            <li> First launched in 1976, there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s still around....</li>
            <li> will absolutely be buying this for my husband again!</li>
            <li> Like this a lot better than the Z scent of the same era.  </li>
            <li> i want to try something different than avon cologne which i love my avon</li>
            <li> better deal than in a regular store.</li>
            <li> I feel like I just walked out of a barber shop and really cleaned myself up!</li>
            <li> I remember the store clerk at Macy&#x27;s saying that the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li> Smell Great an last long</li>
            <li> the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li> I get many compliments, from younger women, I might add.....</li>
            <li> When this is first sprayed, it had an aroma I do not like at all.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty dated smell in my opinion</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for at a price I couldn&#x27;t beat.  </li>
            <li> The item was received within a few weeks, in good condition and it was as described.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff and lasts a few hours anyway.</li>
            <li> This scent works very well with me and blends well with my Right Guard deodorant.</li>
            <li> the halston, z-12, is as good as the more expensive z-14 in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This parfum exceeded my expectations the scent was lasting a whole day on my clothes and the women they love the smell.</li>
            <li> The title pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> This cologne has long been a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Found this cologne perfect for an older man,  not suitable for a younger person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having fun rediscovering classic colognes from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, a time when men smell like real men, and not eyebrow plucking metrosexual.</li>
            <li> It also last for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff used to be pretty good as early as earlier this year (2013); I smelled some that had a rich, oakmossy, green opening - looking at the box, I noted that, sure enough, it had oakmoss in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does last all day and if you are the kinda guy who doesn&#x27;t mind being called Rosebud or Daffydill, why I guess this will suit you just fine.</li>
            <li> They have a certain nice to smell property that makes you want to wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> It has a great spicy, cedar, masculine scent that is hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I spray it in the morning and the sexy smell lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> It has a subdued unusual scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering like some can be.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully won&#x27;t fade too much with time, but for now, would make a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rebuttal as to why others don&#x27;t praise Halston&#x27;s 1-12.In</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s formula is really close to this scent I remember.</li>
            <li> Order arrived fast</li>
            <li> But order was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Maybe the floral scent is derived from real flowers.</li>
            <li> Still, it is a very manly and an all around scent to wear, day or night.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT SMELL LIKE THE REAL HALSTON THET</li>
            <li> I find that is wasteful of the product as you can put too much on</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> very manly smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care for the Z-12 as I prefer the Z-14.  </li>
            <li> the Price is still Reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing halston for 25 years and this is definitely not the genuine cologne.</li>
            <li> And really loves the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Thanks you</li>
            <li> It seems that its entirely different from genuine product.</li>
            <li> -12 was introduced to me thanks to online reviews by folks who like lighter 80&#x27;s powerhouse scents.</li>
            <li> I blind-bought it off Amazon for about 12 dollars, an absolute STEAL considering the size and quality of this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is very close, but wears off quicker.  </li>
            <li> Just dont be &#x27;that guy&#x27; who poors the whole bottle on.</li>
            <li> It is just very musky.</li>
            <li> Plus it really stands apart from all the over-priced metrosexual colognes being marketed these days.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a cologne that is not to costly but at the same time has a nice smell then look no further.</li>
            <li> the new 1-12 had I smelled it first.</li>
            <li> I remember this as being more rich and musky (but might be confusing it with Z-14).</li>
            <li> It has a very laid back clean smell that&#x27;s very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I also wear Z-14 and even some other brands, but Halston 1-12 has always been my favorite and often gets me compliments.  </li>
            <li> so much better than other deals I used to get in Walmart  </li>
            <li> later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be lulled by the very low price - this stuff isn&#x27;t even worth that!</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full five stars is because the formula has changed a bit from the original back in the day.</li>
            <li> the old 1-12 very much, if at all.  </li>
            <li> As long as it is available I will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells exactly like old spice after shave.</li>
            <li> This cologne has true longevity and projection, lasting 8+ hours on my skin.</li>
            <li> When you first spray this cologne is has an old person cologne smell to it</li>
            <li> Its not bad but being 21, so obviously not my style.</li>
            <li> an age when everything is fast &amp; furious, and loud &amp; tacky, and most fragrances are indistinguishable from each other</li>
            <li> It smelled like older stock that had been sitting around for awhile.</li>
            <li> Definitely a classic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like Halston smell because  Halston is older peoples product</li>
            <li> It fits my needs - older Americans will be please with this.</li>
            <li> It is a classic and decided to get it.</li>
            <li> 1-12 is definitely a classic.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly AAA+++</li>
            <li> Cant beat the price for a high end cologne.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I think I know some other guys with this same kind of cologne as well.</li>
            <li> Kind of like I took a shower with Irish Spring or some other redolent anti-prespirant soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either its really old or it is just pure water.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> And its very very woody which is kind of irritating and won&#x27;t be buying it again..</li>
            <li> Green, crisp top notes of bergamot, basil, lemon &amp; mandarin rise through a lush envelope of pine, lavender, juniper and jasmine middle notes, all of which are flawlessly supported by the rich musky base notes of moss, cedar wood, musk &amp; amber.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product because of its low price but more because other buyers&#x27; positive review.</li>
            <li> Great gift for Secret Santa Grab Bag!</li>
            <li> Straight Up some old man cologne.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 stars is strictly how I feel it was for me.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last to long, ok for the price</li>
            <li> 3.4oz EDT Spray\\&quot; which is a lighter scent, but has no negative impact on my breathing.</li>
            <li> Personally I feel that it suits a more mature gentleman and, looking back</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this fragrance since the mid 70&#x27;s still smells fresh to me</li>
            <li> Has a unique scent which feels bitter like a neem tree</li>
            <li> I found this when I was searching for a new cologne for my Husband.</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> am a guy who loves to try new thing</li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t make it old and out of style, it makes Halston 1-12 a classic</li>
            <li> Nice inexpensive subtle scent.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite cologne for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I like this item and have purchased it many times in the past.  </li>
            <li> It has a very masculine scent and I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> the shape and color of the bottle is very masculine.</li>
            <li> Very masculine and woodsy, never overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The new 1-12 I received smells very heavily &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;, for lack of a better term.  </li>
            <li> When I got it, and first sprayed it on myself, I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same cologne.</li>
            <li> It has a woodsy, musky scent that is a little strong, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> It is a little to strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Took him back to the 80&#x27;s when he was young and hot.</li>
            <li> Very sexy and very subtle.  </li>
            <li> HALSTON 1-12 is a classic scent that is clean and fresh masculine scent that I have been using since the mid to late 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was good, but a little heavy.</li>
            <li> If you have any breathing difficulties, I would recommend you steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> As cheap as it is, it&#x27;s still a waste of money because all of these must be old stock now</li>
            <li> But I can clearly state that it doesn&#x27;t resemble</li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d give an old standby</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 19 year old son as a b&#x27;day gift who did not care for it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to get shipment 1 day early.(shipped by Yamanni, US Mail.)</li>
            <li> classy and vintage as well ..</li>
            <li> This fragrance is overpowering and smells like old musty bar soap.</li>
            <li> Just like Old times...</li>
            <li> An old standby.</li>
            <li> It does smell like a bouquet of flowers maybe, so the \\&quot;inside of an old woman&#x27;s purse\\&quot; is somewhat understandable.</li>
            <li> Everything I get near her</li>
            <li> Old school coo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime user of Halston and my recent purchase has been very satisfactory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Might have sat around in a hot warehouse for too long.  </li>
            <li> It is a woody/spicy scent that is masculine but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> And my grandfather was a damn classy gentleman.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So worth the low low price....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a original, because after two hours I don&#x27;t feel anything , big mistake order this staff, 100% is not real.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is powerful but long lasting and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> One last thing to add,  my older bottle was a splash bottle.  </li>
            <li> Overall a decent product.</li>
            <li> When i first started using it, it was way more expensive.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend to any guy looking for something different.</li>
            <li> I wore this fragrance back in high lschool over 25 years ago.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a light masculine smelling fragrance, it is getting harder and harder to fin this Halston Z-12 at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> That the usual consequence when you buy cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> As long as I have been married this has been my husband&#x27;s one and only aftershave.  </li>
            <li> The sweetness has faded away after an hour, and 1-12 has hunkered down into a long-standing thick, richly lathered shaving cream mixed with light vanilla extract.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine because it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see how this could been seen as a cologne for an older man, however I am only 20 and get plenty of compliments from people of all ages.</li>
            <li> Really manly, its not quite what i expected</li>
            <li> but I went back to my old perfume ( CK )</li>
            <li> this left stains on my new white shirt...hate it</li>
            <li> I sprayed it right after the product arrived and a few friends asked me the brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 78 years old, found my next bottle on Amazon last month</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lemony,a little soapy,lightly woodsy and very animalistic musky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that the new 1-12 I just purchased doesn&#x27;t smell very much like the old 1-12, which is a very big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cologne is absolutely not what i expected, the company that shipped it is not the problem, its the cologne itself it smells like my grandpa, do not waste money on this cologne unless your like over 50!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you are not into those typical fruity, minty colognes.</li>
            <li> When they arrived WOW there is over twice of the amount in 1 bottle than in my other one, and the price here was $7.70.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud like the other perfumes.</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of the original cologne spray.  </li>
            <li> Growing older doesn&#x27;t mean you have to give up old favs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Best part is the cost is much lower than it was in the past.</li>
            <li> but I wish it last long, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> but i feel i doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Ten (!) sprays on me are barely to be smelled a half hour</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s a modern day hidden gem that has so little following/knowledge of it, that the price is equally</li>
            <li> I tried this cologne and found it to be nothing more than bathroom spray in a small bottle, and a weak one at that.</li>
            <li> But with any decently priced cologne come with some disadvantages; it doesn&#x27;t last as long on you as it should (at least for me).</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t been as bad, but honestly I have never worn this.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> Each nuance lingers for a long while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it does stay quite a long while.</li>
            <li> Lasts long and wife loves the smell.  </li>
            <li> The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time and is obvious on my work clothes when I take them off and even into the next day (I only apply it on my skin in small amounts on my wrists and neck)</li>
            <li> , i prefer to combine it with other colognes , its a sweat musky type of smell in a way, doesn&#x27;t last very long, I combine it with Nautica Voyage</li>
            <li> Not a new brand, but</li>
            <li> Only down note was some minor leakage noticed around bottle.</li>
            <li> The only slight is that the spray tip doesnt seem to spray as well as</li>
            <li> 1-12 Halston&#x27;s scent is not a strong one that arrive in the room before you, but last a long time</li>
            <li> bad fragance, also the bottle top came off, so about 25 percent was gone.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Halston 1-12 since 1976 or 1977 and it has gotten harder to locate.  </li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner and was as expected.</li>
            <li> Quality fragrance as expected from Halston.  </li>
            <li> The expected.</li>
            <li> It is just like this : [...] which we use back in my country to get rid of any strong smells from hand after working on oily or greasy things ...</li>
            <li> The old formula in my opinion had something small in it that made it a little darker...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle and masculine.</li>
            <li> My wife just bought me a small bottle locally for 22 dollars plus tax.</li>
            <li> Despite some other reviews, the bottle I got smells like it did in the 80&#x27;s, so I dont believe its been reformulated as some speculate.</li>
            <li> So diametrically opposite to the &#x27;paint-by-numbers&#x27; fragrances of today (eau de banality) concocted by &#x27;marketing experts&#x27; who pick a stock base fragrance (lot X) and tweak it here and there with a few more stock scents, then slap a celebrity name on it and</li>
            <li> Limiting one&#x27;s spritzes of this (like other 80&#x27;s scents) is adviseable.</li>
            <li> ,I&#x27;ll give it away free smh,I waited this long for this crap</li>
            <li> Not worth the time to track a credit.</li>
            <li> I am a late 20&#x27;s male and was a bit unsure if this cologne would suit.</li>
            <li> I have received a ton of compliments from the ladies I work with and am convinced it helped me lock down the beauty I&#x27;m dating now.</li>
            <li> it lasts a while though mayby 3 or 4 hours ,, its not very strong on a level of 1- 10 in strength</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve smelt dollar store cologne less offensive than this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even using it, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> It does, though, perform like you would think a 15 odd dollar bottle of cologne would, its very weak, and to me, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I feel like they changed up the scent a little bit.</li>
            <li> At All, Dont Waste Your Money...</li>
            <li> As it shows a somewhat \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; smell, I do not recommend to wear it everyday, however if you like to wear colognes I would say that 2 or 3 times a week</li>
            <li> always use this, and at this price it was a bargin ,told a few friends about it,they will be purchaceing it soon</li>
            <li> I think you shouldnt waste your money with this cologne..</li>
            <li> The drydown on me is like green soap.</li>
            <li> iit&#x27;s the scent that makes me use it everyday.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has trouble finding this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wear it very rarely.</li>
            <li> if that what they mean by smell like a man.. then keep it.. other than that delievery was on time as projected.. but dont like the smell i wouldnt advise it unless your a fan of musk..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to plop down $50 duckets for cologne these days.  </li>
            <li> I think the Halston&#x27;s has been watered down !!</li>
            <li> This is awful, the reason it&#x27;s considered a classic is because it&#x27;s made for really old people.</li>
            <li> Blast from the past.  </li>
            <li> My wife suggested reselling it, but I&#x27;m not sure I could even give this away.</li>
            <li> Sorry, not the same stuff from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and yet it&#x27;s not potent.</li>
            <li> Not sure what they put in the bottle</li>
            <li> Complex but neither overbearing or heavy.</li>
            <li> Also having problems returning it via Amazon Prime, not sure why?</li>
            <li> It arrived as promisede within a few days of ordering!</li>
            <li> (folks don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing!).</li>
            <li> and I am often asked ,usually by men, what that fragrance is.</li>
            <li> very dead smell.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it does not maintain it&#x27;s scent on me for very long.</li>
            <li> But once you realize that it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> Use common sense and purchase the $90 bottle if you want an &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Sucks that it&#x27;s a non-returnable item.</li>
            <li> Why the other ones are still expensive and this one is not?  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> seriously, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again</li>
            <li> Not good smell like something @ a funeral home</li>
            <li> Halston has always been one of my favorites and I was disappointed when I ran out of my last bottle.  </li>
            <li> The longevity and projection is on the weak side, but i tend to forgive it for the price.</li>
            <li> my brushes, makeup and bath puffs and Hoyle card game.</li>
            <li> per unit, i would be receiving a poor product.</li>
            <li> It is \\&quot;flowerly\\&quot;, and thus is a poor choice for men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> and it smells really flowery and disgusting.</li>
            <li> ....by far the worst smell I have ever smelled in my life</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it&#x27;s not amazing either.</li>
            <li> It was absolutely a wrong buy for me.</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS FAKE  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS FAKE</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;you can not go wrong with this product</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this is not for my guy.</li>
            <li> but I decided don‚Äôt give to him since it has weird odor.</li>
            <li> Stinks I am sorry smells like soap...</li>
            <li> Impossible to find in stores anymore  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bad--</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t smell smashing or bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> When I received this cologne I was shocked that the bottle had no labeling on it at all.  </li>
            <li> ir hate it.</li>
            <li> Then I purchase this item from Amazon.com and am very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Worst smell ever.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible !</li>
            <li> This is my worst purchase every.</li>
            <li> The fragrance has quite a bit of longevity, but given that it smells so awful, its lastingness is just another drawback.</li>
            <li> That is really terrible...</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> it smells awful.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This fragrance smalls very nice for evening wear.  I used to wear it ll day, but in retirement I can smell like sweat until I see people.  This is nice.  Yes, I shower first.  I&#x27;m retired; I&#x27;m not an animal.  Halston fragrances always have just enough hint to be memorable without knocking out everyone in a dining room.  It is very good for people who are with fragrance sensitive partners.</li>
            <li> halston always have some nice cologne</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it&#x27;s not amazing either. I guess you get what you pay for.  But once you realize that it&#x27;s too late. You can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s flammable.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this on Amazon. Cologne is much more expensive in stores. This is a good value for the size and price.</li>
            <li> This one was the right size for him. He leaves it at work so when he leaves work to go out to dinner he refreshes himself with this one.Thanks</li>
            <li> Halston has always been one of my favorites and I was disappointed when I ran out of my last bottle.  Glad I found this on Amazon.  I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Nice masculine smell !</li>
            <li> smells great!  Just like you remember.... So worth the low low price....</li>
            <li> Simply awesome.  Items were as described and delivered very quickly.  I have been wearing Halston 1-12 since 1976 or 1977 and it has gotten harder to locate.  I also wear Z-14 and even some other brands, but Halston 1-12 has always been my favorite and often gets me compliments.  Thank you so much for offering this great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> i dont like the smell</li>
            <li> Fresh and cool, I prefer it to the Halston for women.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a cologne that is not to costly but at the same time has a nice smell then look no further.</li>
            <li> This Doesn&#x27;t Smells As I Though, I Would Not Recommend This At All, Dont Waste Your Money...</li>
            <li> Excellent seller and excellent product</li>
            <li> Another of my 80s cologne re-stock. I remember this as being more rich and musky (but might be confusing it with Z-14). This one is okay, but not something I am rushing out to wear too often.     It is masculine and rich but not all that memorable after all.</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve seen, and quick service. Got the product well within the timeframe promised.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last to long, ok for the price</li>
            <li> Nice and pleasant not overpowering. Prompt &amp; Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Halston Z14 is my favorite cologne. My wife just bought me a small bottle locally for 22 dollars plus tax. I came across this ad here and bought 2 bottles. When they arrived WOW there is over twice of the amount in 1 bottle than in my other one, and the price here was $7.70. Im very happy and would not of believed it if it didnt happen to me. Thanks AMAZOM..  FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try this one and it is really good.  so much better than other deals I used to get in Walmart  I strongly recommend it ! thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> The title pretty much says it all. I regret getting it. Maybe it&#x27;s just not for me though...</li>
            <li> I had never heard of 112. While ordering Halston&#x27;s Catalyst cologne, I saw this and took a chance. The fragrance is powerful but long lasting and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m glad I took the chance. It was received timely and in the advertised condition.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product because of its low price but more because other buyers&#x27; positive review. I sprayed it right after the product arrived and a few friends asked me the brand. I spray it in the morning and the sexy smell lasts longer than I expected. Good buy!</li>
            <li> This is a good deal at under 9 bucks. Buy several. Give gifts. It&#x27;s a mellow cologne that won&#x27;t offend anyone.</li>
            <li> I am unable to tell what the fragrance is because the spray does not work and it would cost me more to return it.</li>
            <li> THIS COLOGN SMELLS SO GOOD SOMEONE IS ALWAYS ASKING ME WHAT IT IS AND SAYING I SMELL GOOD.BUYING THIS ON AMAZON SAVED ME ABOUT TWENTY FIVE BUCKS.</li>
            <li> Worst smell ever. very dead smell.</li>
            <li> Yep, just like I remembered.  Blast from the past.  This and Z14 were favorites.  It&#x27;s hard to plop down $50 duckets for cologne these days.  Figured I&#x27;d give an old standby a go again and glad I did.  Growing older doesn&#x27;t mean you have to give up old favs.  The Amazon seller and product exceeded expectations yet again.  Think it&#x27;s time to add couple more &amp;quot;blast from the past.&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> Love the way he smells - the price is fantastic - I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Estoy muy insatisfecha con el servicio de compra de Amazon. En dias pasados compre unos audifonos de un modelo y me mandaron otro modelo y ahora no se donde devolverlos, dicen que hacer una devolucion es FACIL y de facil no tiene nada. Despues compre 3 perfumes Halston y solo me mandaron 1 y me cobraron los 3 y ahora no se como hacer el reclomo para que me hagan el reembolso. Lo he intentado de varias formas y NADA. Yo me afilie a Amazon porque crei que era una empresa seria pero hasta hora NO me han solucionado mis problemas con las compras de las cuales es de ustedes loa errores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 4 colognes on Amazon, and liked 3... this was the fourth. Didn&#x27;t really care for the scent, its too strong and... musky. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wear it very rarely.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for many, many years and I never get tired of the original cologne spray.  Then I purchase this item from Amazon.com and am very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I am not a cologne expert of any sort but nevertheless here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It smells good!&lt;br /&gt;-It has a manly smell, doesn&#x27;t smell like lady&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;-Again it smells good what more do you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product it smells great and is inexpensive! It also last for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;I say don&#x27;t hesitate and order it! You&#x27;ll thank me afterwards trust me! ;)</li>
            <li> There is not scent to it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and still love it.  Get compliments on it as well.</li>
            <li> a big NO NO for this product...this left stains on my new white shirt...hate it and i dont recommend it</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne, released shortly after Halston Z-14 around 1976. Not a new brand, but well worth trying if you like good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Halston 1-12 is an item I like to purchase whenever I have the chance. Excellent cost benefit, long lasting smell and a very pleasant scent.  As it shows a somewhat \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; smell, I do not recommend to wear it everyday, however if you like to wear colognes I would say that 2 or 3 times a week it is a good choice, mainly for evening occasions.  I sincerelly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I have worn this cologne for years and it is fantastic. The scent lasts all day long.  I will continue to buy it and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Smells terrible ! Please don&#x27;t buy !</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance. Just wish it were a pour type bottle then a spray. Bought it for my 19 year old son as a b&#x27;day gift who did not care for it.</li>
            <li> It smells funny when you first spray it, but after you put it on, it smells really good. I hope my husband like his gift.</li>
            <li> This cologne is absolutely not what i expected, the company that shipped it is not the problem, its the cologne itself it smells like my grandpa, do not waste money on this cologne unless your like over 50!!!</li>
            <li> Great cologne at a great price.  Well packaged and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Not good smell like something @ a funeral home,I&#x27;ll give it away free smh,I waited this long for this crap</li>
            <li> This Halston 1-12 smells great. I get a lot of compliments from family and friends on how terrific it smells on me.</li>
            <li> HALSTON speaks for itself. If you are wearing it YOU WILL STANDOUT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Halston 1-12 for thirty years and still think it&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;ve used Tuscany, Drakkar, Hugo Boss, and Royal Copenhagen Musk.  While those are good, I keep going back to Halston 1-12.  It has a subdued unusual scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering like some can be.  My wife loves it.  Don&#x27;t confuse this with Halston Z-14 which is strong and overpowering.  I will also advise folks not to buy cologne at the mall where it is overpriced.  Buy it from Amazon and save a boatload.</li>
            <li> Great product and service.</li>
            <li> Wow!! This review stuff is wonderful, I think I&#x27;ll use my webcam next time to send you my kudos! Because that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll ever be submitting to you, Amazon..KUDOS for great products and great service.

            <li> dont like the smell has a strong musk odor.. yuck if that what they mean by smell like a man.. then keep it.. other than that delievery was on time as projected.. but dont like the smell i wouldnt advise it unless your a fan of musk.. winters coming how about some deer musk</li>
            <li> Classic fragrance that smells great at a great price. Great deal for less money always makes me happy &amp; that I am.....</li>
            <li> I  love the smell of Halston hope it smells good on my man Can&#x27;t wait to give it to him.</li>
            <li> This cologne is fantastic.  The fragrance lasts all day and into the evening, even in hot, humid weather. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my worst purchase every. Feels like i sprayed water on me. No smell at all. Either its really old or it is just pure water.</li>
            <li> Este perfume a pesar de ser econ&amp;oacute;mico, tiene un olor agradable al momento y en el transcurso del d&amp;iacute;a se va perdiendo, pero para personas de sudor bajo considero que es recomendable.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells exactly like old spice after shave. Seriously. I guess it would be good if you are 50.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne, not just for old men either. I am 18 and get compliments on how I smell when I use this. Has a great smokey smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had a 4 star rating, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell that great to me. Anyway, I bought it, so I will wear it for now.</li>
            <li> Title says it all. I was pleasantly surprised to get shipment 1 day early.(shipped by Yamanni, US Mail.) Only down note was some minor leakage noticed around bottle. (Maybe shipment shipped by air ?). Very solid good scent, have received compliments on it already. Hopefully won&#x27;t fade too much with time, but for now, would make a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> The cologne is very nice, but the spray dispenser knob fell off while I was using it.</li>
            <li> Another great scent.&lt;br /&gt;As expected</li>
            <li> After a couple-a-decades I was looking for a cheaper cologne to use to mask the smells associated with my job. I was perusing the colognes and restumbled across the Halston Brand again. I remember using I-12 and Z-14 in the 80&#x27;s and decided to reinvest into the brand again. Despite some other reviews, the bottle I got smells like it did in the 80&#x27;s, so I dont believe its been reformulated as some speculate. It does, though, perform like you would think a 15 odd dollar bottle of cologne would, its very weak, and to me, doesn&#x27;t last long. There is a reason you can buy a bottle of cologne for 9 dollars, and another bottle for 90 dollars. They would have discontinued I-12 if it wasn&#x27;t profitable for them, its been around since the 70&#x27;s. Use common sense and purchase the $90 bottle if you want an &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent but unfortunately it does not maintain it&#x27;s scent on me for very long. For this reason I use when I return home f rom work and I want to freshen up. The price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Fantastic clean scent my pairs love it ...classy and vintage as well ..Recommended buy</li>
            <li> This fragrance is overpowering and smells like old musty bar soap. It&#x27;s really bad--I think I&#x27;ve smelt dollar store cologne less offensive than this. In fact, if you combined a bunch of dollar store colognes, I think that would give you an honest idea of what this smells like. I bought a bottle because it was super cheap on sale and had decent reviews. My wife suggested reselling it, but I&#x27;m not sure I could even give this away. The fragrance has quite a bit of longevity, but given that it smells so awful, its lastingness is just another drawback. What lesson did I learn? Never buy a fragrance based on online reviews. From now on, I&#x27;ll always sample fragrances at a local store before buying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a original, because after two hours I don&#x27;t feel anything , big mistake order this staff, 100% is not real.</li>
            <li> HALSTON 1-12 is a classic scent that is clean and fresh masculine scent that I have been using since the mid to late 1980&#x27;s. This cologne has a woodsy,musk,patchouli combination that gives it its wonderful aroma that goes on to one and smells clean and fresh, and the scent lasts all day. You will receive compliments for sure! A classic like the HALSTON 1/12 remains a favorite of mine to date, and I am sure it will continue to be on my cologne counter for a long time to come! I rate it 5 stars for EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> the perfum is very good no retard the miami and venezuela the product is accesible and price is very nice</li>
            <li> Sorry, not the same stuff from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the original ! Gave to my husband for Christmas and he loved it. Took him back to the 80&#x27;s when he was young and hot. This is not a knock-off.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne and the smell is fantastic.  This was the lowest price I have ever seen for this product.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I used to use this cologne years ago. I saw it on Amazon for a great price with free shipping (Prime) and ordered it. When I got it, and first sprayed it on myself, I couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same cologne. It smelled like older stock that had been sitting around for awhile. Returning it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> This cologne has an old school smell which doesn&#x27;t even smell nice. Prospective buyers kindly take note. It was absolutely a wrong buy for me.</li>
            <li> 1-12 and Z-14 Halston the best in the world. I love it...... It works for me and my wife Loves it too. It&#x27;s just GREAT.............</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item gave it to my dad as a present very good price and time of arrival also able to track it very good</li>
            <li> My husband likes Halston, great find great price. It has a very masculine scent and I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This one is even better than the one for Women .I was looking for a perfume for my boys and I found it . This one is a keeper for me. It is manly, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great price on this Cologne my husband loves. Amazon it the only way to shop for the best price and convenience.</li>
            <li> Just like Old times...</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites fragrances and the price was unbeatable. Even the local flea market could not compete</li>
            <li> Classic, mature, warm and refreshing.  Fragrance changes over time.  Each nuance lingers for a long while. Buy this at this price it is a steal.</li>
            <li> excellent product, highly recommend, my son loves the fragrance</li>
            <li> I used to use this scent many years ago before I got married and was dating. It smell great then and it still does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part is the cost is much lower than it was in the past.</li>
            <li> I feel like they changed up the scent a little bit. But its an overall good fall/winter scent.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of H 1-12 over the years. Happy the price has been less for each of them. It has a great spicy, cedar, masculine scent that is hard to find these days. Definitely a classic. Halston always impresses as well.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing, quality men&#x27;s cologne at a remarkable price.  Halston is a very high end cologne in any dept. store to get it for this price delivered is great.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this cologne is good for evening and day wear. It&#x27;s a nanly smell and yet it&#x27;s not potent. It&#x27;s just enough. 5 Stars</li>
            <li> I love it. Can&#x27;t figure out why they stopped making it. Nothing else they have comes close.</li>
            <li> This cologne is an excellent scent and I would highly recommend to any guy looking for something different. But with any decently priced cologne come with some disadvantages; it doesn&#x27;t last as long on you as it should (at least for me). I find that I have to apply a couple times throughout the day to still sense its presence. Overall great product, pretty good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Very good price and fragante really good ,  It was as expected!</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne since I first met him in 1984.  It is my favorite day time scent on him.  Amazon usually has it at the best price and the delivery time is always quick.  I always make sure he&#x27;s got an extra bottle on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really rebuttal as to why others don&#x27;t praise Halston&#x27;s 1-12.In my opinion Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s formula is really close to this scent I remember.The old formula in my opinion had something small in it that made it a little darker...possibly reminiscent to teak oil.But the big picture of this cologne to me remains unchanged.It&#x27;s lemony,a little soapy,lightly woodsy and very animalistic musky.Potent and lasts a good length of time as well as the old formula too.Halston 1-12 was actually a discontinued scent until EA acquired the brand and brought this back into the industry and did a great job on resurrecting the scent.Never understood how Z-14 was more popular versus this scent.</li>
            <li> pretty good smell, i prefer to combine it with other colognes , its a sweat musky type of smell in a way, doesn&#x27;t last very long, I combine it with Nautica Voyage</li>
            <li> Order arrived fast but I wanted Halston Z14 but it was my error so I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back . Z14 Smells a lot better. But order was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> The ladies throw themselves at my feet the moment I walk out the door with this stuff, but the mosquitos stay away. Win + win.</li>
            <li> As long as I have been married this has been my husband&#x27;s one and only aftershave.  As long as it is available I will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since the 80&#x27;s. It&#x27;s subtle and masculine. I recommend anyone try it and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how good you smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sit here and articulate how this smells. Go Google it. I think it smells good. I am sure it is a good value for the quality. Go for it!</li>
            <li> i chose this rating because of the scent of the product was very nice.  it made a great gift. the shape and color of the bottle is very masculine.</li>
            <li> I found this when I was searching for a new cologne for my Husband. Reviews were good so thought I would try it. It is Great!!</li>
            <li> always use this, and at this price it was a bargin ,told a few friends about it,they will be purchaceing it soon ,i told them the price might change and to hurry,i hope they listened.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne, and the price was much better than I could get locally (even with shipping).</li>
            <li> bad fragance, also the bottle top came off, so about 25 percent was gone. Amazon said not return. I feel raped.</li>
            <li> I like this Item.Good for men.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a light masculine smelling fragrance, it is getting harder and harder to fin this Halston Z-12 at an affordable price. This seller delivers a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve loved this scent for forever. it&#x27;s smooth, not overpowering on the nose.&lt;br /&gt;classic scent really.&lt;br /&gt;it does stay quite a long while.</li>
            <li> Halston Z14 has always been a favorite of mine. Halston 1-12 is almost as good. it has a very clean fragrance that is good for a night on the town.</li>
            <li> Did not order this item,it was shipped by mistake and the item has a pleasant  order, I don&#x27;t know if I would order it myself.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, thanks</li>
            <li> the product is very strong if you are of the people who likes to wear strong fragrances is ideal for you, but if you do not like do not buy it.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging, price and especially the cologne.  Not overpowering, but always gets noticed.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had good memories of this product, 1-12 and z-14. I should have guessed @ $8. per unit, i would be receiving a poor product. Not sure what they put in the bottle but it was not the scent I was expecting. I through the product away. Not worth the time to track a credit.</li>
            <li> Used to use Halston cologne years ago.  Thought they quit making it.  Was glad to see they still offer it.  Wife likes it too and that&#x27;s important.  Good value.</li>
            <li> An old standby. If you have used this fragrance before and liked it...then it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> Very nice cologne smell, no silly &amp;#34;fresh soap&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;ocean mist&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;.  Complex but neither overbearing or heavy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like dirt. It does smell like a bouquet of flowers maybe, so the \\&quot;inside of an old woman&#x27;s purse\\&quot; is somewhat understandable. It is \\&quot;flowerly\\&quot;, and thus is a poor choice for men&#x27;s fragrance. It does last all day and if you are the kinda guy who doesn&#x27;t mind being called Rosebud or Daffydill, why I guess this will suit you just fine. However, the reason I am giving it a ONE star has to do with my personal reaction to the product ONLY! I have asthma, and THIS stuff exacerbated my symptoms something fierce! If you have any breathing difficulties, I would recommend you steer clear of this one. Maybe the floral scent is derived from real flowers. I don&#x27;t know. I would recommend \\&quot;Cafe Cafe Puro Pour Homme by Cofinluxe 100ml 3.4oz EDT Spray\\&quot; which is a lighter scent, but has no negative impact on my breathing. I have received good feedback from the ladies, that&#x27;s TWO BIG THUMBS UP: I can breathe and chicks dig it!!!</li>
            <li> An awesome fragrance as classic as a pair of jeans. I have used this cologne since the mid 80&#x27;s and have loved it ever since. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a full five stars is because the formula has changed a bit from the original back in the day. The original was more of a purplish hue in color (this one is more of a golden), and also the fragrance seems to have been blended with a bit of Halstons Z-14. Still, it is a very manly and an all around scent to wear, day or night.</li>
            <li> Still has a great smell and is not cheap like some knock-offs (some are very good though).  It is not as strong as Z-14 but lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great buy for a great price especially for a guy who prefers this Halston fragance. It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff used to be pretty good as early as earlier this year (2013); I smelled some that had a rich, oakmossy, green opening - looking at the box, I noted that, sure enough, it had oakmoss in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife bought me a bottle for Christmas with a date code of October 2013 on it; the box shows no treemoss or oakmoss. EA reformulated it. The result? An indistinct, exceptionally light fougere of no longevity or projection. Ten (!) sprays on me are barely to be smelled a half hour later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be lulled by the very low price - this stuff isn&#x27;t even worth that!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this stuff back in the 1980&#x27;s.  Very masculine and woodsy, never overpowering.  I was amazed at the price.  It arrived quickly and well packaged.  Will reorder when I need more.  Great seller.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was good, but a little heavy. My daughter was allergic to it, so he didn&#x27;t wear it until she left. Think a little lighter would be good..</li>
            <li> Great cologne, I&#x27;d say this is good for when your going to church. I think I know some other guys with this same kind of cologne as well.</li>
            <li> This cologne has long been a favorite of mine. Full bodied, without overpowering it lasts long and smells great after a shave or anytime you just want to freshen up.</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS FAKE  DOES NOT SMELL LIKE THE REAL HALSTON THET I HAVE USED FOR YEARS AND THE SMELL DOES NOT LAST  NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED!!!</li>
            <li> Did realize that that my husband had this cologne already, he was surprised when I got this for him, great but and smells good.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves this smell. Everything I get near her, she keeps telling me how great I smell :) The only problem with this cologne is that it don&#x27;t last long at all. I like i‚Äãt, but I wish it last long, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Un precio excelente para una buena colonia, de uso diario, la cantidad en relaci√≥n al precio es inmejorable, la recomiendo.</li>
            <li> Your price was good for Halston and I received it without a problem.</li>
            <li> This product smells almost like Halston 1-12 used to smell when Halston was a big deal back in the 1970&#x27;s. It seems to have been cheapened a little bit, but the scent is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> Smells very good, but does remind me a little of a bar of soap, I prefer Z-14 to 1-12 but for the price I do not regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> excellent product,received in excellent conditions higly recommended if u want to give it to your dad or friend ,my dad loves this scent .Higly recommended</li>
            <li> I have had this Cologne since the &#x27;80s and it was great back then and is still great now!  My last bottle was over $40 when I purchased it back in 80 something and I looked at the bottom of the bottle it was 2 oz.  I don&#x27;t see how you can beat this value for such a great smelling Cologne.  This is a rather larger sized bottle, most premier men&#x27;s colognes that are this size go for around $50-$75.  I paid the same for this as I did for Polo or Obsession 3 decades ago.  Why the other ones are still expensive and this one is not?  I have no clue.    One last thing to add,  my older bottle was a splash bottle.  I find that is wasteful of the product as you can put too much on and you are wasting it on your hands or in my case your finger as I just dab on a dot.  Either way it is wasteful because 1/2 of what you just dispensed is washed into the sink when you wash your hands.    Z-14 is my favorite but 1-12 is a close second Halston scent.  If I had to pick just one I would pick Z-14 for sure.  At these prices I bought both and did not worry about it :)</li>
            <li> Made a perfect gift. WiIl be borrowing fragrance...</li>
            <li> The real deal. Old school coo.</li>
            <li> I really cant believe I got something this good for so cheap! it lasts for days. very manly smell. i&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> That is really terrible...Thats why it is so cheap. I think you shouldnt waste your money with this cologne..I m so regret that I bought it... There are a lot of colognes which are better than this cologne..</li>
            <li> it shiped the same day and i got it 2 days later. it smells great and i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care for the Z-12 as I prefer the Z-14.  I made the mistake of ordering the Z-12 instead of the Z-14.  The item was received within a few weeks, in good condition and it was as described.  Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> This cologne meets my expectations in every respect.  This is my alternate scent when I do not wear Halston&#x27;s Z-14.  I like them both very much.  Be mindful that different scents work differently on different people&#x27;s skin.  An individual&#x27;s chemistry can alter the overall scent perceived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using N wearing Halston for over 20 yrs. And i&#x27;ve got to say till this day its still has a Great Scent and the Price is still Reasonable. Not overly priced like Polo R Obsession for men.. Though i do still use these at times..( When i can aford to buy them ) So if your looking for Great Scent HALSTON for Men Is a Good choice for a Reasonable Price..</li>
            <li> Halston is always a good choice. very nice fragrance and it holds it scent quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Halston 1-12 has been one of my favorites for over 30 years... So glad they still sell it!</li>
            <li> Not the greatest smell but does last a while for a cheaper cologne.</li>
            <li> The scent is very good for the money but doesn&#x27;t come without cons. The longevity and projection is on the weak side, but i tend to forgive it for the price. It has a very laid back clean smell that&#x27;s very pleasing. Just don&#x27;t expect it to still be hanging around after 4-5 hours</li>
            <li> I was initially worried about ordering this based off reviews, but it was the best online purchase ever! It comes on strong for the first 30 seconds and then mellows out. A light citrus pine scent works on almost everyone! Such an amazing scent!</li>
            <li> Really manly, its not quite what i expected but i gets the job done, its a really good cologne for night and ladies love it hahahaha</li>
            <li> Has a unique scent which feels bitter like a neem tree but after a while  you get used to it and like it.    Haven&#x27;t noticed the response but it&#x27;s has a polarizing appeal which means either people are going to love it ir hate it. Nothing in between. I like it so who gives a s***.</li>
            <li> High priced cologne for a good price.  Lasts long and wife loves the smell.  Plus, plus</li>
            <li> This is awful, the reason it&#x27;s considered a classic is because it&#x27;s made for really old people. Pine needles and lemon best describes it, and I would suggest staying away from this &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; at all costs. Also having problems returning it via Amazon Prime, not sure why?</li>
            <li> this definitely is a must have cologne, very lovely</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected great price!</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t smell smashing or bad. It a once in a while frangences.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS FAKE YOU CAN SMELL THE CHEAP ALCOHOL ADDED INTO THE PRODUCT. I have been wearing halston for 25 years and this is definitely not the genuine cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a fan of Halston fragrance. They have a certain nice to smell property that makes you want to wear it everyday. I have ordered this before and will order again sometime.</li>
            <li> i always loved halston and the way it smells on different bodies.will buy this product many more times in future</li>
            <li> i am using this product for over 40 years.</li>
            <li> Halston 1-12 has been around for a while. That doesn&#x27;t make it old and out of style, it makes Halston 1-12 a classic and I hope it is forever available. My wife loves it on me.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner and was as expected. The only slight is that the spray tip doesnt seem to spray as well as the ones bought from the store. Then again, that was many years back.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to be able to purchase this Halston product. I&#x27;ve been a longtime user of Halston and my recent purchase has been very satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Brawner</li>
            <li> Very good fragrance and nice bottle design. You&#x27;ll appreciate the cologne for its approach in quality smell. Will recommend others who are fans of Halston.</li>
            <li> the person i gifted this to said this is one of the best fragrances he has eve smelled in his life!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it. And really loves the price I paid. Could not have asked for better.</li>
            <li> It smells like somthing my grandpa would wear so I ended up giving it to him.  He was rather pleased by it.  Youngsters please dont buy!!</li>
            <li> Both boys want to grown ups and want their own cologne so I decided I&#x27;d buy 2 of these with the price I new I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Smells good and well worth the purchase. Would do it all over again! A+++++</li>
            <li> The Last bottle I bought was 1980. Had to fight the ladies off with a stick. I&#x27;m now 78 years old, found my next bottle on Amazon last month, Women are not coming around ? I think the Halston&#x27;s has been watered down !!</li>
            <li> Perfect for a men&#x27;s gift. Very nice fragerance</li>
            <li> I do not know when it was that clothing companies, drug users, musicians, and all the rest of the world became fragrances.  Halston is an original and well established fragrance, and is what a man should smell like!</li>
            <li> First launched in 1976, there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s still around.... Green, crisp top notes of bergamot, basil, lemon &amp; mandarin rise through a lush envelope of pine, lavender, juniper and jasmine middle notes, all of which are flawlessly supported by the rich musky base notes of moss, cedar wood, musk &amp; amber. An exquisitely crafted masculine fragrance born in an era when fragrances were literally (and painstakingly) &#x27;designed&#x27; and continuously refined from concept to final production. An era when fragrances had true character and each was as distinctive and elegant as the great design house whose name it bore - So diametrically opposite to the &#x27;paint-by-numbers&#x27; fragrances of today (eau de banality) concocted by &#x27;marketing experts&#x27; who pick a stock base fragrance (lot X) and tweak it here and there with a few more stock scents, then slap a celebrity name on it and, voila! Scent du jour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an age when everything is fast &amp; furious, and loud &amp; tacky, and most fragrances are indistinguishable from each other, it&#x27;s refreshing to see a stand-alone champion like Halston 1-12 still available for the discerning palate, and still a uniquely rich, masterfully blended and perfectly balanced masterpiece of fragrance artistry and craftsmanship.... No matter what fads and fashion the changing times may bring, the classics always endure - And what better testament to that than Halston 1-12, a true classic that has endured for 36 years in the unforgiving and ever-changing world of designer fragrances.</li>
            <li> The scent is very good and lasts long. The scent transfers to your clothes and they smell fresh. i would recomed it to every man and it would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the value for the price is amazing.  will absolutely be buying this for my husband again!</li>
            <li> Well! This was not the best smelling Men Cologne as i expected, but it will do for now. Thanks you</li>
            <li> OK  This is not the scent i remember. It smells nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> 1-12 Halston&#x27;s scent is not a strong one that arrive in the room before you, but last a long time</li>
            <li> The drydown on me is like green soap. Its not bad but being 21, so obviously not my style. I bought it because I wanted to find out what people in the 70s wore, it was a good experiment, respect for this cologne.</li>
            <li> Was a Presend&lt;br /&gt;They Lied&lt;br /&gt;The Smell&lt;br /&gt;Nice to have&lt;br /&gt;The Friends received&lt;br /&gt;A Lot of compliment&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;On the smell</li>
            <li> It was very reasonably priced, therefore making it ideal for gift-giving...a close friend&#x27;s recommendation prompted me to buy this cologne</li>
            <li> A gift for my grandson for Christmas. He loved it! Went nicely with the leather grooming bag I gave him.</li>
            <li> love the smell and the compliments by all the women who smell me. The price also fit my budget greatly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent fragance but i feel i doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> It seems that its entirely different from genuine product. And its very very woody which is kind of irritating and won&#x27;t be buying it again..</li>
            <li> Like this a lot better than the Z scent of the same era.  Wife likes it and great deal, so happy happy!</li>
            <li> Purchased item for my son.  Nice strong manly scent and does not require that you put on a lot in order to smell good.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my fiance and he loves it and so do I</li>
            <li> For the price this can&#x27;t be beat! Halston has a great smell that&#x27;s not overbearing and stays with you during the day or evening. And this is the perfect amount to buy, 4.3 ounces. I think if more people realized how quickly perfumes start turning to alcohol and losing their original scent, they wouldn&#x27;t purchase such large amounts.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful. On some days when I have tried to go look at it again and smell it up close it hasn&#x27;t been as bad, but honestly I have never worn this. As cheap as it is, it&#x27;s still a waste of money because all of these must be old stock now and it smells really flowery and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my son and he refuses to wear it.  Sucks that it&#x27;s a non-returnable item.</li>
            <li> it smells awful.    It is just like this : [...] which we use back in my country to get rid of any strong smells from hand after working on oily or greasy things ... it is like 1$ for the bottle</li>
            <li> This scent works very well with me and blends well with my Right Guard deodorant. I get many compliments from women when I&#x27;m wearing it. It would be an excellent cologne at any price.</li>
            <li> its okay and the smell is mild</li>
            <li> i want to try something different than avon cologne which i love my avon</li>
            <li> That same warm, classically fresh, manly scent from the 80s that I have come to love.</li>
            <li> the halston, z-12, is as good as the more expensive z-14 in my opinion.  i enjoy the scent of both.  i don&#x27;t have a favorite because both have a good scent.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t like it at all. He said that it smells too strong for him. Oh well I tried so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but wouldn&#x27;t order it again and good and fast delevery!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller.</li>
            <li> Its okay-not my favorite.</li>
            <li> My partner loves this and so do I! A nice, clean, softly bold scent that is very appealing! Great gift for Secret Santa Grab Bag!</li>
            <li> I had never tried Halston before. I was pleasantly surprised. It has a woodsy, musky scent that is a little strong, but not overbearing. Great product for the price. I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> better deal than in a regular store. i personally like it the fragance clean smell &amp; good presentation. satisfied with product</li>
            <li> Muy buena colonia, llevo tiempo us√°ndola. Buen precio. Lleg√≥ en el tiempo estimado. Vendedor responsable y muy atento. Muchas gracias.</li>
            <li> No, the title I gave doesn&#x27;t sound very positive, but it truly is meant to if you like either of those scents. And trust me, many of us DO enjoy the smell of rich shaving cream and vanilla. 1-12 was introduced to me thanks to online reviews by folks who like lighter 80&#x27;s powerhouse scents. I owned Z-14 before, and liked it, but never knew 1-12 existed until doing some research. I blind-bought it off Amazon for about 12 dollars, an absolute STEAL considering the size and quality of this cologne. 1-12 starts off potent and very musky and sweet. Limiting one&#x27;s spritzes of this (like other 80&#x27;s scents) is adviseable. But immediately you can detect that the ingredients are varied and deep. There&#x27;s nothing cheap about this fragrance. I believe it&#x27;s a modern day hidden gem that has so little following/knowledge of it, that the price is equally low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after about 30 minutes it begins to morph into a woodsy, powdery scent, perfect for fall or winter evenings. The sweetness has faded away after an hour, and 1-12 has hunkered down into a long-standing thick, richly lathered shaving cream mixed with light vanilla extract. I feel like I just walked out of a barber shop and really cleaned myself up! This cologne has true longevity and projection, lasting 8+ hours on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a cheap smell to it; on the contrary, it exudes warmth and class. I&#x27;d say that may be the best way to describe it: a warm, complex cologne that takes you to a comfortable armchair by a fire with your gal in the 1940&#x27;s. Guys 25 and over would most appreciate 1-12, as it doesn&#x27;t have an aquatic flavor to it like so many modern scents do. Manly, suave, lofty and distinguished are the adjectives for this cologne and the gentleman wearing it. So I&#x27;d say based on the sheer price of it, it&#x27;s worth the try. But if you enjoy confident scents (esp. 80&#x27;s colognes), this one certainly won&#x27;t disappoint!!</li>
            <li> Agradable como las demas fragancias de Halston</li>
            <li> Very nice, tank you üëçüëå</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of Cologne for over 20 years and It never get old, I love the smell ,&lt;br /&gt; I wont leave the house without a couple of sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son and grandson has started using this cologne as well, we all love it&lt;br /&gt;you can not go wrong with this product</li>
            <li> great price and smells great</li>
            <li> will probably buy it again</li>
            <li> Found this cologne perfect for an older man,  not suitable for a younger person. Smells ok but not a fragrance that would wow me.</li>
            <li> My son really liked this fragrance.  Gave to him for Christmas.</li>
            <li> great lasts long time</li>
            <li> Quality fragrance as expected from Halston.  Compared to the more wood and cinnamon forward Z-14 by Halston the 1-12 is more floral and mellow while still maintaining those silky musk undertones.  Very sexy and very subtle.  Definately an all day wear.</li>
            <li> iit&#x27;s the scent that makes me use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I am a late 20&#x27;s male and was a bit unsure if this cologne would suit. It has a vintage fragrance which is very smooth, not fruity and doesn&#x27;t fade soon. Highly recommend it if you are not into those typical fruity, minty colognes.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and lasts a few hours anyway.</li>
            <li> When you first spray this cologne is has an old person cologne smell to it but as it settles it smells better  the cologne does not last all day it lasts a while though mayby 3 or 4 hours ,, its not very strong on a level of 1- 10 in strength I would say 4.5 my scale would. Refer to 6.5/7 being the ideal strength so in that sense it would depend on your preference</li>
            <li> I would not order this again. The smell is not desirable. I expected Halston to smell very handsome. Sorry, but this is not for my guy. If I could I would return it, but the product cannot be returned per the enclosure.</li>
            <li> Stinks I am sorry smells like soap...</li>
            <li> I bought it as a present for a friend but I decided don‚Äôt give to him since it has weird odor. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. That the usual consequence when you buy cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> 1-12 has always been my favorite cologne; I was pleased to see that 1-12 was still available for purchase.  I still have a smidgen of 1-12 left from a bottle that I purchased when I was in college (1981).  I&#x27;m sorry to say that the new 1-12 I just purchased doesn&#x27;t smell very much like the old 1-12, which is a very big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a cologne connoisseur and lack the requisite vocabulary to effectively describe the difference, but I always found the original 1-12 to be sharply clean but woodsy/musky.  The new 1-12 I received smells very heavily &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;, for lack of a better term.  Kind of like I took a shower with Irish Spring or some other redolent anti-prespirant soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it for a while and see what I think.  It may grow on me.  But I can clearly state that it doesn&#x27;t resemble the old 1-12 very much, if at all.  I would never have purchased the new 1-12 had I smelled it first.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!!  My husband loves it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Found this over while visiting our son in the UK and had to get it for him for Christmas... so glad I did :)</li>
            <li> When I received this cologne I was shocked that the bottle had no labeling on it at all.  I thought it must be a knock off trying to pass for Halston.  I used to wear this cologne sometimes when I was younger and going out to the clubs, and I don&#x27;t remember it being an unlabeled bottle.  However, I recognized the scent when I put it on, plus all the photos of it on Amazon that show the bottle have no labeling on them either.  Personally I feel that it suits a more mature gentleman and, looking back I remember the store clerk at Macy&#x27;s saying that the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li> 8 dollars what more can I say. This is a great splash on and a cheap one to boot.......So I bought it.</li>
            <li> I realy like the Halston for Men Cologne Spray and this is a great value and reminds me of the years of using colognes.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has trouble finding this product so I purchased it as a Christmas gift. It arrived as promisede within a few days of ordering!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known and used Halston 1-12 for more than 2 decades now. I like it especially for night time event. It&#x27;s inexpensive but exceptional in quality.</li>
            <li> The scent is great! But it seems like a cologne more for old people. So I can&#x27;t wear it. But I&#x27;m still going to I&#x27;ve it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a fantastic smell for older individuals.</li>
            <li> Nice inexpensive subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Smell Great an last long</li>
            <li> Wanted something he could use that he would never buy, cologne, it smells soooooooo good on a man, I hope he likes it.</li>
            <li> Smell like a boss! subtle, delicious awesome smell, not to strong, not to crazy, I like it quite a lot.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find in stores anymore  (folks don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing!). My husband wore Halston when I first met him, but it was not the spray kind. This is very close, but wears off quicker.  Overall it&#x27;s fine because it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> I love the price and the value of this perfume. It&#x27;s not too loud like the other perfumes. The best part is, I didn&#x27;t have to drive anywhere to pick it up.</li>
            <li> lleg√≥ en perfecto estado y rapidisimo!! se recomienda el producto me encanta! excelente proveedor muy buena compra! mejor imposible. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was for a gift. My friend was happy with the product and really enjoys it a lot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like Halston smell because  Halston is older peoples product so whoever is 18- 45 don&#x27;t buy this product .....</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and always get compliments on it. Just dont be &#x27;that guy&#x27; who poors the whole bottle on. Two sprays and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> Straight Up some old man cologne.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 stars is strictly how I feel it was for me. It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad. It is just very musky. Something you expect men ages 50 and up to wear. Overall a decent product. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this cologne and found it to be nothing more than bathroom spray in a small bottle, and a weak one at that. If I wanted to smell like the flower girl, this is what I would use. I have used free hotel cologne that smelled better than this, and they are horrendous. The search for a true men&#x27;s cologne continues.</li>
            <li> One of my old time favorite cologne. You will love it. I recommend it highly AAA+++</li>
            <li> excelente producto 100% recomendado</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Good quality. And for people who need it, I recommend it 100%. In addition, this a good price.</li>
            <li> I do not have the recommendations, this pack is according for the article! the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li> Really good, I loved it. Really good price.</li>
            <li> older fregrant but nice</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this fragrance since the mid 70&#x27;s still smells fresh to me and I am often asked ,usually by men, what that fragrance is. I will continue to buy this til the day I die, and throw one in the casket too! This is not a overbearing or piney scent Forget the $60.00 bottle stuff and try this I believe you will be very happy to ad this to your Manly Scents.</li>
            <li> just men cologne smell I wanted</li>
            <li> I guess this cologne smells pretty good,if I could get it out of the bottle! It arrived in a reasonable amount of time,but would not spray,I have to pull the spray top off and shake some in my hand to rub any on.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite cologne for a long, long time.  When i first started using it, it was way more expensive. I get many compliments, from younger women, I might add.....Cant beat the price for a high end cologne.</li>
            <li> am a guy who loves to try new thing&lt;br /&gt;I like it though , but I went back to my old perfume ( CK )</li>
            <li> i love it. it is wonderfull. it is my favorite. i use it every day. it is excelllent. i recommend it</li>
            <li> Nice strong smell to it</li>
            <li> A nice classy smell. I can definitely see how this could been seen as a cologne for an older man, however I am only 20 and get plenty of compliments from people of all ages.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some 20 years - yes a bit older than most, but this is great stuff and a good price through Amazon. It fits my needs - older Americans will be please with this. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> love it..love it..love it..love it..love it..love it..my husbands like this cologne. It is a classic and decided to get it.</li>
            <li> When this is first sprayed, it had an aroma I do not like at all. Once the topnotes fade, this is a nice scent.</li>
            <li> great aroma  very manly</li>
            <li> This is good purchase for the price.  It is a little to strong for me.  I like a lighter smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Might have sat around in a hot warehouse for too long.  Normally, I like this item and have purchased it many times in the past.  This time, it didn&#x27;t smell quite right....</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cologne but it fades very quickly from the time you put it on...I don&#x27;t think it lasts much more than hour.  Also, the sprayer didn&#x27;t work great so by the time I got an appreciable amount out of the bottle my finger would cramp up!  Just kidding of course but seriously, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again and I&#x27;m not even using it, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.  Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance extremely low price</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT FRAGRANCE!!!</li>
            <li> My son loved his Christmas present!!</li>
            <li> Right price and good perfume</li>
            <li> It has a soapy almost flowery scent. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who uses newer cologne.It is a pretty dated smell in my opinion but  I am also a pretty picky cologne person and usually I can get compliments on my cologne use but I know fora fact most people I know don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> smells great ladies love the way it smells plenty of compliments everybody takes smell twice.</li>
            <li> I wore this fragrance back in high lschool over 25 years ago. It still smells as good as I remember. It is a woody/spicy scent that is masculine but not overpowering. I have received a ton of compliments from the ladies I work with and am convinced it helped me lock down the beauty I&#x27;m dating now. &amp;#34;You always smell so good&amp;#34; she tells me.  The scent lasts a long time and is obvious on my work clothes when I take them off and even into the next day (I only apply it on my skin in small amounts on my wrists and neck) so the juice itself is good quality. The price is ridiculously low. I&#x27;d pay twice the amount being charged for this elegant fragrance. Plus it really stands apart from all the over-priced metrosexual colognes being marketed these days. Highly recommended. I&#x27;ll be getting Halston Z-14 soon. I&#x27;m having fun rediscovering classic colognes from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s, a time when men smell like real men, and not eyebrow plucking metrosexual. 1-12 is definitely a classic.</li>
            <li> I love Halston 1-12 and glad it is still around.</li>
            <li> to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations</li>
            <li> for halston the 12 is a slightly diffrent but still halston ata great price for men, highly recommend this to others</li>
            <li> Buenos dias, el dia de hoy me tome la molestia para calificar esta compra, la cual cumplio con los parametros que esperabamos. Quedamos conforme con la compra, gracias.</li>
            <li> Nice prices on colognes . Was exactly what I was looking for at a price I couldn&#x27;t beat.  Will look at them for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell that is affordable!</li>
            <li> I ordered one from Amazon three weeks ago and used it. It smells just for one hour. Never bye another one!</li>
            <li> And my grandfather was a damn classy gentleman.&lt;br /&gt;Thats why I bought this Halston. Its what he wore, and it brings back memories of him.</li>
            <li> ....by far the worst smell I have ever smelled in my life</li>
            <li> This parfum exceeded my expectations the scent was lasting a whole day on my clothes and the women they love the smell.</li>
            <li> Good named product at a reasonable price.  Would recommend.</li>
    </ol>
