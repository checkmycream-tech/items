            <li>Great Price.</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a perfect every day perfume; inviting but not overt, sensual without being obviously sexy.</li>
            <li>this will smell so nice!</li>
            <li>:) Best part it arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>You could wear this anywhere &amp; feel good about it.</li>
            <li>loved it.</li>
            <li>nice pleasant smell and good value for the price</li>
            <li>nice smell but made me break out.</li>
            <li>I was super happy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great compliment to other perfumes &amp; layers beautifully with musks &amp; florals.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this spray.</li>
            <li>Nice and light .Love</li>
            <li>Warm vanilla scent, not sick sweet like most.</li>
            <li>I love this light fragrance body mist after my bath.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty amazing for a body mist.</li>
            <li>A sweet, yet suddle smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it if I had known I was receiving the new version.</li>
            <li>The vanilla is good and lasts over time than most currently on the market, fully recommended, buy the body shop next time</li>

            <li>Just be aware that it does not have staying power.  </li>
            <li>Love it, but it does not last.</li>
            <li>I like it with Flower Bomb in particular.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely order more in the future</li>
            <li>Even though the packaging is diffident I love the scent.</li>
            <li>It has a Subtle, warm vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>This has everything you might want in a Vanilla Body Spray: the scent is warm, soft &amp; inviting, it lasts for hours &amp; a just a few sprays go a long way.</li>
            <li>very happy with product just a bit expensive for such a small bottle</li>

            <li> smells yummy and lasts long.</li>
            <li> It lasts long, about 6 hours before I need to spritz it on again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately what I received was 3 bottles of the new formula, which I don&#x27;t care for nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> Due to the photo, I ordered 3 bottles of the Vanilla Body Mist.  </li>
            <li> You would have to reapply a few times throughout the day to have the scent say with you.</li>

            <li> smells yummy and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Even though the packaging is diffident I love the scent. I was worried the scent formulation changed...if it did I haven&#x27;t noticed. I&#x27;ll definitely order more in the future</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I have ordered!!!! I received a different product and I don&#x27;t like it. It was totally different.</li>
            <li> nice smell but made me break out.</li>
            <li> Love this. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent. It lasts long, about 6 hours before I need to spritz it on again. That&#x27;s pretty amazing for a body mist. My boyfriend says it smells so yummy.</li>
            <li> loved it. nice pleasant smell and good value for the price&lt;br /&gt;would purchase again in the future if comparable price</li>
            <li> I like a lot of the Body Shop products but didn&#x27;t see this in my local store so when I found it on Amazon I was super happy.  I love this light fragrance body mist after my bath.  Now that spring is around the corner this will smell so nice!</li>
            <li> It smells great. Not too strong.  :) Best part it arrived on time.  :)</li>
            <li> Does not at all smell like vanilla</li>
            <li> Warm vanilla scent, not sick sweet like most. Love it, but it does not last.</li>
            <li> very happy with product just a bit expensive for such a small bottle</li>

            <li> This mist smells so good! Like vanilla icecream you can&#x27;t get enough of! A sweet, yet suddle smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering either.</li>
            <li> It has a Subtle, warm vanilla scent. Just what I wanted! I would purchase again. My husband loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Love this spray.Nice and light .Love the vanilla scent.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
