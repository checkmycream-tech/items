            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the scent as well.  </li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this :)</li>
            <li>Nothing magical here</li>
            <li>/&gt;So to anyone who wants a healthy shampoo that leaves you looking great</li>
            <li>pretty good for sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li>The original formula was a true sulfate-free formula and my hair loved it.  </li>
            <li>THIS ONE MAKE EVERYTHING AND LEAVE MY HAIR SO SOFT, WITHOUT FREEZE, IM SO HAPPY AND RECOMENDED EVERYBODY.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great detangler for both relaxed and natural hair.</li>
            <li>Works really well, as good as the loreal brand</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it because it is sulfate-free, but am in love with how it makes my hair feel and look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to find at walmart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to untangle too.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t quite live up to it&#x27;s shine promise, but good shampoo without sulfates</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended to me because I have relaxed and dyed hair, and I needed something that was sulfate free.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself is nice and because there is no sulfate or anything, you really don&#x27;t need a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I found this shampoo in winn dixie for 3.50 a bottle took a chance and wow am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>Those in the sulfate-free community agree that this chemical is a true sulfate and can be as drying as Sodium Laureth Sulfate.  </li>
            <li>its not a bad smell but its just not something you would expect shampoo to smell like?&lt;br</li>
            <li>i guess it just doesnt like my body chemistry because it seems to work great for other people</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stink, it just has a really mild &amp;#34;generic unscented lotion&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>It produced a nice lather and moisturized my hair better than any other shampoo that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>my favorite all time shampoos, as well as straight from eden line shampoo, both sulfate free, very detangling and mositurizing , creme of nature has done it right with both of these products</li>
            <li>Lathers really well, smells nice, leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I use it every time I was my hair, even after a clarifying shampoo, just to make it soft and more manageable for styling.</li>
            <li>Also pairs nicely with a palmers coconut deep conditioning packet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>not crazy about the scent...</li>
            <li>It actually smells pretty good, and contrary to what others say, it lathers very well even without the sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I immediately got rid of this shampoo and bought a replacement that is truly sulfate free, after using my new shampoo once,</li>
            <li>my hair feels soft and is easy to comb.  </li>
            <li>it do exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>It does leave a shine on her hair even after hair drying and hot rolling.</li>
            <li>I FINALLY FIND IT HERE, AND IM SO GLAD.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice, a slightly &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; type smell, but it is very pleasing and clean.</li>
            <li>First off, I would like to rave about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I take great care of my hair, and with one shampooing from this my hair became a dry, frizzled, damaged mess when before it was shiny, slick, and incredibly moisturized.</li>
            <li>but thankfully this shampoo is an easy find at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li>, no matter the gender, I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li>; which did smell good, but I had heard that the sulfates put into shampoos like this commonly strip the hair of moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong, I can smell it all day long.  </li>
            <li>But it does clean the hair and the plus is that it lathers up like a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair dry and smooth, and eliminates frizz on humid days.</li>
            <li>the argan oil feels comfortable and doesn&#x27;t leave hair too dry.</li>
            <li>One of the pluses is that it&#x27;s sulfate free meaning your hair won&#x27;t feel dry after using it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and even though it gives it the shine, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like most other shine shampoos do.  </li>
            <li>in addition to a barber visit and some vitamin e and jajoba oiling, my hair has returned to normal.</li>
            <li>However, I ordered this shampoo as a higher quantity replacement of their smaller bottle (which unknown to me at the time, this shampoo had significantly changed formula&#x27;s) and the first time I used it, my hair was so damaged from this shampoo that it took over 3 days for my hair to start to regain its former appearance.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that Creme of Nature has recently changed the ingredients of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am on my 3rd bottle and just ordered 2 more, and have not used any other shampoo since trying this.  </li>
            <li>I used this the first time and almost instantly noticed the shine it provides.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft even before adding conditioner.</li>
            <li>After I started using this, my hair is now sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>It smells like loud medicine.</li>
            <li>my Aussie Three Minute has my hair almost back to  normal.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because I wanted something other than the shampoo that&#x27;s labeled &amp;#34;Color Safe&amp;#34;, even when the ingredients are almost exactly the same as normal shampp.</li>
            <li>I used to wash my hair daily with regular department store brands but with how constantly it made me have to dye my hair back to my standard red, I started searching for a hydrating, sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well this shampoo will work because I&#x27;ve used it only once; the fragrance is so overpowering and masculine that I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo I have found to leave my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>This shampoo was much thicker and richer than I expected.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and silky and manageable I like this product and will definitely buy every now and then</li>
            <li>I recently went natural and my hair needs a lot of moisture and this definitely does it.</li>
            <li>and really it does not weigh your hair down.</li>

            <li> I recently went natural and my hair needs a lot of moisture and this definitely does it.</li>
            <li> and really it does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> After rinsing for 2 minutes, my hair was still really flat and greasy-ish.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this sulfate free shampoo...</li>
            <li> She has long hair and swears by this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to know what the right product to use is when you&#x27;re a guy who dyes his hair, and I dye mine black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understand some things may be a bit higher, but double the price is ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair is dry and damaged from perms and coloring.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it does not have sulfates, which dry the hair out.</li>
            <li> This product is significantly different than their previous shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I 1st went natural I had a hard time finding staple products.</li>
            <li> The last hair dye I used dried my hair out and this with</li>
            <li> I only use a tinnny bit because it is heavy on my hair</li>
            <li> because I used this new formula not knowing that it had changed, (the new smell tipped me off that something wasn&#x27;t quite right), and the results were terrible.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine buying any other shampoo after this.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other shampoos, it leaves my hair feeling moisturized and doesn&#x27;t strip it off oils.</li>
            <li> I started my natural hair journey and needed a reliable shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t put my hard work go to waste.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh it down nor does it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> and you get a lot less of per bottle</li>
            <li> very thick &amp; long colored hair &amp; a little of this shampoo goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS PRODUCT FOR LONG TIME IN STORES AND WAS SO HARD TO FIND.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
            <li> i bought a few months ago</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves a heavy film on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Conditioning after helps remove some of the heavy coating.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard and crunchy like other shampoos do.</li>
            <li> so I will not go in to some long azz unnecessary review</li>
            <li> Not sure why the company made this change.  </li>
            <li> If you can wake up and not wash your hair, and it is still fluffy or thick curls or whatever, or a guy with short-cropped hair, then this will do you fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy.</li>
            <li> My scalp felt acutely dry and uncomfortable and my hair felt very strange and was difficult to style.  </li>
            <li> have wavy hair that is moderately thick</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t co wash this is a solid shampoo that doesnt seem to strip your hair to badly.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this is the smell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not for people who have thin or oily hair.</li>

            <li> Please be aware that Creme of Nature has recently changed the ingredients of this shampoo.  The formula listed above is drastically different than what is used now.  The change now includes Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate listed as the second ingredient.  Those in the sulfate-free community agree that this chemical is a true sulfate and can be as drying as Sodium Laureth Sulfate.  I can attest to that, because I used this new formula not knowing that it had changed, (the new smell tipped me off that something wasn&#x27;t quite right), and the results were terrible.  My scalp felt acutely dry and uncomfortable and my hair felt very strange and was difficult to style.  The original formula was a true sulfate-free formula and my hair loved it.  Not sure why the company made this change.  One can only assume it has something to with cost-cutting as with everything else these days.  I am very disappointed and will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair great body and texture. Even seems to make my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> This did not work well. It&#x27;s a basic conditioner and has drying agents like alcohol. I want to return it. But it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Best product ever....hair is so soft even still wet in shower.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this sulfate free shampoo... it do exactly as advertised so I will not go in to some long azz unnecessary review</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this shampoo will work because I&#x27;ve used it only once; the fragrance is so overpowering and masculine that I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> My hair felt healthy and silkky shiny after one use!  I have baby fine hair and a lot of it.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh it down nor does it feel greasy.  I will definitey purchase again/</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair is dry and damaged from perms and coloring. So far, so good. It smells great. My hair is soft even before adding conditioner. My hair is not tangled. I like this product because it does not have sulfates, which dry the hair out. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> My son who is 18 wanted no sulphites, so here it is. He loves it and the price rocks for the size of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff and really it does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> OMG! I do not know why I have not tried this before. This was recommended to me because I have relaxed and dyed hair, and I needed something that was sulfate free. I love it! The last hair dye I used dried my hair out and this with my Aussie Three Minute has my hair almost back to  normal.</li>
            <li> Buy this all the time..</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t like the fragrance.  It&#x27;s too strong, I can smell it all day long.  It&#x27;s difficult to rinse out.</li>
            <li> This product is significantly different than their previous shampoo. Their old shampoo formula was one of the best I had ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair that is moderately thick so what I experienced with my hair could not happen for all types. However, I ordered this shampoo as a higher quantity replacement of their smaller bottle (which unknown to me at the time, this shampoo had significantly changed formula&#x27;s) and the first time I used it, my hair was so damaged from this shampoo that it took over 3 days for my hair to start to regain its former appearance. I take great care of my hair, and with one shampooing from this my hair became a dry, frizzled, damaged mess when before it was shiny, slick, and incredibly moisturized. I immediately got rid of this shampoo and bought a replacement that is truly sulfate free, after using my new shampoo once, in addition to a barber visit and some vitamin e and jajoba oiling, my hair has returned to normal. I am beyond displeased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have very fine hair but LOTS of it. I used to wash my hair daily with regular department store brands but with how constantly it made me have to dye my hair back to my standard red, I started searching for a hydrating, sulfate free shampoo. And I found it (: I only use a tinnny bit because it is heavy on my hair but it makes my hair shiny and it smells wonderful! I plan on making this my shampoo from now on.</li>
            <li> My daughter has me order this item monthly. She has long hair and swears by this item. It does leave a shine on her hair even after hair drying and hot rolling. She uses the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not for people who have thin or oily hair. It&#x27;s very heavy. After rinsing for 2 minutes, my hair was still really flat and greasy-ish. I had to give it away. If you can wake up and not wash your hair, and it is still fluffy or thick curls or whatever, or a guy with short-cropped hair, then this will do you fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because I use their conditioner, and it is great. It leaves my hair dry and smooth, and eliminates frizz on humid days.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is glorious! Super moisturizing, sulfate-free, smells good, great price. I have very thick &amp; long colored hair &amp; a little of this shampoo goes a long way. Will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t quite live up to it&#x27;s shine promise, but good shampoo without sulfates</li>
            <li> This is really good shampoo.  Lathers really well, smells nice, leaves hair soft.  It reminds me of a salon.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I have found to leave my hair extremely soft. It is not a clarifying shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t lather a lot (remember sulfate is one of the things that causes lots of bubbles to form), but I prefer to use a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of all its oils and then have to find conditioners to replenish those oils. I have actually gone several times without using a conditioner and sometimes a deep conditioner while cause my hair to have quite a bit of residue. Periodically, I will wash with a clarifying shampoo, especially if I plan to deep condition. A friend recommended the product to me and I am soooo happy I tried it. I use it every time I was my hair, even after a clarifying shampoo, just to make it soft and more manageable for styling.</li>
            <li> I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS PRODUCT FOR LONG TIME IN STORES AND WAS SO HARD TO FIND. I FINALLY FIND IT HERE, AND IM SO GLAD. THIS PRODUCT ITS AMAZING. IM A COSMETOLOGYST AND TRY ALL KIND OF SHAMPOO. BUT THIS ONE IS INCREDIBLE, YOU DON&#x27;T EVEN NEED THE CONDITIONER CUZ THIS ONE MAKE EVERYTHING AND LEAVE MY HAIR SO SOFT, WITHOUT FREEZE, IM SO HAPPY AND RECOMENDED EVERYBODY.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine buying any other shampoo after this.  I am on my 3rd bottle and just ordered 2 more, and have not used any other shampoo since trying this.  I originally purchased it because it is sulfate-free, but am in love with how it makes my hair feel and look.  I have fine hair, and even though it gives it the shine, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like most other shine shampoos do.  I love the scent as well.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this :)</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo in winn dixie for 3.50 a bottle took a chance and wow am I glad I did! This shampoo does not tangle or shrink my hair, suds up really nicely and smells great after you rinse. Also pairs nicely with a palmers coconut deep conditioning packet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I am sad to see the price so hiked up here on amazon but thankfully this shampoo is an easy find at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> pretty good for sulfate-free shampoo. the argan oil feels comfortable and doesn&#x27;t leave hair too dry.</li>
            <li> After I started using this, my hair is now sooooo soft. Smells really nice, a slightly &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; type smell, but it is very pleasing and clean.</li>
            <li> NO SULFATE and smells great!!! I started my natural hair journey and needed a reliable shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t put my hard work go to waste. My hair feels great with this product. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Works really well, as good as the loreal brand i bought a few months ago and you get a lot less of per bottle&lt;br /&gt;im not crazy about the scent...its not a bad smell but its just not something you would expect shampoo to smell like?&lt;br /&gt;if your someone who sniffs the bottle before you buy it, this shampoo is not for you</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because I like the name brand and they make great products.  However; this shampoo can be purchased at Sally for 1/2 the price which tells me I was ripped off by this seller.  I understand some things may be a bit higher, but double the price is ridiculous!  The shampoo itself is nice and because there is no sulfate or anything, you really don&#x27;t need a conditioner.  My hair is almost tangle-free so I will definitely purchase this again, just not on Amazon.</li>
            <li> gave me really bad dandruff- i guess it just doesnt like my body chemistry because it seems to work great for other people</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and this shampoo has worked great for my hair.  I tend to have a problem with dryness, so this shampoo has helped a lot with restoring moisture to my hair.  After washing. my hair feels soft and is easy to comb.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nothing magical here but if you don&#x27;t co wash this is a solid shampoo that doesnt seem to strip your hair to badly. It&#x27;s easy to find at walmart.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was much thicker and richer than I expected. It produced a nice lather and moisturized my hair better than any other shampoo that I&#x27;ve used. (NO conditioner needed!!) If it smelled good, I would have given it 5 stars. It doesn&#x27;t stink, it just has a really mild &amp;#34;generic unscented lotion&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> First off, I would like to rave about this shampoo. Unlike other shampoos, it leaves my hair feeling moisturized and doesn&#x27;t strip it off oils. One of the pluses is that it&#x27;s sulfate free meaning your hair won&#x27;t feel dry after using it. I recently went natural and my hair needs a lot of moisture and this definitely does it. I would definitely buy again and from this seller. Product was delivered in a timely manner and you get your bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> When I 1st went natural I had a hard time finding staple products. But this shampoo is the best and it&#x27;s a great detangler for both relaxed and natural hair. The only bad thing about this is the smell. It smells like loud medicine. But it does clean the hair and the plus is that it lathers up like a regular shampoo. Besides the smell I would compare it to shea moisture coconut and hibiscus curl and shine shampoo.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and silky and manageable I like this product and will definitely buy every now and then</li>
            <li> I have a keratin treatment in my hair and this is ideal for my washes. It smells wonderful and lasts for days. It&#x27;s easy to untangle too.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.  This shampoo leaves a heavy film on my hair.  Conditioning after helps remove some of the heavy coating.</li>
            <li> This is one my favorite all time shampoos, as well as straight from eden line shampoo, both sulfate free, very detangling and mositurizing , creme of nature has done it right with both of these products</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I wanted something other than the shampoo that&#x27;s labeled &amp;#34;Color Safe&amp;#34;, even when the ingredients are almost exactly the same as normal shampp. It&#x27;s tough to know what the right product to use is when you&#x27;re a guy who dyes his hair, and I dye mine black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Clairol Herbal Essences &amp;#34;Color Me Happy&amp;#34; which did smell good, but I had heard that the sulfates put into shampoos like this commonly strip the hair of moisture. So I looked here for alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some people who negate the damage of sulfates, but why risk it? I used this the first time and almost instantly noticed the shine it provides. It actually smells pretty good, and contrary to what others say, it lathers very well even without the sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium length for a guy, and my hair has tangled/been damaged. The Argan seems to be a great remedy to this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to anyone who wants a healthy shampoo that leaves you looking great, no matter the gender, I highly recommend this shampoo! Hey, what can I say? I think it&#x27;s no crime to look your best and feel awesome. This stuff does the job!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard and crunchy like other shampoos do.</li>
