    <ol>
            <li> I love all Crack Hair products.  I&#x27;m African American with very curly but soft and thick hair.  I can comb through my hair with ease after using the Crack shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner.  If you want to save money you can just get the leave in.  It works great!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great, a small amount goes a long way. Has really helped tame down my wild hair</li>
            <li> I would honestly be lost with out this Conditioner! I leave it on for about 2-3 mins then rinse. My hair is as soft as can be shiny and just all out amazing. It hasn&#x27;t removed my hair color and it doesnt leave a gross feeling in my hair. My hair dries so much faster and I have naturally curly hair with this combined with the Shampoo I am able to blow dry my hair straight and typically only need to use the flat iron in a few spots vs all over. Since I have started using this my hair has changed so much for the better. I am so thankful I came across this product. You should deff try it out! Trust me you wont regret it!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! It is amazing.  My hair never looked so healthy!</li>

            <li> I think thick curly hair. This stuff is amazing. My hair has never felt better whether I wear it curly or straight. I also use the shampo and the leave in conditioner/cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.  A little costly, but worth the price. I personally think the conditioner is better than the shampoo but works great together.</li>
            <li> this is a great product to use with the Crack ~Clean and Soaper. Because the Shampoo is so rich, I would not use the conditioner every day. I only use this at the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> My stylist tried it on me before a cut- I noticed a difference right away. Less drying time, little need to flat-iron any pieces. Just glossy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works well.... little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what I normally purchase in a local Beauty Store at a much lower price</li>

            <li> I used this immediately after washing with the Crack Clean and Soaper Shampoo and oh boy was it great. Left my hair soft and almost tangle free.I was impressed because I went into it with kinda low expectations. I did do a henna treatment the same day and usually when I do a henna treatment, it&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that can correct the dryness as henna sometimes causes dryness in some people&#x27;s hair. This stuff was amazing. Even after towel drying I was like WOW! I followed up with crack hair cream which I&#x27;ve been using for over a year and all I can say is I&#x27;m addicted. Already looking forward to my next fix if you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: African American relaxer free. A mixture of 4a/4b coils.</li>
            <li> I bought another conditioner at ULTA , and they sent me a sample of this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;my hair is already damaged but i tried this and right away as i let it air dry and next morning&lt;br /&gt;i woke up and saw NICE SHINY HAIR! my hair has not shine in a while.&lt;br /&gt;i am def buying this from amazon ! sometimes you need to try to see what works for your hair this worked wonders&lt;br /&gt;LOVED IT!!!  I CANT WAIT TO USE IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> prompt deliver, great product.</li>
            <li> This was a good choice for my curly hair.  My hair is softer using Crack in Treatment.  It arrived quickly.  Very satisfied &amp; would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it makes my hair very soft and less frizzy. Have recommended to my girlfriends cant go wrong here. i also purchased the shampoo will be buying more and they smell good too</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product, and best of all it is way cheaper than her normal hair salon.</li>
            <li> Abosultely love this shampoo!  My salon uses it, which is why I decided to try it.  I love the scent.  Leaves my soft and shiny.</li>
