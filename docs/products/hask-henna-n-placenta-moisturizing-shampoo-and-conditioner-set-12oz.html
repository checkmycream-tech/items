            <li>I have used other bask products and thought this would be awesome</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my doctor and out of ALL of the &amp;#34;on the shelf&amp;#34; hair products for itchy/flakey scalp, this is the ONLY one that gives me releif and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I like it, but I did more research online about it and found out that it contain a certain amount of hormons that can cause breast cancer..</li>
            <li>It feels fuller &amp; I would highly recommend to anyone with naturally curly hair !!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and healthy now.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>Please be aware that it CAN and WILL turn your hair brassy &amp; orange.</li>
            <li>It feels healthier and I&#x27;ve noticed not so much hair in my brush or my drain!  </li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d say it, but I finally found a product BETTER than WEN.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal WEN purchaser for years, but couldn&#x27;t keep affording that high cost.  </li>
            <li>I regret ever buying this product and am very upset about my hair.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Fantastic,everything I remember!!!!!I will buy it again,thanks so much for truth in advertising.</li>
            <li>My daughters&#x27; long fine blonde hair takes a beating in the FL sun and pools, but this stuff had their hair looking shiny and smooth within just a couple showers.  </li>
            <li>but my wife says that my hair smells like sugar, which is a heck of a lot better then every other product I have used for this issue.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, brittle, and dry.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll stick to the hask shampoo with olive oil, which is a much better product and less costly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Does not leave the hair as smooth as expected.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, they don&#x27;t seem to leave residue or cause dandruff like other shampoos do for me, which is good.</li>
            <li>Pretty gross you are using aborted fetuses placenta</li>
            <li>Soso - neither henna nor placenta do anything different from any other shampoo - it smells ok and hair feels alright</li>
            <li>Ok at ive used this product twice in 4 weeks and noticed my hair was dry and rough.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>My hair stopped breaking and feels soft..</li>
            <li>I am a 45 year old white woman, VERY naturally curly highlighted hair, &amp; it is very brittle &amp; close to the texture of an African American woman, very coarse texture.</li>

            <li> No tangles in the shower, very mild scent (I HATE hard scents that linger all day, this does NOT thank goodness) &amp; it makes my hair very soft &amp; easy to style.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair as well.</li>
            <li> Recently, my hair has been very dry, delicate in falling out, &amp; TANGLES more than usual in the shower.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the placenta :-)</li>
            <li> so I know the company has been around for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Your hair will be so soft without any heavy build up.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again and recommend anyone to try it for dry hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> However, you only need a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it four stars but am still on the search for shampoo that will give me Kardashian-like moisture and shine for less than $50 a bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small, which concerned me about value.  </li>
            <li> I had to go get my hair cut because the ends were especially dark &amp; orange.</li>
            <li> I thought it was something i was doing wrong because my hair kept shedding</li>
            <li> So needless to say i wont be using the Hask product on myself anymore.  </li>
            <li> This review isn&#x27;t for the faint.</li>
            <li> I have allergies caused by food and environment that have ill affect on my skin.</li>
            <li> We also purchased the spray in conditioner, too from this brand, but don&#x27;t feel as crazy about that as I do the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to moisturize my hair and contain sulfates, which is bad.  </li>
            <li> Could work for someone else but didnt do the job for me :(</li>

            <li> Works great! A little goes a long way!  My hair is smoother and shiny!  Will purchase again!  Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as great as I thought it would be.  I have used other bask products and thought this would be awesome, I&#x27;ll stick to the hask shampoo with olive oil, which is a much better product and less costly.</li>
            <li> I used this product one time and it turned my blonde hair brassy &amp; orangey. The description states that it will not change the color of your hair, but in my case it did, and after only one use. I had to go get my hair cut because the ends were especially dark &amp; orange. I regret ever buying this product and am very upset about my hair. I have since colored it and between that and the hair cut it looks much better but it still has an orangey tint that I just can&#x27;t get rid of. I would not suggest this product to anyone with blonde hair. Please be aware that it CAN and WILL turn your hair brassy &amp; orange.</li>
            <li> Ok at ive used this product twice in 4 weeks and noticed my hair was dry and rough.

            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. My hair has never been so shiny!!! :) &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Great for my hair. My hair stopped breaking and feels soft.. I will always buy this product for my hair to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> This product really works. This review isn&#x27;t for the faint. I have allergies caused by food and environment that have ill affect on my skin. An allergic flair up leaves my scalp itchy and flakey. This product was recommended by my doctor and out of ALL of the &amp;#34;on the shelf&amp;#34; hair products for itchy/flakey scalp, this is the ONLY one that gives me releif and it has a pleasant scent. The shampoo has a &amp;#34;cherry caugh syrup&amp;#34; scent when applying it but my wife says that my hair smells like sugar, which is a heck of a lot better then every other product I have used for this issue. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty gross you are using aborted fetuses placenta</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  The original scents shook was the best.</li>

            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is so soft and healthy now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. My hair is fine, brittle, and dry. This shampoo and conditioner has turned my hair around.</li>
            <li> Does not leave the hair as smooth as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal WEN purchaser for years, but couldn&#x27;t keep affording that high cost.  I never thought I&#x27;d say it, but I finally found a product BETTER than WEN.  I&#x27;ve been using the Henna and Placenta deep conditioning packets for years...so I know the company has been around for a long time.  I know the name of the brand is gross...my two daughters were mortified.  BUT, if you can get beyond that, you will be so pleased.  The bottles are small, which concerned me about value.  However, you only need a very small amount.  Your hair will be so soft without any heavy build up.  My daughters&#x27; long fine blonde hair takes a beating in the FL sun and pools, but this stuff had their hair looking shiny and smooth within just a couple showers.  I really highly recommend this product.  We also purchased the spray in conditioner, too from this brand, but don&#x27;t feel as crazy about that as I do the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> We love this Has Henna &#x27;N&#x27; Placenta shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Fantastic,everything I remember!!!!!I will buy it again,thanks so much for truth in advertising.I love your product!!</li>
