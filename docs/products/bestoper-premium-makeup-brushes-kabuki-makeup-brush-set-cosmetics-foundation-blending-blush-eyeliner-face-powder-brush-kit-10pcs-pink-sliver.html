            <li>They came in fast and she loves them!!!</li>
            <li>but not so much the aye brushes!!!</li>
            <li>These brushes are an absolute steal!!!</li>
            <li>Super full!</li>
            <li>I love my new brushes!!!</li>
            <li>And so soft!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend purchasing these because of the price and how many you get and they are made very well.</li>
            <li>, my makeup looks so much more natural and light and where it is  suppose to be with brushes and I looked for a long time for a good set--</li>
            <li>such an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>They only thing is that they don&#x27;t come in a case but get your own make up</li>
            <li>These brushes are great, I received them last week and I have used them daily and have washed them almost daily too after applying my makeup--no fibers have come out and they are withstanding constant use perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They are very,very soft to the skin and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super soft !!!</li>
            <li>Overall, these are okay brushes.</li>
            <li>There super soft and</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>i really like this brushes!!and for the price</li>
            <li>there a cute color pink Iove them</li>
            <li>I wish I would have tried these first, but live and learn.</li>
            <li>I recommend these to anyone and everyone wanting a decent brush set but don&#x27;t want to spend the 100&#x27;s on sigma brushes</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100.00 bucks a high end cosmetic company&#x27;s brushes (although I will on makeup..)</li>
            <li>very soft and blendable.  </li>
            <li>Oh and there was a little fall out on 2 of the brushes but after washing, they seem to be just fine.</li>
            <li>Reading the other reviews, others had that issue but nonetheless, the brushes are super soft, bristles never fall out, and they apply my makeup</li>
            <li>They are so plush and soft.  </li>
            <li>If I have a choice, I&#x27;d pay x3 as much to get brushes I can actually use.</li>
            <li>My make up application completely has done a 180 since I started using these.</li>
            <li>Also, one or two of the brushes broke off at the end of the handle, can  be glued back on but kind of frustrating</li>
            <li>but they smelled a little funny when they arrived.</li>

            <li> Super full! I cannot wait to use this set!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, I received them last week and I have used them daily and have washed them almost daily too after applying my makeup--no fibers have come out and they are withstanding constant use perfectly.  I just started to use brushes last year after using a blender and my fingers for years, my makeup looks so much more natural and light and where it is  suppose to be with brushes and I looked for a long time for a good set--I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100.00 bucks a high end cosmetic company&#x27;s brushes (although I will on makeup..) these work great.  I would recommend purchasing these because of the price and how many you get and they are made very well.</li>

            <li> These brushes are an absolute steal!!! They apply my makeup so flawlessly.  I recommend these to anyone and everyone wanting a decent brush set but don&#x27;t want to spend the 100&#x27;s on sigma brushes</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes I love them!!!</li>
            <li> I started watching YouTube &amp;#34;Beat My Face&amp;#34; videos a couple of months ago. It&#x27;s where people apply makeup while a song plays. I saw then using all these wonderful looking brushes. Then I found out that some of them cost over $100 per set. That was too deep for my pocket. I bought some from e.l.f and another website that were $15.00+$2.00 for shipping. I didn&#x27;t like either of those at all (too rough and prickly) so I searched here and I found THESE!!!. OMWOW! They feel WONDERFUL. They are very,very soft to the skin and easy to use. The handles are a great size so you can apply your makeup with ease and not waste product by having to start over and reapply.Yes, they had a chemical smell but that&#x27;s not uncommon with new brushes.They just needed to air out and then be cleaned. They work well with any makeup I&#x27;m applying. They can even be used to blend in your favorite face cream or lotion. I bought a second pair for that and for backups. Then I told my Mom about them and we ordered her a set too! She loves them also. I wish I would have tried these first, but live and learn. I&#x27;m experimenting with makeup and the tools for them and these will always be on my go to list. I hope they never stop selling these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They are so plush and soft.  They worked perfectly.  The fibers are not falling out.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  Great quality, great price, fantastic brushes!</li>
            <li> OMG, the BEST brushes ever for the price.  Folks don&#x27;t get any others.  These are perfect!</li>
            <li> Big brushes are OK but the smaller ones for the eyes are just not good: out of shape, big, too fluffy. You can&#x27;t do anything, well maybe blend in your concealer before applying eye shadows but I don&#x27;t need 4 brushes for that. If I have a choice, I&#x27;d pay x3 as much to get brushes I can actually use.</li>
            <li> such an amazing deal. great quality and quantity for a STEAL of a price.</li>
            <li> These are quite decent brushes even though they sent me the wrong color. I ordered the pink/silver ones, not the black ones. Reading the other reviews, others had that issue but nonetheless, the brushes are super soft, bristles never fall out, and they apply my makeup okay/decently. Overall, these are okay brushes. Don&#x27;t expect something amazing.</li>
            <li> Just got it today. It doesn&#x27;t shed. And so soft!!!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG im so glad I found these!! My make up application completely has done a 180 since I started using these. If you&#x27;re looking for AMAZING brushes for cheap, these are the ones! Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used! They don&#x27;t shed, they&#x27;re extremely soft and they make the make up look flawless on my skin! Worth every penny!</li>
