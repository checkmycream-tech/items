            <li>Good for traveling.</li>
            <li>Veeeeery  good</li>
            <li>An excellent product and with an extra 4 pads an excellent value.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...works great</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Otherwise nice for taking on trips.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of carrying these packets in my handbag in emergency nail situations.  </li>
            <li>I tried these because they were cheaper than the Sally Hansen ones, which I love.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say any works better than the others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to use more than one.</li>
            <li>And of course, it can&#x27;t be beat for travel--no more toting polish remover around with you or worrying about leaking in your suitcase.</li>
            <li>does an excellent job removing polish and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out nails</li>
            <li>Easy to use and portable.</li>
            <li>These and the ones from Ulta are best if you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;re going to use them all within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nails that split or chip easily?</li>
            <li>With one pad, I could easily remove light colored polish on all of my nails.  </li>
            <li>They are great for travel as no spillage is possible.</li>
            <li>if used correctly, four surfaces are available.</li>
            <li>these pads are an inexpensive, convenient, and high-quality option for removing nail polish quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>The Cutex ones will actually clean all 10 nails with one pad.</li>
            <li>These are ok but too much rubbing.</li>
            <li>One pad can do all then fingers leaving them polish free and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It quickly removed all of the polish.  </li>
            <li>Even when the wipes are full of your old nail color - they can take off more.</li>
            <li>so for the money I did not think it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Wash hands after use and before applying fresh polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thin</li>
            <li>that I find it definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>However, if there are too many layers, you may need two pads to complete the job of removing paint from ur two hands.</li>
            <li>Initially I purchaed these for travel only, but now use them all the time as there is no spill danger and they do a great job.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too little but raly good</li>
            <li>This product works but not any better than regular nail polish remover and a cotton ball</li>
            <li>My sister gave me some of these polish remover pads at Christmas, and I recently bought more.</li>
            <li>They are very convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider this much of a shortcoming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of how well they removed polish, all of the pads I&#x27;ve tried do that very well.</li>
            <li>If you just gently rub/dab at your finger, you&#x27;ll need two to three pads to take all the polish off.</li>
            <li>These work very well and the cloth doesn&#x27;t get clogged up when removing polish.  </li>
            <li>Much prefer jar with sponge.</li>
            <li>Worked very well</li>
            <li>these don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>but that doesn&#x27;t happen that much.  </li>
            <li>But as long as you do that, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricier than cotton balls or cotton rounds, but the results are so much better (no shredding or bits of cotton sticking to your hands or nails)</li>
            <li>Outside of box said 4 pads free but box only had 10 pads</li>
            <li>simple to carry for a quick fix or regular use.</li>
            <li>These have a slightly more pleasant (less unpleasant) smell than the Sally Hansens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them a couple times now and you really can use one pad for all ten toes or fingers.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re sensitive to the smell of nail polish remover, that&#x27;s something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it ll last much much longer</li>
            <li>Use them quickly or they will be dry when you open them.  </li>
            <li>You have to rub firmly and quickly to remove the polish from each finger in order to get all 10 before the pad dries out.</li>
            <li>A single pad really does take care of all ten nails.</li>
            <li>I use a base coat, light colored polish and a top coat . . .</li>
            <li>One wipe does take off nail polish from 10 fingers, but barely :) I really have to work at it to get the last few fingers.</li>

            <li> Less than a month shelf life.  </li>
            <li> nd one pad outs not clean all 10 nails.</li>
            <li> Try either Sally Hansen Miracle Cure or Green Tea + Olive Growth.</li>
            <li> 1 pad isn&#x27;t enough for all 10 toes when the polish is tough - and then it is annoying to waster another whole pad on 1 or 2 toes.  </li>
            <li> Some of the less expensive options are flimsy, not as wet, and make it hard to remove the polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the polish off.  </li>
            <li> The pads are well saturated and comfy thick . . .</li>
            <li> Although this is not the least expensive way to remove nail polish, it is the easiest &amp; least messy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these are wrapped in paper packets (instead of foil)</li>
            <li> I always carry a few of these in my purse because I HATE when my nail color begins to chip.</li>
            <li> Chipped nail polish on finger nails looks AWFUL &amp; HIDEOUS!!</li>

            <li> These pads work wonderfully! A single pad really does take care of all ten nails. Sometimes I use a second if the former polish was dark and I get it on my skin, but one will do the trick if you need it to. They are very convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li> Use them quickly or they will be dry when you open them.  Less than a month shelf life.  Good for traveling.</li>
            <li> Although this is not the least expensive way to remove nail polish, it is the easiest &amp; least messy.  Initially I purchaed these for travel only, but now use them all the time as there is no spill danger and they do a great job.  The Cutex ones will actually clean all 10 nails with one pad. They are just a bit larger and heavier than the off brand ones.</li>
            <li> Outside of box said 4 pads free but box only had 10 pads.... wonder where the others went?  Otherwise nice for taking on trips.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of carrying these packets in my handbag in emergency nail situations.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These pads are smaller than you&#x27;d expect, about 2 inches by 1 inch. However they are thick and really do work. I&#x27;ve used them a couple times now and you really can use one pad for all ten toes or fingers. You do have to flip the pad over and use both sides, but it is thick enough to allow that.</li>
            <li> This product works but not any better than regular nail polish remover and a cotton ball so for the money I did not think it was worth it.</li>
            <li> These are convenient. Easy to use and portable. I had used a stick on nail polish (Sally Hansen salon effects) nd one pad outs not clean all 10 nails. That stuff is a beast to remove, with anything, though, so I don&#x27;t consider this much of a shortcoming. Pricey for regular use, but I bought for travel.</li>
            <li> Even when the wipes are full of your old nail color - they can take off more. I also cut them in 1/2 and reseal in a ziplock.</li>
            <li> I tried these because they were cheaper than the Sally Hansen ones, which I love. Unfortunately, these are wrapped in paper packets (instead of foil) so they dry out within a couple months if you don&#x27;t use them. The Sally Hansen ones are wrapped in thick foil and seem to last forever. These and the ones from Ulta are best if you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;re going to use them all within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of how well they removed polish, all of the pads I&#x27;ve tried do that very well. I wouldn&#x27;t say any works better than the others. For me, it&#x27;s strictly a matter of how long I can keep them in my purse before they go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. These have a slightly more pleasant (less unpleasant) smell than the Sally Hansens. So if you&#x27;re sensitive to the smell of nail polish remover, that&#x27;s something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 8/13/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that any nail polish remover pad depends on pressure to work well. If you just gently rub/dab at your finger, you&#x27;ll need two to three pads to take all the polish off. This is because the liquid starts to dry/evaporate as soon as you open the packet. You have to rub firmly and quickly to remove the polish from each finger in order to get all 10 before the pad dries out. But as long as you do that, you should be fine. I&#x27;ve never had to use more than one.</li>
            <li> These work very well and the cloth doesn&#x27;t get clogged up when removing polish.  They are great for travel as no spillage is possible.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me some of these polish remover pads at Christmas, and I recently bought more. I was impressed with the ability to remove polish from both hands with one pad. I tried some less expensive options, but these (and their equivalent store-brand versions at Target and Walmart) are worth the extra money. Some of the less expensive options are flimsy, not as wet, and make it hard to remove the polish. Trust me - these pads are an inexpensive, convenient, and high-quality option for removing nail polish quickly and easily. I love them!</li>
            <li> Works well. One wipe does take off nail polish from 10 fingers, but barely :) I really have to work at it to get the last few fingers. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...works great</li>
            <li> So convenient for travel!  Will buy again.  Works well!</li>
            <li> These are ok but too much rubbing. Much prefer jar with sponge.</li>
            <li> One pad should be enough to remove polish from both hands. The pads are well saturated and comfy thick . . . if used correctly, four surfaces are available. I use a base coat, light colored polish and a top coat . . . simple to carry for a quick fix or regular use. I did not find the remover to be &#x27;nail drying.&#x27;  Wash hands after use and before applying fresh polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thin nails that split or chip easily? Try either Sally Hansen Miracle Cure or Green Tea + Olive Growth. I use both and they can be used as a base or top coat.</li>
            <li> An excellent product and with an extra 4 pads an excellent value. I would recommend this merchant to anyone.a very pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> These are great for travel. One pad can do all then fingers leaving them polish free and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I like these nail polish remover pads. The felt pads come saturated with nail polish remover. And one pad actually does treat all 10 nails and removes every bit of polish. Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricier than cotton balls or cotton rounds, but the results are so much better (no shredding or bits of cotton sticking to your hands or nails) that I find it definitely worth the price. And of course, it can&#x27;t be beat for travel--no more toting polish remover around with you or worrying about leaking in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> Bought these to use on a trip to Greece in June. Worked very well so I didn&#x27;t have to carry a bottle of liquid polish remover.</li>
            <li> Veeeeery  good but it&#x27;s too little but raly good&lt;br /&gt;But for me I&#x27;ll by the other Nile polish remover coz it ll last much much longer</li>
            <li> these don&#x27;t work very well.  It&#x27;s hard to get the polish off.  I would not buy them again, they just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It quickly removed all of the polish.  With one pad, I could easily remove light colored polish on all of my nails.  Sometimes I needed two pads for use with dark red polish.  Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> does an excellent job removing polish and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out nails</li>
            <li> I always carry a few of these in my purse because I HATE when my nail color begins to chip. Chipped nail polish on finger nails looks AWFUL &amp; HIDEOUS!! Even if there are multiple layers of polish applied to your nails, these definitely do the trick. However, if there are too many layers, you may need two pads to complete the job of removing paint from ur two hands. Txs for this product - carry, tear open, use, toss!!</li>
            <li> works great. 1 pad isn&#x27;t enough for all 10 toes when the polish is tough - and then it is annoying to waster another whole pad on 1 or 2 toes.  but that doesn&#x27;t happen that much.  perfect for hands.</li>
            <li> They work but dry out quicker than nail polish wipes i have used in the past.</li>
