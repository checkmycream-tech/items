            <li>Better price in the end and worth the full size.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!  </li>
            <li>and i believe still with original overwrap.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>where also ,  have allowed me to maintain a break out free, fresh face and fine line repair or</li>
            <li>I love the product although I am kind of upset it was lowered in price two days following my purchase.</li>
            <li>I liked the price &amp; feel like this product is very comparable to others with a much higher price tag</li>
            <li>, it is only for prevention, I can not tell you how good it is at reversing damage, all I know is I glow</li>
            <li>I noticed changes the very first night.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants smooth radiant skin.</li>
            <li>so I can keep them looking soft and smooth!).  </li>
            <li>and this absorbs right into your face</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin always looks clearer, brighter, and more even as quickly as the next day.  </li>
            <li>It is super light, spreads easily all over face (thin fluid), and absorbs beautifully.  </li>
            <li>THIS, u wont FLAKE its gentle but packs a mighty RESULT for oil prone Skin and normal skin</li>
            <li>got smallest bottle to try first,  </li>
            <li>a workgin actress, my face is first thing that gets me into the door for work so</li>
            <li>this product just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to make an impact.</li>
            <li>now use it with RETIN -A, available by prescription only.</li>
            <li>Not oily at all--and I am very picky about things like that.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I really like using this product every night before bed</li>
            <li>lasts a long time due to consistency of product - very light and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much change to the blemishes I seem to get, but it just makes my face have a new layer of skin without going through a mask or exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>My face is overall better, but this is not necessarily an acne treatment.</li>
            <li>and I do enjoy buying other PTR products so this helps the budget.</li>
            <li>and I am in my early 30s.  </li>
            <li>in a decent amount of time, packaged carefully</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way and it made my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> and it acts as a retinol long term</li>
            <li> Was prone to minor breakouts</li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t have dry skin</li>
            <li> have never experienced any redness or irritation with this product, like I have with Retin A (prescription), but for those with sensitive skin, try applying on a small area first.</li>
            <li> My non working days are spent  sans makeup ,just Neutrogena SPF 110.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a few weeks &amp; from what I read about these types of products it takes awhile to see a permanent result</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a small amount using the dropper.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase the larger size, but it was sold out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Retin A via prescription, and other Retinol products.  </li>
            <li> IT IS SMOOTHER, LESS BUMPS AND WHITEHEADS.</li>
            <li> I do not currently have bad skin, I am young and have no acne</li>
            <li> I just put a few drops on a cotton ball and rub all over my face and neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39, not many wrinkles, but just the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I just add some cream in a small bowl and add a dropper of Retinol mix it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This makes my face look SOO knit together and pore less like GLASS SEA each morning , I haven&#x27;t broken out and there is NO OIl!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once had troubled skin, no more for  years .</li>
            <li> , I call them ,  tested on my face that was once troubled .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have been using PTR for about 18 months. Within 3 months I noticed my blotchiness start to fade. My friends , family and co-workers also noticed and asked what I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use it with RETIN -A, available by prescription only.</li>
            <li> love they way to soaks immediately into the skin, very light weight</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, so happy it&#x27;s offered as an add on makes it much more affordable and I do enjoy buying other PTR products so this helps the budget. Goes on smoothly and has brightened my skin. I use it at night and in the AM, helps my skin stay hydrated.</li>
            <li> very good retinol that does not irritate even my sensitive eye area</li>
            <li> I love the product although I am kind of upset it was lowered in price two days following my purchase. Either way better deal than at Sephora... I would get the larger sized bottle. Better price in the end and worth the full size. Keep in mind I do not currently have bad skin, I am young and have no acne, it is only for prevention, I can not tell you how good it is at reversing damage, all I know is I glow and it acts as a retinol long term</li>
            <li> love this product - excellent quality.  lasts a long time due to consistency of product - very light and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> I put it on before bed.  It&#x27;s like liquid silk.  Not oily at all--and I am very picky about things like that.  No odor either.  I noticed changes the very first night.  I woke up with a glowing smooth skin.  I&#x27;m 39, not many wrinkles, but just the beginning.  This is perfect for my skin.  I don&#x27;t notice much change to the blemishes I seem to get, but it just makes my face have a new layer of skin without going through a mask or exfoliating.  Makes the pores tighter, too.  My face is overall better, but this is not necessarily an acne treatment.</li>
            <li> I wish I could bathe in this stuff I love it so much!  haha - my skin is normal/oily in T zone.  Was prone to minor breakouts and I am in my early 30s.  I just put a few drops on a cotton ball and rub all over my face and neck (I rub it on the back of my hands too so I can keep them looking soft and smooth!).  I usually only use at night before bed and wake up to radiant supple skin! Cant remember the last time I had a pimple</li>
            <li> Acceptable product; hopeful for diminishing wrinkles.  Reliable sender.</li>
            <li> Love all of these projects</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it sinking into my skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it made my skin feel soft. However, for a retinol product I didn&#x27;t get the desired effect. I have oily, acne prone skin and this product just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to make an impact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS. I CAN&#x27;T SAY I HAVE BEEN RELIGIOUS ABOUT IT THOUGH. WHEN I DO USE IT - I NOTICE A DIFFERENCE. MY CHIN TENDS TO BREAK OUT AND I GET WHITE HEADS AND SOME BUMPS EVEN WHEN I DON&#x27;T HAVE PIMPLES. THIS HAS MADE AN IMPACT ON THOSE ISSUES. IT IS SMOOTHER, LESS BUMPS AND WHITEHEADS. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT AND WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING IT IF YOU HAVE A SIMILAR ISSUE.</li>
            <li> glad to have a chance to try ptr retinol, but i know it&#x27;ll be months before i see any results..,.&lt;br /&gt;came in a decent amount of time, packaged carefully and i believe still with original overwrap.&lt;br /&gt;great price, great shipping...appreciate extra cleansing sample as well!!</li>
            <li> I really like using this product every night before bed I mix this into my vitamin E face cream or coconut oil and I have noticed a much better complexion also noticed my fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they use to be .some people use just the Retinol but I prefer mixing this with cream I just add some cream in a small bowl and add a dropper of Retinol mix it and I have used this alone and this absorbs right into your face doesn&#x27;t leave it oily that&#x27;s a plus.Will buy this again .</li>
            <li> Works great.  Just purchased another.  Great service too.</li>
            <li> Once again,  this is an amazing product! The texture of my skin has dramatically improved. I recommend this product to anyone who wants smooth radiant skin.</li>
            <li> OH MY !! LUV LUV!  this is greaseless and disappears in to nothingness  not kddign , it dissipates into skin like silk and you Cant see a trace of any of it after skin drinks It in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got smallest bottle to try first,  am SO THRILLED I try alot of things and have over time,  discovered my best wrokgin personal CORE FOUR face essentials time, I call them ,  tested on my face that was once troubled .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a workgin actress, my face is first thing that gets me into the door for work so its great to have a system of care this is now part of, which means world to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes my face look SOO knit together and pore less like GLASS SEA each morning , I haven&#x27;t broken out and there is NO OIl!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Once had troubled skin, no more for  years . My non working days are spent  sans makeup ,just Neutrogena SPF 110.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products I got here , some sold else where also ,  have allowed me to maintain a break out free, fresh face and fine line repair or reduction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY THIS, u wont FLAKE its gentle but packs a mighty RESULT for oil prone Skin and normal skin, i don&#x27;t have dry skin so i cannot speak to that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount using the dropper.  It is super light, spreads easily all over face (thin fluid), and absorbs beautifully.  The BEST part, it actually works!

            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a few weeks &amp; from what I read about these types of products it takes awhile to see a permanent result but I think&lt;br /&gt;it will be helpful overall with continued use. I liked the price &amp; feel like this product is very comparable to others with a much higher price tag</li>
