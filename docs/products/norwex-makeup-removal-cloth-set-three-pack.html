    <ol>
            <li> There great...Hint check the size before you order...</li>
            <li> If you are buying these to remove your eye makeup with just water then don&#x27;t invest in these...They did NOT remove my mascara with water and hardly removed it with soap....They are just ok...not superior and not a &amp;#34;wonder cloth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was looking for a chemical free alternative to cleansing. It turned out to be more of a headache to use these - they&#x27;re difficult to keep clean, and they feel harsh on the skin if you really want to get all the makeup off. They also gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> This cloth works amazingly.  It takes my make up off easily.  When using make sure you wipe in an upwards motion.  I got one for my daughter who has moderate acne and her skin cleared up within a week.  It is cleaned easily by boiling it.  Make sure you don&#x27;t wash your Norwex clothes with normal laundry or the micro fibers will be filled with lint and your cloth will be ruined.</li>
            <li> useless, way too small</li>
            <li> I was pretty amazed how well it removed my very hard to remove non-waterproof mascara (Benefit They&#x27;re Real!) and all I used was the cloth and water.  Most of my makeup came off immediately w/o having to use makeup remover.  Although it didn&#x27;t fully remove my mascara-washed face w/ my cleanser after, I was still amazed that a wet cloth w/ only water worked so well.</li>
            <li> they work but i have dry patches on my skin now that burn after using these ....</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really impressed</li>
            <li> Really like them. Works great. Came quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the cloths.The cloths thoroughly removes make-up, even waterproof mascara. Not having to use harsh soaps helps with overall health of the skin, and pretty much eliminated pimples and other skin reactions.My teenage daughter uses the cloth with complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for 3 facial cloths... but they work wonderfully.  I wish they were a little larger.</li>
            <li> This cloth removes the make-up just like it says. My face feels really clean afterwards too.</li>
            <li> Not what I was hoping for. Had to keep rinsing and turning the cloth over to get all my make up off. Had a hard time getting mascara off with these cloths.</li>
            <li> Keeping my skin soft as it ever could be. I am nearly 60 and after a few weeks, my face feels 30!</li>
            <li> if I could give this a 0 star I would.  Worst. Cloth. Ever!  Gave me wicked bad wrinkles and no one raves about my skin any longer, after a year of using them.  now people say I look tired and old.  very disappointed</li>
            <li> Thought they  were bigger.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the great. It feels weird for some reason to wipe it. I don&#x27;t like the feeling of the suede on my face for some reason. Then it doesn&#x27;t even feel clean afterwards. I really have to wipe hard to get makeup off and I feel it will dry out my skin doing it everyday. I took my usual  makeup remover cloth to my face after the norwex and there was residual makeup left. I don&#x27;t even wear a ton of makeup. See picture attached. I&#x27;m disappointed since norwex is so expensive and I would not recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase mine from a norwex consultant not amazon.</li>
            <li> These cloths work pretty good and I would recommend them over using a cleanser for the face but it didn&#x27;t get my mascara off without hard rubbing which of course isn&#x27;t a good thing.</li>
            <li> These are over priced! A Norwex consultant can get these to you for much cheaper. Plus you get the Norwex warranty (void if not purchased from Norwex or their consultants) and personal customer service including monthly specials for hosts and customers. Find a consultant in your area to get REAL Norwex products and the REAL prices. Ask your consultant if they are running any specials.</li>
