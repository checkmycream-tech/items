    <ol>
            <li>no hair product works perfectly on all hair.  </li>
            <li>this is perfect for mine!</li>
            <li>Best part was that I could chose WHERE I wanted the highlights</li>
            <li>THIS WORK PERFECT</li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking to have hightlights, but I did see some people use this to create beautiful highlights and ombre effects.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for my purpose.</li>
            <li>was very nice.  </li>
            <li>Love Love this product!!!!</li>
            <li>I think it looks especially nice in the sunlight, when the top of the head and strands on the side seem to look \\&quot;sunkissed\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s it very easy!</li>
            <li>Looked good</li>
            <li>, THE SMELL IS NOT THAT GOOD</li>
            <li>i threw away the directions and struck out on my own.  </li>
            <li>i really liked the effect, even though that wasn&#x27;t what i was out to achieve.  </li>
            <li>I did my own ombré</li>
            <li>be sure to use at your own caution.  </li>
            <li>i have since repeated that process 3 times with even better results.  </li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and I have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, that is the best feature of this product- because it lightens gradually, you can choose what shade to aim for, you&#x27;re not stuck with whatever is in the bottle, and you can stop and do more later, if you choose to.</li>
            <li>I will probably lighten even more for summer.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have better luck straightening your hair with lemon juice.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>and it turned out beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li>, IS CHEAP AND EASY BETTER THAN A SALON $$$$$.</li>
            <li>But my hair was fine.</li>
            <li>It worked great and looked super natural.  </li>
            <li>it gave me the most beautiful highlights to my dark brown hair,it did notice any damaging in the hair.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS GREAT COLOR WITH RED TONES WITH THIS</li>
            <li>is a match for a good old salon highlights .</li>
            <li>Excellent, I will definitely order again,The Product  came Quick, Thanks</li>
            <li>It is the only type of &amp;#34;coloring&amp;#34; I will use and I like it much more than the sun-in products because the results are more noticeable and I have more control of where the color goes.</li>
            <li>i will definitely keep buying this product and continue to use a good conditioner after each use.  </li>
            <li>Tried this on a whim - I am normally a brunette and just wanted some subtle caramel highlights - this was very easy and worked great!!</li>
            <li>the shafts are very fine &amp; naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is not super healthy, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but for those who have pretty healthy, well-conditioned and cared for hair, this product is an inexpensive, easy alternative to three hours at the salon getting highlights.</li>
            <li>I bought this product last summer and did my own highlights.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The one drawback is that the formula made my exposed arms (I was wearing a t-shirt) sting, so I showered right after to get it off.</li>
            <li>, I spray this all over, after I wash and towel dry, and run it through my hair, while wearing the handy gloves that came with this.</li>
            <li>This seemed to be a great product at first, but to get the highlights light enough for my taste, I went over some sections of hair more than a few times including extra spritzes (which was allowed, per the box instructions).  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have mid-back-length, dark brown hair that has never been dyed and is very healthy.</li>
            <li>, caramel highlights that my friends and stylist have said are pretty.</li>
            <li>i followed the directions exactly even though i know that a flat-iron is certain annihilation for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I used up one bottle and what I ended up with is very natural-looking pretty</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn off my hair or fry it like some of the other reviewers have experienced, but it definitely did not lighten my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Also, I think a lot of people are use to how hair dye makes their hair super soft...</li>
            <li>thanks for reading my review.  </li>
            <li>(maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t see so much damage).</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li>and I personally really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I end up with very subtil ..shy highlight .&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture on the box</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all really .&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
            <li>This is a great product for those who want to NATURALLY and SUBTLY LIGHTEN their hair, without having to dye it.</li>
            <li>that is very convenient for me since I am busy and don&#x27;t have much time to wait 25 minutes for hair to turn a certain color.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and was able to achieve noticeably copper streaks.</li>
            <li>(i have an asymmetrical bob with a high crown) with the spray and then applied the blow dryer on high heat to the area for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>it took more than 5-7 swipes with my flat iron and the 1 noticeable highlight actually melted my hair.</li>
            <li>There were lots of natural-looking golden blonde highlights all over the area i had sprayed.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still very black, but in the light, my hair turns brown!</li>
            <li>If you still insist on trying it, I recommend doing so on a tiny piece of hair first.</li>
            <li>i naturally am a redhead</li>
            <li>COMPLETELY damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>and I saw slightly light brown hair only after repeating the steps for spraying and flat ironing the hair about five different times on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby extra fine longer dark blond hair.</li>
            <li>What I do to achieve that is, instead of using a flat iron to go over sprayed strands (I really didn&#x27;t want to risk damaging/burning my hair)</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I only used it on a small area in the front of my head.</li>
            <li>I tried it on several different sections, followed the directions exactly, and got zero results.</li>
            <li>Definitely planning on using again and would recommend to anyone who wants subtle highlights, and if you use more it could probably have made them more dramatic too.</li>
            <li>I have been colouring my hair for years personally and professionally and never once has any product ever caused any reaction.</li>
            <li>Also might be more dramatic on lighter-haired folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I covered my gray with brunette dye and then pulled out tiny (1/8\\&quot; sections) of hair around the crown and my face, where my natural highlights are, sprayed and went to town with the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Her hair has never been colour treated so there is no excuse for the damage this caused.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not impressed.. would be best for ligher colors.. to get dramatic or even noticeable highlights..</li>
            <li>and so far there&#x27;s no fried or dry hair noted.  </li>
            <li>I want to keep my Asian black hair, but sometimes, I really do feel like wanting brown hair.</li>
            <li>I have very dark hair with natural red highlights, but since I&#x27;m starting to show some gray and am now having to dye the gray out, I felt I was losing the natural red.  </li>

            <li> I have very dark hair with natural red highlights, but since I&#x27;m starting to show some gray and am now having to dye the gray out, I felt I was losing the natural red.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair before (even highlights) with other products including bleach (professional hair grade) and never had a problem.  </li>
            <li> but i like to take a little of the ginger out of it with dark golden brown semi-permanent color.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, dirty blonde hair that I do not not color and barely use styling products on so it is pretty healthy.</li>
            <li> Just as well I only applied it to three small areas, otherwise I&#x27;m sure she would have serious issues with her hair.  </li>
            <li> All this is is like taking hydrogen peroxide, saturating your hair and using a flat iron to burn it all off!</li>
            <li> Should be expected as you are adding semi-wet product to hair then applying heat on it several times.</li>
            <li> Be careful, though, because just a second too long</li>
            <li> the product only slightly lightened my hair...not enough for what i wanted.  </li>
            <li> The technique I followed was as directed, spray, and then run over with straightening iron until the strand was dry (about 3-5 times), then I repeated those steps 3-4 times/section to lighten to my desired shade.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I blow dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is my scalp gets irritated for a few days afterwards but its no big deal.</li>
            <li> I am Asian with black hair that&#x27;s never been dyed.</li>
            <li> Gave me the highlights I need without having to use actual messy hair color.</li>
            <li> TIP: be careful when you spray close to the roots.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i wanted chunky highlights in my dark color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I am naturally dark brown</li>
            <li> It lightens your hair but it also ruins your hair and makes it so damaged there is NO WAY to fix it.</li>
            <li> i would recommend starting slowly and repeating until the desired effects are achieved.  </li>
            <li> and I am sitting here cutting them off right now.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands because I have trouble finding this in stores</li>
            <li> but that I&#x27;ve colored my hair black using a non-permanent rinse for years.</li>
            <li> And I find it odd that the clumps of gray are where the highlights were.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little bit too...</li>
            <li> I HAD MY HAIR VERY DARK</li>
            <li> I have been highlighting (with heavy duty &amp;#34;bleach&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The two stars are for the few highlights I had and the eas of use .</li>
            <li> Seriously, my hair gummed up and I am cutting it right now.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with one small section of dried frizzle.  </li>
            <li> Hardly because I had no expectation at all .</li>
            <li> No one in my family (including extended family) went prematurely gray (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> i mean what the hell please dont order this its a god product</li>
            <li> I contacted the company (which took forever to reply BTW, never seen such bad customer service), and asked them if this could be used on chemically colored hair.</li>
            <li> Smelled nasty, left residue on my hair, and didnt even lighten a single strand.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see so many bad reviews!</li>
            <li> my hair is neither very thick or thin.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money, and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> When considering the product, I was concerned about the bad side effects (drying/breaking) that had been mentioned in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Well it worked but very subtly .</li>
            <li> It burnt parts of my daughters hair off and left a nasty looking bleach like stain on one side.</li>
            <li> and I did it really haphazardly</li>
            <li> I am so upset and mad at myself for even buying this stuff.</li>
            <li> Again, I was afraid to damage my hair) and I achieved the sunkissed glowing hair!  </li>
            <li> My hair has a terrible texture that feels like crimped hay.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> This crap should be taken off of the market!</li>
            <li> This product burned my hair so badly I have to now get it cut!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible and unsafe!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!!</li>

            <li> it gave me the most beautiful highlights to my dark brown hair,it did notice any damaging in the hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I will definitely order again,The Product  came Quick, Thanks</li>
            <li> i bought this because i wanted chunky highlights in my dark color-treated hair.  i naturally am a redhead but i like to take a little of the ginger out of it with dark golden brown semi-permanent color.  my hair is neither very thick or thin. the shafts are very fine &amp; naturally curly.  i&#x27;ve described my hair in detail so that the review can be applied to someone with my hair color, type &amp; texture.  each person&#x27;s hair will respond to any treatment differently.  i followed the directions exactly even though i know that a flat-iron is certain annihilation for my hair.  the product only slightly lightened my hair...not enough for what i wanted.  i then switched to PLAN B.  i threw away the directions and struck out on my own.  I sprayed the entire front section of my hair (i have an asymmetrical bob with a high crown) with the spray and then applied the blow dryer on high heat to the area for about 3 minutes.  i really liked the effect, even though that wasn&#x27;t what i was out to achieve.  i washed and conditioned my hair and the after-styling effect was very nice.  There were lots of natural-looking golden blonde highlights all over the area i had sprayed.  i have since repeated that process 3 times with even better results.  i have been washing the product out of my hair after each use because i feel that leaving it on until the next wash might be damaging to my fragile hair.  yesterday, i left it on overnight and so far there&#x27;s no fried or dry hair noted.  i will definitely keep buying this product and continue to use a good conditioner after each use.  be sure to use at your own caution.  no hair product works perfectly on all hair.  i would recommend starting slowly and repeating until the desired effects are achieved.  thanks for reading my review.  ~JanetManley~</li>
            <li> COMPLETELY damaged my hair. 3 months later and I am still dealing with the effects of using this once!! My hair has a terrible texture that feels like crimped hay. It also made my hair fall out. HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have baby extra fine longer dark blond hair. My hair is healthy and I have a lot of it.  I have been highlighting (with heavy duty &amp;#34;bleach&amp;#34; products)and coloring for 30 years and have NEVER-EVER had breakage.&lt;br /&gt;This product made my hair break off about 3 inches from my scalp in the area I used this product.  I am so upset and mad at myself for even buying this stuff. What a nightmare.  I am SO glad I only used it on a small area in the front of my head. This crap should be taken off of the market!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lighten my brown hair at all.  It did fry it, though.  What a waste of money, and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dirty blonde hair that I do not not color and barely use styling products on so it is pretty healthy. I have read a lot of complaints about this product but I use it every summer and have noticed no damage. It is the only type of &amp;#34;coloring&amp;#34; I will use and I like it much more than the sun-in products because the results are more noticeable and I have more control of where the color goes. I have tried other brands because I have trouble finding this in stores but nothing else works as well. I was disappointed to see so many bad reviews! I guess it all depends on hair type and this is perfect for mine! Also, I think a lot of people are use to how hair dye makes their hair super soft...this ISNT hair dye. After I use it, I always do a deep conditioning treatment (maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t see so much damage). The only thing I don&#x27;t like is my scalp gets irritated for a few days afterwards but its no big deal.</li>
            <li> Love Love this product!!!! Its like getting salon hi lites at home! Would highly recommend this product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.  I am naturally dark brown but that I&#x27;ve colored my hair black using a non-permanent rinse for years. Tried this on my hair and I saw slightly light brown hair only after repeating the steps for spraying and flat ironing the hair about five different times on my hair. At that point my hair was fried crispy and broke all over the spots that I sprayed this. I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for all hair color like it says. Smells a little bit too...</li>
            <li> Worked for what I wanted, but it fried my hair. Should be expected as you are adding semi-wet product to hair then applying heat on it several times. I have dark brown hair and was able to achieve noticeably copper streaks. Everyones hair works differently with how well it can absorb color, but this product did help highlight my hair. Best part was that I could chose WHERE I wanted the highlights</li>
            <li> I have mid-back-length, dark brown hair that has never been dyed and is very healthy. When considering the product, I was concerned about the bad side effects (drying/breaking) that had been mentioned in previous reviews. To ease my fears, I tried it on a small underside segment first. Looked good so I pinned it up and started going through layer by layer adding highlights where I wanted them. The technique I followed was as directed, spray, and then run over with straightening iron until the strand was dry (about 3-5 times), then I repeated those steps 3-4 times/section to lighten to my desired shade. I actually did the process on two different days, because I have a lot of hair and I was concerned to go &amp;#34;too far&amp;#34; in the heat of the moment and end up with that &amp;#34;skunk&amp;#34;/streaky look. In my opinion, that is the best feature of this product- because it lightens gradually, you can choose what shade to aim for, you&#x27;re not stuck with whatever is in the bottle, and you can stop and do more later, if you choose to. I used up one bottle and what I ended up with is very natural-looking pretty, caramel highlights that my friends and stylist have said are pretty. I will probably lighten even more for summer. Definitely planning on using again and would recommend to anyone who wants subtle highlights, and if you use more it could probably have made them more dramatic too. Also might be more dramatic on lighter-haired folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback is that the formula made my exposed arms (I was wearing a t-shirt) sting, so I showered right after to get it off.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company (which took forever to reply BTW, never seen such bad customer service), and asked them if this could be used on chemically colored hair. When they said yes I decided to give it a try. It sucked. Smelled nasty, left residue on my hair, and didnt even lighten a single strand. You&#x27;d have better luck straightening your hair with lemon juice.</li>
            <li> i ordered this because of the name i got this in a plastic rap all messed up i didn&#x27;t receive it in no box i got no gloves i mean what the hell please dont order this its a god product but this supplier needs licks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.. would be best for ligher colors.. to get dramatic or even noticeable highlights.. it took more than 5-7 swipes with my flat iron and the 1 noticeable highlight actually melted my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim.  I have very dark hair with natural red highlights, but since I&#x27;m starting to show some gray and am now having to dye the gray out, I felt I was losing the natural red.  I covered my gray with brunette dye and then pulled out tiny (1/8\\&quot; sections) of hair around the crown and my face, where my natural highlights are, sprayed and went to town with the flat iron.  It worked great and looked super natural.  Be careful, though, because just a second too long and I ended up with one small section of dried frizzle.  If your hair is not super healthy, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but for those who have pretty healthy, well-conditioned and cared for hair, this product is an inexpensive, easy alternative to three hours at the salon getting highlights.</li>
            <li> Tried this on a whim - I am normally a brunette and just wanted some subtle caramel highlights - this was very easy and worked great!! I would definately use this again</li>
            <li> Works soooooooo well. I did my own ombré and I did it really haphazardly and it turned out beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last summer and did my own highlights.  I&#x27;ve dyed my hair before (even highlights) with other products including bleach (professional hair grade) and never had a problem.  This seemed to be a great product at first, but to get the highlights light enough for my taste, I went over some sections of hair more than a few times including extra spritzes (which was allowed, per the box instructions).  Now, 9 months later, I have TONS of GRAY HAIR where I put the highlights in.  No one in my family (including extended family) went prematurely gray (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s).  And I find it odd that the clumps of gray are where the highlights were.  It&#x27;s your risk, but I will never buy a Marc Anthony product again.</li>
            <li> I HAD MY HAIR VERY DARK AND I DO NOT HAVE GRAY HAIR BUT I WANTED A CHANGE THIS WORK PERFECT , THE SMELL IS NOT THAT GOOD BUT YOU CAN WASH YOUR HAIR WHEN YOU FINISH , LOVE IT MY HAIR IS GREAT COLOR WITH RED TONES WITH THIS , IS CHEAP AND EASY BETTER THAN A SALON $$$$$.</li>
            <li> great product! Gave me the highlights I need without having to use actual messy hair color. that is very convenient for me since I am busy and don&#x27;t have much time to wait 25 minutes for hair to turn a certain color. you just spray on and straighten with straightening iron and that&#x27;s it very easy!</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE COLOR TREATED HAIR DO NOT USE! My hair curled up like like gummy sprials and I am sitting here cutting them off right now. I didn&#x27;t see any warnings on the box for use on color treated hair so I gave it a shot. If you still insist on trying it, I recommend doing so on a tiny piece of hair first. Seriously, my hair gummed up and I am cutting it right now. BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I am Asian with black hair that&#x27;s never been dyed. I bought this from my local drugstore and I personally really like this product.  I want to start off by saying that I only wanted an ALL-OVER LIGHTENED EFFECT on my hair. I wasn&#x27;t looking to have hightlights, but I did see some people use this to create beautiful highlights and ombre effects. This product worked great for my purpose. I want to keep my Asian black hair, but sometimes, I really do feel like wanting brown hair. I know; how can you have both? Well, I would say this product gave me both!! My hair is still very black, but in the light, my hair turns brown! I think it looks especially nice in the sunlight, when the top of the head and strands on the side seem to look \\&quot;sunkissed\\&quot;.  What I do to achieve that is, instead of using a flat iron to go over sprayed strands (I really didn&#x27;t want to risk damaging/burning my hair), I spray this all over, after I wash and towel dry, and run it through my hair, while wearing the handy gloves that came with this. TIP: be careful when you spray close to the roots. I sprayed this onto my scalp several times and it STINGED quite a bit. But my hair was fine. Afterwards, I blow dry. I did this a couple of times (not in consecutive days though. Again, I was afraid to damage my hair) and I achieved the sunkissed glowing hair!  This is a great product for those who want to NATURALLY and SUBTLY LIGHTEN their hair, without having to dye it.</li>
            <li> This product should be removed from the shelves. It burnt parts of my daughters hair off and left a nasty looking bleach like stain on one side. Just as well I only applied it to three small areas, otherwise I&#x27;m sure she would have serious issues with her hair.  Her hair has never been colour treated so there is no excuse for the damage this caused. It also burnt my hand after a tiny drip fell onto me. I have been colouring my hair for years personally and professionally and never once has any product ever caused any reaction. Avoid this product!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. It didn&#x27;t burn off my hair or fry it like some of the other reviewers have experienced, but it definitely did not lighten my hair at all. I tried it on several different sections, followed the directions exactly, and got zero results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brunette start with , got this product from Walgreen to give it a try with  zero expectation in mind . Well it worked but very subtly . It took me TONS of spraying and resprying just like the instructions says . I end up with very subtil ..shy highlight .&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture on the box you will not get that results at all .&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed? Hardly because I had no expectation at all . The two stars are for the few highlights I had and the eas of use . That&#x27;s all really .&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is a match for a good old salon highlights .</li>
            <li> All this is is like taking hydrogen peroxide, saturating your hair and using a flat iron to burn it all off! This product burned my hair so badly I have to now get it cut!!!! Horrible and unsafe!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!! DON&#x27;T USE THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO FRY YOUR HAIR OFF AND BE BALD!! It lightens your hair but it also ruins your hair and makes it so damaged there is NO WAY to fix it. Should be discontinued or a warning label on it that says it makes all your hair break off!!!</li>
