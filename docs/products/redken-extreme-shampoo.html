            <li>When I look good, I feel good, so I won&#x27;t be using anything else.</li>
            <li>I also know that his recommended method of switching up your shampoo/conditioner is a good idea because it has worked on my hair and helped it</li>
            <li>shampoo/conditioner when using this line because it works so good and these 33 oz.</li>

            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and a good bit of it too.</li>
            <li>I buy it in the large size bottles like this because it is the best deal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large volume and the price is good!!</li>
            <li>Delivery was so quick, and this product smells so good!</li>
            <li>The conditioner was amazing, as soon as I put it in</li>
            <li>MY hair dresser recommended I use Redken, but the prices at the salon were astronomical, Amazon is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product works AMAZING for that.</li>
            <li>and we switched to Redken at that time and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Amazing shampoo set.</li>
            <li>However the stuff was AMAZING..</li>
            <li>I was expecting an amazing experience in the shower and after blow drying and styling my hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells just as awesome as the anti-snap and my stylist says my hair is so much healthier now.  </li>
            <li>but it also smells really nice</li>
            <li>NOw..when I received the Redken product the smell was nice in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It lathered so nicely</li>
            <li>Nice price.</li>
            <li>Priced Right and a very good product</li>
            <li>great deal will buy again, fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and conditioners and can honestly say these are the absolute best ever!</li>
            <li>The price was great as well and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I love it, fast shipping and excellent price</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this product and it&#x27;s wonderful - helps my naturally curly hair to curl again.  </li>
            <li>Kind of ok, doesn&#x27;t have desired effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best Redken product that I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>Good product and made a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this shampoo/conditioner is amazing, and not to mention it smells FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair in copious amounts.</li>
            <li>I love love love these!</li>
            <li>I got this from my hair stylist on his recommendation, and I liked how smooth and nice my hair looked.</li>
            <li>Not for fine hair!</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is good when you need a quick change of protein to your hair.</li>
            <li>It seems like the great results people get are from an unusually large proportion of the Sodium Laureth Sulfate because I&#x27;ve never had anything close to this problem</li>
            <li>it was a huge mistake!  </li>
            <li>but instead I think I am losing even more hair than before.  </li>
            <li>my hair become much more shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair feels and it does have seemed to help with the breakage of my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Always pleased with redken products.  </li>

            <li>This shampoo is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>you can be sure this is for you.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but I was better of just using my Kenra products.</li>
            <li>Love this set.</li>
            <li>most salons have these products and use them...</li>
            <li>have bought many things on Amazon and never returned anything.</li>
            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels better and better with every wash.</li>
            <li>This is the better product for damage hair</li>
            <li>Not the best quality, the only thing I can say is that the price is affordable for the name (Redkin) and quantity.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Great Price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love the product and what it does for my wifes hair.</li>
            <li>Will but again when i need some more</li>
            <li>Always leaves my hair silky smooth and luscious!  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my mother, it was way better than any we were using...</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just buy from a reputable salon from now on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this .</li>
            <li>So much better than the product I had been using for damaged hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks so healthy now.</li>
            <li>She tried everything and some products worked better than others.</li>

            <li>My hair seems to be growing better and stronger.</li>
            <li>I love the pump that is included in this 33.8 oz size.</li>
            <li>It is gently and smells great -</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years and</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried them all) at getting my hair smoother and shinier.  </li>
            <li>Many salons carry it too.</li>
            <li>Redken really does make great hair products.  </li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Must have love how it leaves my hair</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner and shampoo on a regular bases and it leaves my hair smelling, looking and feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love running my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see I could get them here.</li>
            <li>This one definitely smells the best (sweetest).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a magical anti-knot serum.</li>
            <li>I love the way it make your hair feels.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t honestly know if it&#x27;s authentic because I saw another user said that it wasn&#x27;t, but so far it works great for me.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE their shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li>Top of the line, in quality.</li>
            <li>Love how my comb glides through my hair after washing.</li>
            <li>My hair fell out MORE as well</li>
            <li>I have bought so many products that just don&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>
            <li>favorite shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>deff most resonable priced i have found for bottle size</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>a prettier, shinier and more manageable poof is better than the frizzy poof</li>
            <li>I feel like this shampoo and conditioner gave me 100 times more split ends.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT AND</li>
            <li>THE PRICE THRU AMAZON TOO :)</li>
            <li>However it has done pretty good with slowing the breakage</li>
            <li>THIS CONDITIONER IS THE PERFECT COCKTAIL AND LITERALLY SAVED MY LONG LOCKS...</li>
            <li>It does smell pretty good though.</li>
            <li>Redken products are definately worth the money!!</li>
            <li>last me honestly 9 months up to a year!!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair healthy, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>LET THE CONDITIONER SIT ON YOUR HAIR FOR A GOOD 5 TO 10 MIN TO REALLY HEAL AND FEEL HEALTHY</li>
            <li>Great product so far!</li>
            <li>Good stuff but not cheap - came with pumps so that was good!</li>
            <li>Fast and reliable shipping, good and accurate description, I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>(a store around town) has this for $5 more, but they were offering a buy 2 get 1 free..</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves my hair VERY hydrated for days.</li>
            <li>It really makes your hair feel good.  </li>
            <li>My shedding has reduced to half of the amount, and now to doesn&#x27;t get tangled in itself any more, which was a very pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t right for my hair, my mom really liked it</li>
            <li>it was easy to comb, it still shed however (see my Anti-Snap review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price for the larger 32oz bottles, make sure you order the pumps separately as they do not come with the set.</li>
            <li>I am happy to have been able to order it on Amazon, in the larger bottles, and save money in the process.  </li>
            <li>So I strongly, strongly recommend that you DO NOT use this on your hair.  </li>
            <li>and I did some decent research on what would be good on bleached hair.</li>
            <li>I thought highly suspicious because it smelled so good in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo hands down for damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>But everyone is different so best thing is to try first then buy...</li>
            <li>Even if you think you&#x27;re hair is taking these products fine</li>
            <li>This product has helped my hair out tremendously!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so strong and smooth and tangle-free.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t smell very pretty, I can deal :)</li>
            <li>was delivered next day and smells great</li>
            <li>As soon as I put the conditioner on, I can feel it get silky smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>And, trust me, I wasn&#x27;t using cheap shampoo before I started using Redken.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was melting my hair it because it was SO smooth</li>
            <li>I enjoy all of Redken&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a year since I&#x27;ve used this, so unless the product has changed this stuff is FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>The next time I will buy it through Amazon, this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, especially for hair that has gone through any treatments.</li>
            <li>A fantastic product, that prevents split ends.</li>
            <li>Same great quality.  </li>
            <li>This is far superior for me.</li>
            <li>They both smell so good and your hair feels so soft and shiny after using them.</li>
            <li>I combed my hair with the conditioner (after putting on a plastic bag and setting some hot rags on top for five minutes, to open up my hair shaft for the BEST results) in, it had so much slip</li>
            <li>WELL the case is that she asked me what did I do to my hair because it is super super healthy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very strong and too much usage could damage the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Point blank, this is great to add protein back to your hair, if you&#x27;re considering spending a good piece of change on hair care be sure to research the benefits of protein treatments and what exactly it does so</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Moisturizing without buildup, worked very well for me with colored and very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I thought for sure a nice salon brand such as this would help me out.</li>
            <li>Great fir dry damaged hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to argue with Redken&#x27;s quality--it&#x27;s just great!  </li>
            <li>so my hair had started to feel a bit better but was still really fried.</li>
            <li>Red ken is a really good product.</li>
            <li>Then, when I used the conditioner, I couldn&#x27;t want to see if the raves were true about how it feels like it \\&quot;melts your hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sooo many and organix morrocan and argan oil seemed to really be working</li>
            <li>Prior to this I used Pureology shampoo and conditioner which I loved</li>
            <li>After I first used this my hair felt noticeably softer the next morning, I love it!!</li>
            <li>It is the perfect product for fine, thin and permed hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser told me that it is nice for your hair to have a little mix when it comes to product lines, and honestly I know this to not be a sales tactic because I don&#x27;t even purchase my products from him</li>
            <li>What a tremendous line they offer.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look differently, actually looks more healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair just feels so smooth, soft, and more manageable today.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Today, my hair is still soft and actually feels more full, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have found in my lifetime and, believe me, I&#x27;ve been around for a lot of years buying very high quality, salon sold only, shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I love this product,  it leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>My hair was healthy before using this, and now it&#x27;s breaking more and looks very dry.</li>
            <li>It still is a good product, split ends are minimal.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot brag enough about this product!</li>
            <li>This is not only nice for my hair</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of thin and runny and my hair looks fairly frizzy after I use it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is not heavy, more soupy.</li>
            <li>My husband actually thought I had died it a darker color and said as nice as he could &amp;</li>
            <li>My hair is so healthy and soft as a result of using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft an healthy.</li>
            <li>I liked Expreme, but have recently switched to the Redken brand that doesn&#x27;t have sulfate.</li>
            <li>my&lt;br /&gt;hair is long and it keeps it in excellent shape even in our dry climate.</li>
            <li>but I think the extreme has a better smell and is a better damage controller.</li>
            <li>It really made a significant difference</li>
            <li>In general though, my hair looks great and my color is lasting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always constantly shedding and my hair always gets tangled in itself very easily.</li>
            <li>I have super blonde highlights and this product keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for sure, my hair certainly can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>The processing can tend to dry out the hair even more, and equally causes damage, but I have found that these products help maintain my long hair beautifully!</li>
            <li>I Love Redken Extreme!  Great for dry damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I pulled out large clumps of hair!  </li>
            <li>In the end it actually ends up being very cost effective.</li>
            <li>Too expensive and a pain in the butt if you have to continually be the one having to seek out the best deal once a month for your girlfriend because 50$ for shampoo just doesn&#x27;t seem right to you.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is very gentle and wont&#x27; strip the color.  </li>
            <li>Received this shipment very fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the other products from Redken but works really well.</li>
            <li>Thank u very much for the fast deliver!</li>
            <li>Do not buy from this seller, it is not the real stuff!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first wash.  </li>
            <li>This will be my first.</li>
            <li>Better than some shampoos and conditioners I have used, but not quite the same.  </li>
            <li>The bleach ruined my hair and after using this product, my hair instantly felt softer and had more body again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love redken but this specific type gave me dandruff.</li>
            <li>My hair was pretty damaged at the ends after coloring it</li>
            <li>It stopped her hair from falling out almost from the first time she used it.</li>
            <li>They make it so much easier!</li>
            <li>Excelent product and fast ship!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to people who want their hair to be healthy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Great for thick colored hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update next week when I see if it made a difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance when I straighten it. :)</li>
            <li>I most definitely will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>So, I have more volume than I&#x27;d like to have, but now it&#x27;s different than it was before--</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than the salon&#x27;s price!  </li>
            <li>The conditioner condition is the real star -- my hair is always super soft AND full of body.  </li>
            <li>I also reccomend getting the leave in serum, this combination left my hair super smooth and now straw feeling.</li>
            <li>If your hair is in need of repair, this is the combo to use instead of most products found in most large discount department stores, such as Wal-Mart and Target, because after trying those products, they simply do not work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of product the other reviewers that gave 5 stars got</li>
            <li>It keeps hair manageable, soft, shiny, and clean .</li>
            <li>These 33 oz bottles are the most economical way to buy the Redken Extreme shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time  and it&#x27;s much better than the products that I can find at the supermarket.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about it is that it does not weigh hair down at all...</li>
            <li>It is not thick enough to get the tangles out in the shower, so I have to combine it with a thicker, more hydrating conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It made my ends feel even more dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>So...if you suffer from KNOTS, this is a great product -- at least the conditioner is!</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing to me and when I opened the conditioner it had little to no smell.</li>
            <li>It instantly took what I thought was \\&quot;silky\\&quot; to the next level and my hair just felt amazing.</li>
            <li>Recommended by Shelley Corona, thanks.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very greasy</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>It worked really well for my bleached damaged hair though.</li>
            <li>After using these products i have not seen as much hair loss as I was experiencing before I highlighted my hair.  </li>
            <li>It really didn;t change anything.</li>
            <li>hers was much thicker.</li>
            <li>My hair is very repared since I am using this product.  </li>
            <li>I stopped losing so much hair when I showered using this product and it really made a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is great for unhealthy hair.</li>
            <li>It really will mend your hair if you need that.</li>
            <li>The product leaves my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>AND HOW MUCH YOU WASH YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li>but it works really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is real redken shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Tried this - but found it really stripped my color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>That said I have reason to believe it was not actually Redken and was a product that the seller filled the Redken bottles with.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I did some research and learned this gives your hair alot of protein which if too much, can make it feel brittle and break.</li>
            <li>There should be a warning not to use it too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>My local salon was doing a promo offering free haircuts for children, so I took the opportunity to ask an employee about anti-breakage shampoos.</li>
            <li>but as time went on I didn&#x27;t notice the difference as much anymore.</li>
            <li>It worked well on her colored treated hair, and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>For me, the one thing that I have found that really works on damaged hair are the</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using this set of Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, my hair looks and feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I also bought redken anti snap leave in treatment because like I said before, my hair is really really damaged.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner alot.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has helped so much with trying to grow my hair longer.</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t have to use as much (or as often)</li>
            <li>Since it was working so well, I decided to throw in the whole system and started using the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Is this the real product?</li>
            <li>this is the real McCoy..</li>
            <li>Things really went downhill from there.</li>
            <li>The smell at first is different but not bad, I like it now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty convinced there isn&#x27;t anything better for keeping my hair hydrated and oil production down.</li>
            <li>Every time I took a shower, there&#x27;d be a large clump of hair and a friend of mine was having the same problem, which was reduced significantly with anti-breakage products.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair that breaks easily</li>
            <li>I used it also with Redken Extreme Anti-Snap leave in, and WOW the results for me are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>and she said ultimately, it would be a good idea to speak with a doctor about it because it could indicate thyroid or other health problems.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with Redken Extreme Anti Snap and love how my hair feels.</li>
            <li>Works better than other products on my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells kinda like candy where most other shampoos tend to smell flowery.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for at least six years and it is hands down the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe the new protein formula just should not be used very often -- I&#x27;ve read that too much protein can damage your hair, and I wonder if that&#x27;s what happened to me.  </li>
            <li>It is soft, more manageable, it has volume, and the ends aren&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li>anytime I feel like my hair is super damaged, I use this and it instantly looks healthier, better than any other damage shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>and she was even surprised how well it really worked!</li>
            <li>IT MADE MY HAIR LESS HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>you should still throw in a deep conditioner (my fave is B&amp;B) just because it will more than likely improve your hair even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t take much to lather up, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost, especially for the results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But so far, for those who may wonder if it&#x27;s worth the high price (like me), so far, I would say YES.</li>
            <li>Not long after consistently using Redken Extreme products, I noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking to invest in a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone with damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Too high on the price</li>
            <li>and this shampoo in combination with the Redken Extreme conditioner and Anti-Snap Leave in Treatment make sure my treated hair is soft and has no breakage.</li>
            <li>although this isn&#x27;t great for me since my hair is so thick and poofy and I kind of like it being weighed down a little bit to control it.  </li>
            <li>Recommend by my stylist for my thin fine easy damaged hair.</li>
            <li>you consider your hair normal - this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I soon learned that my hair was still growing normally</li>
            <li>My hair is incredibly soft, still able to get some body(doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all), maintains the color well.  </li>
            <li>My hair fell out MORE, my hair was completely weighed down, lifeless, no body, AND after washing my hair I noticed that my hair never smelled as it did in the bottle, my hair just smelled like water.</li>
            <li>You spend about $40 for the small bottles in the salon alone so this price for two large bottles that will last me at the very least, two months is worth the price up front for a great product!</li>
            <li>but I would prefer something more natural and less drying.</li>
            <li>okay, my stylist does it for me…and my hair was starting to dry out from the highlights which I stopped (for now).</li>
            <li>I previously was using Pureology and was tired of paying $60 for (2) 8 oz bottles that lasted me a couple of months at best.</li>
            <li>The only other brand I&#x27;ve used in the last five years is Wen, which although good for your hair, would leave mine greasy by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I know $50 seems like an investment right now, but it will last you 9-12 months based on the length of your hair.  </li>
            <li>You can typically also get them refilled at a local beauty supply store (no you don&#x27;t usually need a license to enter the store) and they give you a pretty good discount, and you&#x27;re saving the environment by re-using your bottle!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried other Redken products and none are as good as Extreme!</li>
            <li>Got a new baby, full-time job, and am a part-time student.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell but still has a nice subtle scent to it.</li>
            <li>I really did major damages and this product saved me.</li>
            <li>I also have fine hair and this product did not appear to weigh it down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li>makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>It did not smell exactly like the same product bought from a salon.</li>
            <li>Well, last night I went to my stylist for the first time after using this Redken product and he asked me what I had been using on my hair.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra few bucks to ensure you&#x27;re getting GOOD, QUALITY products at your local discounted salon or Ulta.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has been fine as long as I only use it a couple times per week.  </li>
            <li>Started using Redken Extreme a few months ago, it is now the only shampoo and conditioner I will use, leaves your hair feeling very healthy!</li>
            <li>The extreme shampoo/conditioner is VERY SENSITIVE on my hair, yet it helps the natural and healthy balance come back to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had VERY damaged hair being bleached all the time and all with high and low lights every 8 to 10 weeks!</li>
            <li>We got it quick and was just as expected.</li>
            <li>Even though my hair is fairly dry and not greasy to begin with, I&#x27;d assume you&#x27;d fare better if your hair was very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>And my hair is normally thin, fine and curly and can&#x27;t take much abuse as it is so if it works for me, it can work for anyone!!</li>
            <li>My hair is stronger, shinier, healthier, and those little breakage frizzies are actually growing out and looking better.</li>
            <li>The bottles that I received were two different shades of blue and this kind of smells a little like blueberry or some type of berry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d steer clear of this if you have curly, dyed, or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>and there is a clear difference.  </li>
            <li>I had been buying it from ulta and will be going back to buy the real stuff again.</li>
            <li>This stuff has completely changed my hair.</li>
            <li>I was worried when I rinsed out the shampoo because my hair wasn&#x27;t soft and silky like</li>
            <li>I bleach my hair blonde very often and use heat styling products on my hair.</li>
            <li>but the conditioner is completely watery.</li>
            <li>and it is not heavy on your hair</li>
            <li>far as my experience goes with buying these on Amazon............</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get it this size near me.</li>
            <li>After using this product my hair has completely stopped breaking off and is now growing again.</li>
            <li>Kinda like a five year old.  </li>
            <li>p.s. salon quality shampoo and conditioner is not $ wasted on fancy labels.  </li>
            <li>#34;you need to go to a professional and have them re-do your hair color</li>
            <li>All of the shine in my hair was completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I am keeping my fingers crossed that with a few more weeks it will have the shine and gloss back without the need to go to a professional).</li>
            <li>THis stuff is complete GARBAGE.</li>
            <li>and I shouldn&#x27;t have fixed what ain&#x27;t broke as the old saying goes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always shiny and soft now, and</li>
            <li>It always leaves my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair is soft afterwards</li>
            <li>This stuff healed my hair and it&#x27;s soft and silky again.</li>
            <li>I used it almost every day for weeks -- because I wash my hair nearly every day.  </li>
            <li>Gives a good feel to hair but increased hair fall which could be due to change in shampoo and maybe not suitable for my condition (hair type and water quality in my area)</li>
            <li>I brought it to my local salon to compare with her redken extreme and sure enough</li>
            <li>I started using this because when we moved to a higher altitude my hair started to dry out and break.  </li>
            <li>The price is a little high for me, but it&#x27;s absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The price was a little high, but  was definitely worth to spend.</li>
            <li>wish I could recommend this product since it was very nice at first, but because of my unpleasant experience I&#x27;d advise you to be very careful before you buy this whole set.</li>
            <li>We live in a dry climate and these hair products really keep the hair under control.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair stylist recommended this shampoo because her hair was very damaged by her flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It really has helped my hair with less dryness and my hair is not falling out as much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Redken for about 2 years now, and notice a huge difference - my hair has less breakage and seems to be much thicker than when I used other shampoo and conditioner brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not back to normal yet though.  </li>
            <li>I have fine colored hair and this left my hair limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li>(this was free shipping keep in mind), Only thing she mentioned was she wished the price was a little cheaper,</li>
            <li>If your hair is already dry I would highly recommend putting some time in to hot oil and deep conditioning treatments to bring back the moisture in your hair before you start using these.</li>
            <li>I used the smaller bottles but after washing and conditioning my hair was like brand new by the time the bottles were through.  </li>
            <li>I recently went to a new hairdresser and she recommended some products in this line.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 4 and has very long, curly hair that gets very tangled with some shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really felt a difference in my dry, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It only damaged my hair further, and I even avoided using too much protein.</li>
            <li>I do think they helped a little more that other shampoo/conditioners I had tried at the time</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty dry, and this helped bring a lot of moisture back.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hoping that it would help keep my hair from being damaged so much since I wash my hair nearly every other day.</li>
            <li>it is very gentle on my hair, does not weigh it down and doesn not leave a waxy residue.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, they turn around and sell the expired product (hair products have a 4 month shelf life) to you, at what you think is an amazing deal however what you&#x27;re getting is a product that is useless AND DAMAGING to the customer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to start off by saying I am obsessed with finding amazing shampoos and conditioners for damaged hair, since,</li>
            <li>every I shower and comb it, with no rough handling mind you.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is straightened almost daily.  </li>
            <li>I will not revert back to my old ways.</li>
            <li>It actually made it feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, shoulder length hair and this product makes my hair feel soft easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I must admit I didn&#x27;t expect Redkin Extreme to really work</li>
            <li>I bought this because I read other reviews how this shampoo really seemed to help girls who had bleached their hair.</li>
            <li>But my stylist recomended a change after I use the whole supply due to the ingredients of this one.</li>
            <li>Redken Extreme helped me so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will admit that sometimes I will use Biolage Normalizing Shampoo as a clarifier and Redken All Soft Heavy Cream as a deep conditioner but both as pretty infrequent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to pay $275 last night repairing my hair with deep conditioning and different treatments along with my normal coloring process to CORRECT what this EXPIRED product has done to my hair.</li>
            <li>The texture of the shampoo is smooth and creamy white fluid, it took only the size of a dollar coin to cover my 6 - 7 inch hair; the conditioner is thick and rich and white as well and took even less (but I used extra just in case, I didn&#x27;t need too!).</li>
            <li>Your hair can be damaged and not dry.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product as I have long thick hair and a little of this</li>
            <li>( I expected the opposite because Suave is a MUCH cheaper store brand), this actually seems to strip my hair of everything</li>
            <li>The next day, I noticed that my hair was really greasy already, when I usually only have to wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li>My hair is usually naturally soft, but ever since i started using this product my hair has been dry, stringy and brittle.</li>
            <li>My hair has been really damaged due to coloring and flat iron use.</li>
            <li>I switched to the Extreme shampoo and conditioner because I use the extreme anti snap leave in product so much ( before I was using redken&#x27;s so soft shampoo and conditioner).  </li>
            <li>The entire line of products is very drying, but I have noticed less breakage since I started using it about three weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I like to try different high quality brands but always seem to gravitate back to Extreme.  </li>

            <li> I also know that his recommended method of switching up your shampoo/conditioner is a good idea because it has worked on my hair and helped it</li>
            <li> shampoo/conditioner when using this line because it works so good and these 33 oz.</li>

            <li> LOVE THE PAIR, MY HAIR FEELS GREAT</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell good or make my hair shine or even feel nice</li>

            <li> and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and a good bit of it too.</li>
            <li> I buy it in the large size bottles like this because it is the best deal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large volume and the price is good!!</li>
            <li> Delivery was so quick, and this product smells so good!</li>
            <li> The conditioner was amazing, as soon as I put it in</li>
            <li> MY hair dresser recommended I use Redken, but the prices at the salon were astronomical, Amazon is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product works AMAZING for that.</li>
            <li> and we switched to Redken at that time and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo set.</li>
            <li> However the stuff was AMAZING..</li>
            <li> I was expecting an amazing experience in the shower and after blow drying and styling my hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells just as awesome as the anti-snap and my stylist says my hair is so much healthier now.  </li>
            <li> but it also smells really nice</li>
            <li> NOw..when I received the Redken product the smell was nice in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It lathered so nicely</li>
            <li> Nice price.</li>
            <li> Priced Right and a very good product</li>
            <li> great deal will buy again, fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and conditioners and can honestly say these are the absolute best ever!</li>
            <li> The price was great as well and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I love it, fast shipping and excellent price</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product and it&#x27;s wonderful - helps my naturally curly hair to curl again.  </li>
            <li> Kind of ok, doesn&#x27;t have desired effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best Redken product that I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> Good product and made a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this shampoo/conditioner is amazing, and not to mention it smells FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair in copious amounts.</li>
            <li> I love love love these!</li>
            <li> I got this from my hair stylist on his recommendation, and I liked how smooth and nice my hair looked.</li>
            <li> Not for fine hair!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is good when you need a quick change of protein to your hair.</li>
            <li> It seems like the great results people get are from an unusually large proportion of the Sodium Laureth Sulfate because I&#x27;ve never had anything close to this problem</li>
            <li> it was a huge mistake!  </li>
            <li> but instead I think I am losing even more hair than before.  </li>
            <li> my hair become much more shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels and it does have seemed to help with the breakage of my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> Always pleased with redken products.  </li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> you can be sure this is for you.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but I was better of just using my Kenra products.</li>
            <li> Love this set.</li>
            <li> most salons have these products and use them...</li>
            <li> have bought many things on Amazon and never returned anything.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.</li>
            <li> and my hair feels better and better with every wash.</li>
            <li> This is the better product for damage hair</li>
            <li> Not the best quality, the only thing I can say is that the price is affordable for the name (Redkin) and quantity.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Great Price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the product and what it does for my wifes hair.</li>
            <li> Will but again when i need some more</li>
            <li> Always leaves my hair silky smooth and luscious!  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my mother, it was way better than any we were using...</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just buy from a reputable salon from now on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this .</li>
            <li> So much better than the product I had been using for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks so healthy now.</li>
            <li> She tried everything and some products worked better than others.</li>
            <li> love the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> great product at reasonable price</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be growing better and stronger.</li>
            <li> I love the pump that is included in this 33.8 oz size.</li>
            <li> It is gently and smells great -</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years and</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried them all) at getting my hair smoother and shinier.  </li>
            <li> Many salons carry it too.</li>
            <li> Redken really does make great hair products.  </li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Must have love how it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner and shampoo on a regular bases and it leaves my hair smelling, looking and feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love running my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see I could get them here.</li>
            <li> This one definitely smells the best (sweetest).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a magical anti-knot serum.</li>
            <li> I love the way it make your hair feels.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t honestly know if it&#x27;s authentic because I saw another user said that it wasn&#x27;t, but so far it works great for me.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE their shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li> Top of the line, in quality.</li>
            <li> Love how my comb glides through my hair after washing.</li>
            <li> My hair fell out MORE as well</li>
            <li> I have bought so many products that just don&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li> and I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> favorite shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> deff most resonable priced i have found for bottle size</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> a prettier, shinier and more manageable poof is better than the frizzy poof</li>
            <li> I feel like this shampoo and conditioner gave me 100 times more split ends.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT AND</li>
            <li> THE PRICE THRU AMAZON TOO :)</li>
            <li> However it has done pretty good with slowing the breakage</li>
            <li> THIS CONDITIONER IS THE PERFECT COCKTAIL AND LITERALLY SAVED MY LONG LOCKS...</li>
            <li> It does smell pretty good though.</li>
            <li> Redken products are definately worth the money!!</li>
            <li> last me honestly 9 months up to a year!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair healthy, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> LET THE CONDITIONER SIT ON YOUR HAIR FOR A GOOD 5 TO 10 MIN TO REALLY HEAL AND FEEL HEALTHY</li>
            <li> Great product so far!</li>
            <li> Good stuff but not cheap - came with pumps so that was good!</li>
            <li> Fast and reliable shipping, good and accurate description, I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> (a store around town) has this for $5 more, but they were offering a buy 2 get 1 free..</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my hair VERY hydrated for days.</li>
            <li> It really makes your hair feel good.  </li>
            <li> My shedding has reduced to half of the amount, and now to doesn&#x27;t get tangled in itself any more, which was a very pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t right for my hair, my mom really liked it</li>
            <li> it was easy to comb, it still shed however (see my Anti-Snap review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price for the larger 32oz bottles, make sure you order the pumps separately as they do not come with the set.</li>
            <li> I am happy to have been able to order it on Amazon, in the larger bottles, and save money in the process.  </li>
            <li> So I strongly, strongly recommend that you DO NOT use this on your hair.  </li>
            <li> and I did some decent research on what would be good on bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I thought highly suspicious because it smelled so good in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo hands down for damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> But everyone is different so best thing is to try first then buy...</li>
            <li> Even if you think you&#x27;re hair is taking these products fine</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hair out tremendously!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so strong and smooth and tangle-free.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t smell very pretty, I can deal :)</li>
            <li> was delivered next day and smells great</li>
            <li> As soon as I put the conditioner on, I can feel it get silky smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> And, trust me, I wasn&#x27;t using cheap shampoo before I started using Redken.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was melting my hair it because it was SO smooth</li>
            <li> I enjoy all of Redken&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a year since I&#x27;ve used this, so unless the product has changed this stuff is FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> The next time I will buy it through Amazon, this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, especially for hair that has gone through any treatments.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product, that prevents split ends.</li>
            <li> Same great quality.  </li>
            <li> This is far superior for me.</li>
            <li> They both smell so good and your hair feels so soft and shiny after using them.</li>
            <li> I combed my hair with the conditioner (after putting on a plastic bag and setting some hot rags on top for five minutes, to open up my hair shaft for the BEST results) in, it had so much slip</li>
            <li> WELL the case is that she asked me what did I do to my hair because it is super super healthy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very strong and too much usage could damage the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Point blank, this is great to add protein back to your hair, if you&#x27;re considering spending a good piece of change on hair care be sure to research the benefits of protein treatments and what exactly it does so</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing without buildup, worked very well for me with colored and very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought for sure a nice salon brand such as this would help me out.</li>
            <li> Great fir dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to argue with Redken&#x27;s quality--it&#x27;s just great!  </li>
            <li> so my hair had started to feel a bit better but was still really fried.</li>
            <li> Red ken is a really good product.</li>
            <li> Then, when I used the conditioner, I couldn&#x27;t want to see if the raves were true about how it feels like it \\&quot;melts your hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sooo many and organix morrocan and argan oil seemed to really be working</li>
            <li> Prior to this I used Pureology shampoo and conditioner which I loved</li>
            <li> After I first used this my hair felt noticeably softer the next morning, I love it!!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect product for fine, thin and permed hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me that it is nice for your hair to have a little mix when it comes to product lines, and honestly I know this to not be a sales tactic because I don&#x27;t even purchase my products from him</li>
            <li> What a tremendous line they offer.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look differently, actually looks more healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair just feels so smooth, soft, and more manageable today.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Today, my hair is still soft and actually feels more full, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have found in my lifetime and, believe me, I&#x27;ve been around for a lot of years buying very high quality, salon sold only, shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I love this product,  it leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> My hair was healthy before using this, and now it&#x27;s breaking more and looks very dry.</li>
            <li> It still is a good product, split ends are minimal.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot brag enough about this product!</li>
            <li> This is not only nice for my hair</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of thin and runny and my hair looks fairly frizzy after I use it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is not heavy, more soupy.</li>
            <li> My husband actually thought I had died it a darker color and said as nice as he could &amp;</li>
            <li> My hair is so healthy and soft as a result of using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft an healthy.</li>
            <li> I liked Expreme, but have recently switched to the Redken brand that doesn&#x27;t have sulfate.</li>
            <li> my&lt;br /&gt;hair is long and it keeps it in excellent shape even in our dry climate.</li>
            <li> but I think the extreme has a better smell and is a better damage controller.</li>
            <li> It really made a significant difference</li>
            <li> In general though, my hair looks great and my color is lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always constantly shedding and my hair always gets tangled in itself very easily.</li>
            <li> I have super blonde highlights and this product keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for sure, my hair certainly can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> The processing can tend to dry out the hair even more, and equally causes damage, but I have found that these products help maintain my long hair beautifully!</li>
            <li> I Love Redken Extreme!  Great for dry damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I pulled out large clumps of hair!  </li>
            <li> In the end it actually ends up being very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and a pain in the butt if you have to continually be the one having to seek out the best deal once a month for your girlfriend because 50$ for shampoo just doesn&#x27;t seem right to you.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is very gentle and wont&#x27; strip the color.  </li>
            <li> Received this shipment very fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the other products from Redken but works really well.</li>
            <li> Thank u very much for the fast deliver!</li>
            <li> Do not buy from this seller, it is not the real stuff!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first wash.  </li>
            <li> This will be my first.</li>
            <li> Better than some shampoos and conditioners I have used, but not quite the same.  </li>
            <li> The bleach ruined my hair and after using this product, my hair instantly felt softer and had more body again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love redken but this specific type gave me dandruff.</li>
            <li> My hair was pretty damaged at the ends after coloring it</li>
            <li> It stopped her hair from falling out almost from the first time she used it.</li>
            <li> They make it so much easier!</li>
            <li> Excelent product and fast ship!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to people who want their hair to be healthy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Great for thick colored hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update next week when I see if it made a difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance when I straighten it. :)</li>
            <li> I most definitely will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> So, I have more volume than I&#x27;d like to have, but now it&#x27;s different than it was before--</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the salon&#x27;s price!  </li>
            <li> The conditioner condition is the real star -- my hair is always super soft AND full of body.  </li>
            <li> I also reccomend getting the leave in serum, this combination left my hair super smooth and now straw feeling.</li>
            <li> If your hair is in need of repair, this is the combo to use instead of most products found in most large discount department stores, such as Wal-Mart and Target, because after trying those products, they simply do not work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of product the other reviewers that gave 5 stars got</li>
            <li> It keeps hair manageable, soft, shiny, and clean .</li>
            <li> These 33 oz bottles are the most economical way to buy the Redken Extreme shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time  and it&#x27;s much better than the products that I can find at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about it is that it does not weigh hair down at all...</li>
            <li> It is not thick enough to get the tangles out in the shower, so I have to combine it with a thicker, more hydrating conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It made my ends feel even more dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> So...if you suffer from KNOTS, this is a great product -- at least the conditioner is!</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing to me and when I opened the conditioner it had little to no smell.</li>
            <li> It instantly took what I thought was \\&quot;silky\\&quot; to the next level and my hair just felt amazing.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Shelley Corona, thanks.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very greasy</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> It worked really well for my bleached damaged hair though.</li>
            <li> After using these products i have not seen as much hair loss as I was experiencing before I highlighted my hair.  </li>
            <li> It really didn;t change anything.</li>
            <li> hers was much thicker.</li>
            <li> My hair is very repared since I am using this product.  </li>
            <li> I stopped losing so much hair when I showered using this product and it really made a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is great for unhealthy hair.</li>
            <li> It really will mend your hair if you need that.</li>
            <li> The product leaves my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> AND HOW MUCH YOU WASH YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> but it works really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is real redken shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Tried this - but found it really stripped my color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> That said I have reason to believe it was not actually Redken and was a product that the seller filled the Redken bottles with.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I did some research and learned this gives your hair alot of protein which if too much, can make it feel brittle and break.</li>
            <li> There should be a warning not to use it too much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> My local salon was doing a promo offering free haircuts for children, so I took the opportunity to ask an employee about anti-breakage shampoos.</li>
            <li> but as time went on I didn&#x27;t notice the difference as much anymore.</li>
            <li> It worked well on her colored treated hair, and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> For me, the one thing that I have found that really works on damaged hair are the</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this set of Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, my hair looks and feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I also bought redken anti snap leave in treatment because like I said before, my hair is really really damaged.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner alot.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has helped so much with trying to grow my hair longer.</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t have to use as much (or as often)</li>
            <li> Since it was working so well, I decided to throw in the whole system and started using the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Is this the real product?</li>
            <li> this is the real McCoy..</li>
            <li> Things really went downhill from there.</li>
            <li> The smell at first is different but not bad, I like it now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty convinced there isn&#x27;t anything better for keeping my hair hydrated and oil production down.</li>
            <li> Every time I took a shower, there&#x27;d be a large clump of hair and a friend of mine was having the same problem, which was reduced significantly with anti-breakage products.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair that breaks easily</li>
            <li> I used it also with Redken Extreme Anti-Snap leave in, and WOW the results for me are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> and she said ultimately, it would be a good idea to speak with a doctor about it because it could indicate thyroid or other health problems.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with Redken Extreme Anti Snap and love how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Works better than other products on my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda like candy where most other shampoos tend to smell flowery.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for at least six years and it is hands down the best I have found.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe the new protein formula just should not be used very often -- I&#x27;ve read that too much protein can damage your hair, and I wonder if that&#x27;s what happened to me.  </li>
            <li> It is soft, more manageable, it has volume, and the ends aren&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> anytime I feel like my hair is super damaged, I use this and it instantly looks healthier, better than any other damage shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> and she was even surprised how well it really worked!</li>
            <li> IT MADE MY HAIR LESS HEALTHY.</li>
            <li> you should still throw in a deep conditioner (my fave is B&amp;B) just because it will more than likely improve your hair even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t take much to lather up, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost, especially for the results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But so far, for those who may wonder if it&#x27;s worth the high price (like me), so far, I would say YES.</li>
            <li> Not long after consistently using Redken Extreme products, I noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking to invest in a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Too high on the price</li>
            <li> and this shampoo in combination with the Redken Extreme conditioner and Anti-Snap Leave in Treatment make sure my treated hair is soft and has no breakage.</li>
            <li> although this isn&#x27;t great for me since my hair is so thick and poofy and I kind of like it being weighed down a little bit to control it.  </li>
            <li> Recommend by my stylist for my thin fine easy damaged hair.</li>
            <li> you consider your hair normal - this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> I soon learned that my hair was still growing normally</li>
            <li> My hair is incredibly soft, still able to get some body(doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all), maintains the color well.  </li>
            <li> My hair fell out MORE, my hair was completely weighed down, lifeless, no body, AND after washing my hair I noticed that my hair never smelled as it did in the bottle, my hair just smelled like water.</li>
            <li> You spend about $40 for the small bottles in the salon alone so this price for two large bottles that will last me at the very least, two months is worth the price up front for a great product!</li>
            <li> but I would prefer something more natural and less drying.</li>
            <li> okay, my stylist does it for me…and my hair was starting to dry out from the highlights which I stopped (for now).</li>
            <li> I previously was using Pureology and was tired of paying $60 for (2) 8 oz bottles that lasted me a couple of months at best.</li>
            <li> The only other brand I&#x27;ve used in the last five years is Wen, which although good for your hair, would leave mine greasy by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I know $50 seems like an investment right now, but it will last you 9-12 months based on the length of your hair.  </li>
            <li> You can typically also get them refilled at a local beauty supply store (no you don&#x27;t usually need a license to enter the store) and they give you a pretty good discount, and you&#x27;re saving the environment by re-using your bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried other Redken products and none are as good as Extreme!</li>
            <li> Got a new baby, full-time job, and am a part-time student.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell but still has a nice subtle scent to it.</li>
            <li> I really did major damages and this product saved me.</li>
            <li> I also have fine hair and this product did not appear to weigh it down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> It did not smell exactly like the same product bought from a salon.</li>
            <li> Well, last night I went to my stylist for the first time after using this Redken product and he asked me what I had been using on my hair.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra few bucks to ensure you&#x27;re getting GOOD, QUALITY products at your local discounted salon or Ulta.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has been fine as long as I only use it a couple times per week.  </li>
            <li> Started using Redken Extreme a few months ago, it is now the only shampoo and conditioner I will use, leaves your hair feeling very healthy!</li>
            <li> The extreme shampoo/conditioner is VERY SENSITIVE on my hair, yet it helps the natural and healthy balance come back to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had VERY damaged hair being bleached all the time and all with high and low lights every 8 to 10 weeks!</li>
            <li> We got it quick and was just as expected.</li>
            <li> Even though my hair is fairly dry and not greasy to begin with, I&#x27;d assume you&#x27;d fare better if your hair was very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> And my hair is normally thin, fine and curly and can&#x27;t take much abuse as it is so if it works for me, it can work for anyone!!</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger, shinier, healthier, and those little breakage frizzies are actually growing out and looking better.</li>
            <li> The bottles that I received were two different shades of blue and this kind of smells a little like blueberry or some type of berry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d steer clear of this if you have curly, dyed, or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and there is a clear difference.  </li>
            <li> I had been buying it from ulta and will be going back to buy the real stuff again.</li>
            <li> This stuff has completely changed my hair.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I rinsed out the shampoo because my hair wasn&#x27;t soft and silky like</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair blonde very often and use heat styling products on my hair.</li>
            <li> but the conditioner is completely watery.</li>
            <li> and it is not heavy on your hair</li>
            <li> far as my experience goes with buying these on Amazon............</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it this size near me.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair has completely stopped breaking off and is now growing again.</li>
            <li> Kinda like a five year old.  </li>
            <li> p.s. salon quality shampoo and conditioner is not $ wasted on fancy labels.  </li>
            <li> #34;you need to go to a professional and have them re-do your hair color</li>
            <li> All of the shine in my hair was completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I am keeping my fingers crossed that with a few more weeks it will have the shine and gloss back without the need to go to a professional).</li>
            <li> THis stuff is complete GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> and I shouldn&#x27;t have fixed what ain&#x27;t broke as the old saying goes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always shiny and soft now, and</li>
            <li> It always leaves my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair is soft afterwards</li>
            <li> This stuff healed my hair and it&#x27;s soft and silky again.</li>
            <li> I used it almost every day for weeks -- because I wash my hair nearly every day.  </li>
            <li> Gives a good feel to hair but increased hair fall which could be due to change in shampoo and maybe not suitable for my condition (hair type and water quality in my area)</li>
            <li> I brought it to my local salon to compare with her redken extreme and sure enough</li>
            <li> I started using this because when we moved to a higher altitude my hair started to dry out and break.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little high for me, but it&#x27;s absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The price was a little high, but  was definitely worth to spend.</li>
            <li> wish I could recommend this product since it was very nice at first, but because of my unpleasant experience I&#x27;d advise you to be very careful before you buy this whole set.</li>
            <li> We live in a dry climate and these hair products really keep the hair under control.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair stylist recommended this shampoo because her hair was very damaged by her flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It really has helped my hair with less dryness and my hair is not falling out as much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Redken for about 2 years now, and notice a huge difference - my hair has less breakage and seems to be much thicker than when I used other shampoo and conditioner brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not back to normal yet though.  </li>
            <li> I have fine colored hair and this left my hair limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> (this was free shipping keep in mind), Only thing she mentioned was she wished the price was a little cheaper,</li>
            <li> If your hair is already dry I would highly recommend putting some time in to hot oil and deep conditioning treatments to bring back the moisture in your hair before you start using these.</li>
            <li> I used the smaller bottles but after washing and conditioning my hair was like brand new by the time the bottles were through.  </li>
            <li> I recently went to a new hairdresser and she recommended some products in this line.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4 and has very long, curly hair that gets very tangled with some shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t really felt a difference in my dry, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It only damaged my hair further, and I even avoided using too much protein.</li>
            <li> I do think they helped a little more that other shampoo/conditioners I had tried at the time</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty dry, and this helped bring a lot of moisture back.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping that it would help keep my hair from being damaged so much since I wash my hair nearly every other day.</li>
            <li> it is very gentle on my hair, does not weigh it down and doesn not leave a waxy residue.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, they turn around and sell the expired product (hair products have a 4 month shelf life) to you, at what you think is an amazing deal however what you&#x27;re getting is a product that is useless AND DAMAGING to the customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start off by saying I am obsessed with finding amazing shampoos and conditioners for damaged hair, since,</li>
            <li> every I shower and comb it, with no rough handling mind you.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is straightened almost daily.  </li>
            <li> I will not revert back to my old ways.</li>
            <li> It actually made it feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, shoulder length hair and this product makes my hair feel soft easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I must admit I didn&#x27;t expect Redkin Extreme to really work</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read other reviews how this shampoo really seemed to help girls who had bleached their hair.</li>
            <li> But my stylist recomended a change after I use the whole supply due to the ingredients of this one.</li>
            <li> Redken Extreme helped me so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will admit that sometimes I will use Biolage Normalizing Shampoo as a clarifier and Redken All Soft Heavy Cream as a deep conditioner but both as pretty infrequent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to pay $275 last night repairing my hair with deep conditioning and different treatments along with my normal coloring process to CORRECT what this EXPIRED product has done to my hair.</li>
            <li> The texture of the shampoo is smooth and creamy white fluid, it took only the size of a dollar coin to cover my 6 - 7 inch hair; the conditioner is thick and rich and white as well and took even less (but I used extra just in case, I didn&#x27;t need too!).</li>
            <li> Your hair can be damaged and not dry.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product as I have long thick hair and a little of this</li>
            <li> ( I expected the opposite because Suave is a MUCH cheaper store brand), this actually seems to strip my hair of everything</li>
            <li> The next day, I noticed that my hair was really greasy already, when I usually only have to wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually naturally soft, but ever since i started using this product my hair has been dry, stringy and brittle.</li>
            <li> My hair has been really damaged due to coloring and flat iron use.</li>
            <li> I switched to the Extreme shampoo and conditioner because I use the extreme anti snap leave in product so much ( before I was using redken&#x27;s so soft shampoo and conditioner).  </li>
            <li> The entire line of products is very drying, but I have noticed less breakage since I started using it about three weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I like to try different high quality brands but always seem to gravitate back to Extreme.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and less damaged using this!</li>
            <li> Extreme left it shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> With other shampoos, I usually end up with a head full of split ends about three months in, which drive me to the hairstylist for a cut.  </li>
            <li> I FOUND THE TRICK TO BUY THE REDKIN ALL SOFT SHAMPOO AND MIX IT WITH THIS REDKIN EXTREME CONDITIONER....</li>
            <li> If you have excessive hair breakage this product really works.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even have to use that much like usual.</li>
            <li> (they are much cheaper here online usually).  </li>
            <li> It did help my hair damage, but I have flat hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used these products for years with no issues, and would suggest for anyone who has curly hair that they flat iron!  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind, dry and damaged are not the same thing.</li>
            <li> I had my blonde hair dyed black, only to want to go back to blonde.  </li>
            <li> I use it every single day, and have for months now, and get the same results each day.</li>
            <li> I have thick, semi-damaged, black hair and my hair soaked it right up!</li>
            <li> So I purchased the Extreme line recently and just used the Shampoo+Conditioner last night.</li>
            <li> It was a little over my budget but within days my hair was soft and silky...</li>
            <li> Her hair was about 30 inches long.</li>
            <li> I recently lost over 50 pounds and my hair has become really brittle, thin and falls out from simply brushing it, running my fingers through it or just standing still.</li>
            <li> Second time I have ordered and delivered on time as expected.  </li>
            <li> goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Should I admit I haven&#x27;t cut my hair in that long either?</li>
            <li> It gets really dry and my ends are starting to look rough.</li>
            <li> In the future, I will probably stick to using the Redken Extreme CAT Reconstructing Treatment, which you rinse out.</li>
            <li> I began using Redken extreme shampoo, conditioner, the strengthening treatment and the leave-in-conditioner back in march.</li>
            <li> only due to the fact ULTA  </li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t find the Extreme in larger quantity containers anywhere in our town.</li>
            <li> It lasted a long time too!  </li>
            <li> not really allergic or sensitive to anything usually, so this was definitely a surprise.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair.</li>
            <li> After I use it, my hair is so tangled and dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair almost every day.</li>
            <li> you have dry hair - this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I also do not blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a shampoo that would work on my dry, color-treated hair and itching scalp and wouldn&#x27;t make my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely softer, and it&#x27;s shiney and seems stronger after just a few uses, especially when I add the anti-snap treatment after I wash it.  </li>
            <li> I want my thick soft hair back</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;re having issues with your hair being damaged, oily, frizzy, or just not feeling right try the Redken Extreme shampoo/conditioner!</li>
            <li> Using it every single day for a long time made my hair feel like mush when it was wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was old, or it had been diluted..... but</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I alternate every other wash with this and a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner because the redken extreme contains protein.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have damage/breakage you aren&#x27;t going to see any results beyond your hair drying out slightly and for obvious reasons you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smaller size shampoo and conditioner will run you almost $40, for half the amount of product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to wash it every single day!</li>
            <li> OH, another thing, I added a couple drops of rosemary essential oil to the shampoo and the leave in treatment, just because I wanna grow my hair a little longer.</li>
            <li> (It has been a week since I used the products, and my hair has a little bit of shine back in it.  </li>
            <li> and I have had major issues with my hair being so oily in the past</li>
            <li> The cheaper drug store brands ( Pantene, garnier, herbal essences) have are high in alcohol which is not good for our hair.</li>
            <li> The products somehow covered all of the natural highlights/low lights in my hair, making my hair look dull, drab and greasy.  </li>
            <li> the shampoo is real, but I think the conditioner i received is fake, it;s totally different (bottle, smell and result)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a big waste of your money.ir at night, how to brush and comb, ETC, If you don&#x27;t know how to use this product in conjunction with others</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a big waste of your money.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like that at all because my hair stayed greasy and smelled like a wet dog.</li>
            <li> As expected, thank you</li>
            <li> my cousin told me she spent $50 on her shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair or if it&#x27;s in rough shape this shampoo &amp; conditioner will help heal &amp; protect it.  </li>
            <li> Feel like I have to use it since I spent the money.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I know a few people said that the shampoo made their hair feel drier than expected--the opposite happened for me.</li>
            <li> Even after I applied shampoo a second time, it didn&#x27;t make it feel dried out as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> My mom also had this same problem with her hair when using this product a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected...  </li>
            <li> I have been searching my entire adult life for the secret to (</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and this shampoo and conditioner help cut down on frizz (though depending on the whether it is still a bit frizzy).</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and it usually takes a lot of care especially as I work as a dive guide and it gets battered by the salt water and sun everyday.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is especially thin and runny, even more so than the shampoo, which is strange.</li>
            <li> Even though it seems pricey, a little goes a long way, with both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This seller either refills bottles with other product or is selling extremely expired product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything extreme has occurred.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the other Redken conditioners as well, but none of them do as well as this one.</li>
            <li> color and highlight my hair every other month…</li>
            <li> all over my other stuff</li>
            <li> so my stylist suggested Redken Extreme.</li>
            <li> ask for a sample and take a small zip-lock with you to get one from an open container if they do not have samples.</li>
            <li> I also try to wash my hair every other or every two days.</li>
            <li> It was about seven months before I heard of Redkin Extreme</li>
            <li> A WEEK I WOULD USE THE EXTREME SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> I read about Redken Extreme on Amazon</li>
            <li> She used to have enough hair in the drain after each shower to make a small animal.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like the other</li>
            <li> no matter what other brands I try in between.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> and I never use any other brand, but Redken.</li>
            <li> Also, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this in ANY other size.  </li>
            <li> She said if it truly is a breakage problem, Redken Extreme would be her recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I purchased the Redken Extreme shampoo and conditioner a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone that has problems with hair loss and extreme dryed out ends</li>
            <li> I was hoping that, based on some other reviews, that would ease the hair loss but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have been using Redken Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner at the recommendation of my Hair Stylist.  </li>
            <li> So I was and condition with this redken extreme and</li>
            <li> With other products used,  I have seen a difference in my integrity of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I switch it up between Redken&#x27;s color extend and the extreme lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I have been using the extreme line for years</li>
            <li> Redken Extreme, I have used this for years and it is a life saver for colored hair.</li>
            <li> I went back and checked the drugstore shampoo I usually use, and found that it has both Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a little dry, but this shampoo and conditioner seems to be helping it become healthier.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair dull with a &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; feeling</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner cleans your hair without weighing it down at all.</li>
            <li> Every time I stop using Extreme because it&#x27;s a little bit pricier, I end up regretting it.</li>
            <li> Instead of helping, this stuff dried out my hair and made it extremely brittle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less hair falling out as well.</li>
            <li> The quality seems less compared to the bottles I bought before these ones.</li>
            <li> I used this because my hair was a mess.  </li>
            <li> A little less than a year ago I was on a bleaching spree.</li>
            <li> Now after 1 week she is down to a few strands.</li>
            <li> LITTLE</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my girl after doing a little searching online.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to detangle and I had a hard time getting a wide tooth comb through in the shower...</li>
            <li> ON WASTED PRODUCTS THAT DONT WORK</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel like I did not wash it - heavy.  </li>
            <li> When I use both shampoo and conditioner together my hair is so heavy that my styling falls out within an hour; even with hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, blonde hair, and as soon as I put this stuff in my hair in the shower</li>
            <li> I suggest using it for awhile and switching to a few times a week of using it after that.  </li>
            <li> Not to harsh on the hair.</li>
            <li> My only thought is that the other reviewers are reps for the company attempting to sell the product and bringing their rating up so that dumb suckers like me buy their EXPIRED product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is missing.</li>
            <li> (I also have heavy highlights, which I know doesn&#x27;t help things.)  </li>
            <li> I started using the anti-snap leave-in treatment a few months ago</li>
            <li> Just a few uses</li>
            <li> why, so it got pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of the Redkin shampoos and conditioners in the past few months.</li>
            <li> Two weeks ago I went to a hair salon I used to visit but got tired of the lady telling me all the time my hair was very damaged and was always offering me expensive treatments.</li>
            <li> This actually made my hair greasy and have an uncomfortable texture to it.</li>
            <li> Oh and needless to say winter means I could sell the electricity that my hair generates so finding a shampoo that has enough moisture without the weight</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at the Salon, and pay Salon prices.  </li>
            <li> I compared the small bottles to these</li>
            <li> I have no more breakage in my hair.</li>
            <li> I got a couple small bottles from the salon</li>
            <li> it always seems to get to about 2 inches past my shoulders and then starts breaking off.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviewers that this is not a good conditioner if you have curly hair that is prone to tangling.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say my hair was very dead</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expensive for minimal results.</li>
            <li> late (I&#x27;m 16)</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying it at least once.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer than ever before, and quite thick again.</li>
            <li> I have thick (and i mean THICK) hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out</li>
            <li> EXTREME SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER!!!!</li>
            <li> before this my hair was damaged, dry and frizzy and was even thinking of cutting my hair s few inches!</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, thick, and curly, but when I became ill, it thinned out, broke, lost its curl, and looked unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it took me a few weeks to realize what was happening, and</li>
            <li> I DID NOT want to buy it because it was so expensive compared to ordinary shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Redkin addicted womem</li>
            <li> I can not use permanent hair color because raising the cuticle makes my cotton ball even worse.</li>
            <li> seriously, what do I need to do people?!)</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and this stuff dried it out very badly!  </li>
            <li> Really, chemical shampoos in general are just awful, but these are the worst I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not only did this shampoo and conditioner remove all the body, and I mean all the body, from our hair, the smell was terrible and stayed in the hair for days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how something this expensive can make your hair feel worse, yet it does.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if the quality isn&#x27;t there, what is the point?</li>
            <li> I could not decide if I thought this product was fake or</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the straightening iron has caused some damage.</li>
            <li> It made me wonder if this was a fake.  </li>
            <li> WE KNOW OUR STYLIST FAILED TO SAY HOW DAMAGED OUR HAIR WOULD BE FROM PROCESSING AND BLEACHING THE HECK OUT OF IT.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> so I know it wasn&#x27;t a fake product.</li>
            <li> I had a really awful breakout on my forehead and hairline with painful red bumps</li>
            <li> I have to wash it with cold water or else it gets frizzy and breaks.</li>
            <li> my hair has shed like crazy</li>
            <li> , I thought she was crazy, but I truly see the value of it now.</li>
            <li> and it was breaking off like mad.</li>
            <li> This combination is very difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad breakage in my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife had a TON of hair breakage and it was bad for years.</li>
            <li> tangles were so bad</li>
            <li> and I was shocked to see someone else write this in another review.  </li>
            <li> I am hugely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me.</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it just isn&#x27;t suited for out hair types, or maybe it&#x27;s just crap.</li>
            <li> My stylist was appalled when she touched it, and immediately asked what conditioner I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hated this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I was miserable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Whatever the reason, my hair looks and feels awful now.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Recommended by Shelley Corona, thanks.</li>
            <li> was delivered next day and smells great</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very greasy</li>
            <li> I understand these products sell so inexpensively because they&#x27;re expired; however, I&#x27;ve had no issues with either the shampoo or conditioner and once I finally run out, will continue to purchase this product from this same company.  It was recommended to me by my stylist and thank God it was because it has worked beautifully!!  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple months ago, have been using it a couple times a week since. My hair was healthy before using this, and now it&#x27;s breaking more and looks very dry. I do not dye or style my hair. Do not buy from this seller, it is not the real stuff! I had been buying it from ulta and will be going back to buy the real stuff again. This seller either refills bottles with other product or is selling extremely expired product. Total bummer!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had over-bleached my hair and it was breaking off like mad. I used the anti-snap leave in afterward.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like these products were a bit drying. I do think they helped a little more that other shampoo/conditioners I had tried at the time but it&#x27;s expensive for minimal results. I did like the smell but I would prefer something more natural and less drying.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo in my holiday trip here in USA. In Germany it&#x27;s quit expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it will be good for my hair. I gonna try it when I&#x27;m back at home. Thank u very much for the fast deliver!</li>
            <li> Based on reviews I had read, I figured this shampoo/conditioner would help hear breakage but instead I think I am losing even more hair than before.  Plus, when I received the package, there was leakage from the bottles.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviewers that this is not a good conditioner if you have curly hair that is prone to tangling.  It is not thick enough to get the tangles out in the shower, so I have to combine it with a thicker, more hydrating conditioner.  The shampoo has been fine as long as I only use it a couple times per week.  The entire line of products is very drying, but I have noticed less breakage since I started using it about three weeks ago.  In the future, I will probably stick to using the Redken Extreme CAT Reconstructing Treatment, which you rinse out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the only set that has actually made a difference on my hair. I have very fine, thin hair that breaks easily and I can&#x27;t even do things like towel-dry it without it breaking. I have to wash it with cold water or else it gets frizzy and breaks. Using these products, my hair is the shiniest and healthiest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> Terrible shampoo. It only damaged my hair further, and I even avoided using too much protein. Really, chemical shampoos in general are just awful, but these are the worst I&#x27;ve used. However, they did inspire me to go no-shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner - great smell and good price</li>
            <li> it really works. my hair become much more shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels and it does have seemed to help with the breakage of my hair. Since in the winter all I do is straighten my hair it ends up breaking off. I have definitely noticed a difference and I may be using this shampoo and conditioner all year now. The price was great as well and shipping was quick. At Ulta or another store these are each $35 a piece. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> A good brand of shampoo</li>
            <li> This is a great buy.  Been looking everywhere for the big liter bottles.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will buy again. Smells good and leaves my hair VERY hydrated for days.</li>
            <li> love this product. it is very gentle on my hair, does not weigh it down and doesn not leave a waxy residue.</li>
            <li> Always pleased with redken products.  I can&#x27;t say anything extreme has occurred.  Going through mid life and losing hair rapidly.  This product isn&#x27;t changing the hair loss.  It still is a good product, split ends are minimal.</li>
            <li> This stuff has completely changed my hair. As soon as I put the conditioner on, I can feel it get silky smooth and tangle free. I can&#x27;t go without it now! My hair is colored and it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the color either. I have tried the other Redken conditioners as well, but none of them do as well as this one. I use it every single day, and have for months now, and get the same results each day. My hair is stronger, shinier, healthier, and those little breakage frizzies are actually growing out and looking better. I honestly cannot brag enough about this product! The price is a little high for me, but it&#x27;s absolutely worth every penny. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and this shampoo and conditioner help cut down on frizz (though depending on the whether it is still a bit frizzy). I use it in conjunction with Redken Extreme Anti Snap and love how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Started using Redken Extreme a few months ago, it is now the only shampoo and conditioner I will use, leaves your hair feeling very healthy!</li>
            <li> Love Redken!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I color and highlight my hair every other month…okay, my stylist does it for me…and my hair was starting to dry out from the highlights which I stopped (for now). My stylist recommended Redken anti-snap leave in conditioner and I loved the smell so I thought I&#x27;d try the shampoo and conditioner. It smells just as awesome as the anti-snap and my stylist says my hair is so much healthier now.  And, trust me, I wasn&#x27;t using cheap shampoo before I started using Redken. So maybe next time I go to the hairdresser, I&#x27;ll get my highlights again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic!  Moisturizing without buildup, worked very well for me with colored and very fine hair.  My hair is incredibly soft, still able to get some body(doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all), maintains the color well.  Even though it seems pricey, a little goes a long way, with both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but my conditioner exploded in the box....all over my other stuff</li>
            <li> Love this product. Recommend by my stylist for my thin fine easy damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I love it. The smell at first is different but not bad, I like it now, I want to eat it actually. The texture of the shampoo is smooth and creamy white fluid, it took only the size of a dollar coin to cover my 6 - 7 inch hair; the conditioner is thick and rich and white as well and took even less (but I used extra just in case, I didn&#x27;t need too!). My hair has been chemically processed as a child, unfortunately it&#x27;s this way not because of improper application of relaxers but more because I didn&#x27;t know how to maintain it. I.E, using protein treatments in between relaxers, satin caps to protect hair from pillows, brushing from the ends to roots, ETC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of late (I&#x27;m 16) my hair has shed like crazy every I shower and comb it, with no rough handling mind you. I was worried when I rinsed out the shampoo because my hair wasn&#x27;t soft and silky like Suave Professionals Humectant left it ( I expected the opposite because Suave is a MUCH cheaper store brand), this actually seems to strip my hair of everything but I had to remember I didn&#x27;t have any moisture in my hair at the time of washing and this is NOT a moisturizer. This adds the protein chemical treatments suck out of your hair. The conditioner was amazing, as soon as I put it in I thought maybe it was melting my hair it because it was SO smooth (that&#x27;s a good thing!) where as before it felt sticky (like hotel shampoos make your hair). I combed my hair with the conditioner (after putting on a plastic bag and setting some hot rags on top for five minutes, to open up my hair shaft for the BEST results) in, it had so much slip it was easy to comb, it still shed however (see my Anti-Snap review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point blank, this is great to add protein back to your hair, if you&#x27;re considering spending a good piece of change on hair care be sure to research the benefits of protein treatments and what exactly it does so you can be sure this is for you. And also PLEASE put in the time to research how to care for your hair at night, how to brush and comb, ETC, If you don&#x27;t know how to use this product in conjunction with others it&#x27;s a big waste of your money.ir at night, how to brush and comb, ETC, If you don&#x27;t know how to use this product in conjunction with others it&#x27;s a big waste of your money.</li>
            <li> This is not only nice for my hair but it also smells really nice and I love it!  I enjoy all of Redken&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> These 33 oz bottles are the most economical way to buy the Redken Extreme shampoo and conditioner.  I have definitely noticed my hair being a lot stronger and thicker since using them.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair stylist recommended this shampoo because her hair was very damaged by her flat iron.  I DID NOT want to buy it because it was so expensive compared to ordinary shampoos.  I have to say I am very impressed at how repaired her hair is after two months of using this shampoo.  It really made a significant difference and I would  definitely recommend this shampoo to those trying to repair damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in a deployed location and we are literally bathing in chlorine. I purchased this hoping that it would help keep my hair from being damaged so much since I wash my hair nearly every other day. Bottom line it did okay but I was better of just using my Kenra products. However it has done pretty good with slowing the breakage it just didn&#x27;t leave my hair as moisturized as I would&#x27;ve hoped.</li>
            <li> I am 5 washes in and I am very impressed.  I noticed a difference after the first wash.  My hair was so soft and shiny!  I no longer felt the dryness that I was experiencing from curling/straightening my hair daily.  I also have fine hair and this product did not appear to weigh it down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this set. I bought it like a year ago for cheaper though. It&#x27;s nearly the same price as buying it in the store though now, so there&#x27;s really no point in buying it online unless you can&#x27;t find it at a beauty supply shop in an area around you. It worked really well for my bleached damaged hair though. I also reccomend getting the leave in serum, this combination left my hair super smooth and now straw feeling.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. I have blonde hair and it usually takes a lot of care especially as I work as a dive guide and it gets battered by the salt water and sun everyday. I&#x27;ve even tried other Redken products and none are as good as Extreme! I also use the treatments in this range which are great.</li>
            <li> I have used Redken for years. Its great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to argue with Redken&#x27;s quality--it&#x27;s just great!  If your hair is in need of repair, this is the combo to use instead of most products found in most large discount department stores, such as Wal-Mart and Target, because after trying those products, they simply do not work.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hair out tremendously! I fried my hair so my stylist suggested Redken Extreme. Although it doesn&#x27;t smell very pretty, I can deal :)</li>
            <li> Awesome! Product as described and shipped without damage!</li>
            <li> Works better than other products on my hair. But everyone is different so best thing is to try first then buy...most salons have these products and use them...ask for a sample and take a small zip-lock with you to get one from an open container if they do not have samples.</li>
            <li> Every time I stop using Extreme because it&#x27;s a little bit pricier, I end up regretting it. It makes my hair so strong and smooth and tangle-free. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I began using Redken extreme shampoo, conditioner, the strengthening treatment and the leave-in-conditioner back in march. My hairdresser recommended it because I had just gotten highlights. I have long, thin, straight hair. After using these products i have not seen as much hair loss as I was experiencing before I highlighted my hair.  Two weeks ago I went to a hair salon I used to visit but got tired of the lady telling me all the time my hair was very damaged and was always offering me expensive treatments. WELL the case is that she asked me what did I do to my hair because it is super super healthy. I know these products are working. OH, another thing, I added a couple drops of rosemary essential oil to the shampoo and the leave in treatment, just because I wanna grow my hair a little longer.</li>
            <li> The guy who cuts my hair recommended this product and it is excellent.  I can tell it must be good because my wife is using it too!</li>
            <li> This actually made my hair greasy and have an uncomfortable texture to it. Don&#x27;t know what it was, but I didn&#x27;t like it. My friends tried it and the same thing happened to them.</li>
            <li> Not only did this shampoo and conditioner remove all the body, and I mean all the body, from our hair, the smell was terrible and stayed in the hair for days. That&#x27;s all we smelled even after washing it with another product. Pillow cases were saturated with the smell. I don&#x27;t want to smell a product in my hair, or anyone else&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought many things on Amazon and never returned anything. This will be my first.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair. I thought for sure a nice salon brand such as this would help me out. It really didn;t change anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a year since I&#x27;ve used this, so unless the product has changed this stuff is FANTASTIC and I just recently bought it again today after damaging my hair- yet again!  If you over processed your hair with chemicals in any way (dying, bleaching, perming, etc.) I highly recommend this product.  I used the smaller bottles but after washing and conditioning my hair was like brand new by the time the bottles were through.  I used it also with Redken Extreme Anti-Snap leave in, and WOW the results for me are truly amazing.  And my hair is normally thin, fine and curly and can&#x27;t take much abuse as it is so if it works for me, it can work for anyone!!</li>
            <li> I Love this product. My hair is stronger and heathier and has changed the way I feel about my hair.</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair blonde very often and use heat styling products on my hair. Let&#x27;s just say my hair was very dead and I didn&#x27;t want to cut it. This shampoo and conditioner has changed my life. I alternate every other wash with this and a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner because the redken extreme contains protein. If you use too much it will destroy your hair. I also try to wash my hair every other or every two days. Definitely a must for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Well the shampoo seems alright but the conditioner is completely watery. I brought it to my local salon to compare with her redken extreme and sure enough hers was much thicker. BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> A little less than a year ago I was on a bleaching spree. My hair was so fried to the point where pieces of my hair would flake off if the slightest wind blew. It was about seven months before I heard of Redkin Extreme so my hair had started to feel a bit better but was still really fried. I must admit I didn&#x27;t expect Redkin Extreme to really work but it does! It doesn&#x27;t show immediate results but I have been using this for a month now and my hair feels better and better with every wash.</li>
            <li> My hair is very repared since I am using this product.  I recomend 100% this product.  This is the better product for damage hair</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this shampoo, it&#x27;s kind of thin and runny and my hair looks fairly frizzy after I use it. The conditioner is especially thin and runny, even more so than the shampoo, which is strange. The bottles that I received were two different shades of blue and this kind of smells a little like blueberry or some type of berry. I&#x27;d steer clear of this if you have curly, dyed, or frizzy hair. Not the best quality, the only thing I can say is that the price is affordable for the name (Redkin) and quantity. Unfortunately, if the quality isn&#x27;t there, what is the point?</li>
            <li> I used this because my hair was a mess.  It is wonderful!  It detangles great and smells great.  I stopped losing so much hair when I showered using this product and it really made a difference in my hair.  The next time my hair needs extra help, I am definitely using it again</li>
            <li> I have really bad breakage in my hair. MY hair dresser recommended I use Redken, but the prices at the salon were astronomical, Amazon is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Foes a good job and it is not heavy on your hair&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> I Love Redken Extreme!  Great for dry damaged hair.  I&#x27;ve been using Redken for about 2 years now, and notice a huge difference - my hair has less breakage and seems to be much thicker than when I used other shampoo and conditioner brands.</li>
            <li> I could not decide if I thought this product was fake or not so I decided to return it. It did not smell exactly like the same product bought from a salon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how something this expensive can make your hair feel worse, yet it does.  After I use it, my hair is so tangled and dry I can&#x27;t get a comb through it.  Going back to Pantene.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but not cheap - came with pumps so that was good!</li>
            <li> This is great for unhealthy hair. It doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out. Your hair will keep getting healthier the longer that you use this. I tried the wen stuff but I didn&#x27;t like that at all because my hair stayed greasy and smelled like a wet dog. This is far superior for me. It really will mend your hair if you need that. I would recommend trying it at least once.</li>
            <li> Fast and reliable shipping, good and accurate description, I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  I have naturally curly hair that is straightened almost daily.  Needless to say, the straightening iron has caused some damage. Definitely improved the texture of my hair and it is on the road to recovery.  Smells great as well!</li>
            <li> These products do not seem like the ones I have bought from my salon.  Better than some shampoos and conditioners I have used, but not quite the same.  It made me wonder if this was a fake.  The product was delivered on time and in good shape.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels and looks great. The product leaves my hair very shiny. My hair is naturally a little dry, but this shampoo and conditioner seems to be helping it become healthier.</li>
            <li> We got it quick and was just as expected. I have been using Redkin for a while and think they offer the best price here.</li>
            <li> MY DAMAGED HAIR IS FINALLY SAVED FROM THIS!!! SO WE ALL KNOW THE OMBRE WAS A TOTAL HIT.. LITTLE DID WE KNOW OUR STYLIST FAILED TO SAY HOW DAMAGED OUR HAIR WOULD BE FROM PROCESSING AND BLEACHING THE HECK OUT OF IT. AFTER A MILLION PRODUCTS AND LIKE 200 JUST FOR MY HAIR TO BE COLOR AND DAMAGED AND ANOTHER 200 ON WASTED PRODUCTS THAT DONT WORK.. I FINALLY FOUND A SOLUTION!!! EXTREME SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER!!!! THIS IS A MUST HAVE TO SAVE ANY DAMAGED HAIR. I FOUND THE TRICK TO BUY THE REDKIN ALL SOFT SHAMPOO AND MIX IT WITH THIS REDKIN EXTREME CONDITIONER.... ONE A WEEK I WOULD USE THE EXTREME SHAMPOO BUT THE ALL SOF AND THIS CONDITIONER IS THE PERFECT COCKTAIL AND LITERALLY SAVED MY LONG LOCKS... NEVER WILL I DO OMBRE AND ALWAYS WILL I PURCHASE REDKIN!! THIS SELLER HAS GREAT PRICES TOO AND THAT WAS A PLUS- THE BOTTLES LAST FOR ABOUT 3-4 MONTHS DEPENDING ON USAGE AND HOW MUCH YOU WASH YOUR HAIR. LET THE CONDITIONER SIT ON YOUR HAIR FOR A GOOD 5 TO 10 MIN TO REALLY HEAL AND FEEL HEALTHY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and conditioners and can honestly say these are the absolute best ever! Worth every penny. Great scent and leaves hair in great condition.</li>
            <li> Great Price and fast shipping. Love the product and what it does for my wifes hair. Will but again when i need some more</li>
            <li> Red ken is a really good product. Expensive but it works really well. This is the second time I use it and I am planning on continuing using this brand</li>
            <li> Always leaves my hair silky smooth and luscious!  I have used these products for years with no issues, and would suggest for anyone who has curly hair that they flat iron!  The processing can tend to dry out the hair even more, and equally causes damage, but I have found that these products help maintain my long hair beautifully!</li>
            <li> I had my blonde hair dyed black, only to want to go back to blonde.  My stylist recommended this product and it&#x27;s wonderful - helps my naturally curly hair to curl again.  I would recommend to anyone who lightens their hair.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mother, it was way better than any we were using...</li>
            <li> loved it both products are great i will definitely be reordering this once it is done and it lasts for awhile too!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t right for my hair, my mom really liked it so I gave it to her. It didn&#x27;t smell good or make my hair shine or even feel nice but hey everybody has different ph. My hairdresser has it at the shop so i wanted to try it</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever!  Great price for the larger 32oz bottles, make sure you order the pumps separately as they do not come with the set.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair almost every day. It gets really dry and my ends are starting to look rough. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months now and I LOVE IT. It&#x27;s worth every penny. My hair feels like silk every time I use it. I&#x27;ve noticed less hair falling out as well. I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking to invest in a high quality product. They come in big bottles, too.</li>
            <li> Kind of ok, doesn&#x27;t have desired effect. Gives a good feel to hair but increased hair fall which could be due to change in shampoo and maybe not suitable for my condition (hair type and water quality in my area)</li>
            <li> I love this Redken products, this product is great. It&#x27;s very good for colored treated hair!! Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I see a lot of reviews from people who obviously don&#x27;t understand what a protein treatment is and who it&#x27;s used for, then blame the product when it doesn&#x27;t turn out the way they expected.&lt;br /&gt;This is a shampoo/conditioner that&#x27;s fortified with PROTEIN. This isn&#x27;t for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry hair - this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have chemical or heat related damage - this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you consider your hair normal - this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protein treatments are meant to repair damage. This product works AMAZING for that. The problem is protein treatments are also drying. If your hair is already dry I would highly recommend putting some time in to hot oil and deep conditioning treatments to bring back the moisture in your hair before you start using these. Keep in mind, dry and damaged are not the same thing. Your hair can be damaged and not dry. If you don&#x27;t have damage/breakage you aren&#x27;t going to see any results beyond your hair drying out slightly and for obvious reasons you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend every three washes using a deep conditioner instead of these products. If your hair can handle solely using these products great, but most peoples can&#x27;t. Even if you think you&#x27;re hair is taking these products fine you should still throw in a deep conditioner (my fave is B&amp;B) just because it will more than likely improve your hair even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as my experience goes with buying these on Amazon............ I won&#x27;t do it again. This product smells amazing to me and when I opened the conditioner it had little to no smell. I&#x27;m not sure if it was old, or it had been diluted..... but either way I&#x27;m not taking any chances. I&#x27;ll just buy from a reputable salon from now on.</li>
            <li> Takes away just enough oil/dirt. Conditioner is not heavy, more soupy.</li>
            <li> We live in a dry climate and these hair products really keep the hair under control. AntiSnap is the best.</li>
            <li> As expected, thank you</li>
            <li> Needed some help for my damaged hair. Redken comes to the rescue again. What a tremendous line they offer. I would highly recommend this for anyone with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Came within the allotted time frame</li>
            <li> Redken products are the best on the planet . It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this . They are for all hair types and these products do what they say they do . Hands down the best.</li>
            <li> So much better than the product I had been using for damaged hair. My hair feels and looks so healthy now. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> My wife had a TON of hair breakage and it was bad for years. She tried everything and some products worked better than others. I read about Redken Extreme on Amazon and I bought it locally. The next time I will buy it through Amazon, this stuff works great. She used to have enough hair in the drain after each shower to make a small animal. Now after 1 week she is down to a few strands. She is also using the Redken Anti-snap leave in conditioner for about 2 weeks. I am very happy because we don&#x27;t have hair everywhere. Her hair was about 30 inches long. She had it cut shoulder length and we switched to Redken at that time and the results are amazing. Amazing shampoo and conditioner. If you have excessive hair breakage this product really works.</li>
            <li> Great product. I wish it was cheaper but it does get the job done. Do recommend it if you are looking for a product to protect your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for at least six years and it is hands down the best I have found.  The shampoo cleans without overdrying but still manages to get rid of all the styling product in my hair.  The conditioner condition is the real star -- my hair is always super soft AND full of body.  This combination is very difficult to find.  I was one of those people who switched shampoos and conditioner every time when I finished a bottle, but not anymore once I found tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that sometimes I will use Biolage Normalizing Shampoo as a clarifier and Redken All Soft Heavy Cream as a deep conditioner but both as pretty infrequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the space, Ulta sells these liter bottles twice a year for $16-20 each.</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago when I bleached my hair and dyed it blue a lot. The bleach ruined my hair and after using this product, my hair instantly felt softer and had more body again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was in 2009/2010. I stopped using it and went back to Pantene because it was cheaper.  it was a huge mistake!  I recently lost over 50 pounds and my hair has become really brittle, thin and falls out from simply brushing it, running my fingers through it or just standing still. I want my thick soft hair back and this is the way to do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken is my to to product and I will online to use it from here on out.  I will not revert back to my old ways. My hair is worth the extra money.  Though this is the best value I have seen.  You spend about $40 for the small bottles in the salon alone so this price for two large bottles that will last me at the very least, two months is worth the price up front for a great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is real redken shampoo.  The quality seems less compared to the bottles I bought before these ones.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  No film, does not coat hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Tried this - but found it really stripped my color-treated hair. Not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> love the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, especially for hair that has gone through any treatments. I have my hair straightened at a salon every 9 months or so and this shampoo in combination with the Redken Extreme conditioner and Anti-Snap Leave in Treatment make sure my treated hair is soft and has no breakage.</li>
            <li> Second time I have ordered and delivered on time as expected.  Great!</li>
            <li> The best.  Can&#x27;t get it this size near me.</li>
            <li> I love redken but this specific type gave me dandruff.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and a pain in the butt if you have to continually be the one having to seek out the best deal once a month for your girlfriend because 50$ for shampoo just doesn&#x27;t seem right to you.  F Redkin, I&#x27;m all about Whitkin and Kickin without getting Hittin on my my livin damn Redkin addicted womem</li>
            <li> great product at reasonable price</li>
            <li> the shampoo is real, but I think the conditioner i received is fake, it;s totally different (bottle, smell and result) then before and it doesn&#x27;t do the same as it did before</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell but still has a nice subtle scent to it. I am very pleased with this product as I have long thick hair and a little of this goes a long way. After I first used this my hair felt noticeably softer the next morning, I love it!!</li>
            <li> I hated this product. I purchased this product 2 months ago. It ruined my hair. I had a dandruff problem now&lt;br /&gt;The seller either sold an expired product or something else in a redken bottle</li>
            <li> My hair got so fried when I decided to add color to it.  I really did major damages and this product saved me.</li>
            <li> Priced Right and a very good product</li>
            <li> I purchased this from this seller and have purchased it prior so I know what it is supposed to be like. That said I have reason to believe it was not actually Redken and was a product that the seller filled the Redken bottles with. It does not smell like the other Redken I bought of the same variety and does not feel the same on my hair or my wifes. Overall, I would not buy anything from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I feel like a received another expired redkin product from an iffy vendor. Didn&#x27;t really work. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love it. My hair seems to be growing better and stronger.</li>
            <li> This is come really good stuff, but when i received it, it had 2 conditioners not a shampoo and conditioner like it said. it will get used just wanted a shampoo also.</li>
            <li> Too high on the price</li>
            <li> Great product lasted a good while. Would recommed</li>
            <li> Great products, good seller.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product, that prevents split ends. With other shampoos, I usually end up with a head full of split ends about three months in, which drive me to the hairstylist for a cut.  I&#x27;m made it over a year now without any issues. Should I admit I haven&#x27;t cut my hair in that long either? Got a new baby, full-time job, and am a part-time student. This product sure is handy!</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this brand shampoo no matter what other brands I try in between. I&#x27;m pretty convinced there isn&#x27;t anything better for keeping my hair hydrated and oil production down. I love the pump that is included in this 33.8 oz size.</li>
            <li> My hair was pretty damaged at the ends after coloring it and I was hoping this product would help. NOT AT ALL. It made my ends feel even more dry and brittle. I started using garnier and that made it feel softer than this much more expensive product. I did some research and learned this gives your hair alot of protein which if too much, can make it feel brittle and break. There should be a warning not to use it too much.</li>
            <li> This cost a lot of money, and it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I don&#x27;t really like the smell and I haven&#x27;t really felt a difference in my dry, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> does not leave a film in your hair.  It is gently and smells great - I have used it for many years and my&lt;br /&gt;hair is long and it keeps it in excellent shape even in our dry climate.</li>
            <li> My hair seemed like it had stopped growing and I tried just about every product to try and fix it. I soon learned that my hair was still growing normally it was just my ends that we&#x27;re breaking off. After using this product my hair has completely stopped breaking off and is now growing again. Best shampoo and conditioner ever!!</li>
            <li> I have super blonde highlights and this product keeps my hair healthy. Use anti-snap too.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair in copious amounts. Kinda like a five year old.  I can not use permanent hair color because raising the cuticle makes my cotton ball even worse. So I use semi-permanent.  This shampoo is very gentle and wont&#x27; strip the color.  Works better than anything else I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried them all) at getting my hair smoother and shinier.  Oh and needless to say winter means I could sell the electricity that my hair generates so finding a shampoo that has enough moisture without the weight is paramount.</li>
            <li> love it great product!! great seller !!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have found in my lifetime and, believe me, I&#x27;ve been around for a lot of years buying very high quality, salon sold only, shampoos.  Very, very happy with these products.  I buy it in the large size bottles like this because it is the best deal.  You can try it in smaller sizes if you&#x27;d like to just check it out for yourself.  Many salons carry it too. It really makes your hair feel good.  Great smell and all that too. Redken really does make great hair products.  I only discovered Redken for myself about a year ago.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my girl after doing a little searching online. Works extremely well. Second time we&#x27;re buying this! It stopped her hair from falling out almost from the first time she used it. We love it.</li>
            <li> Would definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner...highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have my cosmetology license and I never use any other brand, but Redken. The only other brand I&#x27;ve used in the last five years is Wen, which although good for your hair, would leave mine greasy by the end of the day.  Redken does a great job moisturizing even the driest of hair.  I have done my share of coloring, bleaching, and heating over the years, so the last 4 inches of my hair is relatively damaged.  Extreme left it shiny and soft.  I switched to the Extreme shampoo and conditioner because I use the extreme anti snap leave in product so much ( before I was using redken&#x27;s so soft shampoo and conditioner).  They both work well but I think the extreme has a better smell and is a better damage controller. It smells kinda like candy where most other shampoos tend to smell flowery.  Also, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this in ANY other size.  The smaller size shampoo and conditioner will run you almost $40, for half the amount of product.  I know $50 seems like an investment right now, but it will last you 9-12 months based on the length of your hair.  In the end it actually ends up being very cost effective. p.s. salon quality shampoo and conditioner is not $ wasted on fancy labels.  The cheaper drug store brands ( Pantene, garnier, herbal essences) have are high in alcohol which is not good for our hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Makes my hair healthy, shiny and strong. Prior to use my hair was shedding a lot. This product saved my hair.</li>
            <li> Must have love how it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo set. It keeps hair manageable, soft, shiny, and clean . I love it!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY.  This shampoo and conditioner almost ruined my hair after just a couple of uses. It is the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  The products somehow covered all of the natural highlights/low lights in my hair, making my hair look dull, drab and greasy.  My husband actually thought I had died it a darker color and said as nice as he could &amp;#34;you need to go to a professional and have them re-do your hair color, your hair doesn&#x27;t look right&amp;#34;.  All of the shine in my hair was completely gone.  So I strongly, strongly recommend that you DO NOT use this on your hair.  (It has been a week since I used the products, and my hair has a little bit of shine back in it.  It&#x27;s not back to normal yet though.  I am keeping my fingers crossed that with a few more weeks it will have the shine and gloss back without the need to go to a professional).</li>
            <li> Use this all the time ,great product .Good price,I&#x27;ve bought it before and will continue to purchase it .Thank you</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner and shampoo on a regular bases and it leaves my hair smelling, looking and feeling wonderful. My husband can&#x27;t keep his hands or his nose off my hair.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo! Great price! Don&#x27;t forget to purchase the hand pumps that are sold separately. They make it so much easier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for well over a month now and the health of my hair has improved dramatically! My local salon was doing a promo offering free haircuts for children, so I took the opportunity to ask an employee about anti-breakage shampoos. Every time I took a shower, there&#x27;d be a large clump of hair and a friend of mine was having the same problem, which was reduced significantly with anti-breakage products. Anyway, I mentioned this to the employee and she said ultimately, it would be a good idea to speak with a doctor about it because it could indicate thyroid or other health problems. She said if it truly is a breakage problem, Redken Extreme would be her recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my cousin told me she spent $50 on her shampoo and conditioner, I thought she was crazy, but I truly see the value of it now. I love running my fingers through my hair. It is soft, more manageable, it has volume, and the ends aren&#x27;t dry. I&#x27;ve also been losing fewer hairs in the shower, which tells me that it WORKS.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I asked around and I did some decent research on what would be good on bleached hair. I thought that it worked in the being beginning but as time went on I didn&#x27;t notice the difference as much anymore. It does smell pretty good though.</li>
            <li> Excelent product and fast ship!</li>
            <li> Excellent service, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great fir dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> This is a good product for any hair but especially good for my colored treated hair.  If you have damaged hair or if it&#x27;s in rough shape this shampoo &amp; conditioner will help heal &amp; protect it.  I like to try different high quality brands but always seem to gravitate back to Extreme.  I have been happy with any Redken product I have used over the years.  I have oily hair at my roots and my hair tends to tangle in the back.</li>
            <li> My wife said it smells fantastic, Happy wife &#x3D; happy life.  It worked well on her colored treated hair, and the shipping was fast. We ordered it Sunday and it arrived Tuesday (this was free shipping keep in mind), Only thing she mentioned was she wished the price was a little cheaper, only due to the fact ULTA  (a store around town) has this for $5 more, but they were offering a buy 2 get 1 free..we bought the leave in conditioner there.</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing.  It makes my hair feel like I did not wash it - heavy.  When I use both shampoo and conditioner together my hair is so heavy that my styling falls out within an hour; even with hair spray.  It did help my hair damage, but I have flat hair.  I have started using a different shampoo and use just the conditioner and my hair is not as heavy, but not by much.  Feel like I have to use it since I spent the money.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I would have stuck to my Joico K-pak for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Delivery was so quick, and this product smells so good!</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t find the Extreme in larger quantity containers anywhere in our town. I was glad to see I could get them here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of the Redkin shampoos and conditioners in the past few months. This one definitely smells the best (sweetest). I&#x27;m not overly impressed with how &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; it makes my hair, as others have mentioned. BUT, I will say this. I have thin, blonde hair, and as soon as I put this stuff in my hair in the shower it&#x27;s like a magical anti-knot serum. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I can put a comb through my hair as soon as I&#x27;ve got it on my head. So...if you suffer from KNOTS, this is a great product -- at least the conditioner is!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo hands down for damaged hair.  This shampoo will change your hair.  I suggest using it for awhile and switching to a few times a week of using it after that.  Using it every single day for a long time made my hair feel like mush when it was wet.  I found switching days with this and a good shampoo helped.</li>
            <li> great deal will buy again, fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way it make your hair feels.Not to harsh on the hair.I tried all the Redken in blue.I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> THis stuff is complete GARBAGE. I don&#x27;t know what kind of product the other reviewers that gave 5 stars got but mine is garbage. My only thought is that the other reviewers are reps for the company attempting to sell the product and bringing their rating up so that dumb suckers like me buy their EXPIRED product. So I purchased the Redken Extreme shampoo and conditioner a couple of months ago. I previously was using Pureology and was tired of paying $60 for (2) 8 oz bottles that lasted me a couple of months at best. However the stuff was AMAZING..and I shouldn&#x27;t have fixed what ain&#x27;t broke as the old saying goes. NOw..when I received the Redken product the smell was nice in the bottle. I was expecting an amazing experience in the shower and after blow drying and styling my hair and it&#x27;s been 2 months and I&#x27;m STILL waiting. My hair fell out MORE, my hair was completely weighed down, lifeless, no body, AND after washing my hair I noticed that my hair never smelled as it did in the bottle, my hair just smelled like water. I thought highly suspicious because it smelled so good in the bottle. Well, last night I went to my stylist for the first time after using this Redken product and he asked me what I had been using on my hair. I told him and I advised him that I purchased it on Amazon, he about passed out. He said to NEVER, EVER buy hair products on Amazon, as the companies selling hair products on Amazon have either purchased EXPIRED products from salons that are being thrown away or have already been thrown away, and the companies selling on AMazon have not even purchased these expired products HOWEVER, they turn around and sell the expired product (hair products have a 4 month shelf life) to you, at what you think is an amazing deal however what you&#x27;re getting is a product that is useless AND DAMAGING to the customer. Which is what has happened to me. I had to pay $275 last night repairing my hair with deep conditioning and different treatments along with my normal coloring process to CORRECT what this EXPIRED product has done to my hair. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE HAIR PRODUCTS ON AMAZON AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!! Spend the extra few bucks to ensure you&#x27;re getting GOOD, QUALITY products at your local discounted salon or Ulta. If I could report these places to the local authorities I would because seriously essentially what they&#x27;re doing is committing fraud by mis-advertising their products. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo off and on for some years.  I love it.  It is good for the hair.  I also use the snap-it leave in afterwards.  It makes my hair feel healthier.  This is a great shampoo.  Hair Shines and is quite manageable.  I definitely recommend this product to people who want their hair to be healthy.</li>
            <li> Excellent products.  It really has helped my hair with less dryness and my hair is not falling out as much.  Would recommend this product to anyone that has problems with hair loss and extreme dryed out ends</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair with lots of body.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! Will order again!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look differently, actually looks more healthy. The price was a little high, but  was definitely worth to spend.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a conditioner through a local beauty shop after i ran out and noticed a difference, the order from Amazon seemed to be watery compared to the beauty shops product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t honestly know if it&#x27;s authentic because I saw another user said that it wasn&#x27;t, but so far it works great for me. I realize that Redken only guarantees if you purchase through a beauty supply or authorized salon, so I don&#x27;t know for a fact. But anyway, I have coarse hair and it&#x27;s always shiny and soft now, and while I am still losing a lot of hair from having bariatric surgery, I don&#x27;t think that it can be helped. I was hoping that, based on some other reviews, that would ease the hair loss but it hasn&#x27;t. In general though, my hair looks great and my color is lasting. It&#x27;s the best Redken product that I&#x27;ve tried so far and I LOVE their shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li> Top of the line, in quality. I have bleached, damaged hair. And this stuff works great to repair my hair. The smell is awesome. Love how my comb glides through my hair after washing. Will never use anything again but Redken. Redken products are definately worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is good when you need a quick change of protein to your hair. My hair needs a lot of moisture and sometimes I need a boost of protein. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using Redken Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner at the recommendation of my Hair Stylist.  I usually buy it at the Salon, and pay Salon prices.  I am happy to have been able to order it on Amazon, in the larger bottles, and save money in the process.  I have very thick, shoulder length hair and this product makes my hair feel soft easy to manage.</li>
            <li> My version smells different than what I am used to in the store.  I compared the small bottles to these and there is a clear difference.  My hair fell out MORE as well and I was shocked to see someone else write this in another review.  I am hugely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read other reviews how this shampoo really seemed to help girls who had bleached their hair. I BLEACH! My hair had lots of breakage, and it was turning into a disaster. I have bought so many products that just don&#x27;t seem to work for me. I used this shampoo for about three months, but didn&#x27;t notice any change with my hair whatsoever, so I moved on. For me, the one thing that I have found that really works on damaged hair are the &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and a good bit of it too. I&#x27;m always constantly shedding and my hair always gets tangled in itself very easily. Ever since I started using this set of Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, my hair looks and feels so much healthier. My shedding has reduced to half of the amount, and now to doesn&#x27;t get tangled in itself any more, which was a very pleasant surprise! This is overall my favourite Redken Product.</li>
            <li> I had VERY damaged hair being bleached all the time and all with high and low lights every 8 to 10 weeks! My hair dresser recommend this for me and it&#x27;s was cheaper on amazon! So I gave I a shot, the next time I went in to see her she said my hair was not as damaged and she was even surprised how well it really worked! So I was and condition with this redken extreme and the use it&#x27;s a 10 before I brush it out!! BIG diffrence!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PAIR, MY HAIR FEELS GREAT</li>
            <li> Great deal for a great product.</li>
            <li> This was the best investment I ever made! It was a little over my budget but within days my hair was soft and silky...before this my hair was damaged, dry and frizzy and was even thinking of cutting my hair s few inches! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Great for thick colored hair. I use it since hi-lights have began to break pieces of my hair. With other products used,  I have seen a difference in my integrity of my hair.  I also do not blow dry my hair and I use a detangler, extra conditioner, shine serum &amp; shine spray to help.</li>
            <li> I love this product,  it leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Second time purchasing this product. It always leaves my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and this stuff dried it out very badly!  It did nothing to detangle and I had a hard time getting a wide tooth comb through in the shower...tangles were so bad I pulled out large clumps of hair!  It also left my hair dull with a &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; feeling</li>
            <li> So I purchased the Extreme line recently and just used the Shampoo+Conditioner last night. I know a few people said that the shampoo made their hair feel drier than expected--the opposite happened for me. It actually made it feel silky and soft. Even after I applied shampoo a second time, it didn&#x27;t make it feel dried out as I was expecting. Then, when I used the conditioner, I couldn&#x27;t want to see if the raves were true about how it feels like it \\&quot;melts your hair\\&quot;. Well, let me say, as soon as I placed it into  my hair, my hair literally did feel like it melted! It instantly took what I thought was \\&quot;silky\\&quot; to the next level and my hair just felt amazing. Today, my hair is still soft and actually feels more full, which is a good thing. I&#x27;ll update next week when I see if it made a difference in my hair&#x27;s appearance when I straighten it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But so far, for those who may wonder if it&#x27;s worth the high price (like me), so far, I would say YES. My hair just feels so smooth, soft, and more manageable today.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this product I&#x27;ve noticed I have no more breakage in my hair. I most definitely will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. But my stylist recomended a change after I use the whole supply due to the ingredients of this one. Accourding to her it&#x27;s very strong and too much usage could damage the hair. But it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I get my hair bleached and dyed. My hair dresser recommended this to me, however it did not work for my hair. My hair is usually naturally soft, but ever since i started using this product my hair has been dry, stringy and brittle. IT MADE MY HAIR LESS HEALTHY. I bought it from the salon so I know it wasn&#x27;t a fake product. My mom also had this same problem with her hair when using this product a few years ago. Maybe it just isn&#x27;t suited for out hair types, or maybe it&#x27;s just crap. Regardless, I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> They are really good in my case. It&#x27;s a large volume and the price is good!! It lasts a long time  and it&#x27;s much better than the products that I can find at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great shampoo and conditioner to have...</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything and I love, love, love this stuff. My hair is so healthy and soft as a result of using this shampoo and conditioner. The search is over -- thank goodness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start off by saying I am obsessed with finding amazing shampoos and conditioners for damaged hair, since, well.. I had damaged hair.I&#x27;ve tried sooo many and organix morrocan and argan oil seemed to really be working BUT..I tried this as it was recommended by my boyfriends hairstyliest and OMG..it&#x27;s amazing. I got a liter of the shampoo and the conditioner on sale for $20.00, it smells sooo good and the smell stays in my hair. I have thick, semi-damaged, black hair and my hair soaked it right up! It lathered so nicely and I didn&#x27;t even have to use that much like usual. I could feel it working while I was using the product. It felt like silk and I would defanitly recomend this to anyone who is looking for that miracle product for the same hair type!! Like I said #1, I&#x27;m soooo happy now!!</li>
            <li> Good product and made a huge difference in my hair.  It lasted a long time too!  I would definetely buy it again and keep it in stock.  Very good price on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> anytime I feel like my hair is super damaged, I use this and it instantly looks healthier, better than any other damage shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair has been really damaged due to coloring and flat iron use. I recently went to a new hairdresser and she recommended some products in this line. I love the way it makes my hair feel! My daughter is 4 and has very long, curly hair that gets very tangled with some shampoos and conditioners. I used the Redken shampoo and conditioner and it got rid of the tangles without having to brush them out! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I damage my hair. I really love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the other products from Redken but works really well. I have noticed my hair is stronger.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Prior to this I used Pureology shampoo and conditioner which I loved but it seemed like my hair was getting &amp;#34;used to&amp;#34; it. I hear that&#x27;s a thing! Anyways the reviews were great on this and my hair is oh so damaged so here we are. I also bought redken anti snap leave in treatment because like I said before, my hair is really really damaged. I suppose that&#x27;s what happens when you bleach your hair and straighten it daily. I feel like my hair is soft afterwards but I still don&#x27;t get quite the salon afterwards smoothness I have been searching my entire adult life for the secret to (seriously, what do I need to do people?!) anyways, it&#x27;s a great product and hopefully will keep my hair nice and healthy. Kudos redkins!</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair is so much softer and less damaged using this! Love the smell!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner alot. They both smell so good and your hair feels so soft and shiny after using them. This shampoo/conditioner cleans your hair without weighing it down at all. I plan on using this all the time..i love it!</li>
            <li> Great product so far! Received this shipment very fast.</li>
            <li> I love it, fast shipping and excellent price</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I have every used. It makes my hair feel soft an healthy.</li>
            <li> I bought this set but I received only the shampoo. The conditioner is missing.</li>
            <li> I started using this because when we moved to a higher altitude my hair started to dry out and break.  I was miserable.  I got a couple small bottles from the salon and it worked so well I started buying the big bottles.  I won&#x27;t ever use anything else.  This stuff healed my hair and it&#x27;s soft and silky again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has helped so much with trying to grow my hair longer. I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo and conditioner I will use... even if I can&#x27;t afford it! Redken Extreme helped me so much. My hair is dry, thick, and curly, but when I became ill, it thinned out, broke, lost its curl, and looked unhealthy. Not long after consistently using Redken Extreme products, I noticed a huge difference! My hair is softer than ever before, and quite thick again. When I look good, I feel good, so I won&#x27;t be using anything else.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and best price.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely. No problems.</li>
            <li> I switch it up between Redken&#x27;s color extend and the extreme lines. My hair dresser told me that it is nice for your hair to have a little mix when it comes to product lines, and honestly I know this to not be a sales tactic because I don&#x27;t even purchase my products from him (they are much cheaper here online usually).  I also know that his recommended method of switching up your shampoo/conditioner is a good idea because it has worked on my hair and helped it so I don&#x27;t have to wash it as often and it is healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have been using the extreme line for years and I LOVE it! I have fine/oily hair and I have had major issues with my hair being so oily in the past I&#x27;d have to wash it every single day! The extreme shampoo/conditioner is VERY SENSITIVE on my hair, yet it helps the natural and healthy balance come back to my hair.  Redken also has great product lines for extending your color if you have colored hair.  Seriously, if you&#x27;re having issues with your hair being damaged, oily, frizzy, or just not feeling right try the Redken Extreme shampoo/conditioner! You won&#x27;t be disapointed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you don&#x27;t have to use as much (or as often) shampoo/conditioner when using this line because it works so good and these 33 oz. last me honestly 9 months up to a year!! You can typically also get them refilled at a local beauty supply store (no you don&#x27;t usually need a license to enter the store) and they give you a pretty good discount, and you&#x27;re saving the environment by re-using your bottle! Also, if you feel uncomfortable buying the 33 oz at first (like I did) you can always try the smaller bottle at first and just save that for when you are traveling and refill it whenever you need to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shampoo/conditioner is amazing, and not to mention it smells FANTASTIC! I would highly recommend this product for sure, my hair certainly can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> favorite shampoo and conditioner i am deff buying for here again deff most resonable priced i have found for bottle size</li>
            <li> I have thick (and i mean THICK) hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out forever-- it always seems to get to about 2 inches past my shoulders and then starts breaking off. (I also have heavy highlights, which I know doesn&#x27;t help things.)  I started using the anti-snap leave-in treatment a few months ago and I am FINALLY seeing some growth.  Since it was working so well, I decided to throw in the whole system and started using the shampoo and conditioner.  This stuff is GREAT.  My hair is definitely softer, and it&#x27;s shiney and seems stronger after just a few uses, especially when I add the anti-snap treatment after I wash it.  The nice thing about it is that it does not weigh hair down at all... although this isn&#x27;t great for me since my hair is so thick and poofy and I kind of like it being weighed down a little bit to control it.  :)  So, I have more volume than I&#x27;d like to have, but now it&#x27;s different than it was before-- a prettier, shinier and more manageable poof is better than the frizzy poof I&#x27;ve been sporting prior to this shampoo and conditioner.  As others have said, it doesn&#x27;t take much to lather up, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost, especially for the results.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Nice price. Packaged well. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Great product,no problems with shipping</li>
            <li> Good price.  Product arrived quickly.  My gf is happy (she was using crappy $7/bottle stuff) &amp; I like the smell it leaves in her hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like this shampoo and conditioner gave me 100 times more split ends. This is nothing like they use in a beauty school. Stay away!</li>
            <li> Just a few uses and i can already see the changes in my hair. Staying with this brand from now on!</li>
            <li> I have fine colored hair and this left my hair limp and lifeless. Not for fine hair!</li>
            <li> Great value.  Redken is a product I trust.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the salon&#x27;s price!  Same great quality.  Should last me for a year!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years, and will continue to do so.  It is the perfect product for fine, thin and permed hair.  Great price online also!</li>
            <li> Is this the real product? Leaves a layer of film on your scalp!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected...  Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations...</li>
            <li> Good price great product.  Will purchase again.  And &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34;...this is the real McCoy..Redken Extreme, I have used this for years and it is a life saver for colored hair.</li>
            <li> I liked Expreme, but have recently switched to the Redken brand that doesn&#x27;t have sulfate.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to condition my hair, which has some damage from coloring.  I used it almost every day for weeks -- because I wash my hair nearly every day.  Instead of helping, this stuff dried out my hair and made it extremely brittle.  Unfortunately it took me a few weeks to realize what was happening, and why, so it got pretty bad.  My stylist was appalled when she touched it, and immediately asked what conditioner I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the new protein formula just should not be used very often -- I&#x27;ve read that too much protein can damage your hair, and I wonder if that&#x27;s what happened to me.  If that&#x27;s the case, I wish the bottle would warn not to use it every day. It just says to use after shampooing, implying that this can be an every day conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the reason, my hair looks and feels awful now. I won&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time...will keep ordering</li>
            <li> Definitely an expired and washed all my color out.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT AND THE PRICE THRU AMAZON TOO :)</li>
            <li> I love love love these! My hair is pretty dry, and this helped bring a lot of moisture back. Oh and the smell! It smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I got this from my hair stylist on his recommendation, and I liked how smooth and nice my hair looked. The next day, I noticed that my hair was really greasy already, when I usually only have to wash my hair every other day. I figured that it was alright and that I&#x27;d just change my hygiene regiment. Things really went downhill from there. I had a really awful breakout on my forehead and hairline with painful red bumps (I think they were cystic pimples?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really allergic or sensitive to anything usually, so this was definitely a surprise. I went back and checked the drugstore shampoo I usually use, and found that it has both Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. It seems like the great results people get are from an unusually large proportion of the Sodium Laureth Sulfate because I&#x27;ve never had anything close to this problem before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could recommend this product since it was very nice at first, but because of my unpleasant experience I&#x27;d advise you to be very careful before you buy this whole set. Even though my hair is fairly dry and not greasy to begin with, I&#x27;d assume you&#x27;d fare better if your hair was very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a shampoo that would work on my dry, color-treated hair and itching scalp and wouldn&#x27;t make my hair fall out. This works like a charm and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
