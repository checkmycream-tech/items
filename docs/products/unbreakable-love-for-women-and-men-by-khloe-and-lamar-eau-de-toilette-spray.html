            <li> my fav cologne out of the 3 they have out!  I order a new bottle every month!!  by far LOVE is the best for men!!  you have to have this cologne!  its a must for the trendy man!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> Unbreakable Love is a very delicate fragrance for a man and a woman to share. This fragrance has a way of smelling different on different people.&lt;br /&gt;The box for this fragrance is very interesting. To me it looks like water but photoshopped to look fuzzy but I do like the very relaxing blue and white added to it&lt;br /&gt;The bottle for unbreakable love is my favorite out of the three in its brand. The light blue throughout the bottle with its silver lettering and spritser allow for the fragrance to look high end.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very great. At first spray you get a sharp bergamot with the delicate neroli creating an fresh initial spray. When the scent gets closer to the midnotes, the fragrance begins to get that unisex aspect but still has that bergamot from the top. The base of unbreakable love compliments the fragrance perfectly adding a musky/woody scent on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall Unbreakable Love is safe. Its a great signature scent and safe enough to give this as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;On me personaly i get 6 hours with a moderate sillage.&lt;br /&gt;Lotion: great citrus/musky scent and does its job&lt;br /&gt;Travel spray: fits anywhere and is also refillable&lt;br /&gt;Lotion:5/5&lt;br /&gt;Travel spray:5/5</li>
            <li> I actually was SUPPOSED to by some other version of this....Unbreakable Bond or something like that.....for my sister. But she was very happy with this product. She manages a spa and deals with lots of nice smells, but made a point to text me to tell me that she enjoyed getting the ovational whiff of her own perfume.  Great product, great deal considering the expense of other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Love thesmell I wanted too get it in Florida but it wasn&#x27;t there so I ordered  it is great. Thanks</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it! It&#x27;s very refreshing</li>
            <li> Love love love it smells great ..it kinda reminds me of Dolce and Gabana ..I recieve alot of good compliments with this perfume ...def will add to my collection</li>
            <li> Well, K &amp; L broke but the cologne is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!!!!!!  The only thing wrong with this is, it doesn&#x27;t last...  About 15 or 20 minutes after spraying this, it&#x27;s gone...</li>
            <li> I like it but I might like the other two better.</li>
            <li> awesome scent  and fast delivery service.</li>
            <li> This is now my favourite perfume. It is light and airy and not at all overpowering. Myself and everyone around me love it</li>
            <li> So i went to the mall and ran cross a tester and was super curious... I cudnt stop smelln my arm all day... I was sad whn i had to take a shower,cuz i washed the lil bit i had on... So i got home and ordered me my very own.... Itz really a unique scent...if i cud describe it... I wud say itz a fresh oriental wit a hint of sugar.... U jus have to try it urself... In my opinion the unbreakable bond was so so... Letz jus say i wnt b refilling when i finally do run out... But the unbreakable love i wil buy to the end of time... Itz that special and captures my nasal cavity like no other fragrance to date...and i have over 300 bottles of cologne.. Stay so fresh and clean clean my friendz</li>
            <li> I got my new fragrance and I love it, I now own all 3 of them. Unbreakable Bond, Unbreakable Joy &amp; Unbreakable Love. I love them all, thanks so much for sharing them, and for your creativity. Anyone who gets the chance to own them, don&#x27;t pass it up, you will love them!!</li>
            <li> I wear Unbreakable Bond literally every day. So I thought trying Unbreakable Love and Unbreakable Joy would be a great idea. They came packaged great. I just dislike the smell. I gave this bottle to my Mom and she didn&#x27;t like it, so she gave it to someone she works with.</li>
            <li> Not too feminine, not too masculine. Amazing &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long. It lasts for about 2 minutes. I tried spraying 14 spritz and it went away within minutes. I love the smell though. Too bad you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Congrats to Khle and Lamar, I love them as I love this fragrance!</li>
