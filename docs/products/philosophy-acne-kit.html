    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My skin is clearer and smoother,  it just isn&#x27;t perfect,  but who is!</li>
            <li>I think trying the kit is a must because it is the best way to find out which of these products might work for you.  </li>
            <li>my skin is flawless but when I do breakout it lasts a shorter period which is good.    </li>
            <li>It is great for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten great results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This kit is just AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>but I need some kind of miracle!  </li>
            <li>So, get a good hidrating cream/emulsion too(oilfree).</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 13</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve very satisfied with the product and intend to continue using it for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I was all set to go to a dermatologist when I decided to give the Philosophy line a chance after hearing so many good things about it from family and friends.  </li>
            <li>The acne cleared up nicely, but now I have a sizable (to me anyway)</li>
            <li>Knowing what I do now, I would probably buy this on it&#x27;s own.    </li>
            <li>I was a real skeptic of Proactiv with all the celebrity spokespeople but what an amazing product line!!!</li>
            <li>and I would recommend that if you have tried everything and are looking for a healthy, natural, and effective way to help your skin look and feel it&#x27;s best</li>
            <li>Just remember not to get it on your eyebrows and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li>I have pictures to proove, that for more than a month of using Acne Kit Kit not even one acne spot dissapeared.</li>
            <li>I was having better results using $0,97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen</li>
            <li>I am more depressed now than I ever have been, mostly because of my skin.</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy, so I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>The serum is my favorite product in this kit, but I use all four products as recommended.</li>
            <li>like most companies Philosophy assumes that acne prone skin is always oily skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Philosphy Acne Kit because I love there smelly bath and body line.  </li>
            <li>I am just so pleased.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this kit.</li>
            <li>I love philosophy</li>
            <li>There are pieces in this kit I like better than others (the face wash and the protection cream).  </li>
            <li>I love Philosphy products so after researching what was out there</li>
            <li>I also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy-</li>
            <li>I recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years.  </li>
            <li>cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size.</li>
            <li>but I feel it is one of the best overall treatments out there!</li>
            <li>so really it is a pretty good bargain. :)</li>
            <li>non-exsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just happy so far and will continue to process...maybe I will write another review in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love the On a Clear Day lotion, under makeup it really does help to give a very flawless look.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin dries out some in the area I use the serum, but I just use a good moisturizer (I use MAC Studio Moisture Fix, which contains antioxidants which are also good for blemished skin) which takes care of the dry spots.     </li>
            <li>The face wash is amazing, so refreshing, and it really cleans my face without either drying it out or leving a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, this is for sure true, when you use this Kit Kit.</li>
            <li>However, (and this is a huge however)</li>
            <li>I have tried many different acne kits and products over the years, but this has definately been the most effective.</li>
            <li>The facewash is okay, nothing stellar.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for two weeks, and while I can&#x27;t say my skin is flawless, it&#x27;s considerably improved.</li>
            <li>thing that I do recommend is that if you wear make-up, use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser.</li>
            <li>I also note that I need to put a top layer of moisturiser on my face as the protection creme doesn&#x27;t do the trick to keep my skin from drying out in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face nice and soft in the mornings.</li>
            <li>The day and night face creams are cool.</li>
            <li>I have 2 huge pimples right now</li>
            <li>For the same price I could have bought stuff that really works-the one that Vanessa Williams is happy with.</li>
            <li>I used to have moderate acne, and while the amount of blemishes I have has not decreased, the visibility of them has reduced greatly.</li>
            <li>and my skin has had a tremendous transformation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that any large blemishes heal more quickly, but that my skin is more sensitive to dryness and sun.</li>
            <li>Philosophy is my new favorite company for both their skin care and their \\&quot;Kiss Me\\&quot; lip balm that is so moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I can walk out the door with just powder on my face for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>I was as happy as young horse to have all this products for around $40: night and day cream, facial wash and blemish serum.</li>
            <li>On a Clear Day Hydrogen Peroxide Cream (4.5 stars): Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day!</li>
            <li>The bumps have gone down in every area, my nostrils are no longer red and unsightly, no more blackheads, and best of all it feels great while applying and after.</li>
            <li>On a Clear Day Super Wash (3 stars): not bad</li>
            <li>Each product also has very little scent to it which I liked as well - no antiseptic smell here!</li>
            <li>But take care if your skin is not good hidrated, you will need to moisture more than normal, it is a great treatment but dries the skin, which is normal in acne treatments</li>
            <li>The first couple weeks I did continue to break out</li>
            <li>I really hope this works out for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Philosophy!</li>
            <li>This kit has cleared up my acne and is keeping my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I actually stopped using the serum and placed the cream on my acne and got better results.</li>
            <li>If you are going to spend $47 on the Philosophy Acne Kit, spend an extra couple more dollars for Proactiv.</li>
            <li>When I first started using Philosophy&#x27;s kit</li>
            <li>When I first got the set, I used it all the time.. for about three days.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of stuff you get at the drug store.. and it leaves a funny smell on your face.    </li>
            <li>I have to admit when I first started using it</li>
            <li>I will stick with Philosophy in the future:)</li>
            <li>If i feel a blemish starting to form, I make sure to put some on the area right away, and it really just shrinks it up before it has a chance to show on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had some clean and clear gel (drug store stuff)</li>
            <li>I tried this kit after reading some positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>That and the fact that it cleared up my acne mostly but not completely are my reasons for giving it four stars rather than five.</li>
            <li>The cons are certainly that it is time intensive and pricey.  </li>
            <li>This philosophy kit really works for people with consistant light to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>The H2O2 cream does work well, but it will bleach your skin (however, not has much as something with benzoyl peroxide).  </li>
            <li>but didnt pay much attention to it.</li>
            <li>so i put some on for three days straight and NOTHING.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about).</li>
            <li>Yeah, this cream is intense as well.</li>
            <li>Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling -</li>
            <li>Just like many other people, I have tried so many other products (Clinique, Arbonne, Proactive) that did not work for my skin.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I will say is that I use all the products sparingly since the bottles are kind of small</li>
            <li>I did&#x27;t find any of the products particularly drying so</li>
            <li>I still have occasional blemishes but they disappear quickly and are not as severe as before.      </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products to anyone struggling with their skin.</li>
            <li>The price is high but at this point I will try anything once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not a perfect fix for me, but it is better than my old regimen, so that&#x27;s good enough for now.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change in the first few weeks, beyond pimples clearing up faster.</li>
            <li>I really feel this has helped clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>either it dried my skin out, made my skin oily, saw no results at all, or just broke out more.  </li>
            <li>Around week 5 or 6, I began to notice that I wasn&#x27;t waking up to a new zit every morning</li>
            <li>Now, I have been using for 4 months and feel like a new person.</li>
            <li>Soon I have had to buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream and sensitive skin, high spf day cream</li>
            <li>I break out monthly and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and sensitive, even in the areas where I am most likely to break out.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had skin this clear since childhood!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of over the counter products of various prices, and this is the first stuff I&#x27;ve used that works.</li>
            <li>I got my ACNE kit today from Sephora.com and this stuff rocks so far!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels like velvet, new blemishes clear up in a day or 2, and my makeup goes on easier than ever.</li>
            <li>a clear day\\&quot; blemish serum, in the pretty blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>This product is expensive but effective for those who are willing to commit to the four step process.  </li>
            <li>All of my existing blemishes cleared up much faster than usual, and I haven&#x27;t seen any significant new breakouts.   </li>
            <li>I have had mild to moderate acne for the last 20 years.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had short term success with other products in the past, so I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars for the good start.</li>
            <li>hardly ever review anything, but I loved this product so much, and had such a hard time finding the right product, that I just had to put this out there.  </li>
            <li>I just want clear skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clear Day Blemish Serum (2 stars)</li>
            <li>so I started using Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar for sensitive skin on my cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li>Since then I have been completely amazed by how my skin looks.</li>
            <li>but I am now going to try the Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Sensitive Skin and put it on after everything.</li>
            <li>and my skin already feels so soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have adult acne at age 25 years old.</li>
            <li>was getting them to the point where popping them made me have all these yucky fading of spots where the old pimples used to be.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I am getting a handle on my adult acne and plan to continue purchasing Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I recommend this kit if you sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Even after my first use, my monster zit dramatically went down and nearly gone after three days.</li>
            <li>The other thing is that I have always battled mild adult acne and I am still getting occasional breakouts, its not like all of a sudden</li>
            <li>Since you only use a little at a time, this bottle can last you pretty much forever..</li>
            <li>On a Clear Day Protection Cream (1 star): I have no idea if this actually works.</li>
            <li>Hell, what&#x27;s another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back.</li>
            <li>Being in my 30&#x27;s and having dealt with moderate acne problems since my early teens, I&#x27;ve literally tried everything.   </li>
            <li>The Philosophy states on their cosmetic&#x27;s containers: there is no such thing as unblemished skin.</li>
            <li>I recently began suffering from acne as a graduate student in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It completely cleared up my skin and prevented further breakouts from occurring.</li>
            <li>These pimples would start off red and then have the grand finale of pus oozing (don&#x27;t mean to be gross).</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of the lotion because I dont think it moisturizes enough, although it does make your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now, and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes.</li>
            <li>but, T zone, tends to dry, overall sensitive zones.</li>
            <li>I found myself with bumps on my cheeks (where my skin was dry), around my nostrils (where my skin was super red and inflammed and raw looking), my nose (oily and prone to blackheads), and my forehead (also oily).</li>
            <li>is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Each product also has very little scent to it which I liked as well - no antiseptic smell here!</li>
            <li> But take care if your skin is not good hidrated, you will need to moisture more than normal, it is a great treatment but dries the skin, which is normal in acne treatments</li>
            <li> The first couple weeks I did continue to break out</li>
            <li> I really hope this works out for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Philosophy!</li>
            <li> This kit has cleared up my acne and is keeping my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I actually stopped using the serum and placed the cream on my acne and got better results.</li>
            <li> If you are going to spend $47 on the Philosophy Acne Kit, spend an extra couple more dollars for Proactiv.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Philosophy&#x27;s kit</li>
            <li> When I first got the set, I used it all the time.. for about three days.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of stuff you get at the drug store.. and it leaves a funny smell on your face.    </li>
            <li> I have to admit when I first started using it</li>
            <li> I will stick with Philosophy in the future:)</li>
            <li> If i feel a blemish starting to form, I make sure to put some on the area right away, and it really just shrinks it up before it has a chance to show on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had some clean and clear gel (drug store stuff)</li>
            <li> I tried this kit after reading some positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> That and the fact that it cleared up my acne mostly but not completely are my reasons for giving it four stars rather than five.</li>
            <li> The cons are certainly that it is time intensive and pricey.  </li>
            <li> This philosophy kit really works for people with consistant light to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> The H2O2 cream does work well, but it will bleach your skin (however, not has much as something with benzoyl peroxide).  </li>
            <li> but didnt pay much attention to it.</li>
            <li> so i put some on for three days straight and NOTHING.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about).</li>
            <li> Yeah, this cream is intense as well.</li>
            <li> Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling -</li>
            <li> Just like many other people, I have tried so many other products (Clinique, Arbonne, Proactive) that did not work for my skin.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I will say is that I use all the products sparingly since the bottles are kind of small</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t find any of the products particularly drying so</li>
            <li> I still have occasional blemishes but they disappear quickly and are not as severe as before.      </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products to anyone struggling with their skin.</li>
            <li> The price is high but at this point I will try anything once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not a perfect fix for me, but it is better than my old regimen, so that&#x27;s good enough for now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change in the first few weeks, beyond pimples clearing up faster.</li>
            <li> I really feel this has helped clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> either it dried my skin out, made my skin oily, saw no results at all, or just broke out more.  </li>
            <li> Around week 5 or 6, I began to notice that I wasn&#x27;t waking up to a new zit every morning</li>
            <li> Now, I have been using for 4 months and feel like a new person.</li>
            <li> Soon I have had to buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream and sensitive skin, high spf day cream</li>
            <li> I break out monthly and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and sensitive, even in the areas where I am most likely to break out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had skin this clear since childhood!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of over the counter products of various prices, and this is the first stuff I&#x27;ve used that works.</li>
            <li> I got my ACNE kit today from Sephora.com and this stuff rocks so far!  </li>
            <li> My skin feels like velvet, new blemishes clear up in a day or 2, and my makeup goes on easier than ever.</li>
            <li> a clear day\\&quot; blemish serum, in the pretty blue bottle.  </li>
            <li> This product is expensive but effective for those who are willing to commit to the four step process.  </li>
            <li> All of my existing blemishes cleared up much faster than usual, and I haven&#x27;t seen any significant new breakouts.   </li>
            <li> I have had mild to moderate acne for the last 20 years.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had short term success with other products in the past, so I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars for the good start.</li>
            <li> hardly ever review anything, but I loved this product so much, and had such a hard time finding the right product, that I just had to put this out there.  </li>
            <li> I just want clear skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clear Day Blemish Serum (2 stars)</li>
            <li> so I started using Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar for sensitive skin on my cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li> Since then I have been completely amazed by how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> but I am now going to try the Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Sensitive Skin and put it on after everything.</li>
            <li> and my skin already feels so soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have adult acne at age 25 years old.</li>
            <li> was getting them to the point where popping them made me have all these yucky fading of spots where the old pimples used to be.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am getting a handle on my adult acne and plan to continue purchasing Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I recommend this kit if you sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Even after my first use, my monster zit dramatically went down and nearly gone after three days.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that I have always battled mild adult acne and I am still getting occasional breakouts, its not like all of a sudden</li>
            <li> Since you only use a little at a time, this bottle can last you pretty much forever..</li>
            <li> On a Clear Day Protection Cream (1 star): I have no idea if this actually works.</li>
            <li> Hell, what&#x27;s another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back.</li>
            <li> Being in my 30&#x27;s and having dealt with moderate acne problems since my early teens, I&#x27;ve literally tried everything.   </li>
            <li> The Philosophy states on their cosmetic&#x27;s containers: there is no such thing as unblemished skin.</li>
            <li> I recently began suffering from acne as a graduate student in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It completely cleared up my skin and prevented further breakouts from occurring.</li>
            <li> These pimples would start off red and then have the grand finale of pus oozing (don&#x27;t mean to be gross).</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the lotion because I dont think it moisturizes enough, although it does make your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now, and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes.</li>
            <li> but, T zone, tends to dry, overall sensitive zones.</li>
            <li> I found myself with bumps on my cheeks (where my skin was dry), around my nostrils (where my skin was super red and inflammed and raw looking), my nose (oily and prone to blackheads), and my forehead (also oily).</li>
            <li> is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas.</li>
            <li> but I think Aveeno&#x27;s Clear Complexion Cleansing line works about the same for less.    </li>
            <li> Whenever I used regular OTC acne products they always made me face feel dry, flaky, and red.  </li>
            <li> I get really lazy with too much steps.</li>
            <li> The blemish serum is extremely drying, so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don&#x27;t reapply throughout the day, until your skin is ready.</li>
            <li> It seems from reading the other reviews that some people are using both at the same time, which might be why they are not seeing the same reluts.  </li>
            <li> Well in the past week I  developed two angry cyst like pimples (you know, the kind you cant pop, but they&#x27;re huge and painful and red?).</li>
            <li> So take it slow until your skin is ready.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or cause it to flake and peel.</li>
            <li> In addition I do use Hope in a jar at night when I do start to feel a bit dry.    </li>
            <li> I cannot use products with benzol peroxide because it becomes dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> ( my skin started showing dark, sun-exposure spots, altough I WAS USING an spf filter) and finally no acne was or is gone.</li>
            <li> only downfall is that this is a 4 step program which is a tad time consuming and tedious, but at this point I&#x27;m willing to do it if the results continue at this rate.  </li>
            <li> For those who have tried other products but still experience the dry, oily patches, I would whole-heartedly urge you to take a shot with this kit.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion the smell is not worth mentioning (it only last a few seconds and is not strong).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks, and my acne is steadily getting worse.</li>
            <li> Also, while it is a little pricey altogether, it lasts a while so it might end up costing less than my last regimen too.</li>
            <li> so I have absolutely no complaints!  </li>
            <li> But, after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> but my son is a little on the dry side to begin with</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the other products on a regular basis, at least not anymore.  </li>
            <li> I never had a problem with acne until my late 20s, when suddenly my skin seemed to turn on me.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, I never experienced acne as a teenager.</li>
            <li> It did dry my skin out a little,  but whatever works!   </li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for about 3 months and have noticed that I break out less.  </li>
            <li> thing I do is I will take a little bit of the hope</li>
            <li> This product cleared up even my difficult nodular acne (large, hard bumps under the skin&#x27;s surface).</li>
            <li> It has decreased my breakouts and when I do have one, the blue serum seems to quicken the healing time a lot!</li>
            <li> Other people have complained about it being too drying</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve tried have only made my acne worse, or if it did clear it up then it dried out my skin so badly that I&#x27;d have to stop use as soon as it&#x27;d start to work.</li>
            <li> It slowly brought my monster zit down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting large, painful cysts, a type of acne I have never gotten before.</li>
            <li> I never had this problem in before and been battling it for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> However, I still have the small pimples on my forehead and they don&#x27;t seem to be going away.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late twenties and started breaking out around my jawline and cheeks.</li>
            <li> And proactiv is the most worthless, waste of money crap of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv, which dried my skin out horribly, and stung while I applied the products - I even used those products only every other day and my skin still peeled!</li>
            <li> but I get those big painful ones that</li>
            <li> Nothing was helping my acne, it just kept getting worse.  </li>
            <li> This kit immediately began to work on my face, clearing my skin at the absolute worst time of the month.</li>
            <li> Philosophy has gotten me addicted to skincare</li>
            <li> A couple days ago my co-worker game</li>
            <li> I would recommend this kit to anyone who can&#x27;t use benzoyl peroxide and is frustrated with all the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> Could I be doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I am allergic to benzyl peroxide</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it works, because it is on your face until night time when you wash (I can even faintly smell the product).</li>
            <li> but, that doesn&#x27;t mean it is a bad product.  </li>
            <li> I still have a bad complexion but nothing like it used to be after trying this.  </li>
            <li> and I have painful acne bumps...</li>
            <li> I have had acne since age 12, and though it&#x27;s never been severe, I hate it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this kit with low expectations.  Being in my 30&#x27;s and having dealt with moderate acne problems since my early teens, I&#x27;ve literally tried everything.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this kit for over a week, and I have definitely seen progress.  All of my existing blemishes cleared up much faster than usual, and I haven&#x27;t seen any significant new breakouts.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is that this is a 4 step program which is a tad time consuming and tedious, but at this point I&#x27;m willing to do it if the results continue at this rate.  I also note that I need to put a top layer of moisturiser on my face as the protection creme doesn&#x27;t do the trick to keep my skin from drying out in certain areas.  Which makes it actually a 5 step process.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had short term success with other products in the past, so I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars for the good start. I am reserving judgement on the last star pending long-term results.  If the system continues to work for me I&#x27;ll re-review.</li>
            <li> I never had a problem with acne until my late 20s, when suddenly my skin seemed to turn on me. I found myself with bumps on my cheeks (where my skin was dry), around my nostrils (where my skin was super red and inflammed and raw looking), my nose (oily and prone to blackheads), and my forehead (also oily). I tried several high-end drugstore brands and none of them seemed to work. For months it was this way no matter what I did. I tried Proactiv, which dried my skin out horribly, and stung while I applied the products - I even used those products only every other day and my skin still peeled! I was all set to go to a dermatologist when I decided to give the Philosophy line a chance after hearing so many good things about it from family and friends.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for two weeks, and while I can&#x27;t say my skin is flawless, it&#x27;s considerably improved. The bumps have gone down in every area, my nostrils are no longer red and unsightly, no more blackheads, and best of all it feels great while applying and after. Each product also has very little scent to it which I liked as well - no antiseptic smell here! I did find that the moisturizer wasn&#x27;t quite enough for me so I started using Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar for sensitive skin on my cheeks and neck. That and the fact that it cleared up my acne mostly but not completely are my reasons for giving it four stars rather than five. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve very satisfied with the product and intend to continue using it for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Yet another product that didn&#x27;t work for my skin.  I did&#x27;t find any of the products particularly drying so if dryness is a concern for you, you might want to try it.  I&#x27;ve been using the system for 2 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  I wouldn&#x27;t tell my friends to use this product.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all but, that doesn&#x27;t mean it is a bad product.  Everybody&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> It is great for acne prone skin. But take care if your skin is not good hidrated, you will need to moisture more than normal, it is a great treatment but dries the skin, which is normal in acne treatments but, T zone, tends to dry, overall sensitive zones. So, get a good hidrating cream/emulsion too(oilfree).</li>
            <li> The Philosophy states on their cosmetic&#x27;s containers: there is no such thing as unblemished skin. Well, this is for sure true, when you use this Kit Kit. I have pictures to proove, that for more than a month of using Acne Kit Kit not even one acne spot dissapeared. I&#x27;m combining it with oxygen peel- this doesn&#x27;t help either. I was as happy as young horse to have all this products for around $40: night and day cream, facial wash and blemish serum. All they do ( maybe except of the wash) is drying out the skin. Soon I have had to buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream and sensitive skin, high spf day cream( my skin started showing dark, sun-exposure spots, altough I WAS USING an spf filter) and finally no acne was or is gone. I dont get it- I was having better results using $0,97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen peroxide- based line of cosmetics. For the same price I could have bought stuff that really works-the one that Vanessa Williams is happy with. I know cause I tried it, didn&#x27;t make my skin feel like Sahara and will be my next choice. Save your money. P.S. The oxygen peel is O.K. dough.</li>
            <li> I am 23, and have suffered from acne since I was 11. I have tried everything, and nothing has worked. I&#x27;m starting to get indented scars. I am more depressed now than I ever have been, mostly because of my skin. I love Philosophy, so I gave this a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks, and my acne is steadily getting worse. I&#x27;m getting large, painful cysts, a type of acne I have never gotten before. I don&#x27;t know if I should continue using the kit in the hopes that this is the \\&quot;purging\\&quot; process or if I should throw it out. Could I be doing something wrong? WHY DOES NO PRODUCT WORK FOR ME?</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! I recently began suffering from acne as a graduate student in my early 20&#x27;s (I think the lack of sleep and stress appeared on my face). Just like many other people, I have tried so many other products (Clinique, Arbonne, Proactive) that did not work for my skin.  This product cleared up even my difficult nodular acne (large, hard bumps under the skin&#x27;s surface). The first couple weeks I did continue to break out (if you suffer from constant acne realize that acne is forming under the skin before it appears on your face, so be patient and realize that the product needs time to bring that acne to the surface and get rid of it). Since then I have been completely amazed by how my skin looks. I still have occasional blemishes but they disappear quickly and are not as severe as before.      The serum is my favorite product in this kit, but I use all four products as recommended. I have noticed that my skin dries out some in the area I use the serum, but I just use a good moisturizer (I use MAC Studio Moisture Fix, which contains antioxidants which are also good for blemished skin) which takes care of the dry spots.     Others have mentioned a dislike for the smell of some of the products.  In my opinion the smell is not worth mentioning (it only last a few seconds and is not strong). Also, because it does not require a lot of each product I feel like this will last me for quite sometime!  This product worked for me so I have absolutely no complaints!  I&#x27;m a  Philosophy believer!</li>
            <li> I have tried I think every product on the market.  Nothing was helping my acne, it just kept getting worse.  I still have a bad complexion but nothing like it used to be after trying this.  I loved it.  It did dry my skin out a little,  but whatever works!   My skin is clearer and smoother,  it just isn&#x27;t perfect,  but who is!</li>
            <li> This works! It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or cause it to flake and peel. No redness. I haven&#x27;t had skin this clear since childhood! One side note, the hydrogen peroxide cream made my eyebrows lighter--oops! Just remember not to get it on your eyebrows and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> I have had acne since age 12, and though it&#x27;s never been severe, I hate it. I&#x27;ve tried lots of over the counter products of various prices, and this is the first stuff I&#x27;ve used that works. However, (and this is a huge however) like most companies Philosophy assumes that acne prone skin is always oily skin. This is not so. My skin is very dry and sensitive, even in the areas where I am most likely to break out. I did notice when I bought the kit that it was likely to strip the oil from my skin, but I assumed that moisturizing would help with that. Not so. The acne cleared up nicely, but now I have a sizable (to me anyway) flaking patch next to one of my eyebrows. &lt;br /&gt;I was using an aveno moisturizer after the h202 cream, and the blemish syrum only once a day (and that sparingly) but I am now going to try the Philosophy Hope in a Jar for Sensitive Skin and put it on after everything. Hopefully (no pun intended) this will help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now, and it seems to work pretty well. I used to have moderate acne, and while the amount of blemishes I have has not decreased, the visibility of them has reduced greatly. I&#x27;ve also noticed that any large blemishes heal more quickly, but that my skin is more sensitive to dryness and sun. This is not a perfect fix for me, but it is better than my old regimen, so that&#x27;s good enough for now. Also, while it is a little pricey altogether, it lasts a while so it might end up costing less than my last regimen too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with acne since I was 13, I&#x27;m now 22, and this is the ONLY product that has worked well for me. Other products I&#x27;ve tried have only made my acne worse, or if it did clear it up then it dried out my skin so badly that I&#x27;d have to stop use as soon as it&#x27;d start to work. It completely cleared up my skin and prevented further breakouts from occurring. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this was a lifesaver for mine.</li>
            <li> This kit immediately began to work on my face, clearing my skin at the absolute worst time of the month. Philosophy is my new favorite company for both their skin care and their \\&quot;Kiss Me\\&quot; lip balm that is so moisturizing. I highly recommend these products to anyone struggling with their skin.</li>
            <li> I got my ACNE kit today from Sephora.com and this stuff rocks so far!  I just used it once and my skin already feels so soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have adult acne at age 25 years old. It started back when I was 22 around my chin area and the side of my face. I don&#x27;t have infestation of zits but I get those big painful ones that just hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting them to the point where popping them made me have all these yucky fading of spots where the old pimples used to be.  These pimples would start off red and then have the grand finale of pus oozing (don&#x27;t mean to be gross). I never had this problem in before and been battling it for the past 3 years.  I don&#x27;t know if it is my birth control or added stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything from MURAD, Shiesido, Clinque,Neutrogena, Aveeno and Pro-Active.  I don&#x27;t know if I was just not dedicated enough but they did&#x27;nt do any wonders...they might have controlled the acne to an extent but I need some kind of miracle!  I just want clear skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try Philosphy Acne Kit because I love there smelly bath and body line.  I also use the Shear Splendor hair care and it rocks!  The price is high but at this point I will try anything once!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use I notice my skin is softer, cleaner, and if feels like it is healing already!  I have 2 huge pimples right now and I applied that serum in the blue bottle.  Hopefully when I wake up in the morning they will be non-exsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just happy so far and will continue to process...maybe I will write another review in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my point is that even after initial use...I can already see and feel results.  I really hope this works out for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Philosophy!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit because hormonal acne hit me in my 40&#x27;s.  Whenever I used regular OTC acne products they always made me face feel dry, flaky, and red.  This kit is just AMAZING!  My face hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 13 and I&#x27;m 50.  The serum decongests my pores, tightens them, and stops any blackheads or whiteheads from forming.  The H202 cream and daily protector finish the process.  I can&#x27;t say enough good about this.  I am just so pleased. Even if I never have another breakout, I&#x27;ll still use it because it tones and brightens my face.  It&#x27;s that glow you always hear about, but never think it&#x27;ll happen to you.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have had mild to moderate acne for the last 20 years. This kit has cleared up my acne and is keeping my skin soft and smooth. I have been using it for almost a month now and have not had any drying effects. I do still develop an occasional blemish, but it is gone in a matter of days. I have tried many different acne kits and products over the years, but this has definately been the most effective. I feel like I am getting a handle on my adult acne and plan to continue purchasing Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this kit. My skin feels like velvet, new blemishes clear up in a day or 2, and my makeup goes on easier than ever. I love philosophy and I&#x27;ve just bought the booster shots kit to increas ethe effectivness. Philosophy has gotten me addicted to skincare</li>
            <li> There are pieces in this kit I like better than others (the face wash and the protection cream).  I don&#x27;t use the other products on a regular basis, at least not anymore.  I really feel this has helped clear up my skin.  I think trying the kit is a must because it is the best way to find out which of these products might work for you.  I have purchased the face wash, protection cream, and the H2O2 at seperate times after buying this kit.  The H2O2 cream does work well, but it will bleach your skin (however, not has much as something with benzoyl peroxide).  It also doesn&#x27;t aggervate my skin the say benzoyl peroxide does.  I don&#x27;t use the serum.  It doesn&#x27;t wear well under makeup, and the H2O2 is what I use at night if I need to spot treat.  However, my husband likes the serum.  Anyway, try it out.</li>
            <li> I am in my late twenties and started breaking out around my jawline and cheeks. I love Philosphy products so after researching what was out there I decide to try the Philosophy acne kit.     --------------------------------  On a Clear Day Super Wash (3 stars): not bad but I think Aveeno&#x27;s Clear Complexion Cleansing line works about the same for less.    Clear Day Blemish Serum (2 stars): You can feel this working. There is definitely a sting but causes redness and left me with acne scars. Boo!    On a Clear Day Hydrogen Peroxide Cream (4.5 stars): Love this stuff. It leaves your face nice and soft in the mornings. I actually stopped using the serum and placed the cream on my acne and got better results. It slowly brought my monster zit down. Knowing what I do now, I would probably buy this on it&#x27;s own.    On a Clear Day Protection Cream (1 star): I have no idea if this actually works. Applying it on my face did not help me from future break outs.    Overall the Philosophy Acne Kit help treat my acne but not prevent it.  --------------------------------    A couple days ago my co-worker game me a sample of PROACTIV cleanser and lotion. Even after my first use, my monster zit dramatically went down and nearly gone after three days. I was a real skeptic of Proactiv with all the celebrity spokespeople but what an amazing product line!!! If you are going to spend $47 on the Philosophy Acne Kit, spend an extra couple more dollars for Proactiv. Some Malls have the Proactiv machines so you can save on S&amp;H if you can find one.</li>
            <li> This philosophy kit really works for people with consistant light to moderate acne. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there-prescription topicals &amp; pills, Pro-activ, and all the over the counter stuff. I have adult acne, I never experienced acne as a teenager. When I first started using Philosophy&#x27;s kit I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change in the first few weeks, beyond pimples clearing up faster. Around week 5 or 6, I began to notice that I wasn&#x27;t waking up to a new zit every morning and I didn&#x27;t feel oily at the end of the day. Now, I have been using for 4 months and feel like a new person. I don&#x27;t have to cover my face with concealer or retouch make-up throughout the day. I can walk out the door with just powder on my face for the first time in years! I would recommend this kit to anyone who can&#x27;t use benzoyl peroxide and is frustrated with all the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> When I first got the set, I used it all the time.. for about three days. I get really lazy with too much steps. I am not a big fan of the lotion because I dont think it moisturizes enough, although it does make your skin feel soft. The facewash is okay, nothing stellar. Reminds me of stuff you get at the drug store.. and it leaves a funny smell on your face.    The blue stuff . . I have to admit when I first started using it i sort of saw a difference but didnt pay much attention to it. Well in the past week I  developed two angry cyst like pimples (you know, the kind you cant pop, but they&#x27;re huge and painful and red?). I had some clean and clear gel (drug store stuff) so i put some on for three days straight and NOTHING. Then i remembered I had this blue bottle and used it. And over night, i saw a difference. They are drying out and diminishing in size, pain, and redness. Since you only use a little at a time, this bottle can last you pretty much forever.. so really it is a pretty good bargain. :)</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks and I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied.  Other people have complained about it being too drying but my son is a little on the dry side to begin with and I haven&#x27;t had any problems  at all.  The one thing I will say is that I use all the products sparingly since the bottles are kind of small and I want to make it last.  In addition I do use Hope in a jar at night when I do start to feel a bit dry.    The other thing is that I have always battled mild adult acne and I am still getting occasional breakouts, its not like all of a sudden my skin is flawless but when I do breakout it lasts a shorter period which is good.    I really love the On a Clear Day lotion, under makeup it really does help to give a very flawless look.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve already been on Acutane.  I&#x27;d been searching for a product that would help eliminate the acne I still get but also help normalize my skin.  This product is expensive but effective for those who are willing to commit to the four step process.  For those who have tried other products but still experience the dry, oily patches, I would whole-heartedly urge you to take a shot with this kit.  If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you can always return the portion you don&#x27;t use.  The cons are certainly that it is time intensive and pricey.  The pros are clearer and softer skin without a trip to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I tried this kit after reading some positive reviews.  I break out monthly and have very sensitive skin. I cannot use products with benzol peroxide because it becomes dry and itchy.  I do not have that problem with this kit.  I&#x27;ve gotten great results and I don&#x27;t even use the products every day.  I recommend this kit if you sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Hi, I just wanted to let everyone out their know: that this stuff works.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have had problematic hormonal acne since the age of 21. I&#x27;m 27 now.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about). Unfortunately for me, I am allergic to benzyl peroxide and I have extremely sensitive skin. I also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like a tomato or is ineffective and I have painful acne bumps...which would you rather do?). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes. But, after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - I decided to give it a try. Hell, what&#x27;s another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I started using it about 3 weeks ago and my skin has had a tremendous transformation. I finally feel like my acne is under control. I recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size. The blemish serum is extremely drying, so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don&#x27;t reapply throughout the day, until your skin is ready. The day and night face creams are cool. The day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day! That&#x27;s why it works, because it is on your face until night time when you wash (I can even faintly smell the product). Then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream, yes not benzyl. Yeah, this cream is intense as well. So take it slow until your skin is ready.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One thing that I do recommend is that if you wear make-up, use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser. That&#x27;s what I do and it works for me - so I will share it with you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another thing I do is I will take a little bit of the hope is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas. Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer can help hydrate the area around the acne. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well that&#x27;s about it. I hope this helps you and let&#x27;s you know that your acne can be tamed and doesn&#x27;t have to run your life.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Take care, &lt;br /&gt;M. Rodriguez &lt;br /&gt;Surprise, AZ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for about 3 months and have noticed that I break out less.  However, I still have the small pimples on my forehead and they don&#x27;t seem to be going away.  My sister also purchased this kit and has returned it, didn&#x27;t work for her at all.  Overall, I think it has helped my complexion, but my search is still on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product. I had never used Philosophy before but I feel it is one of the best overall treatments out there! I have already told friends about it and I would recommend that if you have tried everything and are looking for a healthy, natural, and effective way to help your skin look and feel it&#x27;s best this may be it. It has decreased my breakouts and when I do have one, the blue serum seems to quicken the healing time a lot! I will stick with Philosophy in the future:)</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne all over my face since puberty, and nothing I have ever tried has given me long-term results the way that Philosophy Acne kit has.  I have tried literally EVERY brand on the drugstore shelf, as well as Proactiv, and was even prescribed something by my doctor.  Something was always left to be desired- either it dried my skin out, made my skin oily, saw no results at all, or just broke out more.  And proactiv is the most worthless, waste of money crap of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I held off on trying Philosophy simply because of the price.  I finally gave in, because I thought, \\&quot;Maybe this is the one that will finally work for me.\\&quot;  It is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are four products in the kit, but there are two moisturizers.  One is for morning, one is for night.  It seems from reading the other reviews that some people are using both at the same time, which might be why they are not seeing the same reluts.  The face wash is amazing, so refreshing, and it really cleans my face without either drying it out or leving a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the shining star of the kit is the \\&quot;on a clear day\\&quot; blemish serum, in the pretty blue bottle.  If i feel a blemish starting to form, I make sure to put some on the area right away, and it really just shrinks it up before it has a chance to show on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly ever review anything, but I loved this product so much, and had such a hard time finding the right product, that I just had to put this out there.  I will be a Philosophy girl for life!</li>
