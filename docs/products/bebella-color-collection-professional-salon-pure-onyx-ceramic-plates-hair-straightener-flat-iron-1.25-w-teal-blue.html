            <li> I have really thick hair [ for those who are familiar with hair</li>
            <li> My last straightener still left some wave in my hair (which I usually don&#x27;t mind), and this one gets it REALLY straight.</li>
            <li> Regular drug store flat irons do not straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Received a day later than expected...</li>

            <li> At times my hair will be a little damp.</li>
            <li> Since the plates don&#x27;t open up wide, it makes it a little difficult to change the temp.</li>
            <li> It took a few hrs and some coconut oil before the scent went away.</li>
            <li> My only dislike is that the straightener was dusty and it has small scratches on the handle.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing is when i received it ,it came a little scratched up and the first use you smell an weird odor</li>
            <li> Feels big and awkward in the hand; leaves my hair frizzy</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, on her request, and she hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, not too thin.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I bought a 90 dollar straightener like this one, and after it being stolen, I was in desperate need to find another one.</li>

            <li> Wonderful product. Best I&#x27;ve owned. I like the adjustable heat dial.</li>
            <li> Received a day later than expected... Just opened package. Nice packaging.. nice color . Has a plasticky smell. Will write another review after use... On mine and my daughters hair</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece and she loves ie.</li>
            <li> Beautiful straightener an the price just perfect! #Enough said</li>
            <li> It gets hot and straightens well.  You have to be careful to keep it perfectly straight so you don&#x27;t get any unwanted kinks.  I don&#x27;t like the on off button inside the straightener.  I wish that was on the outside.</li>
            <li> I am happy, happy, happy, with my purchase. I have really thick hair [ for those who are familiar with hair btw 3C- 4B hair]. Regular drug store flat irons do not straighten my hair. They don&#x27;t get hot enough and the plates are usually metal, not ceramic despite what they say.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been searching for a reasonably price, quality flat iron and I have found it. If I ever need to purchase a new flat iron BeBella will be where I come. The price is perfect. I can&#x27;t say it enough I am so happy. Love this flat iron. It leaves my hair shinny and super straight.  It also does amazing barrel curls. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing, I love how hot it gets leaves hair smooth, just love it.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it.  Now she does not have to borrow her mother&#x27;s and it is the right color.</li>
            <li> I bought a 90 dollar straightener like this one, and after it being stolen, I was in desperate need to find another one. I found it!! This product is great, and I love how fast it came.</li>
            <li> I received it today. Packing is really nice. Comes with a User manual. It has Dual voltage 110-240V, so it is great for travel. Good quality Ceramic plates. Adjustable heat, heats up to 460 F.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair.  Not too thick, not too thin. In the morning my hair is a mess because I wash my hair at night. At times my hair will be a little damp. This is the only straightener that straightens my hair the first time and looks and feels great. Very nice product and I&#x27;m hoping it will last a while. The only downfall is that the on and off button is on the inside, so just be careful.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it is built solid. My last straightener still left some wave in my hair (which I usually don&#x27;t mind), and this one gets it REALLY straight. Maybe too straight for me since it takes away body and volume at the same time. My main gripe with the straightener is the poor design - the on/off switch and temp setting are between the two plates. Since the plates don&#x27;t open up wide, it makes it a little difficult to change the temp. They should have been placed on the outside of the unit.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my daughter, who likes it. Works as well as a Chi.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly. I don&#x27;t  like the smell of frying my natural hair. It took a few hrs and some coconut oil before the scent went away.</li>
