            <li>Shea butter is so versatile for so many skin problems everyone should have some around the house.</li>
            <li>I love everything about Shea butter: it has so many uses and benefits.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a top notch Shea Butter</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a top notch Shea Butter</li>
            <li>All you have to do is make sure that the shea butter is at room temperature before you start.</li>
            <li>butter is better purchased unrefined or grade</li>
            <li>So when I got this I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li>Then I used it on my lips and my worked better then some lip balms.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>healthy body butter.  </li>
            <li>I have used many products with shea butter in them and they are always so nourishing to my skin.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>Smells good, feels right</li>
            <li>I used it to make a lotion out of essential oils and it blended very nicely!</li>
            <li>I received a discount on this product for reviewing it, but am ordering more at full price!</li>
            <li>The Shea butter is easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t have any overwhelming smells.</li>
            <li>I really love this Shea butter, it was easy to melt and make body butter with.</li>
            <li>When making creams, salves and lotions, you really need a good Shea butter, and even better if you mash it with cocoa</li>
            <li>I have been using majestic pure shea butter from the day i received as you can see frkm the picture, it melts easily in my hand, the best thing about majestic product  is that they offer pure organic items</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see this shea butter arrive perfectly intact in hot, steamy August, but, it did.</li>
            <li>so I was delighted to have had the opportunity to review this Shea Butter by Majestic Pure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That was easy, went on like silk, absorbed very well and smelled very nice without being very strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to just be able to use it as a body cream without having to melt it and whip it first.</li>
            <li>and it def seems to do a great job helping with that and keeping the, soft and moisturized .</li>
            <li>I love the smooth, non-greasy way it went on</li>
            <li>(this is important - you won&#x27;t be able to whip it up if they&#x27;re still too liquid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Your body heat will melt/soften the bars just enough to give you some good lotion to apply anywhere, even your lips!</li>
            <li>I recieved this product in a timely manner, and it&#x27;s a full pound of Shea Butter!  </li>
            <li>It melts quite easily when you rub it in your palm.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my legs, arms, and face and it rubs in quite easily.</li>
            <li>No oily leftovers and easy to wash off in the shower/</li>
            <li>This is great, I have melted almost the whole block over 2 weeks and have had nothing but success with it.</li>
            <li>is easy to store, cut and measure for my homemade products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using Shea butter in a tub, and it&#x27;s easy to remove and handle.</li>
            <li>This is also easy to use since you can just easily cut a piece off and rub it between your palms to melt.</li>
            <li>I love shea butter specially for&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>I’ve heard so many wonderful things about pure shea butter that I simply couldn’t resist seeing for myself when I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a reduced price for the purposes of an unbiased evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Beautiful block of white shea butter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many cool ways to use shea butter.  </li>
            <li>And it melted down perfectly for my lotions.  </li>
            <li>always make sure you are getting the high quality organic kind like this if you want to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Majestic pure shea butter is one of the top quality shea butter you will find on the market!</li>
            <li>I have to say the product was fine when I opened it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on my roots to help add some volume to my fine hair as well as soften my cuticles and heels between my mani/pedi</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with this shea butter as I have found that it is much better than some others that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and the item arrived as shown the picture!</li>
            <li>It is still a reasonable price for what you get, and seems to be good quality shea butter, however, do be aware that you may be getting more like 12 oz, not 16.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Shea Butter from Majestic Pure for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bar.</li>
            <li>*was* a huge lotion bar.  </li>
            <li>If you are making lotions like me, then this is a HUGE plus.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It seems just to melt into my skin and leave it feeling so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li>DISCLAIMER: FREE OR DISCOUNTED PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am thankful I found such great quality product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, and not grainy.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product and have already recommended it to some friends.</li>
            <li>This shea butter smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is such an excellent natural anti-aging and moisturizing agent for the skin with so many beneficial qualities that I could go on &amp; on...</li>
            <li>Came nicely packaged and ready to use.</li>
            <li>I put it on my hands and it made them so silky smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This alone filled me with confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got this for free for a review.</li>
            <li>I love how this smelled right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the not so great smell that many shea butters have and while raw, there are no impurities in it which I love.</li>
            <li>this product in particular is very high quality, and worked great for me in all</li>
            <li>It is almost scentless and creamy, rich and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I believe you will be as pleased with Majestic Pure Shea Butter as I am!</li>
            <li>I’m going to share some of this block with my family and will happily purchase the next a full price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people that mosquitoes find delicious, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to the venom, hence huge itchy bumps that last forever</li>
            <li>I live the smell and the fact that it is organic made me love it even more.</li>
            <li>If feels great to put on your face right after you shower, and is super mild and basically unscented, and not harsh at all!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>I was able to share it with a friend who also was interested in the organic shea butter.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with shea butter and a post to an online forum</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a significant difference.</li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy and moisturizes</li>
            <li>I originally applied to receive this product to review it so that I could give a shot at making something to help with my acne.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal... Makes my skin super soft with s beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>, clean pressed  </li>
            <li>I have used it on mosquito bites and for itchy dry skin with great results.</li>
            <li>It absorbed easily into the skin and made it feel silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my dry cracked feet as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just great for dry skin, either.</li>
            <li>Put whipped lotion into clean jars and close.</li>
            <li>, it is great for dry skin conditions, and&lt;br /&gt;even chapped lips, and cuticles.</li>
            <li>I did order mine through a special promotion to test it and share my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>My Majestic Pure organic shea butter came packaged safely with nothing leaking.  </li>
            <li>Im in love with this Pure Grade A Unrefined Organic Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>and it blended right in!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting to see how it comes as a solid, yet melts very easily.  </li>
            <li>and it is the perfect consistency: not too hard, not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I store this in a cool place so that it won&#x27;t melt.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>but I would paid full sale price for it.</li>
            <li>I make my own natural hair products and have been using the beauty supply store shea butter in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feels good and you can customize it for your skin type with just a tiny bit of research.</li>
            <li>Thanks. :)</li>
            <li>I then let mine sit on my counter to cool</li>
            <li>or you could put in the fridge to cool.</li>
            <li>a saucepan halfway full with water.  </li>
            <li>Fill a saucepan halfway full with water.  </li>
            <li>Nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Stir it up and let it cool.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to that for sure, but it did seem to help, and I am VERY prone to allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you never feel that you&#x27;ve gotten the full amount of shea for your money,</li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh, and is well packaged.</li>
            <li>quickly yielded advice on how to make it into things like lotion bars</li>
            <li>and I quickly realized it already</li>
            <li>I want to start off this review with a quick statement.</li>
            <li>I have used it as a salve on my elbows with it in its natural state, but I enjoy it most in my body butters.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I was extremely impressed with the raw and pure contents of how this shea butter block was made.</li>
            <li>large number of the best skin products contain some for of Shea, therefore I knew I could achieve maximum results using the Shea in its raw form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is perfect for summer time, where we need more moisture since our skin tends to be dry due to the harmful sun rays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shea butter came in a 1 lb mold in a box, it looks cleans and quite appealing for something in its original natural state, that was a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which is very evident when I shave.</li>
            <li>but this is rather large and can easily be shared amongst friends and family.</li>
            <li>So I wiped together a couple jars of my new magic lotion, gave some to friends and family</li>
            <li>your own lip balm or lotion bars: mix in a microwave bowl 3 parts solid butters (shea butter, cocoa butter), 3 parts oils (coconut oil, olive oil, sweet almond oil, argan oil</li>
            <li>or bigger empty clean jar&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to melt the shea butter at all which is awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in making my own soaps, lotions, deodorants with natural ingredients for some time.</li>
            <li>Her hair after using the Shea butter is softer which is amazing because we have tried so many other products to moisturizer and soften her hair!</li>
            <li>being said, I&#x27;ve now used it to make lip balm and lotion bars several times, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Super soft and smooth skin!</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure Grade A Unrefined Organic Shea Butter was made available to me at a reduced price for a impartial review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I got this product for free or at a reduced price to try it out I would recommend the majestic pure shea butter to anyone.</li>
            <li>It is such an amazing product</li>
            <li>I added a few drops of essential oils to my shea butter and it smells amazing and works great.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it can help calm inflamed skin including eczema and acne (teens anyone?) and also reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I have used it everyday with great success since.</li>
            <li>talk about FRESH.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li>Boy, was this worth the wait.</li>
            <li>You truly will love the feeling of how soft your skin it</li>
            <li>All opinions and thoughts are my own and honest.buy essential oils)  </li>
            <li>favorite skin product is aloe Vera which I also use in its natural state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most obscure: clear congestion.</li>
            <li>IT WHIPS QUITE NICELY WITH ESSENTIAL OILS</li>
            <li>shes butter does a better job of keeping my lips soft.</li>
            <li>If your looking for FRESH this is the store.  </li>
            <li>I love using this on my skin; it makes my skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I got this to review for my nephew he has sever exema and none of the soaps worked so far well glad to say this did immediately stopped the itching and after a couple of days redness is diminishing</li>
            <li>: I received this product complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li>and you know it is super hot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinda of raw shea butter, but this brand is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The other ingredients that are believed to be good for acne are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its miracle working stuff... just soaks right into my skin..</li>
            <li>Looking for the right thing to use for my kids psoriasis and excema issues on the face and arms so this was recommended by a friend.  </li>
            <li>After researching online, I know it&#x27;s the right color and scent.  </li>
            <li>The smell is right on track with what shea butter should be.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter smells and feels exactly the same as the kind he gave me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells great, is easily sliced or broken apart to make what you like.&lt;br /&gt;Although  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice, solid, pure block.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is really a lot of product, I have to look at the other reviews to get recipes on how to use it to the max, of course I will use it as is also, great buy, thanks</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the smell but its all natural so that the good benefit..</li>
            <li>shea butter and beeswax are nearly melted, add coconut oil (which will melt very quickly).</li>
            <li>Its all about quality when it comes to 100% natural African Shea butter, and this one is definitely good quality.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t melt even though it sat outside all day in the summer heat of Southern California, but I was able to easily scrape off a piece with my finger and it absorbed quickly into my skin without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love working with it and think it would be hard, if not impossible to find a better Shea Butter than this.  </li>
            <li>I love working with it and think it would be hard, if not impossible to find a better Shea Butter than this.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d say this is a decent block of shea butter if you want to get into making your own lotions.</li>
            <li>I own several essential oils from Majestic Pure and absolutely love them, so when I was offered the opportunity to buy their Organic Shea Butter at a promotional price for my evaluation and review I readily accepted.</li>
            <li>When the Shea butter arrived, I was surprised by its size-literally, the size of a huge brick.</li>
            <li>Most people might have allergies to mass produced personal care product&lt;</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter has been the only product to achieve that level of softness which I am satisfied with.</li>
            <li>When I first received it, I scraped a bit off and rubbed it in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I used it first thing in the morning and at 10 PM that night</li>
            <li>It arrived and the first difference I saw was that it was literally a brick of shea butter.</li>
            <li>My favorite way to use shea butter is a very simple recipe.</li>
            <li>After experiencing the texture of my skin after the first use, I am keeping some of it out to use as a skin treatment.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying and using Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>and I often have chapped lips and don&#x27;t care for most of the products currently on the market that I have tried.</li>
            <li>You can also make so many different products out of this.  </li>
            <li>skin will be smooth with a natural glow, I just started using the Shea in this form</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hoping for the same or even better results, knowing I am leaving out all the additional chemicals added to products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this she butter, it has the nutty smell but not overwhelming like most.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I  used a butter knife.</li>
            <li>The processing is also what burns off a lot of the benefits of Shea butter, so I&#x27;m OK with some occasional grittiness.  </li>
            <li>No one wants to pick stuff out of their shea butter!</li>
            <li>Unrefined shea butter is a multi-use miracle drug, and Majestic Pure Grade did it right.</li>
            <li>She stores it in our hot garage</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have any weird spots on it and it smelled absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely moisturizer that will not clog your pores and has numerous benefits.</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin feels so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Will be back for more</li>
            <li>Received fast!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it was packed the greatest</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The quality is way higher when you purchase it in the block like this.</li>
            <li>First  off I used it on my skin.</li>
            <li>it is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>My first shea butter.  </li>
            <li>The block was big enough that I was able to share it with my son who was very excited to have it.</li>
            <li>solid block, looks clean and smells clean.</li>
            <li>Came super fast with Amazon prime shipping, and was really well packaged</li>
            <li>I never tried natural shea butter and what a difference it makes!!!!</li>
            <li>It comes nicely packaged and will last for a very long time and it easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>This butter is pure and I feel safe knowing is organic, melts evenly in my double boil pans.</li>
            <li>This comes in a nice 1lb size and it is soft enough to where you don&#x27;t have to do anything but use your hands to get some from the 1 lb block .</li>
            <li>It also provides a fabulous soft and gentle soap that I have make.</li>
            <li>First of all, I couldn&#x27;t believe how large of a box that you receive.  </li>
            <li>if you’d like more of a “whipped” body butter lotion then put the oil in a kitchen aid stand mixer and mix on high for several minutes until the eczema cream looks like whipped butter.  </li>
            <li>You can use the eczema cream at this point, but if you’d like more of a “whipped” body butter lotion then put the oil in a kitchen aid stand mixer and mix on high for several minutes until the eczema cream looks like whipped butter.  </li>
            <li>I got this massive bar of pure Shea butter at an extremely reduced price for the purpose of review, but honestly the price listed now (14.95) is still ridiculously cheap for what you get.  </li>
            <li>I realized that this is a characteristic of a fresher and more nutrient-packed butter.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure’s Shea Butter is the finest Shea butter I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>If you are wanting something to add to your medicine cabinet, get this Shea Butter Bar from Majestic Pure.</li>
            <li>had never used pure shea butter before but have used it as an ingredient in a number of products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Majestic Pure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Majestic Pure provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on well and smells pure and feels</li>
            <li>This shea butter is from MAJESTIC PURE</li>
            <li>Pure sent me a discounted sample to review.</li>
            <li>This block of shea butter is large and came well packaged.</li>
            <li>Tbsp Majestic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil</li>
            <li>Add 2 Tbsp Majestic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil &amp; pulse (or mash)</li>
            <li>and I never had added Shea Butter before, but I knew I was getting this Shea Butter from Majestic Pure, so I started looking up recipes</li>
            <li>/&gt;10-15 drops your favorite essential oil, if you need it to smell pretty (I like orange, or sandalwood for something a little more</li>
            <li>/&gt;My most urgent need for this product is for my dry heels (there may be hope yet!)</li>
            <li>The Majestic Pure Unrefined Organic Shea Butter is absolutely as stated.  </li>
            <li>Really like the large block.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema and and have always known that shea butter is very helpful, so I always bought lotion with shea butter.</li>
            <li>IT LEFT MY SKIN FEELING SMOOTH AND HYDRATED.</li>
            <li>We ended up making Shea Lotion Bars, which were very simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rub the bars straight onto my lips, just like lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I just got this product and have not used it for a whole week yet.</li>
            <li>my skin is saying thank you so very</li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>I know that&#x27;s probably a no-brainer, but I have areas like my feet that even petroleum jelly couldn&#x27;t help, and the shea butter cleared it up fast.</li>
            <li>this came packaged very well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, packaged very well</li>
            <li>and I have used it straight off of the block.</li>
            <li>MUCH</li>
            <li>I did take some of the Shea Butter and used it on my hands straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>When you touch it, it really feels like butter.</li>
            <li>and it really help soften the skin.</li>
            <li>and I my skin felt really hydrated.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your generosity in allowing me to review your products.</li>
            <li>I’ve only ever tried shea butter that was one ingredient, among others, in some kind of commercial blend.  </li>
            <li>I transfered some into a tub that I had with a lid and take a dime size everyday, warm it up between my palms and rub the rest on my hair.</li>
            <li>I liked how Smooth the Block felt, and I had no problem slicing off a thin piece.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin along with my special needs adult children and am in awe with this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it I ate half of it when I first received it</li>
            <li>It is not strong, so I don&#x27;t expect to have any problems masking it with my own fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased from other places, but this is definitely one that shows superior qualities.&lt;br /&gt;Majestic</li>
            <li>There are other essential oils that are also good for acne also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not strong.</li>
            <li>I believe you will be as pleased with Majestic Pure Shea Butter as I am!an average shelf life of 12-18 months.  </li>
            <li>I highly doubt the light scent will transfer over into items that are scented properly.</li>
            <li>In my journey to live a more simple and natural lifestyle, i decided to use it to make a lotion and hair mask.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter was easy to cut as needed and I liked that because the rubbed Shea butter is difficult to portion out.</li>
            <li>I break out less and my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li>I made a Shea cream with sweet almond oil, olive oil, vitamin e, rosemary, rosehip, juniper and frankincense essential oils.</li>
            <li>~ then let it cool an add a bit of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I always make my own lip balm, I have now for the past couple years</li>
            <li>There are so many other recipes I want to try!</li>
            <li>For straight to the skin Shea butter, I just bought a new brand that does have that consistency</li>
            <li>There is so much you can use this for I am learning and trying new things all the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge believer in the power of Shea butter and use it on my scars, dry skin and in my hair.</li>
            <li>Shea Butter contains natural vitamins, antioxidants and fatty acids make it amazingly nourishing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>also mixed up a quick batch of Eczema Cream to give to a family friend of ours for her son.</li>
            <li>It is a decent price for the one pound block.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS DECENT AND ITS OFFERED WITH THE SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE PRIME OPTION.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Add the vitamin c oil and wipe on HIGH for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the water over medium high heat ( not</li>

            <li>2 minutes (or mix on high speed for about 5 minutes if doing in bowl) until mixture is creamy and well blended</li>
            <li>It immediately melted into a creamy, rich oil that left my hands feeling soft and protected.</li>
            <li>The airways of those using the shea butter (versus nasal drops or petroleum jelly) became clear within 30 to 90 seconds of application, and remained so for 5 to 8 hours, better than other methods.  </li>
            <li>So far I have no complaints with the Majestic Pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>(I just used a large glass bowl sitting on top of a small pot of water.</li>
            <li>Because I’m very scent sensitive, sometimes products</li>
            <li>Jojoba for oily, combination, or normal.</li>
            <li>Primrose for normal skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, I use it on my face everyday</li>
            <li>The shea was fresh and a held a yellow tinge (Grade B-cosmetic use only-not for consumption).</li>
            <li>I know of a few people that would love this for a gift.</li>
            <li>As a result, I was very excited to try Shea butter as a moisturizer in my everyday routine.</li>
            <li>lotion bars from molds and store in a cool, dry place.</li>
            <li>and then when melted it melted down easily also.  </li>
            <li>I live in AZ and my mail carrier never comes to the door.</li>
            <li>will definitely lasts me a very very long time, I am currently thinking of using it to make my own hand</li>
            <li>clean and empty 4 oz jars with lid liners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I wanted to find something natural to help moisturize gently and naturally and ease the itch, and this shea butter did just the trick.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter melted nicely and the stiff smell that it has didn&#x27;t transfer over to the final product.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a solid block of Shea, and I wasn&#x27;t intimidated at all.  </li>
            <li>I was plenty surprised that it survived the heat of the south, was well packaged, and didn&#x27;t melt all over the inside of the box (or out of it for that matter!).</li>
            <li>He stated that is was better quality then he had gotten in the past from another supplier.</li>
            <li>Store in clean, dry, dark and cool place.</li>
            <li>Gone are the days of my dry natural curls, but now, with daily use on my scalp and ends my curls are so springy and full of life!</li>
            <li>I love the small of the natural product too.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter is notoriously hard in block form but this product was very manageable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This block of Shea butter comes nicely compressed and very hard, and wrapped in a plastic material.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure Grade Shea butter is such a versatile product.</li>
            <li>I like the texture, and how clean the Shea butter melted down.  </li>
            <li>I used the majestic pure shea butter mainly for my stretch marks and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Rubbing a little on your skin after melting in  your hand (as the directions state) really works wonders!!!</li>
            <li>Its so soft and fresh made, unlike harder versions that have set around awhile.  </li>
            <li>So soothing and does not irritate my sensitive skin or my sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>far mor uses than I can name in this review.</li>
            <li>OZ Olive Oil or Coconut Oil (completely up to</li>
            <li>oh my skin is so soft.. been using it on my heels and elbows..</li>
            <li>Nothing like getting a natural product to use on your cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>and it actually worked really well.</li>
            <li>This one is so smooth on the skin I will use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve so far been using it on my body</li>
            <li>I have been making healthier lifestyle choices, and researched natural moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I whipped it in the mixer, along with almond oil to a soft butter consistency.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to my shea butter being soft and malleable.</li>
            <li>I use it on scars to naturally help collagen production.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten that far, however, I have tried the butter just as it is.</li>
            <li>We also plan on using it this summer for a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve made homemade deodorant and hand soaps.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m surprised that I haven&#x27;t tried this before.</li>
            <li>This 1lb of all natural Shea butter is helping to keep my skin moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Since I was tired of paying high prices for various lotions, I decided to try making my own.</li>
            <li>, this is a wonderful product I put some on my cat because he was scathing when he came indoors one day, now he lays down and lets me apply it</li>
            <li>an this high quality shea butter is definitely  one of those</li>
            <li>I love using it plain on dry elbows and heels, plus also directly on my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>Beware if you live in a hot location and order during the summer, as one other reviewer said this will make the product melty!</li>
            <li>melt.&lt;br /&gt;Remove the jar and cool for a few minutes to about room temp before adding in the oils.&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li>Remove the jar and cool for a few minutes to about room temp before adding in the oils.</li>
            <li>I really like to use shea butter to help with dry skin.</li>
            <li>so it really works for dry skin.</li>
            <li>:I don&#x27;t really like the scent of shea butter, but when I add some essential oils such as lavender or coconut oil.</li>
            <li>A recent summer sunburn left me with super dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>I love it and a little goes a long way so it will last awhile.</li>
            <li>Since using the shea butter several times a day I find my skin to be very soft</li>
            <li>The arm I put the shea butter on was quite soft after a full day, while my other arm had already started to dry out.</li>
            <li>Because Shea Butter has such a large healing fraction, in addition to moisturizing fraction, regular use of this natural cream can treat many skin problems, including blemishes, wrinkles, itching, sunburns, small skin wounds, eczema, skin allergies, insect bites, frost bite, and other skin conditions.</li>
            <li>I first tried the Shea alone without mixing with other oils.</li>
            <li>Room temperature is generally fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you open it up and touch it its truly buttery soft.</li>
            <li>This block is a soft solid with no need to cut and melt for use.  </li>
            <li>The one thing to remember is that it is a natural product so may feel gritty.</li>
            <li>With a small amount of stirring it is easily incorporated into other creams or emulsified for direct use on the skin or in hair.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like the product and the brick</li>
            <li>There is no real discernible scent other than the mild one of the butter itself.</li>
            <li>If you follow my reviews, I think you will see that I am very big into homemade, natural products in a big way.</li>
            <li>Unrefined may feel a little grainy at first</li>
            <li>Continue for a few more minutes, or until it looks kinda like whipped cream, forming stiff peaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took a few weeks to first use up Shea</li>
            <li>I struggle with cracked heels for years from using slippers everyday, living in Hawaii we are always hot.</li>
            <li>block I received did have a slight odor that I didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li>Today is the May 23, 2015 and this product was made May 14, 2015 with a shelf life of three years, but it’s not going to last anywhere near that long for me.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has little to no scent and is very high quality.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Majestic Pure Grade A Unrefined Organic Shea Butter because I have seen a few things on Pinterest that we have wanted to make with it.</li>

            <li> Love this shea butter.</li>
            <li> TRY IT! :)</li>
            <li> Shea butter is so versatile for so many skin problems everyone should have some around the house.</li>
            <li> I love everything about Shea butter: it has so many uses and benefits.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a top notch Shea Butter</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a top notch Shea Butter</li>
            <li> All you have to do is make sure that the shea butter is at room temperature before you start.</li>
            <li> butter is better purchased unrefined or grade</li>
            <li> So when I got this I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> Then I used it on my lips and my worked better then some lip balms.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> healthy body butter.  </li>
            <li> I have used many products with shea butter in them and they are always so nourishing to my skin.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels right</li>
            <li> I used it to make a lotion out of essential oils and it blended very nicely!</li>
            <li> I received a discount on this product for reviewing it, but am ordering more at full price!</li>
            <li> The Shea butter is easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t have any overwhelming smells.</li>
            <li> I really love this Shea butter, it was easy to melt and make body butter with.</li>
            <li> When making creams, salves and lotions, you really need a good Shea butter, and even better if you mash it with cocoa</li>
            <li> I have been using majestic pure shea butter from the day i received as you can see frkm the picture, it melts easily in my hand, the best thing about majestic product  is that they offer pure organic items</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see this shea butter arrive perfectly intact in hot, steamy August, but, it did.</li>
            <li> so I was delighted to have had the opportunity to review this Shea Butter by Majestic Pure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was easy, went on like silk, absorbed very well and smelled very nice without being very strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to just be able to use it as a body cream without having to melt it and whip it first.</li>
            <li> and it def seems to do a great job helping with that and keeping the, soft and moisturized .</li>
            <li> I love the smooth, non-greasy way it went on</li>
            <li> (this is important - you won&#x27;t be able to whip it up if they&#x27;re still too liquid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs really well and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Your body heat will melt/soften the bars just enough to give you some good lotion to apply anywhere, even your lips!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product in a timely manner, and it&#x27;s a full pound of Shea Butter!  </li>
            <li> It melts quite easily when you rub it in your palm.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my legs, arms, and face and it rubs in quite easily.</li>
            <li> No oily leftovers and easy to wash off in the shower/</li>
            <li> This is great, I have melted almost the whole block over 2 weeks and have had nothing but success with it.</li>
            <li> is easy to store, cut and measure for my homemade products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using Shea butter in a tub, and it&#x27;s easy to remove and handle.</li>
            <li> This is also easy to use since you can just easily cut a piece off and rub it between your palms to melt.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter specially for&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> I’ve heard so many wonderful things about pure shea butter that I simply couldn’t resist seeing for myself when I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a reduced price for the purposes of an unbiased evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Beautiful block of white shea butter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are so many cool ways to use shea butter.  </li>
            <li> And it melted down perfectly for my lotions.  </li>
            <li> always make sure you are getting the high quality organic kind like this if you want to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Majestic pure shea butter is one of the top quality shea butter you will find on the market!</li>
            <li> I have to say the product was fine when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my roots to help add some volume to my fine hair as well as soften my cuticles and heels between my mani/pedi</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this shea butter as I have found that it is much better than some others that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and the item arrived as shown the picture!</li>
            <li> It is still a reasonable price for what you get, and seems to be good quality shea butter, however, do be aware that you may be getting more like 12 oz, not 16.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this Shea Butter from Majestic Pure for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bar.</li>
            <li> *was* a huge lotion bar.  </li>
            <li> If you are making lotions like me, then this is a HUGE plus.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It seems just to melt into my skin and leave it feeling so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: FREE OR DISCOUNTED PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am thankful I found such great quality product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, and not grainy.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product and have already recommended it to some friends.</li>
            <li> This shea butter smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is such an excellent natural anti-aging and moisturizing agent for the skin with so many beneficial qualities that I could go on &amp; on...</li>
            <li> Came nicely packaged and ready to use.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hands and it made them so silky smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This alone filled me with confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got this for free for a review.</li>
            <li> I love how this smelled right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the not so great smell that many shea butters have and while raw, there are no impurities in it which I love.</li>
            <li> this product in particular is very high quality, and worked great for me in all</li>
            <li> It is almost scentless and creamy, rich and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I believe you will be as pleased with Majestic Pure Shea Butter as I am!</li>
            <li> I’m going to share some of this block with my family and will happily purchase the next a full price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that mosquitoes find delicious, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to the venom, hence huge itchy bumps that last forever</li>
            <li> I live the smell and the fact that it is organic made me love it even more.</li>
            <li> If feels great to put on your face right after you shower, and is super mild and basically unscented, and not harsh at all!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I was able to share it with a friend who also was interested in the organic shea butter.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with shea butter and a post to an online forum</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a significant difference.</li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy and moisturizes</li>
            <li> I originally applied to receive this product to review it so that I could give a shot at making something to help with my acne.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal... Makes my skin super soft with s beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> , clean pressed  </li>
            <li> I have used it on mosquito bites and for itchy dry skin with great results.</li>
            <li> It absorbed easily into the skin and made it feel silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my dry cracked feet as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just great for dry skin, either.</li>
            <li> Put whipped lotion into clean jars and close.</li>
            <li> , it is great for dry skin conditions, and&lt;br /&gt;even chapped lips, and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I did order mine through a special promotion to test it and share my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> My Majestic Pure organic shea butter came packaged safely with nothing leaking.  </li>
            <li> Im in love with this Pure Grade A Unrefined Organic Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> and it blended right in!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting to see how it comes as a solid, yet melts very easily.  </li>
            <li> and it is the perfect consistency: not too hard, not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I store this in a cool place so that it won&#x27;t melt.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> but I would paid full sale price for it.</li>
            <li> I make my own natural hair products and have been using the beauty supply store shea butter in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels good and you can customize it for your skin type with just a tiny bit of research.</li>
            <li> Thanks. :)</li>
            <li> I then let mine sit on my counter to cool</li>
            <li> or you could put in the fridge to cool.</li>
            <li> a saucepan halfway full with water.  </li>
            <li> Fill a saucepan halfway full with water.  </li>
            <li> Nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Stir it up and let it cool.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to that for sure, but it did seem to help, and I am VERY prone to allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you never feel that you&#x27;ve gotten the full amount of shea for your money,</li>
            <li> It smells clean and fresh, and is well packaged.</li>
            <li> quickly yielded advice on how to make it into things like lotion bars</li>
            <li> and I quickly realized it already</li>
            <li> I want to start off this review with a quick statement.</li>
            <li> I have used it as a salve on my elbows with it in its natural state, but I enjoy it most in my body butters.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with the raw and pure contents of how this shea butter block was made.</li>
            <li> large number of the best skin products contain some for of Shea, therefore I knew I could achieve maximum results using the Shea in its raw form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is perfect for summer time, where we need more moisture since our skin tends to be dry due to the harmful sun rays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shea butter came in a 1 lb mold in a box, it looks cleans and quite appealing for something in its original natural state, that was a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which is very evident when I shave.</li>
            <li> but this is rather large and can easily be shared amongst friends and family.</li>
            <li> So I wiped together a couple jars of my new magic lotion, gave some to friends and family</li>
            <li> your own lip balm or lotion bars: mix in a microwave bowl 3 parts solid butters (shea butter, cocoa butter), 3 parts oils (coconut oil, olive oil, sweet almond oil, argan oil</li>
            <li> or bigger empty clean jar&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to melt the shea butter at all which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in making my own soaps, lotions, deodorants with natural ingredients for some time.</li>
            <li> Her hair after using the Shea butter is softer which is amazing because we have tried so many other products to moisturizer and soften her hair!</li>
            <li> being said, I&#x27;ve now used it to make lip balm and lotion bars several times, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> Super soft and smooth skin!</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Grade A Unrefined Organic Shea Butter was made available to me at a reduced price for a impartial review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I got this product for free or at a reduced price to try it out I would recommend the majestic pure shea butter to anyone.</li>
            <li> It is such an amazing product</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of essential oils to my shea butter and it smells amazing and works great.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it can help calm inflamed skin including eczema and acne (teens anyone?) and also reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I have used it everyday with great success since.</li>
            <li> talk about FRESH.  </li>

            <li> After researching online, I know it&#x27;s the right color and scent.  </li>
            <li> The smell is right on track with what shea butter should be.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter smells and feels exactly the same as the kind he gave me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells great, is easily sliced or broken apart to make what you like.&lt;br /&gt;Although  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice, solid, pure block.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is really a lot of product, I have to look at the other reviews to get recipes on how to use it to the max, of course I will use it as is also, great buy, thanks</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the smell but its all natural so that the good benefit..</li>
            <li> shea butter and beeswax are nearly melted, add coconut oil (which will melt very quickly).</li>
            <li> Its all about quality when it comes to 100% natural African Shea butter, and this one is definitely good quality.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t melt even though it sat outside all day in the summer heat of Southern California, but I was able to easily scrape off a piece with my finger and it absorbed quickly into my skin without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love working with it and think it would be hard, if not impossible to find a better Shea Butter than this.  </li>
            <li> I love working with it and think it would be hard, if not impossible to find a better Shea Butter than this.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say this is a decent block of shea butter if you want to get into making your own lotions.</li>
            <li> I own several essential oils from Majestic Pure and absolutely love them, so when I was offered the opportunity to buy their Organic Shea Butter at a promotional price for my evaluation and review I readily accepted.</li>
            <li> When the Shea butter arrived, I was surprised by its size-literally, the size of a huge brick.</li>
            <li> Most people might have allergies to mass produced personal care product&lt;</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter has been the only product to achieve that level of softness which I am satisfied with.</li>
            <li> When I first received it, I scraped a bit off and rubbed it in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I used it first thing in the morning and at 10 PM that night</li>
            <li> It arrived and the first difference I saw was that it was literally a brick of shea butter.</li>
            <li> My favorite way to use shea butter is a very simple recipe.</li>
            <li> After experiencing the texture of my skin after the first use, I am keeping some of it out to use as a skin treatment.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying and using Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> and I often have chapped lips and don&#x27;t care for most of the products currently on the market that I have tried.</li>
            <li> You can also make so many different products out of this.  </li>
            <li> skin will be smooth with a natural glow, I just started using the Shea in this form</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hoping for the same or even better results, knowing I am leaving out all the additional chemicals added to products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this she butter, it has the nutty smell but not overwhelming like most.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I  used a butter knife.</li>
            <li> The processing is also what burns off a lot of the benefits of Shea butter, so I&#x27;m OK with some occasional grittiness.  </li>
            <li> No one wants to pick stuff out of their shea butter!</li>
            <li> Unrefined shea butter is a multi-use miracle drug, and Majestic Pure Grade did it right.</li>
            <li> She stores it in our hot garage</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have any weird spots on it and it smelled absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is a lovely moisturizer that will not clog your pores and has numerous benefits.</li>
            <li> In the morning my skin feels so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Will be back for more</li>
            <li> Received fast!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was packed the greatest</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The quality is way higher when you purchase it in the block like this.</li>
            <li> First  off I used it on my skin.</li>
            <li> it is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> My first shea butter.  </li>
            <li> The block was big enough that I was able to share it with my son who was very excited to have it.</li>
            <li> solid block, looks clean and smells clean.</li>
            <li> Came super fast with Amazon prime shipping, and was really well packaged</li>
            <li> I never tried natural shea butter and what a difference it makes!!!!</li>
            <li> It comes nicely packaged and will last for a very long time and it easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> This butter is pure and I feel safe knowing is organic, melts evenly in my double boil pans.</li>
            <li> This comes in a nice 1lb size and it is soft enough to where you don&#x27;t have to do anything but use your hands to get some from the 1 lb block .</li>
            <li> It also provides a fabulous soft and gentle soap that I have make.</li>
            <li> First of all, I couldn&#x27;t believe how large of a box that you receive.  </li>
            <li> if you’d like more of a “whipped” body butter lotion then put the oil in a kitchen aid stand mixer and mix on high for several minutes until the eczema cream looks like whipped butter.  </li>
            <li> You can use the eczema cream at this point, but if you’d like more of a “whipped” body butter lotion then put the oil in a kitchen aid stand mixer and mix on high for several minutes until the eczema cream looks like whipped butter.  </li>
            <li> I got this massive bar of pure Shea butter at an extremely reduced price for the purpose of review, but honestly the price listed now (14.95) is still ridiculously cheap for what you get.  </li>
            <li> I realized that this is a characteristic of a fresher and more nutrient-packed butter.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure’s Shea Butter is the finest Shea butter I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting something to add to your medicine cabinet, get this Shea Butter Bar from Majestic Pure.</li>
            <li> had never used pure shea butter before but have used it as an ingredient in a number of products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Majestic Pure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Majestic Pure provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>

            <li> This shea butter is from MAJESTIC PURE</li>
            <li> Pure sent me a discounted sample to review.</li>

            <li> Tbsp Majestic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil</li>
            <li> Add 2 Tbsp Majestic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil &amp; pulse (or mash)</li>
            <li> and I never had added Shea Butter before, but I knew I was getting this Shea Butter from Majestic Pure, so I started looking up recipes</li>
            <li> /&gt;10-15 drops your favorite essential oil, if you need it to smell pretty (I like orange, or sandalwood for something a little more</li>
            <li> /&gt;My most urgent need for this product is for my dry heels (there may be hope yet!)</li>
            <li> The Majestic Pure Unrefined Organic Shea Butter is absolutely as stated.  </li>
            <li> Really like the large block.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and and have always known that shea butter is very helpful, so I always bought lotion with shea butter.</li>
            <li> IT LEFT MY SKIN FEELING SMOOTH AND HYDRATED.</li>
            <li> We ended up making Shea Lotion Bars, which were very simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rub the bars straight onto my lips, just like lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well I just got this product and have not used it for a whole week yet.</li>
            <li> my skin is saying thank you so very</li>
            <li> and it really works</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s probably a no-brainer, but I have areas like my feet that even petroleum jelly couldn&#x27;t help, and the shea butter cleared it up fast.</li>
            <li> this came packaged very well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, packaged very well</li>
            <li> and I have used it straight off of the block.</li>
            <li> MUCH</li>
            <li> I did take some of the Shea Butter and used it on my hands straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> When you touch it, it really feels like butter.</li>
            <li> and it really help soften the skin.</li>
            <li> and I my skin felt really hydrated.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your generosity in allowing me to review your products.</li>
            <li> I’ve only ever tried shea butter that was one ingredient, among others, in some kind of commercial blend.  </li>
            <li> I transfered some into a tub that I had with a lid and take a dime size everyday, warm it up between my palms and rub the rest on my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked how Smooth the Block felt, and I had no problem slicing off a thin piece.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin along with my special needs adult children and am in awe with this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it I ate half of it when I first received it</li>
            <li> It is not strong, so I don&#x27;t expect to have any problems masking it with my own fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased from other places, but this is definitely one that shows superior qualities.&lt;br /&gt;Majestic</li>
            <li> There are other essential oils that are also good for acne also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and not strong.</li>
            <li> I believe you will be as pleased with Majestic Pure Shea Butter as I am!an average shelf life of 12-18 months.  </li>
            <li> I highly doubt the light scent will transfer over into items that are scented properly.</li>
            <li> In my journey to live a more simple and natural lifestyle, i decided to use it to make a lotion and hair mask.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was easy to cut as needed and I liked that because the rubbed Shea butter is difficult to portion out.</li>
            <li> I break out less and my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I made a Shea cream with sweet almond oil, olive oil, vitamin e, rosemary, rosehip, juniper and frankincense essential oils.</li>
            <li> ~ then let it cool an add a bit of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I always make my own lip balm, I have now for the past couple years</li>
            <li> There are so many other recipes I want to try!</li>
            <li> For straight to the skin Shea butter, I just bought a new brand that does have that consistency</li>
            <li> There is so much you can use this for I am learning and trying new things all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge believer in the power of Shea butter and use it on my scars, dry skin and in my hair.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter contains natural vitamins, antioxidants and fatty acids make it amazingly nourishing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> also mixed up a quick batch of Eczema Cream to give to a family friend of ours for her son.</li>
            <li> It is a decent price for the one pound block.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS DECENT AND ITS OFFERED WITH THE SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE PRIME OPTION.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Add the vitamin c oil and wipe on HIGH for about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li> 2 minutes (or mix on high speed for about 5 minutes if doing in bowl) until mixture is creamy and well blended</li>
            <li> It immediately melted into a creamy, rich oil that left my hands feeling soft and protected.</li>
            <li> The airways of those using the shea butter (versus nasal drops or petroleum jelly) became clear within 30 to 90 seconds of application, and remained so for 5 to 8 hours, better than other methods.  </li>
            <li> So far I have no complaints with the Majestic Pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> (I just used a large glass bowl sitting on top of a small pot of water.</li>
            <li> Because I’m very scent sensitive, sometimes products</li>
            <li> Jojoba for oily, combination, or normal.</li>
            <li> Primrose for normal skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it, I use it on my face everyday</li>
            <li> The shea was fresh and a held a yellow tinge (Grade B-cosmetic use only-not for consumption).</li>
            <li> I know of a few people that would love this for a gift.</li>
            <li> As a result, I was very excited to try Shea butter as a moisturizer in my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> lotion bars from molds and store in a cool, dry place.</li>
            <li> and then when melted it melted down easily also.  </li>
            <li> I live in AZ and my mail carrier never comes to the door.</li>
            <li> will definitely lasts me a very very long time, I am currently thinking of using it to make my own hand</li>
            <li> clean and empty 4 oz jars with lid liners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I wanted to find something natural to help moisturize gently and naturally and ease the itch, and this shea butter did just the trick.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter melted nicely and the stiff smell that it has didn&#x27;t transfer over to the final product.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a solid block of Shea, and I wasn&#x27;t intimidated at all.  </li>
            <li> I was plenty surprised that it survived the heat of the south, was well packaged, and didn&#x27;t melt all over the inside of the box (or out of it for that matter!).</li>
            <li> He stated that is was better quality then he had gotten in the past from another supplier.</li>
            <li> Store in clean, dry, dark and cool place.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of my dry natural curls, but now, with daily use on my scalp and ends my curls are so springy and full of life!</li>
            <li> I love the small of the natural product too.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter is notoriously hard in block form but this product was very manageable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This block of Shea butter comes nicely compressed and very hard, and wrapped in a plastic material.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Grade Shea butter is such a versatile product.</li>
            <li> I like the texture, and how clean the Shea butter melted down.  </li>
            <li> I used the majestic pure shea butter mainly for my stretch marks and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Rubbing a little on your skin after melting in  your hand (as the directions state) really works wonders!!!</li>
            <li> Its so soft and fresh made, unlike harder versions that have set around awhile.  </li>
            <li> So soothing and does not irritate my sensitive skin or my sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> far mor uses than I can name in this review.</li>
            <li> OZ Olive Oil or Coconut Oil (completely up to</li>
            <li> oh my skin is so soft.. been using it on my heels and elbows..</li>
            <li> Nothing like getting a natural product to use on your cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> and it actually worked really well.</li>
            <li> This one is so smooth on the skin I will use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve so far been using it on my body</li>
            <li> I have been making healthier lifestyle choices, and researched natural moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I whipped it in the mixer, along with almond oil to a soft butter consistency.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to my shea butter being soft and malleable.</li>
            <li> I use it on scars to naturally help collagen production.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten that far, however, I have tried the butter just as it is.</li>
            <li> We also plan on using it this summer for a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve made homemade deodorant and hand soaps.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m surprised that I haven&#x27;t tried this before.</li>
            <li> This 1lb of all natural Shea butter is helping to keep my skin moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Since I was tired of paying high prices for various lotions, I decided to try making my own.</li>
            <li> , this is a wonderful product I put some on my cat because he was scathing when he came indoors one day, now he lays down and lets me apply it</li>
            <li> an this high quality shea butter is definitely  one of those</li>
            <li> I love using it plain on dry elbows and heels, plus also directly on my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> Beware if you live in a hot location and order during the summer, as one other reviewer said this will make the product melty!</li>
            <li> melt.&lt;br /&gt;Remove the jar and cool for a few minutes to about room temp before adding in the oils.&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li> Remove the jar and cool for a few minutes to about room temp before adding in the oils.</li>
            <li> I really like to use shea butter to help with dry skin.</li>
            <li> so it really works for dry skin.</li>
            <li> :I don&#x27;t really like the scent of shea butter, but when I add some essential oils such as lavender or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> A recent summer sunburn left me with super dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I love it and a little goes a long way so it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> Since using the shea butter several times a day I find my skin to be very soft</li>
            <li> The arm I put the shea butter on was quite soft after a full day, while my other arm had already started to dry out.</li>
            <li> Because Shea Butter has such a large healing fraction, in addition to moisturizing fraction, regular use of this natural cream can treat many skin problems, including blemishes, wrinkles, itching, sunburns, small skin wounds, eczema, skin allergies, insect bites, frost bite, and other skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Shea alone without mixing with other oils.</li>
            <li> Room temperature is generally fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you open it up and touch it its truly buttery soft.</li>
            <li> This block is a soft solid with no need to cut and melt for use.  </li>
            <li> The one thing to remember is that it is a natural product so may feel gritty.</li>
            <li> With a small amount of stirring it is easily incorporated into other creams or emulsified for direct use on the skin or in hair.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I really like the product and the brick</li>
            <li> There is no real discernible scent other than the mild one of the butter itself.</li>
            <li> If you follow my reviews, I think you will see that I am very big into homemade, natural products in a big way.</li>
            <li> Unrefined may feel a little grainy at first</li>
            <li> Continue for a few more minutes, or until it looks kinda like whipped cream, forming stiff peaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to first use up Shea</li>
            <li> I struggle with cracked heels for years from using slippers everyday, living in Hawaii we are always hot.</li>
            <li> block I received did have a slight odor that I didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li> Today is the May 23, 2015 and this product was made May 14, 2015 with a shelf life of three years, but it’s not going to last anywhere near that long for me.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has little to no scent and is very high quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Majestic Pure Grade A Unrefined Organic Shea Butter because I have seen a few things on Pinterest that we have wanted to make with it.</li>
            <li> thought it would be a fun little D.I.Y. I have tried other shea butters</li>
            <li> When I see something as pure and raw as shea butter can be, I definitely need to have it around the house.</li>
            <li> This majestic pure grade a shea butter is raw and unrefined, unlike the mass produced stuff out there.  </li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Raw Unrefined Organic Shea butter&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> We purchased this large 1lb bar of raw shea butter&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> I personally use it for deep moisturizing, scars,  minor cuts and burn healing, insect biting and stings.</li>
            <li> and I had to do a little research to figure out if this is normal.  </li>
            <li> Half an hour later they were completely gone</li>
            <li> but really I&#x27;m too lazy for that</li>
            <li> and I was so surprised to see my dark under eye circle diminishing .  </li>
            <li> I have to say I was a little concerned how my order  would be when I received it because I live in Miami</li>
            <li> Why buy expensive lotions made with shea butter when you can have the pure stuff so much cheaper?  </li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is very even and does not contain big hard chunks like some others.</li>
            <li> You absolutely do not need a lot of this stuff and a tiny bit can cover your entire face, so this product will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I especially use this on my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin especially on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Pure and organic certified Shea Butter is hard.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and even with normal lotions within a few hours</li>
            <li> I noticed no smell, and to me that&#x27;s great for what I want to use this for, as a base for other oils too.  </li>
            <li> Take a little amount and melt it, apply it to your hair before showering, and you will have profoundly soft hair after.</li>
            <li> It was very subtle and when we mixed the Butter with other oils and scents you could no longer smell the original scent.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the texture of the butter and did not expect it to be so firm.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin moisturized all day long..</li>
            <li> Should keep for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received it, I was surprised that it hadn&#x27;t melted, as it was sitting out in 100 degree heat for a few days while we were on a family getaway.</li>
            <li> This bar is going a long way</li>
            <li> I ate half of the first box and my skin ate the other half</li>
            <li> This Majestic Pure Raw Unrefined 100% Organic Shea Butter is cut, not melted and poured, comes from Ghana and has an average shelf life of 12-18 months.  </li>
            <li> - you only need a little of this mixed with other oils), one part beeswax pellets, and essential oils and heat until everything is melted.</li>
            <li> It takes 2-3 minutes TOTAL (other than cooling time).</li>
            <li> I just put it in a small tub and dip my fingers in like a salve, but if you use a little less oil, you can pour it into a paper cup, let it cool, and then peel the paper off and have a lotion bar</li>
            <li> I think this is some really high quality shea, however it&#x27;s hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Coconut for dry skin.</li>
            <li> my skin feels dry again.</li>
            <li> I just take off small pieces and rub it directly onto all my dry skin patches before bed, even my lips.  </li>
            <li> I like this Shea and by cutting off about an ounce or 2  of shavings placing shavings in a mini glass open top jar with Silicone lid container in sun for a few hours until it melts to level and then move it inside with a lid.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived later than expected due to some damage in shipping.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using Shea butter, and I may be addicted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slightly rubbing the Shea Butter on specific areas for three days now</li>
            <li> Unrefined shea butter is an off yellow or slightly greenish color.</li>
            <li> Add in essential oils and whatever other ingredients you care to use, and you will come out the other side with a truly quality</li>

            <li> Very dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> When I use it as a base on my natural hair, I notice tat I have less shedding and that my hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li> It is hard to use since the large and heavy size</li>
            <li> I applied a little on my arm and instantly started feeling relief.</li>
            <li> Use about 1 C coconut oil, 1/4 C shea, a little cocobutter and any essential oils of your choice.</li>
            <li> ten minutes later the redness and scratchmarks from my arms were hardly visible.</li>
            <li> Few Drops of your favor Essential Oil ( I used</li>
            <li> the essential oil into coconut/shea mixture and put the jar in the fridge until done, should be firm to touch.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have noticed some grittiness, but, it&#x27;s unprocessed Shea Butter</li>
            <li> He immediately applied it to his back where he is having trouble with acne.</li>
            <li> It will be harder and quite oily.</li>
            <li> I put it on while I am wet and let it moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it, not just for soap and lotion makers, but also for using plain, as is.</li>
            <li> It is really nice to use as lotion bar alone in slices or as a base for other hair and skin creations.</li>
            <li> Add essential oils, if desired.&lt;br /&gt;Pour melted lotion base into mold (I used 1.5 inch square brownie molds, but any molds will do) and let cool until completely solid</li>
            <li> I also melted the piece down to add a little to my deep conditioner I made.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy feeling and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes A LONG WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and the boys/guys in your life won&#x27;t fear the scent or use either.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a skin moisturizer, lip balm, split end treatment, body butters, lotion bars, face cream, hair conditioner, and a couple other things Since it comes in a bar</li>
            <li> We both go to the same salon and have used shea butter lotions in the past.  </li>
            <li> a small jar add the shea butter and the coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;Place jar in the saucepan (like a makeshift double boiler) until the oils</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go to any other oil or butter line now!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Since receiving it I have checked into other ways I can use the Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> It is white (Grade A), which means it can usually be consumed (lip balms, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I need to use a sharp knife now.</li>
            <li> much!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy another one due to the fact</li>
            <li> Partially due to...&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more burning when applied to the legs as I had with commercially made moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> , I also simply break off small pieces and just rub it together in my hands, then spread over my legs, feet and hands to soften them and to help heal scars.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> all the ingredients in a double boiler or small saucepan over medium heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat</li>
            <li> /&gt;Transfer to a jar or other storage.</li>
            <li> BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also melt this, mix it with other oils, and use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Other shea products I&#x27;ve ordered arrive crumbly</li>
            <li> When I received my order in the mail, I cut off a few chunks and put some in tiny little plastic containers</li>
            <li> I do still plan on melting some down and adding some Tea Tree Essential Oil and maybe even a small batch with lavender oil.  </li>
            <li> It has a less waxy and gummier texture than the other Shea butters I have tried.</li>
            <li> I rub some on my fingers and use for lip softener and a small amount for my long hair to keep it silky feeling and looking.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint</li>
            <li> This is enough for me to make at least 2 creams, 3 lotion and a salve or two, depending on batch size.</li>
            <li> I immediately ran my fingers over it a few times, and it melted enough to leave a small film over my finger.</li>
            <li> This shea butter odd not greasy.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it was packed neatly in a thick white cardboard box, wrapped in heavy wax paper.</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed is that I don&#x27;t get blackheads the way I did when I used previous moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I was given a slight discount to review this product.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, I noticed it had a bit of an odd smell, but I am guessing it is because it is organic.</li>
            <li> Even having sat out in 100+ degree sun for at least an hour, it was still solid and firm.</li>
            <li> You may have to scrape the sides of the mixer down a few times.  </li>
            <li> You may have to scrape the sides of the mixer down a few times.  </li>
            <li> It does not become very stiff as it did with moisturizers which made my skin dry again after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I’ve also used a Pyrex measuring cup sitting inside a pot of water – this method makes it easy to pour melted lotion base into mold)&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a little over a month now</li>
            <li> i received this item for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> I used the block to make a hand lotion mixing it with coconut oil, beeswax pellets, and a little oil fragrance.</li>
            <li> a little more&lt;</li>
            <li> Fatty, but not oily or slimy at all.</li>
            <li> Then I found and tried a few of these things.</li>
            <li> I use it plain, but also use it in homemade soaps and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Or you can use it plain</li>
            <li> because I usually have to wrap him up tight to apply anything on his body, and this is organic</li>
            <li> tried diy in the past that were messy or plain</li>
            <li> Have Raw Unrefined Shea Butter at room temperature (Do not melt or heat it!)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> There is very little scent.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be receiving a small block</li>
            <li> I cut a small piece off with a knife and warmed it between the palms of my hands.</li>
            <li> In a small jar add the shea butter and the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> took off the amount needed and softened in my hand to the desired texture in combination with my aloe Vera extract, a small amount.</li>
            <li> You will be amazed at the unbelievable results you will achieve over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually have cracked bleeding feet and this has helped a ton.</li>
            <li> but I am also not sure how this is supposed to smell since I have never purchased this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that easier to work with than the plastic baggy of mush that I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> Very firm, you need to cut this with a knife.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is a must have, but relatively hard to find in raw form.</li>
            <li> My wife is obsessed with shea butter since being introduced to it late last year.</li>
            <li> She prefers the hard type over the whipped, softer type of shea butter</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> is it smells weird a little bit</li>
            <li> Pale, off-white color, faint nutty scent.</li>
            <li> I had such a horrible eczema flair on my arm the other night</li>
            <li> I am officially addicted to Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re wondering about the size, think of a can of soup, and that&#x27;s the approximate amount of the 1 lb.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet will update if it fails.</li>
            <li> It has a faint smell that I didn&#x27;t care for</li>
            <li> Some people likened it to the smell of stale Play-Doh, and that is kinda how this smells.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with my skin and therefore pay attention to ingredients in skin products I have purchased.</li>
            <li> ONCE THIS BAR IS GONE ILL</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received this shea butter to review and I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> That says an awful lot about its purity.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I’ve only ever tried shea butter that was one ingredient, among others, in some kind of commercial blend.  I’ve heard so many wonderful things about pure shea butter that I simply couldn’t resist seeing for myself when I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a reduced price for the purposes of an unbiased evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I finally know what all the fuss is about!  I just received this today, but this butter is wonderful.  So soothing and does not irritate my sensitive skin or my sensitive nose.  Because I’m very scent sensitive, sometimes products I would otherwise like and use, I have to avoid, but that is not the case with this butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And talk about FRESH.  Wow.  Today is the May 23, 2015 and this product was made May 14, 2015 with a shelf life of three years, but it’s not going to last anywhere near that long for me.  I’m going to share some of this block with my family and will happily purchase the next a full price.  Well worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My most urgent need for this product is for my dry heels (there may be hope yet!) but I’m also liking this shea butter for moisturizing my lips.  I’m going to continue experimenting with this amazing product.  There&#x27;s some topical recipes I&#x27;d like to try.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure’s Shea Butter is the finest Shea butter I&#x27;ve used. It has a less waxy and gummier texture than the other Shea butters I have tried. I realized that this is a characteristic of a fresher and more nutrient-packed butter. I am officially addicted to Shea butter.  It melts quite easily when you rub it in your palm. I applied it to my legs, arms, and face and it rubs in quite easily. It didn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy feeling and a little bit goes a long way. I have been using it for just about everything. I&#x27;ve used it as a skin moisturizer, lip balm, split end treatment, body butters, lotion bars, face cream, hair conditioner, and a couple other things Since it comes in a bar it is very easy to measure to use in all your DIY recipes.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, and makes my skin look great, healthy, and with a nice looking shine. I was offered Majestic Pure’s Shea Butter to review and have found an incredible amount of uses for it.</li>
            <li> Most people might have allergies to mass produced personal care product&lt;br /&gt;because of all the ingredients and chemicals they use.&lt;br /&gt;If youre one of those who loves to make their own product then this is the perfect shea butter for you.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this to make your own lip balm (which I do), or even soap and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I use this to make a DIY lip balm and it saves me tons of money.&lt;br /&gt;I also get the best out of it since my ingredients are pure and safe.&lt;br /&gt;This will definitely lasts me a very very long time, I am currently thinking of using it to make my own hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for summer time, where we need more moisture since our skin tends to be dry due to the harmful sun rays.&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this using a promo code for review.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter had so many d ifferent uses. I personally use it for deep moisturizing, scars,  minor cuts and burn healing, insect biting and stings. I especially use this on my dry itchy skin. This shea butter odd not greasy. My skin feels soft and smooth. You can combine shea butter with different oils to create a creamy moisturizer for yourself. I store this in a cool place so that it won&#x27;t melt. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I saw the shea butter on a promotion and I decided to try it.  First of all, I couldn&#x27;t believe how large of a box that you receive.  I was able to share it with a friend who also was interested in the organic shea butter.  We both go to the same salon and have used shea butter lotions in the past.  It&#x27;s interesting to see how it comes as a solid, yet melts very easily.  It comes nicely packaged and will last for a very long time and it easy to work with.  I like to put it on my legs and feet and I don&#x27;t have any oily/greasy issues.  I recommend this product and would purchase it again after I finish with this 1/2 of brick of shea and I would like to try some of the recipes that I saw under the Amazon reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> solid block, looks clean and smells clean. Haven&#x27;t used yet will update if it fails.</li>
            <li> I got this massive bar of pure Shea butter at an extremely reduced price for the purpose of review, but honestly the price listed now (14.95) is still ridiculously cheap for what you get.  I would buy it at twice the price.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with shea butter and a post to an online forum quickly yielded advice on how to make it into things like lotion bars but really I&#x27;m too lazy for that and I quickly realized it already *was* a huge lotion bar.  It is almost scentless and creamy, rich and smooth.  I love it.  Why buy expensive lotions made with shea butter when you can have the pure stuff so much cheaper?  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Holy Shea butter!! This Shea butter arrived in a nice huge 1 lb block wrapped in what seemed like wax paper. There were no dings or damages to the bar upon arrival. I love to use Shea butter for moisturizer on the skin, but I also have a daughter with more ethnic hair and this Shea butter has done some amazing things for her hair! Her hair after using the Shea butter is softer which is amazing because we have tried so many other products to moisturizer and soften her hair! This Shea butter has been the only product to achieve that level of softness which I am satisfied with. I also use it to make a body butter which is nice. It adds a great moisturizing factor to my body butter!!! This Shea butter was easy to cut as needed and I liked that because the rubbed Shea butter is difficult to portion out. I love this she&#x27;s butter!!!&lt;br /&gt;*i purchased this to review during a promotional period and any opinions expressed are my own**</li>
            <li> I was so very impressed with this shea butter! I have eczema and and have always known that shea butter is very helpful, so I always bought lotion with shea butter. I never tried natural shea butter and what a difference it makes!!!! I had such a horrible eczema flair on my arm the other night It just wouldn&#x27;t stop itching. I decided to put the shea butter to the test. It comes in a block form like a giant soap. Once you open it up and touch it its truly buttery soft. I applied a little on my arm and instantly started feeling relief. You just rub it in like you would any lotion. ten minutes later the redness and scratchmarks from my arms were hardly visible. Half an hour later they were completely gone and I had no urge to scratch. It is such an amazing product I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I will be using it on my kids who eczema as well. The package says it is good for 3years.</li>
            <li> This majestic pure grade a shea butter is raw and unrefined, unlike the mass produced stuff out there.  Great product - loved it!!</li>
            <li> My wife loved the shea butter. She  said it was  a very nice quality  and felt great.</li>
            <li> This Shae butter is absolutely amazing! This is the real deal... Makes my skin super soft with s beautiful glow. I plan on making creams for my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;This item was purchased at discount for review...but I would paid full sale price for it. It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny and I will it purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is unrefined organic Shea butter. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this in the mail. When it arrived, it was packed neatly in a thick white cardboard box, wrapped in heavy wax paper. On the packaging there was a manufacturing date as well as the suggested use by date. Boy, was this worth the wait. I make my own natural hair products and have been using the beauty supply store shea butter in it. I noticed that my hair was not as lustrous as it could be. I figured out that my shea butter was not up to snuff. OMG, this unrefined organic Shea butter has changed my life. When I use it as a base on my natural hair, I notice tat I have less shedding and that my hair is more manageable. Also, the moisture level has skyrocketed! Gone are the days of my dry natural curls, but now, with daily use on my scalp and ends my curls are so springy and full of life! It has added a wonderful nutty scent to my hair and manages to stay solid in my body and hair creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome on its own. This unrefined organic Shea butter leaves your skin so supple. This product is awesome on its own. It can be used as a daily moisturizer or skin conditioner after baths and showers. It seems just to melt into my skin and leave it feeling so silky smooth. My eczema has been not as pronounced since I began using this Shea butter too, another bonus. !</li>
            <li> This shea butter is extremely smooth.  And it melted down perfectly for my lotions.  I am definately going to buy again!  I did receive this for reviewing purposes, but I do truly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Oh my! I thought I would be receiving a small block but this is rather large and can easily be shared amongst friends and family. I transfered some into a tub that I had with a lid and take a dime size everyday, warm it up between my palms and rub the rest on my hair. This is THE best deal on shea butter and the quality is exceptional. I received this to review but will be purchasing before it runs out.</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: FREE OR DISCOUNTED PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I AM A SOAP MAKER AND THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SHEA BUTTERS I HAVE EVER TRIED. IT SMELLS SO GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES NOT HAVE A BUNCH OF GRAINS THAT HAS TO BE STRAINED OUT. PERFECT FOR ANY BODY PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, clean pressed  far mor uses than I can name in this review. This is about the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I love making my own lotions and moisturizers so when I got the chance to review this product at a discout price, I just HAD to. I&#x27;ve got a recipe I always use for a face moisturizer that I use everynight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 tablespoons shea butter&lt;br /&gt;4 tablespoons oil. Coconut for dry skin. Jojoba for oily, combination, or normal. Grapeseed for oily skin. Primrose for normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;5-10 drops essential oil. I use lavender, roman chamomile, or sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Place shea butter and oils in mixing bowl (not essentials yet)&lt;br /&gt;2.  Whip until desired consistency.. takes a bit.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Add essential oil and fill a bottle up.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels good and you can customize it for your skin type with just a tiny bit of research. Unrefined may feel a little grainy at first but it goes away when it hits the skin.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using this in some soap and cosmetic recipes.  When I first received it, I scraped a bit off and rubbed it in my hand.  It immediately melted into a creamy, rich oil that left my hands feeling soft and protected. It has a faint smell that I didn&#x27;t care for and I had to do a little research to figure out if this is normal.  Some people likened it to the smell of stale Play-Doh, and that is kinda how this smells.  It is not strong, so I don&#x27;t expect to have any problems masking it with my own fragrances.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels right, I will be testing out the consistency this weekend when I make some essential oil lotions.</li>
            <li> Seriously, love this brick of goodness! I used this for my homemade whipped lotion. The delivery was quick and the item arrived as shown the picture! Thanks. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased the Shea Butter to make an organic lotion, and I have never made one before so I didn&#x27;t know how it was going to work. But I was extremely happy with the end results. I have really dry skin and even with normal lotions within a few hours my skin feels dry again. Because Shea Butter has such a large healing fraction, in addition to moisturizing fraction, regular use of this natural cream can treat many skin problems, including blemishes, wrinkles, itching, sunburns, small skin wounds, eczema, skin allergies, insect bites, frost bite, and other skin conditions. So I wiped together a couple jars of my new magic lotion, gave some to friends and family and I AM IN LOVE. I used it first thing in the morning and at 10 PM that night my legs still felt like I had just put it on. A little goes A LONG WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recipe I used was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 OZ Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;3 OZ Olive Oil or Coconut Oil (completely up to you)&lt;br /&gt;1 Teaspoon of Vitamin C Oil&lt;br /&gt;A Few Drops of your favor Essential Oil ( I used orange)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat the Shea Butter and Oil of your choice, not till it is melted just lumpy. Add the vitamin c oil and wipe on HIGH for about 5 minutes. Then add your essential oil wipe for about another minute or two. I then let mine sit on my counter to cool or you could put in the fridge to cool. Then pack it in your favorite jar or container. You truly will love the feeling of how soft your skin it and it looks so shiny all day. I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Received this Shea butter and it is soft not grainy and wonderful. This product is wrapped in a wax paper and packaged in a box but lovely, I recommend this shea butter for your products that you are making at home and keeping it all orgainic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order more!</li>
            <li> Beautiful block of white shea butter.  This block is a soft solid with no need to cut and melt for use.  With a small amount of stirring it is easily incorporated into other creams or emulsified for direct use on the skin or in hair.  Moisturizing and enriching for the skin and hair, we use alot of shea butter and have found this one to be a superior fair trade product.</li>
            <li> When I see something as pure and raw as shea butter can be, I definitely need to have it around the house. So when I was offered this Shea Butter from Majestic Pure for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bar. It arrived and the first difference I saw was that it was literally a brick of shea butter. I think this makes it better for you as there are no additives to cause a reaction or ruin it&#x27;s healing properties. I have used it on mosquito bites and for itchy dry skin with great results. I even gave some to my grandfather who is doing skin peels, so help with the healing process. If you are wanting something to add to your medicine cabinet, get this Shea Butter Bar from Majestic Pure. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this block of 1 LB Shea Butter.  I liked how Smooth the Block felt, and I had no problem slicing off a thin piece.  I also melted the piece down to add a little to my deep conditioner I made.  I like the texture, and how clean the Shea butter melted down.  I noticed no smell, and to me that&#x27;s great for what I want to use this for, as a base for other oils too.  This was my first time using a solid block of Shea, and I wasn&#x27;t intimidated at all.  I think there are a lot of possibilities to use this.  I received product at discount for my opinion.</li>
            <li> I’ve only ever tried shea butter that was one ingredient with tons of others. I’ve heard so many wonderful things about shea butter that I simply couldn’t resist seeing for myself when I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a reduced price for the purposes of an unbiased evaluation and review. My favorite way to use shea butter is a very simple recipe. Use about 1 C coconut oil, 1/4 C shea, a little cocobutter and any essential oils of your choice. Came super fast with Amazon prime shipping, and was really well packaged so no problems there.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Grade A Unrefined Organic Shea Butter was made available to me at a reduced price for a impartial review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used pure shea butter before but have used it as an ingredient in a number of products. I was surprised at the texture of the butter and did not expect it to be so firm. I cut a small piece off with a knife and warmed it between the palms of my hands. The warmth softened it and allowed me to apply it to my hands and forearms. It absorbed easily into the skin and made it feel silky to the touch. There was no greasy feel on my skin at all. I was planning to use this shea butter as an additive to homemade soap that I intend to make at a later date but I don&#x27;t think I will use it all for that purpose now. After experiencing the texture of my skin after the first use, I am keeping some of it out to use as a skin treatment. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> loooove loooove loooove this stuff... oh my skin is so soft.. been using it on my heels and elbows.. its miracle working stuff... just soaks right into my skin.. I love it...&lt;br /&gt;*receive this item discounted for my review.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use with essentials oils.  This was my first time buying and using Shea Butter.  Very happy with this product.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This review is for the organic shea butter block. I love how this smelled right out of the package.  Looking for the right thing to use for my kids psoriasis and excema issues on the face and arms so this was recommended by a friend.  I was also told that it&#x27;s great for lip balms and I often have chapped lips and don&#x27;t care for most of the products currently on the market that I have tried. So I will be using it for that too. I was extremely impressed with the raw and pure contents of how this shea butter block was made. Very happy with my purchase and recommend it to anyone who makes their own lotions and balms.&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided at a promotional rate to try it out and review it. The views expressed are 100% my own and honest.</li>
            <li> THIS SHEA BUTTER IS REALLY GREAT!!! IT LEFT MY SKIN FEELING SMOOTH AND HYDRATED. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> The Majestic Pure Unrefined Organic Shea Butter is absolutely as stated.  Nothing like getting a natural product to use on your cracked skin.  I have very sensitive skin along with my special needs adult children and am in awe with this product.  I prefer to use my product at night time to allow the most to absorb in my experience.  The difference in the feel of my hands and feet is just awesome.  I love the small of the natural product too.  The one thing to remember is that it is a natural product so may feel gritty. You can also make so many different products out of this.  Enjoy!  I received this product for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Great quality Shea butter! Some, cream, no debris.</li>
            <li> Have used Shea butter before but this one is one of the best ones.. Keeps your skin moisturized all day long.. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the smell but its all natural so that the good benefit.. Its good that you don&#x27;t have to keep aplying it.. I work for the school district in the cafeteria and I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands so I apply this after work to get the moisture back. Will be recommending this to family and friends..</li>
            <li> I purchased the Majestic Pure Grade A Unrefined Organic Shea Butter because I have seen a few things on Pinterest that we have wanted to make with it. We ended up making Shea Lotion Bars, which were very simple.&lt;br /&gt;The block I received did have a slight odor that I didn&#x27;t really care for. It was very subtle and when we mixed the Butter with other oils and scents you could no longer smell the original scent. Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;2 ounces (1/4 cup) shea butter&lt;br /&gt;2 ounces (1/4 cup) beeswax pastilles&lt;br /&gt;3 tablespoons coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;10 drops of essential oils of your choice (optional)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions&lt;br /&gt;In a double boiler, melt shea butter and beeswax over medium low heat. (I just used a large glass bowl sitting on top of a small pot of water. I’ve also used a Pyrex measuring cup sitting inside a pot of water – this method makes it easy to pour melted lotion base into mold)&lt;br /&gt;When shea butter and beeswax are nearly melted, add coconut oil (which will melt very quickly). Stir. Add essential oils, if desired.&lt;br /&gt;Pour melted lotion base into mold (I used 1.5 inch square brownie molds, but any molds will do) and let cool until completely solid (this will take several hours).&lt;br /&gt;Remove lotion bars from molds and store in a cool, dry place. Note: heat will re-melt the lotion bars, so if for some reason you need to re-mold, just heat and start over.&lt;br /&gt;To use: simply rub lotion bars in between your hands to activate. Your body heat will melt/soften the bars just enough to give you some good lotion to apply anywhere, even your lips! I rub the bars straight onto my lips, just like lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also mixed up a quick batch of Eczema Cream to give to a family friend of ours for her son. She said it smelled really good and it actually worked really well. No oily leftovers and easy to wash off in the shower/bath.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup shea butter&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;15 drops lavender essential oil, therapeutic grade only. (where to buy essential oils)&lt;br /&gt;5 drops tea tree essential oil, therapeutic grade only.

You may have to scrape the sides of the mixer down a few times.  Apply liberally to any affected area of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for review purposes.

            <li> I have always been concerned about what chemicals and products go into my lotions and moisturizers. As a result, I was very excited to try Shea butter as a moisturizer in my everyday routine. As a result, I decided to make my own skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients I decided to use is Shea Butter, vitamin E Oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin became better than it was before. I break out less and my skin is very smooth. Another thing I noticed is that I don&#x27;t get blackheads the way I did when I used previous moisturizers. It does not become very stiff as it did with moisturizers which made my skin dry again after a few hours. It is more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:I don&#x27;t really like the scent of shea butter, but when I add some essential oils such as lavender or coconut oil. It smells better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I am thankful for getting the opportunity to try and review this product!***</li>
            <li> Love it, I use it on my face everyday and I was so surprised to see my dark under eye circle diminishing .  It&#x27;s great for my dry cracked feet as well.  I will be purchasing more once this block is gone.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to first use up Shea I was using sold in a glass bottle.  I like this Shea and by cutting off about an ounce or 2  of shavings placing shavings in a mini glass open top jar with Silicone lid container in sun for a few hours until it melts to level and then move it inside with a lid.  Good stuff.  I will purchase again.  Oh, and it seems to help with itch I get on legs every so often.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. I bought it to make pomade and it works like a champ. NO scent either. This is great, I have melted almost the whole block over 2 weeks and have had nothing but success with it. Really satisfied.</li>
            <li> I want to start off this review with a quick statement. I don&#x27;t like Shea Butter! The only reason I purchased it was because I had a growing number of home remedies, lotions, and soaps that were calling for it and I finally gave in. The reason I don&#x27;t like shea butter is because of the commercial smell that you get from over the counter lotions and scents containing the stuff. With that said, let me  tell you the good points of this shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s Majestic Pure. I love them. I won&#x27;t go to any other oil or butter line now!&lt;br /&gt;2) There is very little scent. If you are making lotions like me, then this is a HUGE plus.&lt;br /&gt;3) It is a decent price for the one pound block.&lt;br /&gt;4) It stores easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that if you are using this in some sort of lotion where you are concerned about the shea butter scent, then don&#x27;t worry. This stuff has little to no scent and is very high quality.</li>
            <li> Great quality authentic shea butter - I can tell by the consistency and color of it. It didn&#x27;t melt even though it sat outside all day in the summer heat of Southern California, but I was able to easily scrape off a piece with my finger and it absorbed quickly into my skin without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own body butter and this shea butter will make a great base for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Pure provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin especially on my hands and feet. I first tried the Shea alone without mixing with other oils. It worked great it does not sit on top of the skin. It absorbs really well and feels good on my skin. I made a Shea cream with sweet almond oil, olive oil, vitamin e, rosemary, rosehip, juniper and frankincense essential oils. I use this oil all over my body including my hair. It is extremely moisturizing.  I have received this product in exchanger reviewing. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I started using the Shea Butter as soon as it arrived.  I fell in love with it.  I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for years and though it is under control with medication, I still have problem areas.  I&#x27;ve been slightly rubbing the Shea Butter on specific areas for three days now and I am amazed at the difference it is making.  Since receiving it I have checked into other ways I can use the Shea Butter.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with my skin and therefore pay attention to ingredients in skin products I have purchased. I have also done quite a bit of research on the best products for skin for renewal, moisturizing and elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A large number of the best skin products contain some for of Shea, therefore I knew I could achieve maximum results using the Shea in its raw form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite skin product is aloe Vera which I also use in its natural state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea butter came in a 1 lb mold in a box, it looks cleans and quite appealing for something in its original natural state, that was a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off the amount needed and softened in my hand to the desired texture in combination with my aloe Vera extract, a small amount. I apply to my skin over night. You will be amazed at the unbelievable results you will achieve over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will be smooth with a natural glow, I just started using the Shea in this form but I&#x27;m hoping for the same or even better results, knowing I am leaving out all the additional chemicals added to products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also add aloe Vera to my water, so I&#x27;m being renewed from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a little concerned how my order  would be when I received it because I live in Miami and you know it is super hot .But I have to say the product was fine when I opened it. I got it to try out making a body butter with essential oils&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be a fun little D.I.Y. I have tried other shea butters This one is so smooth on the skin I will use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The finest and smoothest Shea butter I&#x27;ve tried ever!  I make homemade body creams, and this butter is not grainy, and it smells wonderful.  Not all Shea butters are created equally, I will keep purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with how easy it was to use the shea butter I purchased.  It was packaged nicely!  I used it to make a lotion out of essential oils and it blended very nicely!</li>
            <li> Majestic pure shea butter is one of the top quality shea butter you will find on the market! I did order mine through a special promotion to test it and share my unbiased opinion. I struggle with cracked heels for years from using slippers everyday, living in Hawaii we are always hot. So when I received my shea butter I immediately made my &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; paste with shea butter, coconut oil, lavender oil and tea tree oil. It has been working wonders for me. This butter is pure and I feel safe knowing is organic, melts evenly in my double boil pans.I am thankful I found such great quality product.</li>
            <li> I once received some Shea butter from a man who just returned from a trip to Mali. The shea was fresh and a held a yellow tinge (Grade B-cosmetic use only-not for consumption). This Shea butter smells and feels exactly the same as the kind he gave me. It is white (Grade A), which means it can usually be consumed (lip balms, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on well and smells pure and feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering about the size, think of a can of soup, and that&#x27;s the approximate amount of the 1 lb. box.</li>
            <li> Love this she butter, it has the nutty smell but not overwhelming like most. Nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is good Shea butter. Pale, off-white color, faint nutty scent. It is brick shaped, and wrapped in wax paper. Very firm, you need to cut this with a knife. When I first got it, I  used a butter knife. I&#x27;ve had it a little over a month now and I need to use a sharp knife now. Melts at skin temperature.  Has a very smooth feel to it. I have noticed some grittiness, but, it&#x27;s unprocessed Shea Butter so you will find that. The processing is also what burns off a lot of the benefits of Shea butter, so I&#x27;m OK with some occasional grittiness.  Next time I will probably filter the melted Shea before I whip it into a facial cream, though. Other than that, I really like the product and the brick is easy to store, cut and measure for my homemade products. I do wish it was a softer consistency.  For straight to the skin Shea butter, I just bought a new brand that does have that consistency and it&#x27;s nice to just be able to use it as a body cream without having to melt it and whip it first. I do still plan on using this brand for lip balms and body butters.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is notoriously hard in block form but this product was very manageable and easy to use. We made whipped shea butter lotion. Very pleased! I received a discount on this product for reviewing it, but am ordering more at full price!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is in a solid block. It smells clean and fresh, and is well packaged. It is not, however, approx. 16 ounces/1lb. I weighed what shipped to me, and it was 12.5 ounces - that&#x27;s a significant difference. It is still a reasonable price for what you get, and seems to be good quality shea butter, however, do be aware that you may be getting more like 12 oz, not 16. I am attaching a picture of it on my kitchen scale for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve now used it to make lip balm and lotion bars several times, and I love it!  It is rich and creamy and moisturizes so beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make your own lip balm or lotion bars: mix in a microwave bowl 3 parts solid butters (shea butter, cocoa butter), 3 parts oils (coconut oil, olive oil, sweet almond oil, argan oil - you only need a little of this mixed with other oils), one part beeswax pellets, and essential oils and heat until everything is melted. Stir it up and let it cool. It takes 2-3 minutes TOTAL (other than cooling time). I just put it in a small tub and dip my fingers in like a salve, but if you use a little less oil, you can pour it into a paper cup, let it cool, and then peel the paper off and have a lotion bar - SO nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this item in exchange for an honest review.  No additional consideration was given based on the contents of the review.</li>
            <li> Well I just got this product and have not used it for a whole week yet. I&#x27;ve so far been using it on my body ask it definitely has a fully moisturized feel to it. Especially still damp from the shower. Will update</li>
            <li> Finding 100% Pure and organic certified Shea Butter is hard. I really like to use shea butter to help with dry skin. I have been applying this on my feet and I can tell a huge difference. I usually have cracked bleeding feet and this has helped a ton. I added a few drops of essential oils to my shea butter and it smells amazing and works great. I am going to try to make lotion later in the week. Some many options to make things with Sea Butter. I love that it is organic. I would highly recommend this product. I was given a slight discount to review this product.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Grade Shea butter is such a versatile product. It&#x27;s uses are many, from using on  maternity stretch marks to using in homemade lip balms and even for itchy skin. The product is shipped in a 1 pound block which ensures you will have plenty for your various uses and won&#x27;t run out any time soon.. I&#x27;m a huge believer in the power of Shea butter and use it on my scars, dry skin and in my hair. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it I ate half of it when I first received it, it comes from God through MAJESTIC PURE to me and I and happy for this. It feels so very good from head to toe if you try it you too will see and know how good I feel and my skin is saying thank you so very much!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy another one due to the fact I ate half of the first box and my skin ate the other half, this is a wonderful product I put some on my cat because he was scathing when he came indoors one day, now he lays down and lets me apply it he knows he will get relieve, that is HUGE! because I usually have to wrap him up tight to apply anything on his body, and this is organic so if he licks it, it will not hurt him and that is GREAT!! LOVE THIS SHEA BUTTER  This shea butter is from MAJESTIC PURE and it sure makes you feel Majestic&lt;br /&gt;Grateful heart</li>
            <li> A recent summer sunburn left me with super dry itchy skin.  I wanted to find something natural to help moisturize gently and naturally and ease the itch, and this shea butter did just the trick.  Because I had a pound of it, I started looking into all its uses and discovered some really  interesting  uses for the entire family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many cool ways to use shea butter.  The moisturizers in shea butter are similar to the ones produced by the skin&#x27;s glands so it really works for dry skin. Additionally, it can help calm inflamed skin including eczema and acne (teens anyone?) and also reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Rumor has it that over time, it shea butter can even fade stretch marks.  Working on that! It not only seals moisture into skin, but also hair.  It can help with dandruff and frizz.  I&#x27;m using it on my roots to help add some volume to my fine hair as well as soften my cuticles and heels between my mani/pedi appointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my research, I discovered a surprise use for shea butter.  There was a study where test subjects with nasal congestion put shea butter on the inside of the nostrils.  The airways of those using the shea butter (versus nasal drops or petroleum jelly) became clear within 30 to 90 seconds of application, and remained so for 5 to 8 hours, better than other methods.  Next time someone in my house is stopped up, guess what we&#x27;re trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this shea butter at a reduced cost so that I could try it out and let everyone know how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter specially for&lt;br /&gt;my skin i always use it for my&lt;br /&gt;stretch Marks and for my scars&lt;br /&gt;i am thinking on using it also to&lt;br /&gt;make shea butter soap and oil....&lt;br /&gt;I am happy i got it for free in&lt;br /&gt;exchange of my honest and&lt;br /&gt;umbiased review this one has&lt;br /&gt;helped me reduce allot of my&lt;br /&gt;strechmarks and smotth my dry&lt;br /&gt;skin.. We also use it to reduse&lt;br /&gt;scars and it really works i use it&lt;br /&gt;for allot of things and im really&lt;br /&gt;happy with the result.</li>
            <li> This is a great product , great for making all kinds of things.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review after using it more</li>
            <li> I make whipped body butters with shea butter and this one is the best one out there. It doesn&#x27;t have the not so great smell that many shea butters have and while raw, there are no impurities in it which I love. No one wants to pick stuff out of their shea butter! I have used it as a salve on my elbows with it in its natural state, but I enjoy it most in my body butters. I use The Prairie Homestead recipe with clove oil and use it every day. Im so glad I had the chance to buy this at a reduced rate for review purposes. I will be buying many times again!</li>
            <li> Unrefined shea butter is a multi-use miracle drug, and Majestic Pure Grade did it right. There is no real discernible scent other than the mild one of the butter itself. I had read up on some of its many uses, so I decided to try them out. These are the ones that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You can eat it. Seriously. I used it as a greasing agent in cooking, and it handles the heat well without imparting a flavor. I think it&#x27;s sort of like lard in property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Very dry, cracked skin. I know that&#x27;s probably a no-brainer, but I have areas like my feet that even petroleum jelly couldn&#x27;t help, and the shea butter cleared it up fast. Partially due to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Anti-inflammatory properties. It&#x27;s not just great for dry skin, either. I&#x27;m one of those people that mosquitoes find delicious, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to the venom, hence huge itchy bumps that last forever and nothing helps. The shea butter soothed them, though, and the relief was immediate. I need not fear the outdoors anymore. It contains antioxidants, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Most obscure: clear congestion. You put it in your nose, and it helps open things up. And yes, it worked for me. It also is rumored to provide protection against pollen invasion. I can&#x27;t attest to that for sure, but it did seem to help, and I am VERY prone to allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, it&#x27;s not just for sugar scrubs and lotions, so get brave and give it a whirl...this product in particular is very high quality, and worked great for me in all I attempted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and itch relief are my own.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. My wife is obsessed with shea butter since being introduced to it late last year. She prefers the hard type over the whipped, softer type of shea butter so this was perfect for her. She loved it even though it came in no frills packaging. She stores it in our hot garage and it is the perfect consistency: not too hard, not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> My Majestic Pure organic shea butter came packaged safely with nothing leaking.  After researching online, I know it&#x27;s the right color and scent.  I rub some on my fingers and use for lip softener and a small amount for my long hair to keep it silky feeling and looking.  I mix it with organic jojoba oil for my face and lips.  I love this product and plan to order again soon.  You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this organic shea butter.</li>
            <li> real stuff, great for crafts and for skin too love it</li>
            <li> The shea butter is really a lot of product, I have to look at the other reviews to get recipes on how to use it to the max, of course I will use it as is also, great buy, thanks</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product!  I love shea butter,  I make alot of home remedy receipes and shea butter is in almost all of them when it comes to making a majority of things.  this came packaged very well its nice and secure in the cardboard box it came in.  It was wrapped in wax paper,  to protect it from the cardboard.  I used this tonight and its a very good shea butter,  it whipped very easily and then when melted it melted down easily also.  Couldnt ask for a better product.  Fast shipping, packaged very well item described exactly.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to write my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been making healthier lifestyle choices, and researched natural moisturizers.  I came across grade A unrefined organic Shea butter and have been pleased.  I whipped it in the mixer, along with almond oil to a soft butter consistency.  No more burning when applied to the legs as I had with commercially made moisturizers.  Leaves skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I got this product to review off of a review site and I must say I&#x27;m very glad I did!!! I have used the shea butter to make lotion with and I have used it straight off of the block. Rubbing a little on your skin after melting in  your hand (as the directions state) really works wonders!!!</li>
            <li> This is how shea butter is supposed to be! I&#x27;ve used all kinda of raw shea butter, but this brand is by far the best. It&#x27;s smooth, and not grainy. It has the lightest nutty scent. This stuff is impressive! I&#x27;ve never used such quality shea butter in my life. Disclaimer: I tried this product out in in order to review it, but my review is in no way influenced by this. This shea butter really is terrific.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review earlier but it didn&#x27;t look like it saved! I was sent this product at a reduced price but my opinions are my own. I have bought shea butter before to use with my essential oils and this one is excellent quality. It was packaged perfectly and I can&#x27;t wait to use it to make a salve! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> So far I have no complaints with the Majestic Pure shea butter. This comes in a nice 1lb size and it is soft enough to where you don&#x27;t have to do anything but use your hands to get some from the 1 lb block . I have been using this on my hands that crack and it def seems to do a great job helping with that and keeping the, soft and moisturized . Only complaint I have  is it smells weird a little bit but I am also not sure how this is supposed to smell since I have never purchased this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> I received this shea butter to review and im glad I got it. In my journey to live a more simple and natural lifestyle, i decided to use it to make a lotion and hair mask. I love it and a little goes a long way so it will last awhile. I live the smell and the fact that it is organic made me love it even more. Will definitely be buying more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* i received this item for little or no cost. All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> I love this Organic Shea Butter!! It works as described.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is one of my favorites. it&#x27;s super moisturizing. When I received my order in the mail, I cut off a few chunks and put some in tiny little plastic containers so I could keep one in my purse and next to my desk. I use shea butter as chapstick, lotion and moisturizer. If feels great to put on your face right after you shower, and is super mild and basically unscented, and not harsh at all!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter I amazing quality. You can tell by the scent and the color of it when it arrives. I love shea butter and all of the wonderful things it does for our skin. It didn&#x27;t have any weird spots on it and it smelled absolutely wonderful. It was packaged in a cardboard box with wax paper and plastic over it. Using it to soothe my skin and relieve the dryness.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and will recommend to her friends.</li>
            <li> Organic shea butter is sensationally helpful and useful for many things, and this brand is no exception!&lt;br /&gt;Top quality, arrived in perfect shape, and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, is easily sliced or broken apart to make what you like.&lt;br /&gt;Although  I do make body butters and creams etc with this, I also simply break off small pieces and just rub it together in my hands, then spread over my legs, feet and hands to soften them and to help heal scars.&lt;br /&gt;This is organic and of the best quality! always make sure you are getting the high quality organic kind like this if you want to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(provided for my opinion and review)</li>
            <li> I received this shea butter to review and I&#x27;m really disappointed. I think this is some really high quality shea, however it&#x27;s hard as a rock. The shea butter should have been stored in a plastic bag/wrapping not a box and wax paper. It feels like a bar of soap; I have to pick up the entire bar and rub it on. I&#x27;m use to my shea butter being soft and malleable. I placed it in a plastic zip lock bag in hopes that it will soften up so that I can whip it into a cream/lotion. I don&#x27;t want to have to melt it.  I&#x27;ll come back in a couple of days and change my review if it does soften up.</li>
            <li> Great quality Shea, can&#x27;t wait to put it to work in homemade soap recipes!!!</li>
            <li> I love this for my skin! After just one application you can feel the difference! Super soft and smooth skin! Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hair! I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this shea butter as I have found that it is much better than some others that I have bought in the past. It comes in a solid brick shape (just like is pictured). I find that easier to work with than the plastic baggy of mush that I have purchased in the past so I was delighted to have had the opportunity to review this Shea Butter by Majestic Pure. The consistency of this product is very even and does not contain big hard chunks like some others. The fact that this is organic is also a big plus! This would be great used alone as a lotion bar or would be easy to use in beauty product recipes. The smell is right on track with what shea butter should be. I also like that they include the shelf life printed on the wrapper. Overall, a great product and have already recommended it to some friends.</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED WITH THIS SHEA BUTTER. I USED IT TO MAKE A SUNSCREEN AND A SKIN BUTTER FOR MY ELBOWS AND HEELS. I LIKE THAT I CAN JUST CUT HOW EVER MUCH I NEED AT THE TIME AND THEN STORE IT IN THE FREEZER WHEN I DONT NEED IT. IT WHIPS QUITE NICELY WITH ESSENTIAL OILS AND MAKES VERY NICE PRODUCTS. THE PRICE IS DECENT AND ITS OFFERED WITH THE SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE PRIME OPTION. I RECEIVED THIS BAR AT A DISCOUNT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. ONCE THIS BAR IS GONE ILL BE ADDING IT TO MY S&amp;S</li>
            <li> I received this 1 lb bar of shea butter today and started using it imediately. I use it on scars to naturally help collagen production. I have started using it as an under-eye wrinkle remover and bag-reducer. It has a SPF 6 and I apply it before going to the beach. It can also be used after the beach exposure to replenish the skin. Since using the shea butter several times a day I find my skin to be very soft which is very evident when I shave. I no longer purchase lip balm as I find shes butter does a better job of keeping my lips soft. I received this at a dicount price for an unbias and  honest opinion.</li>
            <li> product for review: This shea butter was a great addition to homemade lotions and lip balms. The texture is perfect and leaves your skin feeling nice and soft. I would recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter! I use it plain, but also use it in homemade soaps and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is unrefined, organic. I want all of the qualities of the shea butter. This shea butter smells fabulous. It comes shipped in plastic, inside of a cardboard box. It&#x27;s a great way to store the butter until I use it. Unrefined shea butter is an off yellow or slightly greenish color. It is not white. White shea butter is a sign of being refined. This shea butter has the off-yellow color to it.&lt;br /&gt;It melts in my hand once warmed up, just as it should. I love using it plain on dry elbows and heels, plus also directly on my son&#x27;s eczema. It also provides a fabulous soft and gentle soap that I have make. I have purchased from other places, but this is definitely one that shows superior qualities.&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Pure sent me a discounted sample to review. I definitely recommend it, not just for soap and lotion makers, but also for using plain, as is. You will NOT be disappointed. A little bit goes a long way, and the boys/guys in your life won&#x27;t fear the scent or use either. (My boys are picky, but love this also)</li>
            <li> This shea butter is an amazing moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy and it does all you would want a moisturizer to do. You absolutely do not need a lot of this stuff and a tiny bit can cover your entire face, so this product will last you a very long time. Furthermore, shea butter is not comedogenic so your pores will not be clogged by applying this. It is great for your face, body and even hair. Take a little amount and melt it, apply it to your hair before showering, and you will have profoundly soft hair after. It is a lovely moisturizer that will not clog your pores and has numerous benefits.</li>
            <li> I anticipate on using this for my upcoming projects (bath fizzers, lotions, lip balms, etc) and was very pleased that I was picked to review this item. I was plenty surprised that it survived the heat of the south, was well packaged, and didn&#x27;t melt all over the inside of the box (or out of it for that matter!). When I opened it, I noticed it had a bit of an odd smell, but I am guessing it is because it is organic. I highly doubt the light scent will transfer over into items that are scented properly. I did take some of the Shea Butter and used it on my hands straight out of the box. I love the smooth, non-greasy way it went on and I am also loving how it has already made my skin feel softer. Once I use this product in my beauty items, I may just have to give it five stars instead of four!</li>
            <li> Im in love with this Pure Grade A Unrefined Organic Shea Butter.  I had intended to use in my health and beauty products but now I prefer using it as is.  Its so soft and fresh made, unlike harder versions that have set around awhile.  I just take off small pieces and rub it directly onto all my dry skin patches before bed, even my lips.  I apply liberally to my feet and cover with socks.  In the morning my skin feels so smooth and soft.  I do still plan on melting some down and adding some Tea Tree Essential Oil and maybe even a small batch with lavender oil.  This is a great addition to any product you make.  If your looking for FRESH this is the store.  I purchased this product at a reduced rate to review and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter. Will be back for more</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing. I have health issues and this keeps me from itching and my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> Received fast! Well packaged! Awesome product just what I was looking for! I received a discount for my feed back.</li>
            <li> Product arrived later than expected due to some damage in shipping. I used the block to make a hand lotion mixing it with coconut oil, beeswax pellets, and a little oil fragrance. The shea butter melted nicely and the stiff smell that it has didn&#x27;t transfer over to the final product. Overall I&#x27;d say this is a decent block of shea butter if you want to get into making your own lotions. Beware if you live in a hot location and order during the summer, as one other reviewer said this will make the product melty!</li>
            <li> I just received this is in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. Unfortunately, it was packed the greatest and so when I opened it, it was convered in ants. Not too happy about that but I rinsed it off and tried to see around that flaw. This is the biggest and heaviest bar of soap Ive ever seen. I was excited to try it since we all know the incredible benefits of shea butter. It is hard to use since the large and heavy size but it did a great job on my skin. I could feel an immediate difference in my skin texture. Brought a instant smoothness. I would recommend but would like to see it in a smaller size.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting. So I excited to make some more homemade soaps for some DIY Christmas gifts!!</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: I received a product discount for this review.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this organic Shea Butter, with the intention of making lotions. I haven&#x27;t gotten that far, however, I have tried the butter just as it is. It melted easily in my hands and did a great job of softening my heels. My heels felt great and I had no fear of wearing my good pair of stockings to wedding I was officiating. The butter soaked in nicely, with no greasy after feel. I do plan on eventually making lotions. Someday. ;)</li>
            <li> I got this so I could try creating different beauty products etc. The quality is way higher when you purchase it in the block like this. Here is one recipe I used and LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup shea butter&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup olive or almond oil&lt;br /&gt;10-15 drops your favorite essential oil, if you need it to smell pretty (I like orange, or sandalwood for something a little more manly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions&lt;br /&gt;Combine all the ingredients in a double boiler or small saucepan over medium heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat until everything is melted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pour into another bowl and let cool for a good hour (in the fridge if you&#x27;re in a hurry), or until the oils are just starting to consider re-solidifying (this is important - you won&#x27;t be able to whip it up if they&#x27;re still too liquid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the oil mixture is starting to solidify around the edges, start beating with a hand mixer. Continue for a few more minutes, or until it looks kinda like whipped cream, forming stiff peaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transfer to a jar or other storage. Should keep for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As easy as that! TRY IT! :)</li>
            <li> If you follow my reviews, I think you will see that I am very big into homemade, natural products in a big way. Shea butter is a must have, but relatively hard to find in raw form. When making creams, salves and lotions, you really need a good Shea butter, and even better if you mash it with cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice, solid, pure block. I live in AZ and my mail carrier never comes to the door. Even having sat out in 100+ degree sun for at least an hour, it was still solid and firm. That says an awful lot about its purity. When you touch it, it really feels like butter. Fatty, but not oily or slimy at all. Sometimes people will pass off stuff like that. This is enough for me to make at least 2 creams, 3 lotion and a salve or two, depending on batch size. Add in essential oils and whatever other ingredients you care to use, and you will come out the other side with a truly quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST, FAIR AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY ASIDE FROM SAID DISCOUNT*</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this organic shea butter. This block of shea butter is large and came well packaged. I love that it is nice and creamy. The block was big enough that I was able to share it with my son who was very excited to have it. He immediately applied it to his back where he is having trouble with acne. He stated that is was better quality then he had gotten in the past from another supplier. We also plan on using it this summer for a natural sunscreen. Shea butter is so versatile for so many skin problems everyone should have some around the house. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love everything about Shea butter: it has so many uses and benefits. This block of Shea butter comes nicely compressed and very hard, and wrapped in a plastic material. It has that nice, nutty Shea butter scent and it&#x27;s an off white color, not yellow like i&#x27;m used to. I can feel its thickness when i touch it and rub it in between my fingers. I&#x27;m used to using Shea butter in a tub, and it&#x27;s easy to remove and handle. This is also easy to use since you can just easily cut a piece off and rub it between your palms to melt. I love using this on my skin; it makes my skin so soft and moisturized. It also adds a nice, healthy glow. I&#x27;ll also melt this, mix it with other oils, and use it on my hair. I cant wait to experiment! Its all about quality when it comes to 100% natural African Shea butter, and this one is definitely good quality.</li>
            <li> I own several essential oils from Majestic Pure and absolutely love them, so when I was offered the opportunity to buy their Organic Shea Butter at a promotional price for my evaluation and review I readily accepted. Shea butter is such an excellent natural anti-aging and moisturizing agent for the skin with so many beneficial qualities that I could go on &amp; on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting to try making my own lotions so when I ordered this I also ordered 4 oz. jars with lids (here on Amazon) to store the lotion, and here&#x27;s what I made:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whipped Shea Butter Lotion&lt;br /&gt;4 oz. Majestic Pure Raw Unrefined Organic Shea butter&lt;br /&gt;2 Tbsp Majestic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;15 total drops of Essential Oils -  (I used 7 drops of Carrot and 7 drops of  Rosemary Essential Oils.)&lt;br /&gt;Mixing Bowl - (I used my Ninja to mix and whip rather than a bowl and hand mixer)&lt;br /&gt;Mixer&lt;br /&gt;2 clean and empty 4 oz jars with lid liners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to make it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Have Raw Unrefined Shea Butter at room temperature (Do not melt or heat it!)&lt;br /&gt;2. Measure 4oz and add that to Ninja and pulse - (or to a bowl - if done in a bowl mash it with a fork like you would whipped potatoes)&lt;br /&gt;3. Add 2 Tbsp Majestic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil &amp; pulse (or mash) a little more&lt;br /&gt;4. Blend in Ninda for approx. 2 minutes (or mix on high speed for about 5 minutes if doing in bowl) until mixture is creamy and well blended&lt;br /&gt;5. Put whipped lotion into clean jars and close. Store in clean, dry, dark and cool place. Room temperature is generally fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was easy, went on like silk, absorbed very well and smelled very nice without being very strong. You can experiment with the types and amount of essential oils you want to add (if any). Shea Butter contains natural vitamins, antioxidants and fatty acids make it amazingly nourishing and moisturizing. This Majestic Pure Raw Unrefined 100% Organic Shea Butter is cut, not melted and poured, comes from Ghana and has an average shelf life of 12-18 months.  I love working with it and think it would be hard, if not impossible to find a better Shea Butter than this.  If you&#x27;re looking for a top notch Shea Butter I believe you will be as pleased with Majestic Pure Shea Butter as I am!an average shelf life of 12-18 months.  I love working with it and think it would be hard, if not impossible to find a better Shea Butter than this.  If you&#x27;re looking for a top notch Shea Butter I believe you will be as pleased with Majestic Pure Shea Butter as I am!</li>
            <li> I originally applied to receive this product to review it so that I could give a shot at making something to help with my acne. This is the recipe that I followed for a shea butter that was enriched with lavendar and lemongrass essential oils that can help with just that. There are other essential oils that are also good for acne also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 oz. unrefined Shea butter&lt;br /&gt;15 drops Lavender essential oil&lt;br /&gt;10 drops Lemongrass essential oil&lt;br /&gt;2 oz. or bigger empty clean jar&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to melt the shea butter at all which is awesome. All you have to do is make sure that the shea butter is at room temperature before you start. Mask it with a fork and then add your essential oils. Mash again and mix with a hand mixer. Ta-da!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter worked wonderfully for making this cream and I have used it everyday with great success since. The other ingredients that are believed to be good for acne are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butters: Shea butter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils: Basil, Bergamot, Birch, Cajuput, Camphor, Caraway, Cedarwood, Chamomile, Garlic, Grapefruit, Immortelle, Juniper, Lavender, Lemongrass, Myrtle, Niaouli, Patchouli, Petitgrain, Sandalwood, Tea Tree, Vetivert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others: African Black Soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter is a great quality and you will get many uses out of this size! There are so many other recipes I want to try!</li>
            <li> I got this for review and am amazed at the size of this block.  It looks and feels like butter, so I have to keep it away from butter lovers!&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter is better purchased unrefined or grade A like this one because that is when it has the most benefits! It will be harder and quite oily. When you warm it it will soften.&lt;br /&gt;Skin, hair, shave with it-you&#x27;ll love it! Rub on your heels.&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a homeopathic wonder of this Earth!</li>
            <li> Great Shea butter,  very easy to  break apart.  I warm mine ~ then let it cool an add a bit of essential oils.  Put in muffin tins and put in fridge to harden back up.  Turns out great and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I got this to review for my nephew he has sever exema and none of the soaps worked so far well glad to say this did immediately stopped the itching and after a couple of days redness is diminishing</li>
            <li> I recieved this product in a timely manner, and it&#x27;s a full pound of Shea Butter!  I am very excited to make some body butter, some conditioner and some body wash! This product will be perfect for my crafting needs!!</li>
            <li> So when I got this I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it. Then I found and tried a few of these things. It worked so well. He is what I tried. First  off I used it on my skin. Which helped to relieve the dryness. Then I used it on my lips and my worked better then some lip balms. I used it on the heel of my feet and it really help soften the skin.It also helps with insect bites. There is so much you can use this for I am learning and trying new things all the time. This stuff is great. I DID RECEIVE THIS AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using Shea butter, and I may be addicted. I&#x27;ve been interested in making my own soaps, lotions, deodorants with natural ingredients for some time. When the opportunity to review this item at a reduced price for an honest and unbiased opinion came my way, I jumped on the chance. When the Shea butter arrived, I was surprised by its size-literally, the size of a huge brick. So far I&#x27;ve made homemade deodorant and hand soaps. The Shea butter is easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t have any overwhelming smells. The deodorant works well(I&#x27;ve tried diy in the past that were messy or plain didn&#x27;t work). All in all, I&#x27;m surprised that I haven&#x27;t tried this before. Also, I think the price point is spot on for the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see this shea butter arrive perfectly intact in hot, steamy August, but, it did. It is nicely refined shea that melts into skin very smoothly. It is really nice to use as lotion bar alone in slices or as a base for other hair and skin creations. Other shea products I&#x27;ve ordered arrive crumbly and you never feel that you&#x27;ve gotten the full amount of shea for your money, but with this brick you know you&#x27;ve gotten all that you&#x27;ve paid for. Excellent value and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;*This product was given at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review*</li>
            <li> Started using this in some home facial items seems to work well . it is exactly what it says it is. Came nicely packaged and ready to use. Glad I got it. I got this product at a reduced rate in return for reviewing it, but I am very glad that I did.</li>
            <li> This is some AWESOME STUFF. Made my lip balm satiny smooth !!</li>
            <li> Perfect for home-made body butter.  We purchased this large 1lb bar of raw shea butter&lt;br /&gt;in a promotion for testing and review.  It can be blended with essential oils for a lovely&lt;br /&gt;and healthy body butter.  Or you can use it plain, it is great for dry skin conditions, and&lt;br /&gt;even chapped lips, and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have been using majestic pure shea butter from the day i received as you can see frkm the picture, it melts easily in my hand, the best thing about majestic product  is that they offer pure organic items an this high quality shea butter is definitely  one of those items.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved  this item for my unbiased honest opinion and it was my pleasure to review thia shea butter an its also now my staple butter for myself as well as kids.</li>
            <li> I used the majestic pure shea butter mainly for my stretch marks and dry skin. After 2 applications I honestly did see my stretch marks already start to fade and I my skin felt really hydrated. Since I got this product for free or at a reduced price to try it out I would recommend the majestic pure shea butter to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really love this Shea butter, it was easy to melt and make body butter with. The smell is nice and not strong.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I cut the shea butter into smaller cubes to make it easier to use. I put it on my hands and it made them so silky smooth and moisturized. The value is great, it&#x27;s a lot of product. I received it discounted from AMZ Review Trader but I plan to repurchase on my own when I run out. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used many products with shea butter in them and they are always so nourishing to my skin. I suffer from ichythosis vulgaris, so my skin is often flaky and scaly. Since I was tired of paying high prices for various lotions, I decided to try making my own. To that end, I bought this unrefined organic shea butter in order to get the highest quality I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, I was surprised that it hadn&#x27;t melted, as it was sitting out in 100 degree heat for a few days while we were on a family getaway. But it was packaged nicely, with wax paper inside of a cardboard box. It smelled quite nice when I opened it. I immediately ran my fingers over it a few times, and it melted enough to leave a small film over my finger. I used this on one arm and then left it for 24 hours just to see if I could tell a difference. The arm I put the shea butter on was quite soft after a full day, while my other arm had already started to dry out. This alone filled me with confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been collecting many recipes to make my own beauty bars, and I can&#x27;t wait to try them all. I think having this will make all the difference in quality, AND I&#x27;ll have saved money!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this item in order to review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Purchased with a discount code for a review.  My first shea butter.  Really like the large block.  Packaging is great with a sturdy box and the butter wrapped in a waxed butcher paper.  Great for delivery of the shea butter in the Florida summer heat.  I have made one moisturizer with the shea butter.  It is very smooth.  No graininess at all. Looking forward to continuing using this brand.</li>
            <li> This 1lb of all natural Shea butter is helping to keep my skin moisturized and soft. This bar is going a long way and I love it. The smell is of natural Shea butter and is wonderful. I know of a few people that would love this for a gift.</li>
            <li> I got this for free for a review. It is so good. My skin is moist and it stays over night. I put it on while I am wet and let it moisturize my skin. I have noticed the difference in my complection. A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;If you rub it in your hands really good and apply it where you want. Very good product for blemishes and skin disorders. I have allergies and my skin is very dry. Not any more. Thanks for your generosity in allowing me to review your products.</li>
            <li> I always make my own lip balm, I have now for the past couple years and I never had added Shea Butter before, but I knew I was getting this Shea Butter from Majestic Pure, so I started looking up recipes I could use this in and I kept finding lip balm recipes, so I have everything to make some since I was needing to anyway, to get me through winter and I added the Shea Butter and it made it better in my opinion! I added a chunk I broke off, into the pan as I was cooking the ingredients I use and it blended right in! I will continue to use the Shea Butter in my mixture!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product complimentary for review purposes.
