            <li>The price point seemed like a good deal, but I guess when you take into consideration quality...not so much.</li>

            <li>Easy to fill water compartment.</li>

            <li>the product did not turn on..not even the power on/off light.</li>
            <li>So far, up in north-east, it is doing a good job on my hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5-star rating</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>this product doesn&#x27;t really deliver the heat necessary to give you a great look.  </li>
            <li>It really is meant for smaller jobs, but it does work well, and the steam feature is great.</li>
            <li>The water can get so hot, that it makes a sizzling sound.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the smallest steam flatiron in the market as my large one does such a good job with steam.</li>
            <li>Great price for a little powerful straightener.</li>
            <li>Economical.</li>
            <li>Just right for travel.  </li>
            <li>Only useful for traveling for sure.</li>
            <li>The iron is small enough to fit in my smallest purse(24X4X2 cm ) and does a good job on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first hair iron.</li>
            <li>very cute and portable, the only con is you have to constantly keep filling it up with water</li>

            <li>Is what I want, when I search and see the specifications, the product is excelent, This buy is in substitution of the older.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this it straightened the hair well enough that it looked straightened.</li>

            <li>did not see any steam action.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 13 year old daughter to take to school, friends&#x27; houses, and traveling.</li>
            <li>the MAJOR draw back is the lack of a temperature control, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much as I only use it to style certain frontal areas of my hair that are stubborn and always end up curling in humidity naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought these for a coworker who has short  (up to her ears - naturally curly) hair and likes to get her hair straightened at the salon.</li>
            <li>now my hair is wild and dry.</li>
            <li>The water reservoir is very small and runs out too quickly.</li>

            <li> now my hair is wild and dry.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is very small and runs out too quickly.</li>
            <li> The steam feature does not work well and the flat iron seems to burn my hair.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine, but the brush/teeth that is removable is pretty useless; it comes off in thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair when it&#x27;s washed and dried naturally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for going from curly to straight.</li>
            <li> The water level in the reservoir stayed the same after half hour of straightening.</li>
            <li> not quite what I expected, but will do the job</li>
            <li> and you have to repeatedly go over the same strand a few times for desired effect.</li>
            <li> Not great to take curly hair to straight though.</li>
            <li> Also is one of the few mini flat irons that comes with the brush which helps a lot to get the hair straighter and faster.</li>
            <li> This iron is small enough to take on the road.</li>
            <li> It does not have heat setting which is a disappointment but it does not get very hot.</li>
            <li> Weighty for a small flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is a total failure.</li>
            <li> Its water container is very small and I have to fill it up twice for my short hair.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair well and its really small</li>
            <li> Small and works when in need while on vacation.</li>
            <li> Its small bag (19.5X7.5 cm) has a elastic loop for its wire to stay put.</li>
            <li> They were not sure if it should be visible steam or not but that they think it \\&quot;Might be non-visible steam\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> Tried it again today and it was worse.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> not quite what I expected, but will do the job</li>
            <li> I bought these for a coworker who has short  (up to her ears - naturally curly) hair and likes to get her hair straightened at the salon. She loved it because it comes with a comb and she loves the way it makes her hair look! Great price for a little powerful straightener.</li>
            <li> great price for the purchase. it actually works. its mini so don&#x27;t expect it to do big jobs. very cute and portable, the only con is you have to constantly keep filling it up with water</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it at all it doesn&#x27;t straighten your hair well and its really small I don&#x27;t think you should buy it because its a waste of money when it says its MINI trust me its really MINI</li>
            <li> Quality product. Weighty for a small flat iron. Fantastic for shorter hair. Delivered quickly. Easy to fill water compartment. Economical.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is very small and runs out too quickly. Didn&#x27;t like it even for my hairline and roots.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling. Very compact and fits perfect in your suitcase. Small and works when in need while on vacation.</li>
            <li> Is what I want, when I search and see the specifications, the product is excelent, This buy is in substitution of the older.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for $14.99 in July.  As of this morning (September 17th), it stopped working.  I called Conair customer service to use the warranty and was told they would replace it but I would need to pay the shipping to send it back to them.  I don&#x27;t believe I should have to make any additional investment to get a faulty product replaced.  The price point seemed like a good deal, but I guess when you take into consideration quality...not so much.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing. We own the larger version and loved it so much that we thought this would be a good choice for a travel sized straightener. Only reason that  I didn&#x27;t give it a full 5-star rating is because I thought I was getting a different bag with a zipper.</li>
            <li> This iron is small enough to take on the road. It works just fine, but the brush/teeth that is removable is pretty useless; it comes off in thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for going from curly to straight. There isn&#x27;t much steam and several passes are needed, but it can work well for touch ups.</li>
            <li> It is what it should be. I was looking for the smallest steam flatiron in the market as my large one does such a good job with steam. My hair is fine and curly which in humidity becomes frizzy. So far, up in north-east, it is doing a good job on my hair. It does not have heat setting which is a disappointment but it does not get very hot. Its water container is very small and I have to fill it up twice for my short hair. The iron is small enough to fit in my smallest purse(24X4X2 cm ) and does a good job on my fine hair. Its small bag (19.5X7.5 cm) has a elastic loop for its wire to stay put.</li>
            <li> I wish this product was just a bit wider. But definitely served its purpose. Only useful for traveling for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and handy aid, really nice results. I gave it as a gift and my collegue was glad. She&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is my first hair iron. My hair has always been waves and nice but age seem to be getting to my hair. For he last 28years I have been coloring my hair as I began to get gray hair in my 20&#x27;s. now my hair is wild and dry. I am still trying to learn the best heat but already love this iron as it has many different option, steam, no steam, hair separated or not and multiple heat degrees! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for traveling. I have one I keep at home and this is my travel straightener. I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work as well, but it works great!</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t really deliver the heat necessary to give you a great look.  At best its warm and you have to repeatedly go over the same strand a few times for desired effect.</li>
            <li> Honestly perfect for a guy with medium-ish length hair...the MAJOR draw back is the lack of a temperature control, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much as I only use it to style certain frontal areas of my hair that are stubborn and always end up curling in humidity naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value for the money paid and I really enjoyed the steam feature, it seems like it truly does keep your hair from singeing/burning. the tiny size makes it perfect for fitting into a toiletry bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I do no regret this purchase and would recommend it to someone looking to do styling on a smaller scale.</li>
            <li> Product just worked once. At the second time I tried to use it the product did not turn on..not even the power on/off light.</li>
            <li> This straightener is just what I was looking for and it&#x27;s easy to store!  I am impressed at how quickly it heats up!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this it straightened the hair well enough that it looked straightened. I have wavy hair when it&#x27;s washed and dried naturally. Not too thick and not too thin. So it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort or heat to straighten it unless there&#x27;s a stubborn wave.&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any steam action. The water level in the reservoir stayed the same after half hour of straightening. Called conair hotline and spoke with 3 different people. They were not sure if it should be visible steam or not but that they think it \\&quot;Might be non-visible steam\\&quot;. I told them that I am not seeing the reservoir emptying even if it were invisible steam and they said it might be defective, in that case. Tried it again today and it was worse. My hair looks more like I had straightened it using a hairbrush and blowdryer than with a straightener. This is a total failure. It has a 2 yr warranty between postage for both ways, I think it&#x27;s better to buy better one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter to take to school, friends&#x27; houses, and traveling. Its great for touch-ups. Not great to take curly hair to straight though. It really is meant for smaller jobs, but it does work well, and the steam feature is great.</li>
            <li> I like the product, however, I wish there was a dial where I can control the tempature.  The water can get so hot, that it makes a sizzling sound.</li>
            <li> Very good product!!!! I realy loved!!!Just in time as announced!!!Packaging perfect!!! Realy exceeded my expectations!!!I recommended to all who enjoy it!!!</li>
            <li> I like the size and the fact that it has a case. The steam feature does not work well and the flat iron seems to burn my hair.  I&#x27;m very happy with the full size version by Conair that I have and thought this would be a mini version. Dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have thin, short hair and this mini straightener is perfect.</li>
            <li> Just right for travel.  Easier on hair than many.</li>
            <li> I bought for travel. I am a backpacker, so the size is so convenient for my trips, who doesn&#x27;t want to look good while traveling.  The steam helps me with the frizz, and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. love it. Also is one of the few mini flat irons that comes with the brush which helps a lot to get the hair straighter and faster.</li>
