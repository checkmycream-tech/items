            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Great tool and fast shipping</li>
            <li>It does not like to hold a curl even with the appropriate styling products.  </li>
            <li>how-to videos and now, it&#x27;s my favorite tool to use on my hair.</li>
            <li>Well made, gets good and hot, and has a temperature dial.  </li>
            <li>This iron heats to about 400 F which is ideal for a strong hold, especially for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I need something easy and</li>
            <li>I always get complements on my hair and it&#x27;s so easy to do.</li>
            <li>Great hot stick, gets super hot, tapering barrel is perfect size for medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>I love using it for special occasions and even every-day use.</li>
            <li>Took it out to use it the other day, loved it, then went to use it again and noticed it wasn&#x27;t heating up, the cord inside the swivel part isn&#x27;t getting a good connection and is turning off and on every time it moves.</li>
            <li>When I do my hair with a clamp curling iron, it will barely last me til the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;This Hot Tools curling wand is perfect for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>i have baby fine hair that refuses to curl with all drug store brand irons.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this curler for myself and quickly gave it to my daughter, (WHO LOVES IT!).</li>
            <li>My wife and the girls enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product overall.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, stays nice and hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, straightforward with the heat settings, the chord swivels for ease, it is clamp free</li>
            <li>The heating elements are of top quality and gets very hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>, I curl and then pin up the hair to let it cool.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quick</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and this iron works magnificently!  </li>
            <li>I can do a few touch ups and walk out the door looking great.</li>
            <li>The curls it creates look so much more natural than a curling wand that doesn&#x27;t have a tapered end too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t personally like the wand curls on my own hair.</li>
            <li>this gives nice curls that really last if i use product along with it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get my hair to style quite right with this style curler</li>
            <li>I own several clip irons from Hot Tools, all of which perform exceedingly well.  </li>
            <li>It gets good and hot so be careful when using it!</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m just kind of old school when it comes to curling irons because I really couldn&#x27;t grasp the whole tapered /</li>
            <li>The 1&amp;#34; to 3/4&amp;#34; is great for loose, natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>love it absolutely the bestone so far</li>
            <li>that does the job right, I LOVE this curling iron, I&#x27;ve used it countless times and always look forward to doing my hair again.</li>
            <li>The glove that comes with this is pretty ineffective, though.</li>
            <li>The smaller one makes more of a curl</li>
            <li>TOO HOT FOR MY HAIR.</li>
            <li>Only used it a couple of times when I first got it, like many tools it has been stored away.</li>
            <li>Curling wands are a bit different than clamp curling irons and take a bit more practice to get a hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they have not failed me.</li>
            <li>They turn on every time, get hot and stay hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Hot Tools for over ten years and their products are the best and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This curler gets HOT and gets hot fast.  </li>
            <li>With the wand I can have lovely vintage waves in 15 minutes, nice defined curls in 30 and they will last for days with a little hair spray to set.</li>
            <li>better for my long hair.</li>
            <li>It is my first no-clip iron, and it is very easy to use (though I did burn myself a couple times the first few times</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have two children and don&#x27;t have much time.</li>
            <li>my 11 YO daughter loves her new hot tools iron.  </li>
            <li>The curls in my hair stay better from this curling iron than any other iron I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>originally ordered medium but ended up with this larger size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quick to heat up and hot enough to make the curls last (they do include a glove so you don&#x27;t burn yourself).</li>
            <li>High heat, heats up quickly, and curls last all day.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have naturally stick straight, no-volume hair.  </li>
            <li>Just probably not an everyday iron for most ladies.</li>
            <li>Brand new in package.</li>
            <li>I am pretty low maintenance when it comes to hair</li>
            <li>Hot Tools is worth every penny and last long.</li>
            <li>tried it, but I personally didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and keeps the curl for a long time.</li>
            <li>I can get the same exact look with my regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and this really did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I only get hot tools as they are high quality and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I saw this exact wand at Ulta the other day</li>
            <li>After trying several clipless curling irons, I finally went back to Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, but this product is the only way I can get full-on curls.</li>
            <li>I liked the quality this curling iron professed by other reviewers and found that at such an affordable price, it would be a hard to pass up.</li>
            <li>You can do small sections to create a lot of curl or do larger sections for a quick wavy look.</li>
            <li>have owned Hot Tools products for a few years now</li>
            <li>I have straight hair with slight waves.</li>

            <li> have owned Hot Tools products for a few years now</li>
            <li> I have straight hair with slight waves.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the glove makes it difficult to get a good feel while using it, so I generally don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> iron far out performs another much more expensive brand I had previously purchased.  </li>
            <li> I expect this to last a long time!</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to use because you can easily burn your hands.</li>
            <li> It seems much harder to me to make curls with it than it does with a regular curling iron with a spring-loaded clip.</li>
            <li> Takes too long to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> Be careful and start off with the heat turned way down and slowly turn up to the right level.  </li>
            <li> so you can put it down when ur fiddling with the back of your head.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with hot tools!</li>
            <li> When I curl my hair with the wand, my curls last for a few days.</li>
            <li> it took her a few tries before she got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair, and this is the only thing that curls it.</li>
            <li> I have the technique down, but fingertips end up getting burned.  </li>
            <li> and I have my heat setting about half way.</li>
            <li> With much less effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (and failed) multiple times to curl my hair with curling irons and even my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my friends hair a few times before</li>
            <li> the past 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed in a Hot Tools product.</li>
            <li> I always thought my hair was hard to curl until I bought this thing.</li>
            <li> I ordered late in the evening and they shipped out 6:30am</li>
            <li> I have course difficult to curl hair</li>
            <li> and Ive only used it maybe three times, very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> This does include a glove to prevent that from happening but I find it difficult to hold my hair with the glove on.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

            <li> GREAT PRICE AND QUALITY. KEEPS HAIR HEALTHY WITH NO BURNING.</li>
            <li> Love this tapered curling iron.  Be careful and start off with the heat turned way down and slowly turn up to the right level.  This thing gets HOT!!!!  I have course difficult to curl hair and I have my heat setting about half way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron. It is my first no-clip iron, and it is very easy to use (though I did burn myself a couple times the first few times I used it). The glove that comes with this is pretty ineffective, though. I personally just don&#x27;t use a glove at all, but if you want to use one, I&#x27;d suggest buying a separate one.</li>
            <li> High heat, heats up quickly, and curls last all day.</li>
            <li> Not what she wanted . It was returned.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Works great.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this works but makes just a wave. The smaller one makes more of a curl</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! Before trying a wand my hair never held curls and took 45 minutes to curl. With the wand I can have lovely vintage waves in 15 minutes, nice defined curls in 30 and they will last for days with a little hair spray to set. It gets good and hot so be careful when using it! My only complaint is the glove makes it difficult to get a good feel while using it, so I generally don&#x27;t use it. Heats up quickly, stays nice and hot.</li>
            <li> This curling iron curls just as it should. I only get hot tools as they are high quality and last a long time. I have yet to replace anything I&#x27;ve bought from them.</li>
            <li> This iron heats to about 400 F which is ideal for a strong hold, especially for fine hair.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she is enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> I liked the quality this curling iron professed by other reviewers and found that at such an affordable price, it would be a hard to pass up. The curls it creates look so much more natural than a curling wand that doesn&#x27;t have a tapered end too. Of course, that&#x27;s only a matter of preference. This wouldn&#x27;t work so well for shorter styles, but it&#x27;s great for longer hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls! Heats up quick</li>
            <li> I personally did not care for this product. I thought as described it was a curling iron, it did not even hold onto my hair there was no closing or clamp.  Was very frustrating...</li>
            <li> It is probably going to take awhile before my daughter actually learns how to use the iron.  There is definitely an art form!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I saw this exact wand at Ulta the other day and it was 60 bucks there! I got it here on Amazon for 35, so I am extremely happy about that. It works wonders! I always thought my hair was hard to curl until I bought this thing. If you&#x27;re hesitating on buying it, don&#x27;t!! It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this iron works magnificently!  Love it and would buy again!  Makes beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> I purchased this curler for myself and quickly gave it to my daughter, (WHO LOVES IT!). The heating elements are of top quality and gets very hot quickly.  TOO HOT FOR MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> my 11 YO daughter loves her new hot tools iron.  it took her a few tries before she got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 16-year-old daughter, and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it, but I personally didn&#x27;t really like it. It seems much harder to me to make curls with it than it does with a regular curling iron with a spring-loaded clip. I can get the same exact look with my regular curling iron. With much less effort. But maybe that is just because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been using the past 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. Try it out you might like it--my kid did.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and this really did nothing for me. The tapered feature made my curls looks awkward. I ended up buying a thinner one that was not tapered and it works much better.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just kind of old school when it comes to curling irons because I really couldn&#x27;t grasp the whole tapered / wear a glove thing.  I tried it and got frustrated and ended up giving this away.</li>
            <li> Bought for my girl friend&#x27;s sister. This is one of the better on the market for a great price. Bought on Amazon since it was around $10 cheaper than ulta.</li>
            <li> hot tools is the best!</li>
            <li> Only used it a couple of times when I first got it, like many tools it has been stored away. Took it out to use it the other day, loved it, then went to use it again and noticed it wasn&#x27;t heating up, the cord inside the swivel part isn&#x27;t getting a good connection and is turning off and on every time it moves. Of course my warranty is expired by now and Ive only used it maybe three times, very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife and the girls enjoy using it. The price is good on Amazon. The heat resistant glove can&#x27;t tolerate the heat of the iron. It meted a hole on the index finger. I guess the iron does produce lots of heat. It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great hot stick, gets super hot, tapering barrel is perfect size for medium to long hair. I expect this to last a long time!</li>
            <li> This is a great product overall. It is sturdy and always heats up and works great. I just don&#x27;t personally like the wand curls on my own hair. It can be difficult to use because you can easily burn your hands. This does include a glove to prevent that from happening but I find it difficult to hold my hair with the glove on. However, if you want a wand this is a great one.</li>
            <li> I ordered late in the evening and they shipped out 6:30am my time (western time) the next day. I was impressed! Everytying was shipped as it should be. Brand new in package.</li>
            <li> love it absolutely the bestone so far and i have used rucha, babyliss, irons etc..</li>
            <li> This is a great iron, it gets super hot and gives your hair a great look.  You can do small sections to create a lot of curl or do larger sections for a quick wavy look.</li>
            <li> I am pretty low maintenance when it comes to hair and I need something easy and that does the job right, I LOVE this curling iron, I&#x27;ve used it countless times and always look forward to doing my hair again. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s sturdy, straightforward with the heat settings, the chord swivels for ease, it is clamp free so you won&#x27;t have an indentation and it has a stand so you can put it down when ur fiddling with the back of your head. You can&#x27;t go wrong with hot tools!</li>
            <li> The curls in my hair stay better from this curling iron than any other iron I&#x27;ve tried. I love how well this works with curling my hair. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this curling iron because I liked the way my hairdresser used it on my hair. I found one at Ulta on sale and with a holiday look for more money. So I returned it and purchased this one. It gets really hot and keeps the curl for a long time. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great curls that can be waves, and heats up fast! I have extremely thick hair, and this is the only thing that curls it. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this iron. it works better then the Sedu iron which costs triple the price.  I&#x27;ve been using Hot Tools for over ten years and their products are the best and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this iron.  Takes too long to do my hair.  I have the technique down, but fingertips end up getting burned.  I don&#x27;t have the patience to use this item.  It is a quality iron though.  Well made, gets good and hot, and has a temperature dial.  Just probably not an everyday iron for most ladies.</li>
            <li> The 1&amp;#34; to 3/4&amp;#34; is great for loose, natural looking curls. I always get complements on my hair and it&#x27;s so easy to do. I have straight hair with slight waves. When I curl my hair with the wand, my curls last for a few days. I have two children and don&#x27;t have much time. I can do a few touch ups and walk out the door looking great. When I do my hair with a clamp curling iron, it will barely last me til the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;This Hot Tools curling wand is perfect for all types of hair. I&#x27;ve done my friends hair a few times before (her hair does not hold curls with my clamp curling iron), however, with this curling rod, hers held until the next day with no hair spray. Curling wands are a bit different than clamp curling irons and take a bit more practice to get a hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned Hot Tools products for a few years now and they have not failed me. I own a straightener and a curling rod. These products get abused by my family from dropping off the counter to getting slammed in the door. They turn on every time, get hot and stay hot. I love the adjustable heat settings and quality. Hot Tools is worth every penny and last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (and failed) multiple times to curl my hair with curling irons and even my flat iron. Nothing worked, so I decided to give this a shot. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s very quick to heat up and hot enough to make the curls last (they do include a glove so you don&#x27;t burn yourself). I start with tighter curls in the morning and by the evening, they are a bit looser and relaxed, but still definitely defined. My hair is naturally wavy, but this product is the only way I can get full-on curls. I love using it for special occasions and even every-day use. Would definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Great tool and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This curler gets HOT and gets hot fast.  I can&#x27;t seem to get my hair to style quite right with this style curler but that&#x27;s not its fault.  It does what it says it will and the curl seems to last.</li>
            <li> Got a 2nd degree burn on my hand! Guess it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> After trying several clipless curling irons, I finally went back to Hot Tools.  I own several clip irons from Hot Tools, all of which perform exceedingly well.  But I like the clipless irons for putting tighter curls in my hair without the dreaded crimp mark from the clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron far out performs another much more expensive brand I had previously purchased.  For reference, I have naturally stick straight, no-volume hair.  It does not like to hold a curl even with the appropriate styling products.  This iron not only curls my hair but it lasts until I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, I curl and then pin up the hair to let it cool.  But if short on time simply curling and going works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this was a really great purchase.  I have never been disappointed in a Hot Tools product.</li>
            <li> i have baby fine hair that refuses to curl with all drug store brand irons.  this gives nice curls that really last if i use product along with it.  it does have a learning curve that i am still struggling with as it is a non-traditional iron (no clip, tapered), but thats no falut of the iron &amp; i am getting used to it.  originally ordered medium but ended up with this larger size. better for my long hair.</li>
            <li> My curling iron took some getting used to when learning how to use it. I watched the youtube how-to videos and now, it&#x27;s my favorite tool to use on my hair.</li>
