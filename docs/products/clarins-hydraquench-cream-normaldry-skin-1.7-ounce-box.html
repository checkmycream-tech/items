            <li>All the best products get discontinued ...</li>
            <li>Clarins is the best!</li>
            <li>year-old mother says it&#x27;s the best skin care product she&#x27;s ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and it has always done a great job keeping my face moisturized!</li>
            <li>Flawless application after use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s s great moisturizer!</li>
            <li>The hydrating mask is great too!</li>
            <li>Very nice cream!  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked or felt so good!</li>
            <li>Skin feels SOOO good after application!</li>
            <li>However, for the cost, I find it isn&#x27;t exceptional or wonderfully impressive.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>i m happy with this product ..</li>
            <li>but the product is great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Good texture and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Again, Clarins is a good product if you already have good skin.</li>
            <li>Good delivery, no problems, and packaging O.K.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found a lotion that works better!</li>
            <li>Still love it!</li>
            <li>But it does provide a nice, continuous barrier of moisture that seems to also be effective against environmental skin irritants.  </li>
            <li>i have nice skin</li>
            <li>who has tried this line and hasn&#x27;t liked it. :))</li>
            <li>it is hydrating light on my skin and smells good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, not greasey, and has a mild pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately Clarins has started adding that gag-me perfumey smell to many of their moisturizers that Olay puts in all their products.  </li>
            <li>I use it for many years.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer for dry skin under makeup!</li>
            <li>Overall, the best product I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;m so glad that it&#x27;s not terribly expensive!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I love this cream--it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it keeps my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this moisturizer, and I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li>Althought it is fantastic, it is by no means an intensive treatment.</li>
            <li>If that describes you, I&#x27;m sure you will love this cream as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>The normal/combination is good for summer but in winter, the sensitive/dry/very dry formulations work better.</li>
            <li>So many of Clarins products do exactly what they say they&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li>I had problems with MAC&#x27;s prep+prime, because it dried my face out too much, but when I use it with this I get perfect results.</li>
            <li>but so worth it.</li>
            <li>Her skin is also fairer and much more sensitive than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In summer, I use this one (normal/dry skin) which is a lot lighter but just as effective on my facial skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super impressed with this product as a night cream or as a lotion in general.</li>
            <li>this would not be the right product for you.</li>
            <li>pretty soon, guess what?  </li>
            <li>However, I found later a better deal..</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I come from people with fair, sensitive skin and naturally, the occasional bit of rosacea which comes with that combination.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer changed all that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarins HydraQuench Cream hydrates all day, overnight, smooths lines - which is probably caused by the intense hydration it provides, plumping up the skin - doesn&#x27;t get greasy or oily and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those two products absolutely complement this one.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast</li>
            <li>this cream does really work for me</li>
            <li>it really does quench the skin...</li>
            <li>this 1 n tried it its really works</li>
            <li>My skin dries out a lot in the winter and this really helped keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li>Not heavy but provided the right amount of moisture for your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also over 40, so naturally, young, combination skin is giving way to more often dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin.</li>
            <li>Even if you do not have dry patches or anything, this is just a fantastic product for keeping your skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>For those still experiencing dry skin using this cream, I have used Clarins products for many years (over 30 to be specific.)  </li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer to Clarins and my skin was very dry after pregnancy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and yet it let your face totally breaths.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still having dry spots and I don&#x27;t see much difference between this and their day cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and smooth on the skin.</li>

            <li> They sent a version with spf 15. Not the product on this page. Not what I ordered or wanted. And their return process is complicated.  :(</li>
            <li> I love this cream--it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it keeps my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This was not the product my husband intended to get .... the one I use is a body cream that has been discontinued!  All the best products get discontinued ... what&#x27;s that about?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and yet it let your face totally breaths.  Usually I use it for 3 seasons (fall, winter &amp; spring).  The only complaint I have is it is fragrant.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this moisturizer, and I am so happy with it. It&#x27;s a little pricey but so worth it. I have normal skin. I very rarely have any problems or break outs, but when I do have problems it tends to be dry patches either from bursts of cold weather or bad reaction to makeup, primers or harsh makeup removers. I bought this during a particularly bad breakout of dry patches on my nose and around my mouth (had a bad cold lol), and this cleared them up in a matter of days.  Even if you do not have dry patches or anything, this is just a fantastic product for keeping your skin soft and supple. It&#x27;s very light, not greasey, and has a mild pleasant scent.  I would say if you have severely dry skin or severely oily skin this would not be the right product for you. Althought it is fantastic, it is by no means an intensive treatment. it is designed for normal skin that ocassionally suffers from a bit of dryness. If that describes you, I&#x27;m sure you will love this cream as much as I do.  Oh and also if your skin is shiny but not greasy and you want to use a mattifying face primer, but it dries your face out, this moisturizer works fantastically. I had problems with MAC&#x27;s prep+prime, because it dried my face out too much, but when I use it with this I get perfect results.</li>
            <li> For those still experiencing dry skin using this cream, I have used Clarins products for many years (over 30 to be specific.)  I find that if you have normal to combination skin in a temperate to cold climate, you need to change your regimen with the seasons.  In summer, this product would work; but in winter, something heavier is needed.  The normal/combination is good for summer but in winter, the sensitive/dry/very dry formulations work better.</li>
            <li> Clarins is the best! It truly needs to be everyone&#x27;s skin regimen...My skin has never looked or felt so good!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn or dry my already dry skin. However, for the cost, I find it isn&#x27;t exceptional or wonderfully impressive. Shortly, after applying it, my skin feels as if I&#x27;ve not applied anything. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clarins products for about two years now.  I started by adding some of the masks, cleansers and toners to my usual products and pretty soon, guess what?  So many of Clarins products do exactly what they say they&#x27;ll do, that I&#x27;ve replaced just about every skin care item in my vanity with Clarins products.  Facial skin care, body lotion, scrubs, tanning products, make-up...everything.  It&#x27;s worked that well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I come from people with fair, sensitive skin and naturally, the occasional bit of rosacea which comes with that combination.  I&#x27;m also over 40, so naturally, young, combination skin is giving way to more often dry skin.  This moisturizer changed all that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarins HydraQuench Cream hydrates all day, overnight, smooths lines - which is probably caused by the intense hydration it provides, plumping up the skin - doesn&#x27;t get greasy or oily and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  But it does provide a nice, continuous barrier of moisture that seems to also be effective against environmental skin irritants.  I&#x27;ve used this cream in both the with/without sunscreen formulas and both seem to provide this benefit.  Absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re over 40 too, do yourself a favor and also get the HydraQuench BiPhase Serum and once-weekly HydraQuench mask.  Those two products absolutely complement this one.  The serum works so well that my 70+ year-old mother says it&#x27;s the best skin care product she&#x27;s ever used.  That says a lot to me because for as long as I can remember, she&#x27;s been the &#x27;department store skin care&#x27; expert.  She&#x27;s tried just about every skin care line they&#x27;ve offered since the 60&#x27;s.  She loves this one.  Her skin is also fairer and much more sensitive than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re thinking of taking the plunge, don&#x27;t let the price make you think twice - try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  ( &amp;lt;--Blatant rip-off of an old Alka Seltzer slogan but I&#x27;ve not met anybody yet who has tried this line and hasn&#x27;t liked it. :))</li>
            <li> This cream has saved my skin over and over again. After moving to a climate that wreaked havoc on my skin, I discovered the HydraQuench cream and used the one for extra dry skin in winter. In summer, I use this one (normal/dry skin) which is a lot lighter but just as effective on my facial skin. Both creams appear to work in a way that seals in moisture on your skin, so that you don&#x27;t walk around with dry patches all day. Overall, the best product I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;m so glad that it&#x27;s not terribly expensive!</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast this cream does really work for me it is hydrating light on my skin and smells good you should give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have moved through the stages of Clarins in the last 25 years of use.  Great product.  I am not allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and it has always done a great job keeping my face moisturized! Haven&#x27;t found a lotion that works better!</li>
            <li> i like this product..  ... it really does quench the skin...</li>
            <li> i was having blak spot on my chicks after my baby birth n my skin become so rough even wen i applied foundation i was able to see white rough marks which looked  weird  i was worry coz i have nice skin i tried lot product but all useless than i found this 1 n tried it its really works even my hubby noticed change in my face n gave me compliment too .....i m happy with this product ..i m using it in winter but will use it in summer too lets see how it works in summer...</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer to Clarins and my skin was very dry after pregnancy so I bought this cream, it hydrates my skin without the greasy feeling that I hate so much! However, I found later a better deal..Amazon should have a price adjustment policy..but the product is great.</li>
            <li> Good texture and absorbs well. Has a neutral scent which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Clarins has started adding that gag-me perfumey smell to many of their moisturizers that Olay puts in all their products.  Too bad, because French company Clarins used to be known for the lovely, natural and subtle floral scents they put in some skincare products, reminiscent of an alpine meadow.  Lay off the perfume Clarins!</li>
            <li> Again, Clarins is a good product if you already have good skin. I&#x27;m not super impressed with this product as a night cream or as a lotion in general. I&#x27;m still having dry spots and I don&#x27;t see much difference between this and their day cream. Seems a bit redundant.</li>
            <li> Good delivery, no problems, and packaging O.K.</li>
            <li> I use it for many years. Still love it!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer for dry skin under makeup! Flawless application after use.</li>
            <li> Not heavy but provided the right amount of moisture for your skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin it&#x27;s s great moisturizer! It&#x27;s thick and smooth on the skin. I usually use it in the winter time when my skin is extra dry! Great product. The hydrating mask is great too!</li>
            <li> My skin dries out a lot in the winter and this really helped keep it moisturized. Now if only it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream!  Skin feels SOOO good after application!</li>
