            <li>My dermatologist recommended this soap and it is great.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I&#x27;m from the United Kingdom which goes to show that it&#x27;s still a great buy even when I include the shipping costs.</li>
            <li>, the Van Der Hagen Unscented Shave Soap looks to be a great bargain.</li>
            <li>I will keep using their soaps, because they produce a great lather and feel good on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I got the scented soap and while I can&#x27;t describe what the scent is, it is pleasant.</li>
            <li>but, wI&#x27;ll produce a good shaving lather after a bit of work.</li>
            <li>Truly no scent, good lather (with some work).</li>
            <li>A superior value.  </li>
            <li>The soap does a good job of lubricating my skin and the glycerin does a good job of keeping my face moist and helps soothe my skin.</li>
            <li>I have allergies and needed a good shave soap.</li>
            <li>As soon as I realised how good it was</li>
            <li>I had to find a good, unscented shaving soap at the advice of the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>He loved the soap.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>this is a good option.</li>
            <li>My husband says it feels good, it smells good, and it gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I love the lather this creates!</li>
            <li>makes a fine lather for shaving, pleasant scent which i could best describe as a nice clean neutral</li>
            <li>Lathers great and easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>and I think its an amazing soap.</li>
            <li>This mug soap gives me a great lather and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Finish drying and get ready for your best shave ever.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s unscented, it smells nice, so I guess &#x27;unscented&#x27; means that no scents are added for the sake of smell.</li>
            <li>Good smooth shave from a good soap.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the BEST bang for the buck in shaving soaps.</li>
            <li>At about $ 5.00 a puck I&#x27;d say this is a good choice for someone wanting to try a better soap without the worry of: &amp;#34;Will</li>
            <li>Works well, lathers and shaves nice, I prefer no added scent.</li>
            <li>great lather and quick.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this soap does a good job of helping with both.</li>
            <li>Although the soap has an interesting sterile kind of smell to it, however that smell does not stay with you after the shave.</li>
            <li>Still, this soap does a great job and is a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Cost effective and works just fine.</li>
            <li>I ditched my electric and have been using Van Der Hagen shave soaps for many, many years.</li>
            <li>To match or do better, you would have to move way up in price.</li>
            <li>I still need more to make it better.</li>
            <li>He want&#x27;s to let everyone know that he love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I bought this aloong with the shave set to have spare soap on hand, glad I did as I like the soap.</li>
            <li>Lathers really nicely and does it&#x27;s bit to give you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>With that bias aside I was happy to find that it works really well.</li>
            <li>I know that my wife likes it more than the &#x27;in your face&#x27; scent of Rapha&#x27;s shave</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works great, the lather forms pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Nice soap that lathers up easy and rinses away easily as well.</li>
            <li>Consistently excellent shaves and extraordinarily long razor life.</li>
            <li>The soap is very slippery, which I think contributes to a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy to get it lathered up</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like any strong scented soaps but</li>
            <li>Great quality, smooth later and shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a huge difference between brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Van Der Hagen is a widely available shaving soap brand.  </li>
            <li>I tried the scented version and liked it so much I purchased this to melt in with my Col Conk lime and bay rum soaps to give them a lather boost.</li>
            <li>Lathers up well and provides a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely reorder as this is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is better than the smaller picked Van Der Hagen Deluxe soap.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling pleasant.</li>
            <li>Having searched the internet for an alternative (and believe me, there really aren&#x27;t that many)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the scent is very mild (yes, though unscented it does have a very very slight smell) and pleasant.</li>
            <li>the only downside of it is that it needs 20% glycerin for a better glide barrier and easy application for face lather people.</li>
            <li>And it is a perfect fit for my late 50s to early 60s</li>
            <li>It lathers good with minimal water.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Van Der Hagen Luxury shaving soap and I will say I am 70 years old and have never ever had a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one comes pretty close.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit more whisking to get a rich foam from this puck than some other soaps I have used</li>
            <li>The unscented luxury soap weighs one ounce more than the standard glycerine soap [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>No need to buy the higher priced soaps.  </li>
            <li>Imagine that .. a shaving soap that doesn&#x27;t stink to high heaven!! ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first puck after 3 months.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It really is first rate.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>and I get more than enough lather to cover my face</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I use it everyday, I will continue to use it as long as you carry it!</li>
            <li>But most products are scented and he had to smell the scent all day long.  </li>
            <li>I melt it into my wooden shaving bowl, using a microwave several short 10 second bursts until fully melted then allow to cool to re-harden perfectly into my bowl.</li>
            <li>Great lather, long lasting and makes skin very soft after.</li>
            <li>Both of those products do a great job, but at $20 for not that much product, they&#x27;re not good for the budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again, but it&#x27;ll be a while, as I think that these three cakes will hold up for a good long time.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li>a little tip if you like your lather to be warm</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>Lathers well and lasts much longer than a can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I really like Van Der Hagen soaps.  </li>
            <li>I ordered another three pack just to ensure I&#x27;d be bristle free for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>As with other Van Der Hagen shave soaps, this one is so much better.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this is my official soap 5 starts :))</li>
            <li>I simply get my badger brush nice and wet with hot water, slop it around on the soap cake</li>
            <li>am using it with the Premium Black Pure Badger shaving brush by Wet shaving products , both are extremely great products ,&lt;br /&gt;wish</li>
            <li>Keep that in mind if you enjoy the green&#x27;s scent but want to super lather your soaps..  </li>
            <li>i just wish it was less gel-like and more soap-like, but i&#x27;m nitpicking.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a quality shaving soap that is not ridiculously priced and is unscented.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that this soap is clear, so no artificial coloring either.  </li>
            <li>This one was highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Col. Conk for a few years, but so far I like Van Der Hagen better.</li>
            <li>:  Partially fill your sink with hot water and set your mug in the hot water while you shower.  </li>
            <li>The first one I tried was the regular scented one that came with a bowl.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Last be not least - it&#x27;s very well priced.</li>
            <li>Old Spice mug (the one that says \\&quot;Shaving Mug\\&quot; on the side) which I got from an online auction.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that it came in a plastic container.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few different soaps and this is by far my favorite, lathers up well and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin prone to eczema, like me, this is the ticket.</li>
            <li>When Taylor of Old Bond Street stopped making my unscented shaving cream I thought I&#x27;d have to return to the land of the bearded.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m jolly sensitive.</li>
            <li>wish I could use scented soaps, but every time I try one I regret it and throw it away early.</li>
            <li>Unscented is the way to go if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It works very well with the sharper double edge blades.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the unscented gel that comes in a can from edge that I buy in my local supercenter</li>
            <li>I just like my natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lather develops quickly and is pretty thick.</li>
            <li>I used this to try to shave my legs in order to be a little more green, and really like it!  </li>
            <li>Also, put some hot water in another shaving mug (if you have two) with your brush upside down in the hot water (I don&#x27;t totally submerse my brush, because I think that might contribute to early loss of bristles).  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband as he uses the old fashioned single blade double edge razor &amp; he absolutely loves this soup!</li>
            <li>you get the benefits of the super lather as well as the scent of the green.  </li>
            <li>stuff doesn&#x27;t dry out of my face and lathers really easy with just a little bit of water.</li>
            <li>When you get out of your shower while you finish drying empty and refill the sink, put a little hot water in the mug (which you will dump before you begin lathering) and refresh the hot water your brush is soaking in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same cake for nearly a month now and it doesn&#x27;t even seem to have reduced in size.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s subtle and smells clean.</li>
            <li>first tried Van Der Hagen because they are affordable and one of the few brands that still make brush and mug shaving products that I could find in local stores.  </li>
            <li>But my other gotcha is that my skin is very sensitive.</li>

            <li> It really is first rate.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> and I get more than enough lather to cover my face</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I use it everyday, I will continue to use it as long as you carry it!</li>
            <li> But most products are scented and he had to smell the scent all day long.  </li>
            <li> I melt it into my wooden shaving bowl, using a microwave several short 10 second bursts until fully melted then allow to cool to re-harden perfectly into my bowl.</li>
            <li> Great lather, long lasting and makes skin very soft after.</li>
            <li> Both of those products do a great job, but at $20 for not that much product, they&#x27;re not good for the budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again, but it&#x27;ll be a while, as I think that these three cakes will hold up for a good long time.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> a little tip if you like your lather to be warm</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and lasts much longer than a can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I really like Van Der Hagen soaps.  </li>
            <li> I ordered another three pack just to ensure I&#x27;d be bristle free for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> As with other Van Der Hagen shave soaps, this one is so much better.  </li>
            <li> Other than that this is my official soap 5 starts :))</li>
            <li> I simply get my badger brush nice and wet with hot water, slop it around on the soap cake</li>
            <li> am using it with the Premium Black Pure Badger shaving brush by Wet shaving products , both are extremely great products ,&lt;br /&gt;wish</li>
            <li> Keep that in mind if you enjoy the green&#x27;s scent but want to super lather your soaps..  </li>
            <li> i just wish it was less gel-like and more soap-like, but i&#x27;m nitpicking.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a quality shaving soap that is not ridiculously priced and is unscented.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that this soap is clear, so no artificial coloring either.  </li>
            <li> This one was highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Col. Conk for a few years, but so far I like Van Der Hagen better.</li>
            <li> :  Partially fill your sink with hot water and set your mug in the hot water while you shower.  </li>
            <li> The first one I tried was the regular scented one that came with a bowl.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Last be not least - it&#x27;s very well priced.</li>
            <li> Old Spice mug (the one that says \\&quot;Shaving Mug\\&quot; on the side) which I got from an online auction.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that it came in a plastic container.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different soaps and this is by far my favorite, lathers up well and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin prone to eczema, like me, this is the ticket.</li>
            <li> When Taylor of Old Bond Street stopped making my unscented shaving cream I thought I&#x27;d have to return to the land of the bearded.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m jolly sensitive.</li>
            <li> wish I could use scented soaps, but every time I try one I regret it and throw it away early.</li>
            <li> Unscented is the way to go if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works very well with the sharper double edge blades.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the unscented gel that comes in a can from edge that I buy in my local supercenter</li>
            <li> I just like my natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather develops quickly and is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I used this to try to shave my legs in order to be a little more green, and really like it!  </li>
            <li> Also, put some hot water in another shaving mug (if you have two) with your brush upside down in the hot water (I don&#x27;t totally submerse my brush, because I think that might contribute to early loss of bristles).  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband as he uses the old fashioned single blade double edge razor &amp; he absolutely loves this soup!</li>
            <li> you get the benefits of the super lather as well as the scent of the green.  </li>
            <li> stuff doesn&#x27;t dry out of my face and lathers really easy with just a little bit of water.</li>
            <li> When you get out of your shower while you finish drying empty and refill the sink, put a little hot water in the mug (which you will dump before you begin lathering) and refresh the hot water your brush is soaking in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same cake for nearly a month now and it doesn&#x27;t even seem to have reduced in size.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s subtle and smells clean.</li>
            <li> first tried Van Der Hagen because they are affordable and one of the few brands that still make brush and mug shaving products that I could find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> But my other gotcha is that my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am still using my Gillette Pro glide and the blades should last a long time now.</li>
            <li> I normally &amp;#34;super lather&amp;#34; my soap with Proraso green.  </li>
            <li> but when I read the box I was surprised to see it is made in little ol Liberty Hill Texas where I lived some 37 years ago.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i&#x27;m allergic to that scented stuff they sent me with my straight razor that i&#x27;m just starting to learn how to use.</li>
            <li> It also has absolutely no scent whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other soaps that claim to be unscented because they have no perfume added but do have an scent from the ingredients used; this soap truly does not have a sent.</li>
            <li> While it lathers and is \\&quot;slicker than the standard glycerine soap, I am not sure that it performs twice as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their other soaps.</li>
            <li> I found myself without shaving soap at one house while having two at the other.  </li>
            <li> Using a Shick Quattro, my beard would dull those blades after only two shaves.</li>
            <li> Has all other commonly used shave creams and soaps beat by a long way.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with soap for a few years now and having tried a number of brands this soap is just what you would expect.</li>
            <li> The scented version would mask the green a bit..  </li>
            <li> My beard is VERY heavy.</li>
            <li> Shocked to see it was a clear soap though.</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating to have to purchase this product while having some at the other house.  </li>
            <li> This soap might be slippery, but it does a poor job at softening my thick beard growth.</li>
            <li> The lather rivals the $15-$30 creams (T&amp;H, TOBS, GFT) - seriously!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have the worst possible combination of beard and skin.</li>
            <li> I hate shave soaps with menthol and this has none.</li>
            <li> I hate perfume, and cologne.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cost effective and works just fine.</li>
            <li> My husband says it feels good, it smells good, and it gives a good shave.  I will certainly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a quality shaving soap that is not ridiculously priced and is unscented. This one comes pretty close. It takes a bit more whisking to get a rich foam from this puck than some other soaps I have used but, wI&#x27;ll produce a good shaving lather after a bit of work. The lather holds well throughout my shave. Unlike some other soaps that claim to be unscented because they have no perfume added but do have an scent from the ingredients used; this soap truly does not have a sent. The price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sumary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grear price. Truly no scent, good lather (with some work). Recommended.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. I&#x27;ve been using Col. Conk for a few years, but so far I like Van Der Hagen better. The lather develops quickly and is pretty thick. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to re-lather part way through. I got the scented soap and while I can&#x27;t describe what the scent is, it is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I ditched my electric and have been using Van Der Hagen shave soaps for many, many years. Consistently excellent shaves and extraordinarily long razor life. Has all other commonly used shave creams and soaps beat by a long way. A superior value.  To match or do better, you would have to move way up in price.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and lasts much longer than a can of shaving cream. It does have a slight scent but it&#x27;s subtle and smells clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Van Der Hagen is a widely available shaving soap brand.  The unscented luxury soap weighs one ounce more than the standard glycerine soap [[ASIN:B001A3DNXC Van Der Hagen Glycerin Shave Soap, 2.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)]] and is double the price.  While it lathers and is \\&quot;slicker than the standard glycerine soap, I am not sure that it performs twice as well.  I can only give it four stars at this time for that reason</li>
            <li> These soaps are awesome! The only thing i wish was that it didnt include sodium lauryl sulfate! It lathers great, has no fragrance and I think its an amazing soap.</li>
            <li> No need to buy the higher priced soaps.  These are excellent.</li>
            <li> I really like Van Der Hagen soaps.  The first one I tried was the regular scented one that came with a bowl.  I decided to try the unscented soap found here since I figure I don&#x27;t need the extra perfumes.  I was surprised to find that this soap is clear, so no artificial coloring either.  The soap is very slippery, which I think contributes to a good shave.  And it is a perfect fit for my late 50s to early 60s Old Spice mug (the one that says \\&quot;Shaving Mug\\&quot; on the side) which I got from an online auction.  (Shaving mugs used to come in all shapes and sizes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried Van Der Hagen because they are affordable and one of the few brands that still make brush and mug shaving products that I could find in local stores.  I will keep using their soaps, because they produce a great lather and feel good on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little tip if you like your lather to be warm:  Partially fill your sink with hot water and set your mug in the hot water while you shower.  Also, put some hot water in another shaving mug (if you have two) with your brush upside down in the hot water (I don&#x27;t totally submerse my brush, because I think that might contribute to early loss of bristles).  When you get out of your shower while you finish drying empty and refill the sink, put a little hot water in the mug (which you will dump before you begin lathering) and refresh the hot water your brush is soaking in. Finish drying and get ready for your best shave ever.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff. He won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Nice soap that lathers up easy and rinses away easily as well. Shocked to see it was a clear soap though.</li>
            <li> Works great, the lather forms pretty easily. Even though it&#x27;s unscented, it smells nice, so I guess &#x27;unscented&#x27; means that no scents are added for the sake of smell.</li>
            <li> great soap. makes a fine lather for shaving, pleasant scent which i could best describe as a nice clean neutral</li>
            <li> Shaving cream was the last liquid I had in my carry-on.  I bought this so to replace my shaving cream.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it came in a plastic container.  It also has absolutely no scent whatsoever.  I don&#x27;t bother with a brush, using a washcloth to lather it up.</li>
            <li> great lather and quick.</li>
            <li> Wow! Imagine that .. a shaving soap that doesn&#x27;t stink to high heaven!! .. And the glycerin in this seems to work. Unfortunately, I have the worst possible combination of beard and skin. My beard is VERY heavy. Using a Shick Quattro, my beard would dull those blades after only two shaves. And that the cost of those .. OUCH!! .. So, I switched to Feather blades in a safety razor. ... But my other gotcha is that my skin is very sensitive. BUMMER!! .. Fortunately, this soap does a good job of helping with both. The soap does a good job of lubricating my skin and the glycerin does a good job of keeping my face moist and helps soothe my skin. I still need more to make it better. Still, this soap does a great job and is a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> A very awesome  shave soap, does  not irritate my skin!  Lathers great!</li>
            <li> This is better than the smaller picked Van Der Hagen Deluxe soap. Richer lather, slicker shave surface. Easy to get it lathered up and the price is great for the amount of time it lasts. I&#x27;m still on my first puck after 3 months.</li>
            <li> Good smooth shave from a good soap. It left my skin feeling pleasant. I hate shave soaps with menthol and this has none. It lathers up well. I will order it again</li>
            <li> It lathers good with minimal water. Easy to use and lasts a long time. I would recommend this soap to others.</li>
            <li> Perfect choice for the skin allergies he has to perfumes.  He want&#x27;s to let everyone know that he love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I tried the scented version and liked it so much I purchased this to melt in with my Col Conk lime and bay rum soaps to give them a lather boost. Absolutely the BEST bang for the buck in shaving soaps. The lather rivals the $15-$30 creams (T&amp;H, TOBS, GFT) - seriously!</li>
            <li> I regularly purchase this item to use with my double edge razor. I have tried a few different soaps and this is by far my favorite, lathers up well and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Good lather, excellent price. Use with Feather blades and have not had a nick yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like any strong scented soaps but VAN DER HAGEN&amp;#34;S soap has NO SENT. If you want a soap with no sent this is an excellent one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i&#x27;m allergic to that scented stuff they sent me with my straight razor that i&#x27;m just starting to learn how to use. But this stuff entirely prevents that! i just wish it was less gel-like and more soap-like, but i&#x27;m nitpicking.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband as he uses the old fashioned single blade double edge razor &amp; he absolutely loves this soup! Great buy &amp; great price!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Van Der Hagen Luxury shaving soap and I will say I am 70 years old and have never ever had a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it with the Premium Black Pure Badger shaving brush by Wet shaving products , both are extremely great products ,&lt;br /&gt;wish I had found them years ago. I am still using my Gillette Pro glide and the blades should last a long time now.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and needed a good shave soap. This has a wonderful lather and doesn&#x27;t bother my nose. Sold!</li>
            <li> I have to be careful about using scented  products because of sensitive skin and allergies. This mug soap gives me a great lather and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I love the lather this creates! My shaving has been changed forever.</li>
            <li> The product was very good. It was exactly what I was looking for. I gave it as a gift and it was great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this aloong with the shave set to have spare soap on hand, glad I did as I like the soap. Plan to keep utilizing this soap along with the set I have.</li>
            <li> This soap, while unscented, still smells fresh, so it&#x27;s not like some unscented products that have a negative scent.  I used this to try to shave my legs in order to be a little more green, and really like it!  My husband has used it as well on his face and likes it, too!</li>
            <li> This is great shave soap. Great quality, smooth later and shave. Although the soap has an interesting sterile kind of smell to it, however that smell does not stay with you after the shave. Will continue to buy this soap.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this soap and it is great. No problems with skin. It, however, does not lather up like &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shave soap, but is acceptable. If you have sensitive skin prone to eczema, like me, this is the ticket.</li>
            <li> Our plumber informed us that gel type shaving products build up in the pipes.  My husband switched to brush and soap.  But most products are scented and he had to smell the scent all day long.  He loves my purchase</li>
            <li> When Taylor of Old Bond Street stopped making my unscented shaving cream I thought I&#x27;d have to return to the land of the bearded. Having searched the internet for an alternative (and believe me, there really aren&#x27;t that many) I stumbled across Van Der Hagen. What can I say? It really is first rate. Lathers really nicely and does it&#x27;s bit to give you a smooth shave. No scent that I can perceive and I&#x27;m jolly sensitive. Last be not least - it&#x27;s very well priced. As soon as I realised how good it was I ordered another three pack just to ensure I&#x27;d be bristle free for the foreseeable future. Oh, and I&#x27;m from the United Kingdom which goes to show that it&#x27;s still a great buy even when I include the shipping costs. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with soap for a few years now and having tried a number of brands this soap is just what you would expect. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a huge difference between brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could use scented soaps, but every time I try one I regret it and throw it away early. Unscented is the way to go if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used their other soaps. I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Williams&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve tried some &amp;#34;craft&amp;#34; soaps. At about $ 5.00 a puck I&#x27;d say this is a good choice for someone wanting to try a better soap without the worry of: &amp;#34;Will a lavender scent be too girly&amp;#34;?. It works very well with the sharper double edge blades.</li>
            <li> This soap might be slippery, but it does a poor job at softening my thick beard growth. I much prefer the unscented gel that comes in a can from edge that I buy in my local supercenter (gillette seems to have stopped making their unscented gel).</li>
            <li> When I bought it I assumed it was from Holland what with the Dutch windmill stamp and the name Van Der Hagen but when I read the box I was surprised to see it is made in little ol Liberty Hill Texas where I lived some 37 years ago. With that bias aside I was happy to find that it works really well. Lathers great and easy on the skin. It gets my recommendation.</li>
            <li> As with other Van Der Hagen shave soaps, this one is so much better.  I had to find a good, unscented shaving soap at the advice of the dermatologist.  This one was highly recommended.  It is an excellent choice for men who want to experience the luxury of a brush applied shaving soap.  It is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Lathers up well and provides a smooth shave. No scent at all and therefore no irritation. I&#x27;ll definitely reorder as this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this shave soap a try.  It works pretty well.  I would prefer it lather a bit better, but for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I bought a 3 pack.  Will probably try the scented version next time.</li>
            <li> this stuff is on par with all the high-end English creams and soaps and its only 4 bucks! I bought the VDH luxury kit but it came with the scented one so it messed up the smell of my after shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  the only downside of it is that it needs 20% glycerin for a better glide barrier and easy application for face lather people. Other than that this is my official soap 5 starts :))</li>
            <li> Works well, lathers and shaves nice, I prefer no added scent. I melt it into my wooden shaving bowl, using a microwave several short 10 second bursts until fully melted then allow to cool to re-harden perfectly into my bowl.</li>
            <li> The Van Der Hagen Unscented Shave Soap is a revelation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with a brush and a double edge razor for about six months now, but I&#x27;ve been using pricy shave creams like those from Rapha and The Art of Shaving. Both of those products do a great job, but at $20 for not that much product, they&#x27;re not good for the budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $15 for the three pack, the Van Der Hagen Unscented Shave Soap looks to be a great bargain. I&#x27;ve been using the same cake for nearly a month now and it doesn&#x27;t even seem to have reduced in size. I simply get my badger brush nice and wet with hot water, slop it around on the soap cake and I get more than enough lather to cover my face twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the scent is very mild (yes, though unscented it does have a very very slight smell) and pleasant. I know that my wife likes it more than the &#x27;in your face&#x27; scent of Rapha&#x27;s shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again, but it&#x27;ll be a while, as I think that these three cakes will hold up for a good long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a man who likes scents. I hate perfume, and cologne. I just like my natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff doesn&#x27;t dry out of my face and lathers really easy with just a little bit of water. No brainer.</li>
            <li> my father in law loves it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boss.  He loved the soap.</li>
            <li> Great lather, long lasting and makes skin very soft after.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I use it everyday, I will continue to use it as long as you carry it!</li>
            <li> I have two houses.  I found myself without shaving soap at one house while having two at the other.  It was very frustrating to have to purchase this product while having some at the other house.  HOWEVER.  I use only Van Der Hagen shaving soap.  I have for years.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells good. Lathers well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34; version of the luxury soap before.  This soap lathered up just as well.  I normally &amp;#34;super lather&amp;#34; my soap with Proraso green.  The scented version would mask the green a bit..  this version being unscented does not do this.. you get the benefits of the super lather as well as the scent of the green.  Keep that in mind if you enjoy the green&#x27;s scent but want to super lather your soaps..  this is a good option.</li>
