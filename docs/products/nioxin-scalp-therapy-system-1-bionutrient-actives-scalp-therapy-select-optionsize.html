            <li>Great product, good price</li>
            <li>seems to be good product</li>
            <li>good stuff been using it for years</li>
            <li>It did not work good on my type of hair.</li>
            <li>The good bottle has an all-black cap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully this helps people know the difference between the good and crappy stuff.  </li>
            <li>None of them works as good as this stuff.</li>
            <li>Since Procter &amp; Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as good as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Product was received in good condition.</li>
            <li>Works good for dermatitis of the scalp.</li>
            <li>So I have no idea how good this product is anymore.</li>
            <li>The price on this item was almost too good to believe.  </li>
            <li>It used to be good but no longer.</li>
            <li>Which is good, because as a 15 year user of Nioxin-1</li>
            <li>Its great even if you don&#x27;t have thinning hair, and I like the nice minty conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair never felt as good as when I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good conditioner with a tingling sensation from the peppermint oil.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the product you get at the salon at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple of months now and my hair is looking good.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nioxin for many months now and have been happy with the 3-part System 1.  </li>
            <li>cleans scalp good, nice smell.</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and find it is very effective in limiting hair loss.</li>
            <li>I just love it!  </li>
            <li>I am SO glad it is being carried here - now I don&#x27;t have to troll the internet or specialty stores looking for it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>A NICE FEEL</li>
            <li>This feels so nice on the scalp.</li>
            <li>My own fault -</li>
            <li>Good stuff and always very quickly delivered ....</li>
            <li>I bought my first version of this at the salon where I get my hair cut - it worked great.</li>
            <li>It is too soon to tell if my hair will become \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; but the thing I noticed after the first shampoo and condition is that my hair, which is always full of static (no matter what the humidity) didn&#x27;t stand on end with static when I combed it!!!</li>
            <li>I have difficulty finding a good conditioner that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down; this conditioner is great!</li>
            <li>I love this product and plan on ordering it again.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>There are a lot of products out there claiming to help, but take it from me, this stuff does what it says, it creates a healthy scalp environment for hair to grow and leaves you hair feeling thicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s inferior, I&#x27;ve continued buying it because I wasn&#x27;t sure what else to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many types of shampoo and remedies.</li>
            <li>which would increase the static in my hair even more!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>is much more healthy....</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>but i do love the refreshing scent that it has.</li>
            <li>Love Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li>Using this product more than a month with cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have used nioxin for many years.</li>
            <li>Not a problem because the quality was even better.</li>
            <li>my favorite conditioner&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Mind-blowingly refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 3 years, and my hair looks better than when I was in my 20s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nioxin System one for many years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Scalp Therapy for the better part of 10 years.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THE TINGLY FEELING, LIKE</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been a return customer of Nioxin products for many yerars.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>works great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>After all, my hair was thinning and sticking a ton of conditioner on it didn&#x27;t seem like it would give it more volume and body.</li>
            <li>Anybody able to help?</li>
            <li>I get many compliments about my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the nioxin system.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using nioxin products for many years</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very fine hair that never had any sort of volume to it and now after using the shampoo and conditioner, I can tell and I also get complaiments on how healthy and full my hair</li>
            <li>My hair was weaker and easily broke.</li>
            <li>Refreshing sensation that is clean rinsing and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily.</li>
            <li>I love the minty smell and the cool feeling it leaves on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>yet I have to use 2-3 times the amount of the original to be able to condition my hair like the original did.</li>
            <li>Have not seen a huge difference, but I can say it does help.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel silky and smooth</li>
            <li>The cheap stuff has a label that you can peel off; nothing is on the bottle itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is thinning, this product is sure worth a try.</li>
            <li>great product at a terrific price.</li>
            <li>Great compliment to the entire Nioxin System.  </li>
            <li>The product changed but so far so good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a stimulating, refreshing product that cleanses  the scalp and simply makes your head feel good.</li>
            <li>if only so my hair doesn&#x27;t look like I stuck my finger in a light socket every time I comb my hair!!!</li>
            <li>Shipment was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Works great  as long as they send you the correct  bottle.</li>
            <li>Love Nioxin, System 1!  Not only for how my hair looks and feels, but love the minty fragrance after using.</li>
            <li>Product was originally recommended by my hair stylist as good for daily use without causing loss of hair.  </li>
            <li>Do not expect to use this and within three months you will have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>It really works and scalp feels very clean, not oily.</li>
            <li>The savings is tremendous verses purchasing in a hair saloon or store.  </li>
            <li>They sent it quickly.  </li>
            <li>BUT GETS OUT OF HAND QUICKLY</li>
            <li>(although product only addresses appearance not actual growth)  It is best used with shampoo and spray in treatment.  </li>
            <li>We are loyal purchasers of this brand.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I have found for my very short grey hair.</li>
            <li>it is more expensive then i am used to paying for shampoo but the price at amazon is very good.</li>
            <li>Thsi conditioner makes you scalp tingle and feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, this means that the company that makes Nioxin heard consumer complaints and has decided to spend the money necessary to make a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both bottles next to me and will now describe how you can tell the difference between the good stuff and the crappy stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The better stuff has it&#x27;s labeling information printed directly on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>but it is well worth</li>
            <li>will tell you that you do have to use it for about 8 months before you start seeing any difference, but like I said, well worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely have to use dandruff shampoo anymore.</li>
            <li>A bit too minty but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m team natural and love this product.</li>
            <li>my most recent order, I received the original Nioxin that is made in the US, and which deserves 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to put this stuff on the crowd of my hair and right on the roots.  </li>
            <li>In general, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the Nioxin products, which have cleaned up my scalp and given me a healthier environment for my hair, which is prone to breakage, and looked like it was thinning because of it.  </li>
            <li>Great price and would recommend this product to anyone with fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>Product was shipped right away and is exactly what I&#x27;ve been using and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li>POISON CONTROL SAID IT IS NOT TOXIC JUST TO DRY OFF WITH A WARM TOWEL AND WAIT FOR SYMPTOMS TO WEAR OFF</li>
            <li>so far so  good, think i&#x27;m starting to see results.</li>
            <li>So, I went back to my good old number 1.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have as much of the powerful classic Nioxin \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; as the original.</li>
            <li>It came very fast</li>
            <li>and it really works - and smells of mint!  </li>
            <li>A couple of years ago, Nioxin switched production to Mexico, making a watered-down, inferior product but selling it for the same price (as many reviews here note).  </li>
            <li>but the entire top is white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works really well to calm my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I love this product it works well for my hair, i wont go back to using anything else.</li>
            <li>It really does what is says, thickens thinning hair!</li>
            <li>Exactly what was posted</li>
            <li>IT IS AT FIRST</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>always make sure I have extra bottles</li>
            <li>Now imagine that sensation all over your scalp both in the hot shower and out.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li>(Cancer patients can keep from losing their hair through &amp;#34;cold cap therapy.&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t feel too confident that this system actually regrows hair.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the big bottles in the 2 pack size (with the cleanser), but I do not use them equally, so it is good  to be able to buy them separately as needed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me - getting older and your hair is thinning and/or receding - this is something worth investing in.</li>
            <li>My roommates think I&#x27;m some kind of super vain weirdo after seeing me open an Amazon package and pulling out an enormous bottle of conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it actually will regrow any hair back, but it seems to stimulated blood flow in the scalp and is probably good for maintaining it.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks it became very evident that the conditioner, which smells FABULOUS, and gives your scalp a lovely tingly feeling, just wasn&#x27;t up to the level of dry I get, especially when I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot during the summer.  </li>
            <li>Nioxin is a great product that I have using for several years now, due to my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Have used for a long time and have always been pleased</li>
            <li>If you have dry hair, and can afford it, perhaps give the more intensive conditioners in the product line a try.  </li>
            <li>(and I mean EVERY) salon and supermarket brand of shampoo/conditioner just to get the static out of my hair, and this is the only product that has performed, without making my very fine hair look greasy!</li>
            <li>a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little more money than I would normally spend on shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I ended up going out and buying another bottle somewhere else to compare and the second bottle worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I am fairly certain that the Mexican made stuff is not as effective and clearly a different mixture/formula.</li>
            <li>I intend on buying from this seller again, as they provide so much value.</li>
            <li>The thinning was getting very noticeable.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Loosing so much hair with conditioner.</li>
            <li>This did not look or perform like the real Nioxin conditioner..</li>
            <li>This really causes hair loss.</li>
            <li>It does help with itching scalp, but doesn&#x27;t really add any volume to hair.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>IT IS REALLY</li>
            <li>I USE THE WHOLE THREE STEP SYSTEM -</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I bought the whole system (cleanser, conditioner and scalp treatment).  </li>
            <li>Alopecia is real, just accept it or do bosely.</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t say to regrow hair but to thicken the hair so much that you think it is improving.</li>
            <li>It really makes me wonder if this one is watered-down or a knock off version.</li>
            <li>:) ...but I&#x27;m not willing to change my regimen.</li>
            <li>this is a faboulous conditioner, i am allergic to others, my head is is itchy when i use any other hair conditioners, i also love their shampo</li>
            <li>Top quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used,</li>
            <li>The latest bottle I received from the seller was one of the &amp;#34;made in Mexico&amp;#34; bottles with the sticker labels and the black cap with white top, instead of the words printed directly on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Have used Nioxin for many years, but this bottle seemed not right, both color and consistency, which is unusual for Nioxin.</li>
            <li>HOLY COW, what a huge difference!</li>
            <li>But if the next bottle I buy was made in Mexico and has the watered down formula, I&#x27;d appreciate any recommendations for good competitor products.roduct.  </li>
            <li>But if the next bottle I buy was made in Mexico and has the watered down formula, I&#x27;d appreciate any recommendations for good competitor products.</li>
            <li>It is a watered down, crappy conditioner that makes my hair fall out more.</li>
            <li>My hair was short short for many years but after using Nioxin for over a year it&#x27;s seems to be thicker.  </li>
            <li>It is not the thick, green, wonderful stuff that works.</li>
            <li>They have changed their products and lost a loyal customer of over ten years.</li>
            <li>Instead of leaving my hair soft and free of any buildup, it now has a waxy buildup and my hair falls flat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little concerned that this product isn&#x27;t authentic.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for someone who has normal hair, or hair that falls closer to the oily side of the spectrum.  </li>
            <li>But after using Nioxin 1 for a few years, I am able to see a drastic decrease in my hair.</li>
            <li>The product, along with the shampoo, severely dried out my hair and caused more to fall out.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to find a new conditioner.</li>
            <li>It took awhile, but gradually I began to get new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>It might cost higher than your average shampoo/conditioner, but the results are WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li>The first 5 ingredients on the American bottle are: \\&quot;Aqua/Eau/Water, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Dicetydimonium Chloride, and Cetyl Alcohol.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first 5 ingredients on the Mexican version are: \\&quot;Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Quaternium-18, and Stearyl Alcohol.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this (supposedly) exact same product</li>
            <li>Nioxin offers more deep-conditioning treatments than this daily one, but cost can be prohibitive, especially since those products come in smaller sizes.  </li>
            <li>So if you have a sensitive scalp, you might want to try it out at your hair salon first before buy the big bottle for $$$.</li>
            <li>it was evident that my hair was not in better shape, I was in fact worse off than I was before.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that when another company takes over, they too often change everything completely.</li>
            <li>(I received the made in USA item) same formula and feeling as you get from your salon at much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>you for contacting Procter and Gamble Professional Care Exclusive Lines.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is not an authorized retailer of our product.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks old and prints on bottle are faded and not readable.</li>
            <li>It makes me suspecious that the contioner liquid was refilled into an old bottle.</li>
            <li>Works well and makes my old hair grow and shine.</li>
            <li>system was developed for cancer patients that that are getting chemo and radiation so it treats the scalp and thickens the hair.</li>
            <li>When I tried to take it off,  prints from both sides of the bottle completely peeled off.</li>
            <li>definitely think that it works really well.</li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; when left in your hair for a few mins.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good - just expensive.  </li>
            <li>Today when I went to get my hair cut, I opened the top of a bottle of the Nioxin conditioner they were selling to see if it was thick</li>
            <li>After using this for several weeks, I&#x27;ve been losing more hair than usual.</li>
            <li>My last purchase &#x27;elsewhere&#x27; of the same item cost four times as much per ounce!</li>
            <li>My hair is curly, and tends to be dry, so I use a little more conditioner than is generally instructed.  </li>
            <li>all of the sudden my scalps so itchy and red and hair not growing as fast.</li>
            <li>This is a giant bottle though, I really need to read the product descriptions a lot closer in the future.</li>
            <li>After major surgery I lost a lot of my hair.</li>
            <li>have 3 older brothers with male pattern baldness in different stages</li>
            <li>but I definitely preferred the old formulation.</li>
            <li>but I picked wrong kind of conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap, but in my book it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more thin and has a stronger smell.  </li>
            <li>The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than just sit there.  </li>
            <li>My wide part looked normal again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It claims to work on fine hair...or starting to thin hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product, good price</li>
            <li> seems to be good product</li>
            <li> good stuff been using it for years</li>
            <li> It did not work good on my type of hair.</li>
            <li> The good bottle has an all-black cap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully this helps people know the difference between the good and crappy stuff.  </li>
            <li> None of them works as good as this stuff.</li>
            <li> Since Procter &amp; Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as good as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Product was received in good condition.</li>
            <li> Works good for dermatitis of the scalp.</li>
            <li> So I have no idea how good this product is anymore.</li>
            <li> The price on this item was almost too good to believe.  </li>
            <li> It used to be good but no longer.</li>
            <li> Which is good, because as a 15 year user of Nioxin-1</li>
            <li> Its great even if you don&#x27;t have thinning hair, and I like the nice minty conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair never felt as good as when I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good conditioner with a tingling sensation from the peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the product you get at the salon at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple of months now and my hair is looking good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for many months now and have been happy with the 3-part System 1.  </li>
            <li> cleans scalp good, nice smell.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and find it is very effective in limiting hair loss.</li>
            <li> I just love it!  </li>
            <li> I am SO glad it is being carried here - now I don&#x27;t have to troll the internet or specialty stores looking for it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> A NICE FEEL</li>
            <li> This feels so nice on the scalp.</li>
            <li> My own fault -</li>
            <li> Good stuff and always very quickly delivered ....</li>
            <li> I bought my first version of this at the salon where I get my hair cut - it worked great.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell if my hair will become \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; but the thing I noticed after the first shampoo and condition is that my hair, which is always full of static (no matter what the humidity) didn&#x27;t stand on end with static when I combed it!!!</li>
            <li> I have difficulty finding a good conditioner that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down; this conditioner is great!</li>
            <li> I love this product and plan on ordering it again.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> There are a lot of products out there claiming to help, but take it from me, this stuff does what it says, it creates a healthy scalp environment for hair to grow and leaves you hair feeling thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s inferior, I&#x27;ve continued buying it because I wasn&#x27;t sure what else to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many types of shampoo and remedies.</li>
            <li> which would increase the static in my hair even more!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> is much more healthy....</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> but i do love the refreshing scent that it has.</li>
            <li> Love Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li> Using this product more than a month with cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have used nioxin for many years.</li>
            <li> Not a problem because the quality was even better.</li>
            <li> my favorite conditioner&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mind-blowingly refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 years, and my hair looks better than when I was in my 20s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin System one for many years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Scalp Therapy for the better part of 10 years.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THE TINGLY FEELING, LIKE</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been a return customer of Nioxin products for many yerars.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> works great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> After all, my hair was thinning and sticking a ton of conditioner on it didn&#x27;t seem like it would give it more volume and body.</li>
            <li> Anybody able to help?</li>
            <li> I get many compliments about my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the nioxin system.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using nioxin products for many years</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very fine hair that never had any sort of volume to it and now after using the shampoo and conditioner, I can tell and I also get complaiments on how healthy and full my hair</li>
            <li> My hair was weaker and easily broke.</li>
            <li> Refreshing sensation that is clean rinsing and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily.</li>
            <li> I love the minty smell and the cool feeling it leaves on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> yet I have to use 2-3 times the amount of the original to be able to condition my hair like the original did.</li>
            <li> Have not seen a huge difference, but I can say it does help.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel silky and smooth</li>
            <li> The cheap stuff has a label that you can peel off; nothing is on the bottle itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is thinning, this product is sure worth a try.</li>
            <li> great product at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> Great compliment to the entire Nioxin System.  </li>
            <li> The product changed but so far so good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stimulating, refreshing product that cleanses  the scalp and simply makes your head feel good.</li>
            <li> if only so my hair doesn&#x27;t look like I stuck my finger in a light socket every time I comb my hair!!!</li>
            <li> Shipment was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Works great  as long as they send you the correct  bottle.</li>
            <li> Love Nioxin, System 1!  Not only for how my hair looks and feels, but love the minty fragrance after using.</li>
            <li> Product was originally recommended by my hair stylist as good for daily use without causing loss of hair.  </li>
            <li> Do not expect to use this and within three months you will have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> It really works and scalp feels very clean, not oily.</li>
            <li> The savings is tremendous verses purchasing in a hair saloon or store.  </li>
            <li> They sent it quickly.  </li>
            <li> BUT GETS OUT OF HAND QUICKLY</li>
            <li> (although product only addresses appearance not actual growth)  It is best used with shampoo and spray in treatment.  </li>
            <li> We are loyal purchasers of this brand.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have found for my very short grey hair.</li>
            <li> it is more expensive then i am used to paying for shampoo but the price at amazon is very good.</li>
            <li> Thsi conditioner makes you scalp tingle and feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, this means that the company that makes Nioxin heard consumer complaints and has decided to spend the money necessary to make a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both bottles next to me and will now describe how you can tell the difference between the good stuff and the crappy stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The better stuff has it&#x27;s labeling information printed directly on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but it is well worth</li>
            <li> will tell you that you do have to use it for about 8 months before you start seeing any difference, but like I said, well worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely have to use dandruff shampoo anymore.</li>
            <li> A bit too minty but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m team natural and love this product.</li>
            <li> my most recent order, I received the original Nioxin that is made in the US, and which deserves 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to put this stuff on the crowd of my hair and right on the roots.  </li>
            <li> In general, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the Nioxin products, which have cleaned up my scalp and given me a healthier environment for my hair, which is prone to breakage, and looked like it was thinning because of it.  </li>
            <li> Great price and would recommend this product to anyone with fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped right away and is exactly what I&#x27;ve been using and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li> POISON CONTROL SAID IT IS NOT TOXIC JUST TO DRY OFF WITH A WARM TOWEL AND WAIT FOR SYMPTOMS TO WEAR OFF</li>
            <li> so far so  good, think i&#x27;m starting to see results.</li>
            <li> So, I went back to my good old number 1.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t have as much of the powerful classic Nioxin \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; as the original.</li>
            <li> It came very fast</li>
            <li> and it really works - and smells of mint!  </li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, Nioxin switched production to Mexico, making a watered-down, inferior product but selling it for the same price (as many reviews here note).  </li>
            <li> but the entire top is white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works really well to calm my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works well for my hair, i wont go back to using anything else.</li>
            <li> It really does what is says, thickens thinning hair!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was posted</li>
            <li> IT IS AT FIRST</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> always make sure I have extra bottles</li>
            <li> Now imagine that sensation all over your scalp both in the hot shower and out.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> (Cancer patients can keep from losing their hair through &amp;#34;cold cap therapy.&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t feel too confident that this system actually regrows hair.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the big bottles in the 2 pack size (with the cleanser), but I do not use them equally, so it is good  to be able to buy them separately as needed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me - getting older and your hair is thinning and/or receding - this is something worth investing in.</li>
            <li> My roommates think I&#x27;m some kind of super vain weirdo after seeing me open an Amazon package and pulling out an enormous bottle of conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it actually will regrow any hair back, but it seems to stimulated blood flow in the scalp and is probably good for maintaining it.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks it became very evident that the conditioner, which smells FABULOUS, and gives your scalp a lovely tingly feeling, just wasn&#x27;t up to the level of dry I get, especially when I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot during the summer.  </li>
            <li> Nioxin is a great product that I have using for several years now, due to my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Have used for a long time and have always been pleased</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, and can afford it, perhaps give the more intensive conditioners in the product line a try.  </li>
            <li> (and I mean EVERY) salon and supermarket brand of shampoo/conditioner just to get the static out of my hair, and this is the only product that has performed, without making my very fine hair look greasy!</li>
            <li> a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little more money than I would normally spend on shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I ended up going out and buying another bottle somewhere else to compare and the second bottle worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I am fairly certain that the Mexican made stuff is not as effective and clearly a different mixture/formula.</li>
            <li> I intend on buying from this seller again, as they provide so much value.</li>
            <li> The thinning was getting very noticeable.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Loosing so much hair with conditioner.</li>
            <li> This did not look or perform like the real Nioxin conditioner..</li>
            <li> This really causes hair loss.</li>
            <li> It does help with itching scalp, but doesn&#x27;t really add any volume to hair.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> IT IS REALLY</li>
            <li> I USE THE WHOLE THREE STEP SYSTEM -</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I bought the whole system (cleanser, conditioner and scalp treatment).  </li>
            <li> Alopecia is real, just accept it or do bosely.</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t say to regrow hair but to thicken the hair so much that you think it is improving.</li>
            <li> It really makes me wonder if this one is watered-down or a knock off version.</li>
            <li> :) ...but I&#x27;m not willing to change my regimen.</li>
            <li> this is a faboulous conditioner, i am allergic to others, my head is is itchy when i use any other hair conditioners, i also love their shampo</li>
            <li> Top quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used,</li>
            <li> The latest bottle I received from the seller was one of the &amp;#34;made in Mexico&amp;#34; bottles with the sticker labels and the black cap with white top, instead of the words printed directly on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Have used Nioxin for many years, but this bottle seemed not right, both color and consistency, which is unusual for Nioxin.</li>
            <li> HOLY COW, what a huge difference!</li>
            <li> But if the next bottle I buy was made in Mexico and has the watered down formula, I&#x27;d appreciate any recommendations for good competitor products.roduct.  </li>
            <li> But if the next bottle I buy was made in Mexico and has the watered down formula, I&#x27;d appreciate any recommendations for good competitor products.</li>
            <li> It is a watered down, crappy conditioner that makes my hair fall out more.</li>
            <li> My hair was short short for many years but after using Nioxin for over a year it&#x27;s seems to be thicker.  </li>
            <li> It is not the thick, green, wonderful stuff that works.</li>
            <li> They have changed their products and lost a loyal customer of over ten years.</li>
            <li> Instead of leaving my hair soft and free of any buildup, it now has a waxy buildup and my hair falls flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned that this product isn&#x27;t authentic.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for someone who has normal hair, or hair that falls closer to the oily side of the spectrum.  </li>
            <li> But after using Nioxin 1 for a few years, I am able to see a drastic decrease in my hair.</li>
            <li> The product, along with the shampoo, severely dried out my hair and caused more to fall out.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to find a new conditioner.</li>
            <li> It took awhile, but gradually I began to get new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> It might cost higher than your average shampoo/conditioner, but the results are WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> The first 5 ingredients on the American bottle are: \\&quot;Aqua/Eau/Water, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Dicetydimonium Chloride, and Cetyl Alcohol.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first 5 ingredients on the Mexican version are: \\&quot;Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Quaternium-18, and Stearyl Alcohol.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this (supposedly) exact same product</li>
            <li> Nioxin offers more deep-conditioning treatments than this daily one, but cost can be prohibitive, especially since those products come in smaller sizes.  </li>
            <li> So if you have a sensitive scalp, you might want to try it out at your hair salon first before buy the big bottle for $$$.</li>
            <li> it was evident that my hair was not in better shape, I was in fact worse off than I was before.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that when another company takes over, they too often change everything completely.</li>
            <li> (I received the made in USA item) same formula and feeling as you get from your salon at much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> you for contacting Procter and Gamble Professional Care Exclusive Lines.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is not an authorized retailer of our product.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks old and prints on bottle are faded and not readable.</li>
            <li> It makes me suspecious that the contioner liquid was refilled into an old bottle.</li>
            <li> Works well and makes my old hair grow and shine.</li>
            <li> system was developed for cancer patients that that are getting chemo and radiation so it treats the scalp and thickens the hair.</li>
            <li> When I tried to take it off,  prints from both sides of the bottle completely peeled off.</li>
            <li> definitely think that it works really well.</li>
            <li> Love the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; when left in your hair for a few mins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good - just expensive.  </li>
            <li> Today when I went to get my hair cut, I opened the top of a bottle of the Nioxin conditioner they were selling to see if it was thick</li>
            <li> After using this for several weeks, I&#x27;ve been losing more hair than usual.</li>
            <li> My last purchase &#x27;elsewhere&#x27; of the same item cost four times as much per ounce!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, and tends to be dry, so I use a little more conditioner than is generally instructed.  </li>
            <li> all of the sudden my scalps so itchy and red and hair not growing as fast.</li>
            <li> This is a giant bottle though, I really need to read the product descriptions a lot closer in the future.</li>
            <li> After major surgery I lost a lot of my hair.</li>
            <li> have 3 older brothers with male pattern baldness in different stages</li>
            <li> but I definitely preferred the old formulation.</li>
            <li> but I picked wrong kind of conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap, but in my book it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more thin and has a stronger smell.  </li>
            <li> The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than just sit there.  </li>
            <li> My wide part looked normal again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It claims to work on fine hair...or starting to thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought a bottle of Nioxin shampoo at a local beauty supply store and noticed that it was thicker than anything I&#x27;ve been getting through Amazon for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I mean it really burn, I can barely stand for 2 minutes of it before rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still planning on seeing a dermatologist and getting a full work up to see if something is behind this change in my hair beyond just the aging process.</li>
            <li> The high quality is still the same, if not better.</li>
            <li> So this size bottle lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using the Nioxin cleanser with a more moisturizing (and less expensive) conditioner.</li>
            <li> The Mexican version&#x27;s cap is black on the outside</li>
            <li> Overall, I would choose this shampoo over any other brand at this time.</li>
            <li> I am unsure whether or not I actually received Nioxin or if the seller has repackaged some other product in a Nioxin bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have oily hair at the roots and dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> I have dry itchy scalp and dry processed hair.  </li>
            <li> Husband has dry scalp</li>
            <li> Apparently, they closed down the U.S. manufacturing plant and started producing Nioxin in Mexico.  </li>
            <li> AT THE SAME TIME NOT WORTH THE MONEY IN MY OPINION</li>
            <li> Although not a complete cure for hair loss, this product really does seem to slow down the appearance of thinning hair.</li>
            <li> So if you want to loose hair, buy Nioxin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are different (proving the recent negative reviews are onto something).  </li>
            <li> I tried all the dandruff shampoos in my late teens and early twenties to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I am not much for writing</li>
            <li> it left my hair limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> so I purchased this item and have been using for last few years.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this Conditioner, I expected to receive the same product that I had gotten in the past.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> We do not sell to online retailers, and therefore cannot verify authenticity of these products and do not stand behind them.&lt;br /&gt;There were changes made to the product and packaging in mid 2011, so it may be that the product you purchased online is older or past its shelf life.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I usually use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for the past month and my hair is definatly thicker andmy scalp</li>
            <li> I have nothing other than this product to attribute that to.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not the same Nioxin I&#x27;d bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> After using it (cleanser &amp; scalp therapy) for 5 times, I can wear dark clothing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I am always skeptical about getting the real product.</li>
            <li> works, cuts down on the dandruff.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has basically slowed that hairline down and leaves my hair feeling thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li> I have used the Nioxin system for 4 years and my hair is down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year and a half now</li>
            <li> Have been using this along with the Scalp treatment for years and have noticed significantly less hair loss.  </li>
            <li> While the contents seem like Nioxin, the bottle has a sticker on the front, rather than a screened/painted label like previous bottles.</li>
            <li> it was I always had a layer of dandruff and could never wear anything black...</li>
            <li> My previous products were made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This product has an odd VICKS VAPO RUB smell.  </li>
            <li> Previously I had a lot of trouble growing my hair but was introduced to this system by my daughter</li>
            <li> was green.</li>
            <li> I like Nioxin products when they aren&#x27;t the thin, watered-down versions that I&#x27;ve been getting recently when ordering through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> A few days of not using this while on vacation and</li>
            <li> will see another few months and stop if not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer because using Nioxin has helped me to maintain and slow down any receding hairline that has occurred.</li>
            <li> I can tell you it does seem to slow down hair loss, but I see no signs of \\&quot;regrowth\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and this product has helped my hair to grow thicker and slow down the balding process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry scalp and thin looking hair.  </li>
            <li> The only reason we don&#x27;t is if we fail to place the order and don&#x27;t have time to wait.</li>
            <li> no more itch or dryness.</li>
            <li> i am not sure if it is making any difference in the thickness</li>
            <li> Thankfully, Amazon&#x27;s customer service was responsive as usual.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the number 4 and thought that formula was useless.</li>
            <li> I have a very dried scalp, although it doesn&#x27;t itch</li>
            <li> Hard to find a conditioner that won&#x27;t over do the oily part.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to sleep and work smelling of mint</li>
            <li> If you are a man or woman who is prone to hair falling out at washing, this product will reduce hair loss rate by at least 50%.  </li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what my  wife says.  </li>
            <li> Product sucks now</li>
            <li> Nioxin at least helps me keep the hair I have.</li>
            <li> and my hair is as thick as ever.</li>
            <li> I think it is a little expensive</li>
            <li> My serious case of bloody, itchy, flaky, &amp;#34;snowy&amp;#34; psoriasis was only remedied by this product.  </li>
            <li> WOULD RECOMMEND, ALTHOUGH MY HAIR IS STILL THIN</li>
            <li> I threw out Nioxin because the new formula that is made in Mexico is horrible and all it does is cause your hair to fall out.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong item.  </li>
            <li> feel like I got something fake.</li>
            <li> IT IS SO COLD LIKE ICE</li>
            <li> Something is very wrong.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad (it smells minty)</li>
            <li> I will now have to look for another product to use instead:(</li>
            <li> I hate Nioxin now and will NEVER buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used to have the worst dandruff, and my stylist recommended Nioxin, (system 1) shampoo/cleanser and conditioner/scalp therapy.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all, the bottle came half-empty/half-full.</li>
            <li> Goodbye forever you horrible company.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I usually use.  I have been buying it for years and it really works - and smells of mint!  I just love it!  I am SO glad it is being carried here - now I don&#x27;t have to troll the internet or specialty stores looking for it!</li>
            <li> seems to be good product</li>
            <li> good stuff been using it for years</li>
            <li> It came very fast but I picked wrong kind of conditioner. It did not work good on my type of hair. Live and learn. Not sellers problem.</li>
            <li> Thsi conditioner makes you scalp tingle and feel fresh.  I don&#x27;t think it actually will regrow any hair back, but it seems to stimulated blood flow in the scalp and is probably good for maintaining it.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  Have seen some changes in my hair and also can feel that it is cleaning my hair.  Like when you use face wash on your face but on your head!!!!</li>
            <li> been using the shampoo and conditioner for years on recommendation from a friend. I don&#x27;t know if its genetics or the product that contribute to my flowing mane :) ...but I&#x27;m not willing to change my regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer because using Nioxin has helped me to maintain and slow down any receding hairline that has occurred.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered and was the same as promised.  I intend on buying from this seller again, as they provide so much value.</li>
            <li> I like the thickness, smell, and size.  I think it is a little expensive and I don&#x27;t know if it actually thickens hair or anything, but it definately helps with my oily scalp/dry hair dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have difficulty finding a good conditioner that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down; this conditioner is great! It makes my hair feel silky and smooth and I can use it over and over without having to do a lemon treatment to lift off residue.</li>
            <li> I love this product and plan on ordering it again.  :)</li>
            <li> The savings is tremendous verses purchasing in a hair saloon or store.  95% of the time we order from Amazon.  The only reason we don&#x27;t is if we fail to place the order and don&#x27;t have time to wait.</li>
            <li> works, cuts down on the dandruff.</li>
            <li> If you are a man or woman who is prone to hair falling out at washing, this product will reduce hair loss rate by at least 50%.  No kidding.  You&#x27;ll start to see a difference in a week.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo when I was 21 and noticed a receding hairline. This shampoo has basically slowed that hairline down and leaves my hair feeling thicker and healthier. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider buying anything else. There are a lot of products out there claiming to help, but take it from me, this stuff does what it says, it creates a healthy scalp environment for hair to grow and leaves you hair feeling thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  A couple of years ago, Nioxin switched production to Mexico, making a watered-down, inferior product but selling it for the same price (as many reviews here note).  Even though it&#x27;s inferior, I&#x27;ve continued buying it because I wasn&#x27;t sure what else to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my most recent order, I received the original Nioxin that is made in the US, and which deserves 5 stars.  Hopefully, this means that the company that makes Nioxin heard consumer complaints and has decided to spend the money necessary to make a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both bottles next to me and will now describe how you can tell the difference between the good stuff and the crappy stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The good bottle has an all-black cap.  The Mexican version&#x27;s cap is black on the outside but the entire top is white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. At the back of the bottle, all the way on the bottom, the American bottle says \\&quot;Made in U.S.A.\\&quot;  The Mexican bottle says \\&quot;Made in Mexico.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The ingredients are different (proving the recent negative reviews are onto something).  The first 5 ingredients on the American bottle are: \\&quot;Aqua/Eau/Water, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Dicetydimonium Chloride, and Cetyl Alcohol.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 5 ingredients on the Mexican version are: \\&quot;Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Quaternium-18, and Stearyl Alcohol.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, when the maker of Nioxin acknowledges that they moved production to Mexico but have kept the same formula, don&#x27;t believe them.  This is clearly a different - and presumably cheaper - formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The better stuff has it&#x27;s labeling information printed directly on the bottle.  The cheap stuff has a label that you can peel off; nothing is on the bottle itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this helps people know the difference between the good and crappy stuff.  If Nioxin has indeed gone back to making their bottles in the U.S., I&#x27;ll continue to buy their product.  But if the next bottle I buy was made in Mexico and has the watered down formula, I&#x27;d appreciate any recommendations for good competitor products.roduct.  But if the next bottle I buy was made in Mexico and has the watered down formula, I&#x27;d appreciate any recommendations for good competitor products.</li>
            <li> I bought the big bottle when, two days after picking up a Nioxin starter kit, I realized that the tiny starter bottle wasn&#x27;t going to last me a week.  My hair is curly, and tends to be dry, so I use a little more conditioner than is generally instructed.  After a couple of weeks it became very evident that the conditioner, which smells FABULOUS, and gives your scalp a lovely tingly feeling, just wasn&#x27;t up to the level of dry I get, especially when I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot during the summer.  Even upping the amount of conditioner I apply doesn&#x27;t help.  Nioxin offers more deep-conditioning treatments than this daily one, but cost can be prohibitive, especially since those products come in smaller sizes.  I recommend this product for someone who has normal hair, or hair that falls closer to the oily side of the spectrum.  In general, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the Nioxin products, which have cleaned up my scalp and given me a healthier environment for my hair, which is prone to breakage, and looked like it was thinning because of it.  If you have dry hair, and can afford it, perhaps give the more intensive conditioners in the product line a try.  I&#x27;m going to continue using the Nioxin cleanser with a more moisturizing (and less expensive) conditioner.</li>
            <li> works really well to calm my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have a very dried scalp, although it doesn&#x27;t itch but it produces a lot of dandruff. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many types of shampoo and remedies. None of them works as good as this stuff. After using it (cleanser &amp; scalp therapy) for 5 times, I can wear dark clothing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main ingredient is cetyl alcohol, you can definitely feel it burns the scalp. I mean it really burn, I can barely stand for 2 minutes of it before rinse it off. So if you have a sensitive scalp, you might want to try it out at your hair salon first before buy the big bottle for $$$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin products for years and can say that it does make a difference. I no longer see hair all over the tub when I&#x27;m showering. I don&#x27;t have hair in my comb or brush either. If you&#x27;re like me - getting older and your hair is thinning and/or receding - this is something worth investing in.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year and a half now and I can see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little more money than I would normally spend on shampoo and conditioner but it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very fine hair that never had any sort of volume to it and now after using the shampoo and conditioner, I can tell and I also get complaiments on how healthy and full my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;I will tell you that you do have to use it for about 8 months before you start seeing any difference, but like I said, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I started using this product because my hair is thinning, and also because my sister has been using it for over two years (she totally believes in this product.) It is too soon to tell if my hair will become \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; but the thing I noticed after the first shampoo and condition is that my hair, which is always full of static (no matter what the humidity) didn&#x27;t stand on end with static when I combed it!!! I&#x27;ve tried every (and I mean EVERY) salon and supermarket brand of shampoo/conditioner just to get the static out of my hair, and this is the only product that has performed, without making my very fine hair look greasy! My hair also looks shiny (which would never happen if I didn&#x27;t use some \\&quot;shine\\&quot; product . . . which would increase the static in my hair even more!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using Nioxin 3 . . . if only so my hair doesn&#x27;t look like I stuck my finger in a light socket every time I comb my hair!!!</li>
            <li> Love the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; when left in your hair for a few mins.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for the past month and my hair is definatly thicker andmy scalp is much more healthy....no more itch or dryness. My wife loves it too!</li>
            <li> I have been losing my hair for the last decade.  The thinning was getting very noticeable. I have been using this product for at lest five years now, and my hair stop thinning.  This product does not grow hair, but keeps what you have.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for about 8 months now. I can tell you it does seem to slow down hair loss, but I see no signs of \\&quot;regrowth\\&quot; as some may have you believe. I rarely have to use dandruff shampoo anymore.</li>
            <li> I am not much for writing so what I can say is it came on time it was what I ordered and I will buy from them again.&lt;br /&gt;Great gob.</li>
            <li> Since Procter &amp; Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as good as it used to be.  The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than just sit there.  Apparently, they closed down the U.S. manufacturing plant and started producing Nioxin in Mexico.  It appears to me they may have also changed the formula.  Either way, I don&#x27;t perceive the same thickening effect it used to have.  This is unfortunate because I used to really love this product line.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have found for my very short grey hair.I use at suggestion of my hairdresser.  Product was received in good condition.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works well for my hair, i wont go back to using anything else. love it</li>
            <li> Have been using this along with the Scalp treatment for years and have noticed significantly less hair loss.  This is a great buy compared to in-store purchase.</li>
            <li> Works good for dermatitis of the scalp.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, saved $60</li>
            <li> my hairdresser has been reccomending this to thicken my hair. it is more expensive then i am used to paying for shampoo but the price at amazon is very good. i am not sure if it is making any difference in the thickness but i do love the refreshing scent that it has. it is great to help me wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I used to have the worst dandruff, and my stylist recommended Nioxin, (system 1) shampoo/cleanser and conditioner/scalp therapy.  I had heard it was for thinning hair, which I do not have.  She reassured me that conditions causing thinning hair can also cause dandruff... so I tried it.  That was 6 years ago, and I still recommend this stuff!  It is great, and I regret every time I have run out!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year with great results.  In my 20s my stylist noticed some thinning and recommended Nioxin.  Now my stylist notices the hair is filling back in.  I would give this product 5 stars, but I still lose hair in the shower or while blow drying.</li>
            <li> this is a faboulous conditioner, i am allergic to others, my head is is itchy when i use any other hair conditioners, i also love their shampo</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that helps me with my scalp psoriasis. I prefer it to the medicated products. A bit too minty but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had been buying this product for years. Now that &amp;#34;P&amp;G&amp;#34; is producing it, it is no longer the same. Instead of leaving my hair soft and free of any buildup, it now has a waxy buildup and my hair falls flat. It&#x27;s a shame that when another company takes over, they too often change everything completely. It&#x27;s now made in Mexico, instead of the U.S.  I will now have to look for another product to use instead:(</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fantastic price.  Love Nioxin products.  Top quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used, ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the big bottles in the 2 pack size (with the cleanser), but I do not use them equally, so it is good  to be able to buy them separately as needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned that this product isn&#x27;t authentic. While the contents seem like Nioxin, the bottle has a sticker on the front, rather than a screened/painted label like previous bottles.</li>
            <li> The latest bottle I received from the seller was one of the &amp;#34;made in Mexico&amp;#34; bottles with the sticker labels and the black cap with white top, instead of the words printed directly on the bottle.  The product is definitely inferior! I guess I will have to find a new conditioner. Anybody have any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product, along with the matching shampoo, for over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  my brothers both are balding/thinning; yet my hairline isn&#x27;t showing any signs of receding at all.  I&#x27;m convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap, but in my book it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update--I no longer use this.  The company was sold (to P&amp;G I believe), and they changed the ingredients.  In fact, they started using an ingredient (sodium laurel sulfate or something like it) that a Nioxin representative had said was a possible contributor to hair loss.  So I have no idea how good this product is anymore.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product and has been for several years.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped right away and is exactly what I&#x27;ve been using and will continue to use.  Product was originally recommended by my hair stylist as good for daily use without causing loss of hair.  She was right.</li>
            <li> I tried all the dandruff shampoos in my late teens and early twenties to no avail.  My serious case of bloody, itchy, flaky, &amp;#34;snowy&amp;#34; psoriasis was only remedied by this product.  It treats the cause...a dry/unhealthy scalp, whereas the others treat the effect, flaky buildup.  Nioxin products are the only products I have had on my head for 20 years.</li>
            <li> cleans scalp good, nice smell.</li>
            <li> Have used Nioxin for many years, but this bottle seemed not right, both color and consistency, which is unusual for Nioxin. After using this for several weeks, I&#x27;ve been losing more hair than usual. Won&#x27;t buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about twenty years and will never-ever be without it.  It really does what is says, thickens thinning hair!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Great customer services!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful!  I love the minty smell and the cool feeling it leaves on my scalp.  They sent it quickly.  I am very happy with the order!</li>
            <li> Started using this (along with the cleanser) in my mid 20&#x27;s when I thought my hair was thinning. I am now almost 38 and my hair is as thick as ever. I have nothing other than this product to attribute that to. Genetically speaking I should be bald by now. This stuff is the real deal. It might cost higher than your average shampoo/conditioner, but the results are WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> The price on this item was almost too good to believe.  My last purchase &#x27;elsewhere&#x27; of the same item cost four times as much per ounce!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was posted and I already use this product. Very happy with this, thank you!</li>
            <li> Using this product more than a month with cleanser. No improvment in the hairfall. Loosing so much hair with conditioner. will see another few months and stop if not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have used nioxin for many years. The high quality is still the same, if not better. The only surprise was the color was white instead of what l was accustomed to which was green. Not a problem because the quality was even better.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS MENTHOL OR SOME TYPE OF COOLING AGENT SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR PEANUS OR B HOLE IT IS AT FIRST A NICE FEEL BUT GETS OUT OF HAND QUICKLY POISON CONTROL SAID IT IS NOT TOXIC JUST TO DRY OFF WITH A WARM TOWEL AND WAIT FOR SYMPTOMS TO WEAR OFF IT IS SO COLD LIKE ICE ALL OVER MY FRONT PRIVATE AND BACK PRIVATE AT THE SAME TIME NOT WORTH THE MONEY IN MY OPINION</li>
            <li> Great product, good price</li>
            <li> Have used Nioxin shampoor and scalp therapy for years.  Downside is the price.  Now I know where to puchase.  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I have oily hair at the roots and dry on the ends.  Hard to find a conditioner that won&#x27;t over do the oily part.  This worked for me.</li>
            <li> I ended up having a reaction to the product ever since manufacturing moved overseas. It used to be good but no longer.</li>
            <li> This did not look or perform like the real Nioxin conditioner.. it left my hair limp and greasy. I ended up going out and buying another bottle somewhere else to compare and the second bottle worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin 1 conditioner for years.  At some point they obviously changed their formula though.  This stuff is not the same Nioxin I&#x27;d bought in the past.  It&#x27;s much more thin and has a stronger smell.  It still seems to work well but I definitely preferred the old formulation.</li>
            <li> It really works! After major surgery I lost a lot of my hair. Using Nioxin helped restore my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Works great  as long as they send you the correct  bottle.</li>
            <li> The product changed but so far so good</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 5 years. Great price and would recommend this product to anyone with fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Nioxin seems to do what it says it will do.  My hair was short short for many years but after using Nioxin for over a year it&#x27;s seems to be thicker.  At least that&#x27;s what my  wife says.  When I use Nioxin I tend to agree with her.  It works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great I&#x27;ve been using it for months&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite conditioner&lt;br /&gt;I always make sure I have extra bottles so I don&#x27;t run out</li>
            <li> This is the best product that ever came out for women with thinning hair.  I buy Nioxin shampoo, conditioner and the scalp therapy which is left in after shampooing your hair.  It took awhile, but gradually I began to get new hair growth.  If your hair is thinning, this product is sure worth a try.</li>
            <li> Mind-blowingly refreshing. You know that arctic feeling you get when you chew peppermint gum? Now imagine that sensation all over your scalp both in the hot shower and out. Definitely a brand I&#x27;m sticking with from now on.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  (I received the made in USA item) same formula and feeling as you get from your salon at much cheaper price. I have been using this product for 3 years, and my hair looks better than when I was in my 20s.</li>
            <li> This feels so nice on the scalp. But after using Nioxin 1 for a few years, I am able to see a drastic decrease in my hair. This really causes hair loss.</li>
            <li> It does help with itching scalp, but doesn&#x27;t really add any volume to hair.</li>
            <li> Good - just expensive.  Oh, and I meant to buy the cleanser but clicked on this one instead.  My own fault - I&#x27;ll just hang on to it for when I run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin System one for many years and you simply cant beat it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it really works. I have thinning hair and this product has helped my hair to grow thicker and slow down the balding process.</li>
            <li> Have not seen a huge difference, but I can say it does help. Do not expect to use this and within three months you will have a full head of hair. It will help regrow/maintain maybe 10 to 15% of what you have now. That is me personally, I cannot speak to everyone&#x27;s reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a great product that I have using for several years now, due to my thinning hair.  It seems to be working well, so I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> so far so  good, think i&#x27;m starting to see results.</li>
            <li> They changed their product when they sold out, not the same, quit using. Doesn&#x27;t provide the tingle sensation and saw results end.</li>
            <li> After purchasing Nioxin cleanser and conditioner, system 1, at a beauty supply shop we bought the conditioner from Amazon and it smells different and has different packaging.  The product is labeled with a TM and not a registration number.Is this a Nioxin product?&lt;br /&gt;Here is what P&amp;G says:&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for contacting Procter and Gamble Professional Care Exclusive Lines.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is not an authorized retailer of our product. We do not sell to online retailers, and therefore cannot verify authenticity of these products and do not stand behind them.&lt;br /&gt;There were changes made to the product and packaging in mid 2011, so it may be that the product you purchased online is older or past its shelf life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin Scalp Therapy for the better part of 10 years.  It&#x27;s a stimulating, refreshing product that cleanses  the scalp and simply makes your head feel good.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks old and prints on bottle are faded and not readable. The cap was sealed by a scotch tape to prevent leaks. It makes me suspecious that the contioner liquid was refilled into an old bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product atg a great price</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like Nioxin products when they aren&#x27;t the thin, watered-down versions that I&#x27;ve been getting recently when ordering through Amazon.  Today when I went to get my hair cut, I opened the top of a bottle of the Nioxin conditioner they were selling to see if it was thick and it was, so I bought it.  I recently bought a bottle of Nioxin shampoo at a local beauty supply store and noticed that it was thicker than anything I&#x27;ve been getting through Amazon for a long time.  I will no longer order these products from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner and the smell is wonderful......like Junior Mints!&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way....this bottle should last me for months!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry scalp and thin looking hair.  It didn&#x27;t matter what I used or what season it was I always had a layer of dandruff and could never wear anything black...now that I use the Nioxin scalp therapy, my scalp is perfectly moisturized, I no longer have dandruff but my scalp isn&#x27;t oily either.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> great product at a terrific price. Been using this product for  14 yrs.Beautician says helped me from loing all of my hair!</li>
            <li> Product sucks now I used it for like 10 years now all of the sudden my scalps so itchy and red and hair not growing as fast.</li>
            <li> Works wonders with the Nioxin shampoo. Thickens your hair and makes it shine.  ########This is an update on this product.  I threw out Nioxin because the new formula that is made in Mexico is horrible and all it does is cause your hair to fall out.  So if you want to loose hair, buy Nioxin.</li>
            <li> Have used for a long time and have always been pleased</li>
            <li> Works well and makes my old hair grow and shine.</li>
            <li> I got this bottle and it&#x27;s made in the USA. Which is good, because as a 15 year user of Nioxin-1 I am fairly certain that the Mexican made stuff is not as effective and clearly a different mixture/formula. I may have to do a youtube video on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin... Move production back, the Mexican facilities are making an inferior product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE TINGLY FEELING, LIKE IT IS REALLY WORKING - I USE THE WHOLE THREE STEP SYSTEM - WOULD RECOMMEND, ALTHOUGH MY HAIR IS STILL THIN IT DOES FEEL THICKER - WILL CONTINUE USING TO SEE IF IT IMPROVES!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for quite some time.  I think it works.  Its great even if you don&#x27;t have thinning hair, and I like the nice minty conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I freaked out when I started losing a lot of hair in the shower. Granted, I&#x27;m only in my mid-20s but this was recommended to me by a co-worker. The product, along with the shampoo, severely dried out my hair and caused more to fall out. My hair was weaker and easily broke. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad (it smells minty) but it&#x27;s hard to sleep and work smelling of mint 24/7. Worst of all, the bottle came half-empty/half-full. Thankfully, Amazon&#x27;s customer service was responsive as usual.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and always very quickly delivered ....thanks</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong item.  It is also Nioxin Therapy but not the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love it!  My hair dresser recommended and I tried it.  I have dry itchy scalp and dry processed hair.  I bought the whole system (cleanser, conditioner and scalp treatment).  My hair looks so much better and my scalp is healing!&lt;br /&gt;This system was developed for cancer patients that that are getting chemo and radiation so it treats the scalp and thickens the hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love it. This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes my scalp all tingly. I&#x27;m team natural and love this product. Great deal</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re losing your hair, ACCEPT IT.  This only functions to thicken your existing hair but it will only serve to frustrate your finances.  Alopecia is real, just accept it or do bosely.</li>
            <li> Soul mates are brought into your life so that you can grow and expand into the best version of yourself.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin products made in USA are great. I used them for years. Some of them I bought from Amazon. The last bottle I got was also ordered thru Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;That was a big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was taped over with a piece of scotch tape. When I tried to take it off,  prints from both sides of the bottle completely peeled off. I noticed that label said it was made in Mexico. My previous products were made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;The content of the bottle also seems very different from the product I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I got something fake. I can&#x27;t believe that Nioxin manufacturers would lower standards and produce something so low in packaging and quality.</li>
            <li> I have been a return customer of Nioxin products for many yerars.  My hair never felt as good as when I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the conditioner on a daily basis as my hair does not require it.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has given my hair body &amp; I use it monthly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great products.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It claims to work on fine hair...or starting to thin hair.  What it seems to actually do is to &amp;#34;swell&amp;#34; the hair that you have already.  It does not grow hair.  The peppermint extract in the product does &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; the scalp a bit.  (Cancer patients can keep from losing their hair through &amp;#34;cold cap therapy.&amp;#34;)  I rinse well to rid my skin of any residue, and use every day.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner with a tingling sensation from the peppermint oil. Refreshing sensation that is clean rinsing and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily.</li>
            <li> Although not a complete cure for hair loss, this product really does seem to slow down the appearance of thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Great compliment to the entire Nioxin System.  I couldn&#x27;t find this size in my regular hair cut place.  So this size bottle lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product.  It seems to work noticeable thickness (although product only addresses appearance not actual growth)  It is best used with shampoo and spray in treatment.  Nioxin sells the package.</li>
            <li> Love Nioxin, System 1!  Not only for how my hair looks and feels, but love the minty fragrance after using.</li>
            <li> Been using Nioxin for over 15 YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3 older brothers with male pattern baldness in different stages and I&#x27;m the ONLY one that does not show any visible hair loss!</li>
            <li> Husband has dry scalp and this is great for him.  We order in bulk over and over again.</li>
            <li> I use it for 2 years and I like it .</li>
            <li> works great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the product you get at the salon at a fraction of the cost. Shipment was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning so I purchased this item and have been using for last few years. It really works and scalp feels very clean, not oily. Overall, I would choose this shampoo over any other brand at this time.</li>
            <li> Although I bought the kit, I didn&#x27;t think the conditioner did anything. After all, my hair was thinning and sticking a ton of conditioner on it didn&#x27;t seem like it would give it more volume and body. I put it on my ends to help with split ends and that was all of it. Well, one Saturday morning I thought - you know, for giggles I&#x27;m going to put this stuff on the crowd of my hair and right on the roots.  HOLY COW, what a huge difference! My wide part looked normal again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don&#x27;t feel too confident that this system actually regrows hair. A few days of not using this while on vacation and it was evident that my hair was not in better shape, I was in fact worse off than I was before.  If you look at the advertising on the bottle, it says 9 out of ten people \\&quot;perceive\\&quot; a thickening effect.  Well, it does work - I can&#x27;t say to regrow hair but to thicken the hair so much that you think it is improving. I&#x27;m still planning on seeing a dermatologist and getting a full work up to see if something is behind this change in my hair beyond just the aging process. But until then, Nioxin will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Great product have been using it for years. Nioxin at least helps me keep the hair I have. I do not notice the hair in shower when I use it. I do not like using anything but.&lt;br /&gt;Although I am always skeptical about getting the real product.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin since 1997. Literally. I recently bought the number 4 and thought that formula was useless. It did nothing. So, I went back to my good old number 1. This formula is not the same. Something is very wrong. It is not the thick, green, wonderful stuff that works. It is a watered down, crappy conditioner that makes my hair fall out more. I hate Nioxin now and will NEVER buy it again. They have changed their products and lost a loyal customer of over ten years. Goodbye forever you horrible company.</li>
            <li> Great deal...great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for many months now and have been happy with the 3-part System 1.  When I purchased this Conditioner, I expected to receive the same product that I had gotten in the past.  This product has an odd VICKS VAPO RUB smell.  I am unsure whether or not I actually received Nioxin or if the seller has repackaged some other product in a Nioxin bottle.  Anybody able to help?</li>
            <li> Good product. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple of months now and my hair is looking good. This is a giant bottle though, I really need to read the product descriptions a lot closer in the future. My roommates think I&#x27;m some kind of super vain weirdo after seeing me open an Amazon package and pulling out an enormous bottle of conditioner. They keep calling me uncle Jessie.</li>
            <li> I have used the Nioxin system for 4 years and my hair is down to my waist.  I get many compliments about my hair.  Previously I had a lot of trouble growing my hair but was introduced to this system by my daughter and I would never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought my first version of this at the salon where I get my hair cut - it worked great. I ordered this (supposedly) exact same product yet I have to use 2-3 times the amount of the original to be able to condition my hair like the original did. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have as much of the powerful classic Nioxin \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; as the original. It really makes me wonder if this one is watered-down or a knock off version.</li>
            <li> We are loyal purchasers of this brand.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and find it is very effective in limiting hair loss. Use with the shampoo system.</li>
            <li> I love the nioxin system. I&#x27;ve been using it for year definitely think that it works really well.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using nioxin products for many years and i like the tingly feeling that i get when using it</li>
