            <li>Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Amazon , now I can give it to her as a present and she will be happy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, no dripping, in my opinion it&#x27;s a Original Perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Seller is amazon.</li>
            <li>It has a clean but powdery type smell.</li>
            <li>When I opened it, that familiar scent brought back so many memories!</li>
            <li>Not available in the Netherlands anymore, so it&#x27;s great</li>

            <li>It smells exactly like i remember it.  </li>
            <li>the previous ones were great my wife loves them especially the ones for me.</li>
            <li>much power.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>and I think it is only available online now.</li>
            <li>it is a soft, pretty smell.  </li>
            <li>When I was four years old, I remember my mom waking me up to take me to the babysitter&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li>This was my fav in the early 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The price also is much less than it used to be when I first bought it.</li>

            <li> I have a difficult time finding perfumes that I really love, that don&#x27;t give me horrible headaches.  </li>

            <li> review is crap</li>
            <li> But, this Tribu crap smells awful.</li>

            <li> I bought this as a gift to a friend, and she loves it, last week she told me that she use it every day, and she will order another one</li>
            <li> I had a couple issues with the shipping BUT they were all my fault. The gentleman I worked with was awesome and corrected the address and made sure the product was shipped ASAP. Very pleased with the customer service and my mom loves the perfume!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant raspberry scent after a few minutes of being on your skin</li>
            <li> Perfume has an exquisite fragrance. Had already used and always makes it stop me where I go.&lt;br /&gt;too much power. thanks</li>
            <li> I love it when my wife uses it, I like the honey rose scent. It goes perfect on her, it is a good fragrance no doubt about it.</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago and it was one of my favorite perfumes!  I have a difficult time finding perfumes that I really love, that don&#x27;t give me horrible headaches.  Tribu is awesome!  Was the large bottle for a very good price!  Very Very pleased with this!</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about buying on amazon perfumes, but yes... I got my perfume and it&#x27;s the same scent I remember from long ago! Good longevity and sillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that the spray fell down when I took the cap off, nothing &amp;#34;to worry&amp;#34; I put it again and works ok but well I guess is some defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, no dripping, in my opinion it&#x27;s a Original Perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Seller is amazon.</li>
            <li> Perfect perfume. Not available in the Netherlands anymore, so it&#x27;s great I could purchase it elsewhere. Though it was a pity I had to pay for custom rights at the moment the package arrived.</li>
            <li> I love this toilette spray you don&#x27;t need a lot to keep you smelling good all day. Get a lot of compliments on the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Benetton products now for some time and decided to do it online. the previous ones were great my wife loves them especially the ones for me. Even bought a few past fragrances for friends. But, this Tribu crap smells awful. I see the woody smell but not COFFIN WOOD. It smells as if it was mixed with corpse oil. My wife smelt it and threw it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt; Cathy J. Robbins  review is crap the fragrance has been about 19 years and his daughter wore it for over 20.&lt;br /&gt;If I could I would take a refund.&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend anyone buy this from amazon...My first amazon disappointment :(</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. She&#x27;s wore this perfume for 20 years. She always asks for it as gifts.</li>
            <li> this is my daughter &#x27;s favorite perfum , you can&#x27;t find it at the stores . Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Amazon , now I can give it to her as a present and she will be happy</li>
            <li> Tribu Perfume by United Colors of Benetton for women Personal Fragrances es un eficiente y excelente producto, todo esta genial.</li>
            <li> When I was four years old, I remember my mom waking me up to take me to the babysitter&#x27;s house. I will never forget the way her clothes and her sheets smell...like Trib. There&#x27;s something about this that is sophisticated, warm, and comforting. It&#x27;s unfortunate that I can barely find this fragrance in the States in stores, but I still buy this when I can for my mother. One of the best fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is the absolutely favorite perfume of my grandmother and I am happy I finally managed to get it somewhere! Have not seen in in Europe for years and I think it is only available online now. The price also is much less than it used to be when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite perfume and love it greatly.  I have been having a hard time getting and found on Amazon.  It smells exactly like i remember it.  it is a soft, pretty smell.  I get a ton of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this perfume years ago. To my knowledge they stopped making this. When I saw it on amazon I just had to order it. When I opened it, that familiar scent brought back so many memories! I love this stuff. It has a clean but powdery type smell. I have yet to find anything even close. I am not a big perfume wearer so this soft scent works great for me.</li>
            <li> This was my fav in the early 90&#x27;s and then it was discontinued! So glad I found it on Amazon! I&#x27;m gonna order more so I don&#x27;t run out and can&#x27;t find it! Love it Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> buena marca lo recomiendo el modelo es como se muestra en la foto, tiene buen aroma es riquísima benetton buenisimo</li>
