            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>Amazing hair spray for fine hair that needs curl/body.</li>
            <li>I love the Aquage products and this one does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>I have used Aquage for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>It holds my style for more than 12 hours, and hair looks better as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>So much better than Kenra 25.</li>
            <li>Plus, my hair just got flatter and more stuck to my head as the day wore on.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love this product too.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>Love this product....</li>
            <li>I would say Aquage is one of the top products on the market today.</li>
            <li>The look is soft but the hold is great.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, though Thankfully, a lot of it.</li>
            <li>As I said above this experience was great.</li>
            <li>I light spray holds very nicely but a second spray holds all day!</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t sweet or perfumed smelling which I can&#x27;t tolerate.</li>
            <li>I am constantly having to run the nozzle under warm water.  </li>
            <li>I love that it brushes out and leaves your hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used B &amp; B for several years and really liked it,but The nossel always got clogged.  </li>
            <li>Very fast turnaround time from this company.  </li>
            <li>It does cost more then other brands, but well worth it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why so many others gave it such rave reviews.</li>
            <li>Received on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It is really tacky feeling.</li>
            <li>I prefer aquage to most other sprays as it is &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, has good holding characteristic, but doesn&#x27;t make hair look dull</li>
            <li>It still allows your hair to be bouncy and natural feeling, it is not at all sticky!</li>
            <li>That is the only consistent thing about this product.  </li>
            <li>This was the first - and last- time using the freezing spray.  </li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair that needs some body and</li>
            <li>Yes, hard to find, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>keeps hair in place all day and looks natural</li>
            <li>it holds, but is not heavy.</li>
            <li>Not heavy but holds.</li>
            <li>It is sent free, does not leave my hair sticky, does not leave my dry, and holds my style all day long.</li>

            <li> Competitive price with the salon&#x27;s and you don&#x27;t have to take the time to go and buy it.  Great product</li>
            <li> This is the only hair spray I use! It is sent free, does not leave my hair sticky, does not leave my dry, and holds my style all day long. I use less then department store hair spray each use. I recommend it to any one that struggle with keeping their hair in the style they start the day off with. I have used this hair spray for over ten years now and have no plans on changing. It does cost more then other brands, but well worth it!</li>

            <li> My hairdresser moved to a new salon, and I followed her, but sadly they don&#x27;t carry Aquage products. This is my favorite hairspray. It&#x27;s a lighter hold than the Kenra 25 and not as sticky. It also isn&#x27;t sweet or perfumed smelling which I can&#x27;t tolerate.</li>
            <li> As I said above this experience was great. I love this product too.It holds better than any product I have ever tried!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray. Can be combed out &amp; not have to wash every day. Not heavy but holds.</li>
            <li> Aquage Freezing Spray is an excellent spray for humid days. Holds well without that stiff look and crunchy feel.&lt;br /&gt;Also brushes out well. I have fine limp hair that needs some body and Aquage gives me that.AAqua</li>
