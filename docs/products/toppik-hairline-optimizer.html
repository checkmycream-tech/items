    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Good product, works well for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Good shipping service.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t look good either.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I love Toppik</li>
            <li>I thought I could use it in my hairline for better application.  </li>
            <li>I have tried two or three other products of this type but find Toppik is the best of all I have tried.</li>
            <li>you cannot see my scalp anymore.super easy to apply just make</li>
            <li>Cheap Plastic Junk.</li>
            <li>great i t worked better than i expected</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this comb, but I use Toppik to cover my grey - works great.</li>
            <li>Helps make the application of Toppik so easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li>sure you buy the optional sprayer it makes life much easier.</li>
            <li>I got better results using one of my old comb</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work worth a hoot.  </li>
            <li>It helps the topic distribute in a more natural looking way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only caveat to this is you must already have some hair in order for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>Nice idea, but simply does not work.</li>
            <li>You hold it in front of your hairline when you sprinkle the toppik on your head and the jaggered design makes it look more natural when it lands on your scalp.</li>
            <li>and it came right on time.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>and it was much easier &amp; faster.</li>
            <li>This product is also used and highly recommended in the spa where I sometimes have my hair done.  </li>
            <li>The texture could have been more firm making it easier to keep in place.</li>
            <li>Simulates a natural hairline and prevents the powder from falling your forehead!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a hairline, you can&#x27;t powder one on and make it look natural.</li>
            <li>the fibers is clumsy and takes too long in between each &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; so I find it better to just shake the fibers directly onto the head from the container.</li>
            <li>This little device really makes all the difference in making your hairline look natural.  </li>
            <li>It is a handy gadget to use with the Toppik powder, especially if you are a little shaky in controlling the flow near your hairline.  </li>
            <li>And for them to charge is ridiculous, it should be free.</li>
            <li>If you are in the beginning stages or have thin or fine hair this is the product for you.</li>

            <li> and you just have to put it on carefully to avoid the hairline issue.</li>
            <li> It does not help as expected.</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> i expected to get two plastic combs not some damn cardboard cutouts for $15.</li>
            <li> similar tp spray paint that was sold a few years ago to cover bald spoits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on thin, straight hair, my hair is short and spikey.</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned out alot, due to age, I guess lack of hormones, whatever.  </li>
            <li> It says 2 Pack on the item title, but I only received 1.&lt;br /&gt;It was made of plastic, and not sure if it meant to be like that?&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I bought this because of other reviews.  </li>
            <li> 5 more words required stupid</li>
            <li> This little comb is helpful in covering the fibers I shake onto my hair.</li>
            <li> This product covers and fills where the hair is missing.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s not cheap for a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> My hairline is thin and my hair is long.</li>
            <li> Product works average, Mainly annoyed with having received half of what was advertised.  </li>
            <li> I was  not able to put toppik without it falling on my forehead just like before  without the optimizer.</li>
            <li> Not even work a few cents let along the price they are charging on here!</li>
            <li> Also, it was hard to use in conjunction with the product.</li>
            <li> Sucks... Use ur finger .</li>
            <li> People tell me I have thick hair, go</li>
            <li> Seriously, they&#x27;re charging how much for this piece of crap!?</li>
            <li> I wish I can take a close picture and show everyone how poorly they designed and made this product.</li>
            <li> No instrctions for use, so difficult ended not using</li>
            <li> Because I am a woman with very thin hair</li>
            <li> The Toppik hairline optimizer is just crap in quality, poorly made.</li>
            <li> And your hair gets stuck in the combs, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a piece of crap</li>
            <li> ridiculous!!!!</li>
            <li> It looks terrible and makes the hair fibre stand out.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without this product.  My hair has thinned out alot, due to age, I guess lack of hormones, whatever.  This product covers and fills where the hair is missing.  People tell me I have thick hair, go figure!&lt;br /&gt;If you have thinning hair, do yourself a big favor and buy this product.  I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on thin, straight hair, my hair is short and spikey.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this is a necessary add on to the toppik powder. And your hair gets stuck in the combs, which is annoying. Once you get the hang of how to use the hair fibers, you don&#x27;t need it anyway.</li>
            <li> The fact that these are paperboard &amp; not plastic isn&#x27;t the problem. It&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t work. The powder goes under them and still ends up on your forehead. I love Toppik and you just have to put it on carefully to avoid the hairline issue. These don&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this comb, but I use Toppik to cover my grey - works great.</li>
            <li> It was of no use for my type of fill in. Also, it was hard to use in conjunction with the product.</li>
            <li> Seriously, they&#x27;re charging how much for this piece of crap!? I bought it with their recommendation of doing frontal hairline but it didn&#x27;t work very well. I got better results using one of my old comb and it was much easier &amp; faster. The Toppik hairline optimizer is just crap in quality, poorly made. You have to see it to believe it. I wish I can take a close picture and show everyone how poorly they designed and made this product. Why do you think they give you two, it&#x27;s a piece of crap that&#x27;s why. And for them to charge is ridiculous, it should be free. Total Ripoff!</li>
            <li> It does not help as expected. I was  not able to put toppik without it falling on my forehead just like before  without the optimizer.</li>
            <li> Only recieved one comb, not the two that was stated.  I will return once I get the chance. Lots of aggivation for a $10 item.  Product I received is plastic and not the cardboard version as some have received.  Product works average, Mainly annoyed with having received half of what was advertised.  Buyers beware!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work worth a hoot.  It might work on men which wash their hair every day but I don&#x27;t.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not something I would buy again. I found it something I can do without as it still causes me to redo my hairline.</li>
            <li> This little device really makes all the difference in making your hairline look natural.  It helps the topic distribute in a more natural looking way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it were made from plastic and not cardboard.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred a laminated cardboard but should do the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years to stretch out times between hair dyes, and with age to thicken the appearance of my hair. This product is also used and highly recommended in the spa where I sometimes have my hair done.  I have tried two or three other products of this type but find Toppik is the best of all I have tried. While it is not part of this specific product, I would caution that the pump affair that is sold to make it easier to spot the fibers is clumsy and takes too long in between each &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; so I find it better to just shake the fibers directly onto the head from the container.</li>
            <li> This little comb is helpful in covering the fibers I shake onto my hair.</li>
            <li> great i t worked better than i expected</li>
            <li> I was completely unaware of this products. I must say that it gets a 5 star rating. The only caveat to this is you must already have some hair in order for it to be effective. I have very fine hair but my scalp shows through.I use very little of this product and it makes my hair much sticker you cannot see my scalp anymore.super easy to apply just make sure you buy the optional sprayer it makes life much easier. If you are already bald this is probably not the product for you. If you are in the beginning stages or have thin or fine hair this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Stop don&#x27;t buy don&#x27;t don&#x27;t don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It is a handy gadget to use with the Toppik powder, especially if you are a little shaky in controlling the flow near your hairline.  Though a regular comb may also give you the same results.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Simulates a natural hairline and prevents the powder from falling your forehead!</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected it to. The texture could have been more firm making it easier to keep in place.</li>
            <li> Cheap Plastic Junk. Not even work a few cents let along the price they are charging on here! Returned for Refund!</li>
            <li> Sucks... Use ur finger . Don&#x27;t wast ur money</li>
            <li> Helps make the application of Toppik so easy and fun to use. I bought one for me and my sister. The applicator is made of cardboard but it is sturdy. I recommend this if you purchase Toppik</li>
            <li> my mom has trouble putting the toppik on but this little tool really helped. and it came right on time.</li>
            <li> Nice idea, but simply does not work. If you don&#x27;t have a hairline, you can&#x27;t powder one on and make it look natural.</li>
            <li> No instrctions for use, so difficult ended not using</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use it without someone help</li>
            <li> I helped friend to purchase this. It says 2 Pack on the item title, but I only received 1.&lt;br /&gt;It was made of plastic, and not sure if it meant to be like that?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap for a piece of plastic. I was told to get this delivered in 2 days, yet it arrived after 1 week.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well for the intended purpose. Good shipping service.</li>
            <li> i expected to get two plastic combs not some damn cardboard cutouts for $15. ridiculous!!!!...... 5 more words required stupid</li>
            <li> I bought this because of other reviews.  Because I am a woman with very thin hair I thought I could use it in my hairline for better application.  NO!  It looks terrible and makes the hair fibre stand out.  Waste of money for me.  My hairline is thin and my hair is long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,it does what it says.You hold it in front of your hairline when you sprinkle the toppik on your head and the jaggered design makes it look more natural when it lands on your scalp.</li>
            <li> similar tp spray paint that was sold a few years ago to cover bald spoits. That didn&#x27;t look good either.</li>
