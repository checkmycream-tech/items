            <li>/&gt;It is totally worth the price, one of the best sunless sprays I have ever used period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>great color and no horrible smell!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and I have to use a lot more of it than I do using the Sunless Pro mist!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I think it looks better than the spray booth tan even!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that , but still quite pleased!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>Make sure you clean area where you stand to spray tan - shower is best place......</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I went home and honestly I was terrified that I was going to be orange.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It sprays onto the skin nicely and evenly in a mist.</li>
            <li>I use it all over, but find it&#x27;s especially useful for my face.  </li>
            <li>The spray feature is nice, but I found it still required rubbing in to distribute evenly.</li>
            <li>Versa Spa really is the best spray tan product out on the market today.</li>
            <li>The color is nice not orange.  </li>
            <li>but way cheeper, and in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li>Sprays evenly and smells nice (nice for a tanning product).  </li>
            <li>Best spray tan ever.. not orange and looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad and the results are great.</li>
            <li>but this is still by far the best self tanning product that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of self tanners and this one is by far the best one!!</li>
            <li>Pricey but a beautiful golden glow - better than any product we&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>It has a very fine mist</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it had received excellent online reviews by a major style magazine.</li>
            <li>The most realistic beautiful tan I ever had.  </li>
            <li>I also love the tone it is as well.</li>
            <li>Love this self bronzer (sometimes nozzle gets clogged though;(.</li>
            <li>It is even better.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it for my face.  </li>
            <li>It is so much better than the creams.  </li>
            <li>The nozzle that worked better had two symbols imprinted on the spray front; the Letter M and number 4.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m instantly tan and feel BEAUTIFULLY sun kissed!!!!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  </li>
            <li>the can away about 6 inches or more when spraying.</li>
            <li>So many compliments on my tan and</li>
            <li>love it, but pricey.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>Love this product..will order over and over again</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that humans came in &amp;#34;zebra&amp;#34; until I learned how to spray it on more evenly.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying more of the product.</li>
            <li>love the color</li>
            <li>I love the bronzer, and getting it through Amazon is way cheaper than getting it from the tanning salons.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love this product -</li>
            <li>I guess my fears about buying tanning lotions/bronzers online have been confirmed!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the tanning bronzer, i use it every day.</li>
            <li>you should not pay more than $45 for it . . .</li>
            <li>the more you spray the more even your color will be.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your hands afterwards.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, love the product and will re-order</li>
            <li>I LOVE SunlessPro 360.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is still my favorite self tanning product.  </li>
            <li>so I love that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde, fair skinned and color is great.</li>
            <li>Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this spray.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your hands after.</li>
            <li>I just need more practice applying.</li>
            <li>So my tans look gorgeous at first...</li>
            <li>this is a great product that goes on nicely and gives an actual tan/brown color - not orange.  </li>
            <li>Great for the face cause it&#x27;s got a very natural looking color .</li>
            <li>The REAL stuff drys within 2 to 3 minutes and your good to go</li>
            <li>Gives you a real fresh look.. Always get compliments.</li>
            <li>so I ended up spraying and rubbing it in fast and washing my hands really good afterwards.</li>
            <li>It is a great color, goes on easily and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Easy application.  </li>
            <li>Love this product especially for the great color that it gives.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful brown color that&#x27;s even.</li>
            <li>My friends claimed it looked fine</li>
            <li>You will live this self tanner !!!!!</li>
            <li>I learned the best way is to spray it on then wait a few minutes and apply lotion.  </li>
            <li>It actually makes the skin on the face look very nice and firmed.  </li>
            <li>The color however is very nice, a deep tan color.</li>
            <li>it is  quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Goes on in a super fine micro mist and doesn&#x27;t smell as if it&#x27;s going to give you lung cancer.</li>
            <li>The color is not like to original product I have purchased at salons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and gives a great bronze color, and I have very pale skin.</li>
            <li>it is a good product but after several uses it does not spray a mist</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Other than that the color is great.</li>
            <li>and fab when you want to add quick color to face or wearing something that will show legs etc.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply dries fast.  </li>
            <li>I love trying new things</li>
            <li>Also The tanning spray I recieved smelled pretty good, like a cucumber smell almost mixed with like a beach smell..  </li>
            <li>You pay for a full canister that is only effective for 1/2 of the intended use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>but if it&#x27;s the real deal it works like a charm!!</li>
            <li>I love the tanning spray and bought several more after my first purchase.  </li>
            <li>but the one I bought from amazon is not the real stuff!!  </li>
            <li>Great dark color!</li>
            <li>Seller sent it fast, even included a free sample of pre tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I can even do my own back!  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Great for touch-ups or even to use all over if you&#x27;re feeling pale.  </li>
            <li>I can fix it in the time it takes to warm up my flat iron.</li>
            <li>then my clarisonic and acne meds just scrub my tan right off my face.</li>
            <li>Versa spa needs to get it right.</li>
            <li>Really extends the versa tan up to a full week.</li>
            <li>But easy to apply and color is natural.</li>
            <li>Also the 360 spray is great for getting your back or back of legs b/c</li>
            <li>It was supposed to have been NEW and unused and unopened!!!  </li>
            <li>it looks so natural and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it recently</li>
            <li>Thanks for this wonder product!  </li>
            <li>Works like a tanning spa only more convenient and cheaper.</li>
            <li>I mostly buy it for my face since I do the versa spa and my body stays tan but face does not since I use deep cleansers on my face.</li>
            <li>Later that day MANY people were complementing me on my tan.  </li>
            <li>and this is exactly like that</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this stuff I kept messing up because I held it too close.</li>
            <li>i hold the can even further away when doing my feet and hands!:)</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone who enjoys sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>I love how you get instant color</li>
            <li>Did exactly what i want, I had to rub it in really well.</li>
            <li>Great for when a quick tan is needed--I used it for when I decided to wear a short dress on new years and didnt want to blind everyone with my legs :)  </li>
            <li>The bronzer effect is great because it looks tan immediately but continues to set your deeper tan over the next few hours.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I really like the tanning chemicals, but the container needs work to be done.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely NOOO orange look w this product.</li>
            <li>but if you take your time it turns out very well.</li>
            <li>is a fast noticeable bronze tan, no orange tints</li>
            <li>REALLY well afterwards.</li>
            <li>You must rub in fast as it dries fast.</li>
            <li>My wife has purchase this product before and she really like the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok…rather do the real VersaSpa though...</li>
            <li>it blends well and is very forgiving with bathing and even sweating.....</li>
            <li>Spray too much &amp; it will run.</li>
            <li>A can lasts quite a while and while it&#x27;s not foolproof, it is very forgiving.  </li>
            <li>THE REAL PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It looks real and does NOT turn orange.  </li>
            <li>so it goes on very evenly.</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>and that is much easier than this spray.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about putting too much</li>
            <li>I bought this off amazon because it was so much cheaper than sun tan city..</li>
            <li>I know that amazon sometimes sells stuff that isnt the real deal..</li>
            <li>a sponge wipe gently over face and neck.  </li>
            <li>This turned out so much better than expected.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell horrible like most self tanners and is so effective, quick and easy!</li>
            <li>My first few tries with this weren&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it you get a pretty natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite tanning spray.  </li>
            <li>On my invoice it says Comments: New Batch!</li>
            <li>Also, I might add this actually lasts and does not wash off the very next day like many others.</li>
            <li>I much prefer using this product than getting a spray tan; and forget those tanning lotions, this goes on like a dream and looks so natural!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have completely stopped using foundation makeup because I just don&#x27;t need it when I use this spray!!  </li>
            <li>All I an say is that it turns a bit orange but not as bad as others!&lt;br /&gt;Looking for the best!</li>
            <li>I was nervous at first, but this was wellll worth the $ spent.</li>
            <li>Clean, dry skin, no moisture.</li>
            <li>Does not smell as much as the others and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>After it dried I added my moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li>The color developed quickly (almost instantly) and was not orange at all.</li>
            <li>It was so easy and dried fast.  </li>
            <li>I recommend doing one light coat at a time and waiting a full ten minutes for the spray to dry before applying a second coat.  </li>
            <li>I try anything and this is truly the product that I would not want to live without.  </li>
            <li>The new nozzle has letter M and number 5.  </li>
            <li>I tried a new product that is liquid to foam</li>
            <li>This product goes on evenly and looks natural!</li>
            <li>It lasts several days and is the exact product in the tanning salon.  </li>
            <li>Its SUPPOSED to be the EXACT same formula as the versaspa sunless tanning booth at Sun Tan City,</li>
            <li>They are the EXACT same bottles and everything</li>
            <li>this actually looks like a real tan!</li>
            <li>It sprays as a mist making is more likely to result in an even tan versus other self tanners.</li>
            <li>I put it on right out of the shower and then let dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I only gave 4 stars is it rubs off on certain places quicker than others.</li>
            <li>I am having a hard time to get this to tan my legs, The old bottle seemed to work better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the DS faux Natural Sunless mist</li>
            <li>I just wanted this problem fixed.</li>
            <li>I spray it lightly on my face and keep that summer glow year round.</li>
            <li>The color is natural and not orange.</li>
            <li>Left me very streaky and spotty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to use lotion tanners on my face for fear of it being streaky and not blending well around the edges of my face, but with the spray, it always comes out looking natural.  </li>
            <li>The old stuff was perfection.</li>
            <li>first time I bought it from Sun Tan City and paid about $50, this time I bought here on amason and spent $34 for the exact same product.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin too</li>
            <li>Natural looking not orange.</li>
            <li>So much easier than going to the salon for a spray tan--exact same product!</li>
            <li>The color I got was nice and dark, but not too dark.</li>
            <li>Decided to do a little sunless spray and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>at first but just let it completely dry</li>
            <li>It works very well for the first few applications but after that it no longer sprays as a mist but rather a direct stream which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with a clarisonic everyday and use some pretty intense acne meds from peter thomas roth.</li>
            <li>While this product produces a great color and does not have that nasty tan smell, until the next day you can smell it a little, it provides great color.</li>
            <li>I was able to put it back on but now it sprays only a little stream.</li>
            <li>The 360 degree spray seems like it would be good, but unfortunately the whole time you are spraying the nozzle is leaking on your hand--my fingers were dark orange afterward.</li>
            <li>While the color is very pretty, it&#x27;s not easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I did not know anything about this bronzer spray but with a few gift-cards in hand, it seemed like something worth trying.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as if the spray top was broken from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little time to get it right.</li>
            <li>They only negative is that it&#x27;s a little hard to get it perfectly even, you have to run it in a bit.</li>
            <li>However, when I went to use the bronzer first time out of the package a straigt heavy stream shot out.  </li>
            <li>Only problem is when it starts to wear off it looks a little funny.</li>
            <li>The spray nozzle was defective so it sprayed the spray in a straight line instead of a mist, which left a dark streak.</li>
            <li>A little messy but fairly easy to use</li>
            <li>But the results with that stuff were not long lasting enough, and I had to apply it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either they don&#x27;t have a good color or they smell so bad you can&#x27;t stand it.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It is totally worth the price, one of the best sunless sprays I have ever used period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> great color and no horrible smell!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> and I have to use a lot more of it than I do using the Sunless Pro mist!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I think it looks better than the spray booth tan even!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that , but still quite pleased!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> Make sure you clean area where you stand to spray tan - shower is best place......</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I went home and honestly I was terrified that I was going to be orange.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It sprays onto the skin nicely and evenly in a mist.</li>
            <li> I use it all over, but find it&#x27;s especially useful for my face.  </li>
            <li> The spray feature is nice, but I found it still required rubbing in to distribute evenly.</li>
            <li> Versa Spa really is the best spray tan product out on the market today.</li>
            <li> The color is nice not orange.  </li>
            <li> but way cheeper, and in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> Sprays evenly and smells nice (nice for a tanning product).  </li>
            <li> Best spray tan ever.. not orange and looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad and the results are great.</li>
            <li> but this is still by far the best self tanning product that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of self tanners and this one is by far the best one!!</li>
            <li> Pricey but a beautiful golden glow - better than any product we&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> It has a very fine mist</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it had received excellent online reviews by a major style magazine.</li>
            <li> The most realistic beautiful tan I ever had.  </li>
            <li> I also love the tone it is as well.</li>
            <li> Love this self bronzer (sometimes nozzle gets clogged though;(.</li>
            <li> It is even better.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it for my face.  </li>
            <li> It is so much better than the creams.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle that worked better had two symbols imprinted on the spray front; the Letter M and number 4.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m instantly tan and feel BEAUTIFULLY sun kissed!!!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  </li>
            <li> the can away about 6 inches or more when spraying.</li>
            <li> So many compliments on my tan and</li>
            <li> love it, but pricey.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> Love this product..will order over and over again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that humans came in &amp;#34;zebra&amp;#34; until I learned how to spray it on more evenly.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying more of the product.</li>
            <li> love the color</li>
            <li> I love the bronzer, and getting it through Amazon is way cheaper than getting it from the tanning salons.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love this product -</li>
            <li> I guess my fears about buying tanning lotions/bronzers online have been confirmed!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> Love the tanning bronzer, i use it every day.</li>
            <li> you should not pay more than $45 for it . . .</li>
            <li> the more you spray the more even your color will be.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash your hands afterwards.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, love the product and will re-order</li>
            <li> I LOVE SunlessPro 360.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is still my favorite self tanning product.  </li>
            <li> so I love that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde, fair skinned and color is great.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this spray.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to wash your hands after.</li>
            <li> I just need more practice applying.</li>
            <li> So my tans look gorgeous at first...</li>
            <li> this is a great product that goes on nicely and gives an actual tan/brown color - not orange.  </li>
            <li> Great for the face cause it&#x27;s got a very natural looking color .</li>
            <li> The REAL stuff drys within 2 to 3 minutes and your good to go</li>
            <li> Gives you a real fresh look.. Always get compliments.</li>
            <li> so I ended up spraying and rubbing it in fast and washing my hands really good afterwards.</li>
            <li> It is a great color, goes on easily and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> Easy application.  </li>
            <li> Love this product especially for the great color that it gives.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful brown color that&#x27;s even.</li>
            <li> My friends claimed it looked fine</li>
            <li> You will live this self tanner !!!!!</li>
            <li> I learned the best way is to spray it on then wait a few minutes and apply lotion.  </li>
            <li> It actually makes the skin on the face look very nice and firmed.  </li>
            <li> The color however is very nice, a deep tan color.</li>
            <li> it is  quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Goes on in a super fine micro mist and doesn&#x27;t smell as if it&#x27;s going to give you lung cancer.</li>
            <li> The color is not like to original product I have purchased at salons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply and gives a great bronze color, and I have very pale skin.</li>
            <li> it is a good product but after several uses it does not spray a mist</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> Other than that the color is great.</li>
            <li> and fab when you want to add quick color to face or wearing something that will show legs etc.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply dries fast.  </li>
            <li> I love trying new things</li>
            <li> Also The tanning spray I recieved smelled pretty good, like a cucumber smell almost mixed with like a beach smell..  </li>
            <li> You pay for a full canister that is only effective for 1/2 of the intended use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> but if it&#x27;s the real deal it works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> I love the tanning spray and bought several more after my first purchase.  </li>
            <li> but the one I bought from amazon is not the real stuff!!  </li>
            <li> Great dark color!</li>
            <li> Seller sent it fast, even included a free sample of pre tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I can even do my own back!  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Great for touch-ups or even to use all over if you&#x27;re feeling pale.  </li>
            <li> I can fix it in the time it takes to warm up my flat iron.</li>
            <li> then my clarisonic and acne meds just scrub my tan right off my face.</li>
            <li> Versa spa needs to get it right.</li>
            <li> Really extends the versa tan up to a full week.</li>
            <li> But easy to apply and color is natural.</li>
            <li> Also the 360 spray is great for getting your back or back of legs b/c</li>
            <li> It was supposed to have been NEW and unused and unopened!!!  </li>
            <li> it looks so natural and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it recently</li>
            <li> Thanks for this wonder product!  </li>
            <li> Works like a tanning spa only more convenient and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I mostly buy it for my face since I do the versa spa and my body stays tan but face does not since I use deep cleansers on my face.</li>
            <li> Later that day MANY people were complementing me on my tan.  </li>
            <li> and this is exactly like that</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this stuff I kept messing up because I held it too close.</li>
            <li> i hold the can even further away when doing my feet and hands!:)</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone who enjoys sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> I love how you get instant color</li>
            <li> Did exactly what i want, I had to rub it in really well.</li>
            <li> Great for when a quick tan is needed--I used it for when I decided to wear a short dress on new years and didnt want to blind everyone with my legs :)  </li>
            <li> The bronzer effect is great because it looks tan immediately but continues to set your deeper tan over the next few hours.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I really like the tanning chemicals, but the container needs work to be done.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely NOOO orange look w this product.</li>
            <li> but if you take your time it turns out very well.</li>
            <li> is a fast noticeable bronze tan, no orange tints</li>
            <li> REALLY well afterwards.</li>
            <li> You must rub in fast as it dries fast.</li>
            <li> My wife has purchase this product before and she really like the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok…rather do the real VersaSpa though...</li>
            <li> it blends well and is very forgiving with bathing and even sweating.....</li>
            <li> Spray too much &amp; it will run.</li>
            <li> A can lasts quite a while and while it&#x27;s not foolproof, it is very forgiving.  </li>
            <li> THE REAL PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It looks real and does NOT turn orange.  </li>
            <li> so it goes on very evenly.</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> and that is much easier than this spray.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about putting too much</li>
            <li> I bought this off amazon because it was so much cheaper than sun tan city..</li>
            <li> I know that amazon sometimes sells stuff that isnt the real deal..</li>
            <li> a sponge wipe gently over face and neck.  </li>
            <li> This turned out so much better than expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell horrible like most self tanners and is so effective, quick and easy!</li>
            <li> My first few tries with this weren&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it you get a pretty natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite tanning spray.  </li>
            <li> On my invoice it says Comments: New Batch!</li>
            <li> Also, I might add this actually lasts and does not wash off the very next day like many others.</li>
            <li> I much prefer using this product than getting a spray tan; and forget those tanning lotions, this goes on like a dream and looks so natural!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have completely stopped using foundation makeup because I just don&#x27;t need it when I use this spray!!  </li>
            <li> All I an say is that it turns a bit orange but not as bad as others!&lt;br /&gt;Looking for the best!</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first, but this was wellll worth the $ spent.</li>
            <li> Clean, dry skin, no moisture.</li>
            <li> Does not smell as much as the others and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> After it dried I added my moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li> The color developed quickly (almost instantly) and was not orange at all.</li>
            <li> It was so easy and dried fast.  </li>
            <li> I recommend doing one light coat at a time and waiting a full ten minutes for the spray to dry before applying a second coat.  </li>
            <li> I try anything and this is truly the product that I would not want to live without.  </li>
            <li> The new nozzle has letter M and number 5.  </li>
            <li> I tried a new product that is liquid to foam</li>
            <li> This product goes on evenly and looks natural!</li>
            <li> It lasts several days and is the exact product in the tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> Its SUPPOSED to be the EXACT same formula as the versaspa sunless tanning booth at Sun Tan City,</li>
            <li> They are the EXACT same bottles and everything</li>
            <li> this actually looks like a real tan!</li>
            <li> It sprays as a mist making is more likely to result in an even tan versus other self tanners.</li>
            <li> I put it on right out of the shower and then let dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I only gave 4 stars is it rubs off on certain places quicker than others.</li>
            <li> I am having a hard time to get this to tan my legs, The old bottle seemed to work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the DS faux Natural Sunless mist</li>
            <li> I just wanted this problem fixed.</li>
            <li> I spray it lightly on my face and keep that summer glow year round.</li>
            <li> The color is natural and not orange.</li>
            <li> Left me very streaky and spotty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to use lotion tanners on my face for fear of it being streaky and not blending well around the edges of my face, but with the spray, it always comes out looking natural.  </li>
            <li> The old stuff was perfection.</li>
            <li> first time I bought it from Sun Tan City and paid about $50, this time I bought here on amason and spent $34 for the exact same product.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin too</li>
            <li> Natural looking not orange.</li>
            <li> So much easier than going to the salon for a spray tan--exact same product!</li>
            <li> The color I got was nice and dark, but not too dark.</li>
            <li> Decided to do a little sunless spray and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> at first but just let it completely dry</li>
            <li> It works very well for the first few applications but after that it no longer sprays as a mist but rather a direct stream which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with a clarisonic everyday and use some pretty intense acne meds from peter thomas roth.</li>
            <li> While this product produces a great color and does not have that nasty tan smell, until the next day you can smell it a little, it provides great color.</li>
            <li> I was able to put it back on but now it sprays only a little stream.</li>
            <li> The 360 degree spray seems like it would be good, but unfortunately the whole time you are spraying the nozzle is leaking on your hand--my fingers were dark orange afterward.</li>
            <li> While the color is very pretty, it&#x27;s not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I did not know anything about this bronzer spray but with a few gift-cards in hand, it seemed like something worth trying.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as if the spray top was broken from the beginning.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get it right.</li>
            <li> They only negative is that it&#x27;s a little hard to get it perfectly even, you have to run it in a bit.</li>
            <li> However, when I went to use the bronzer first time out of the package a straigt heavy stream shot out.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is when it starts to wear off it looks a little funny.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle was defective so it sprayed the spray in a straight line instead of a mist, which left a dark streak.</li>
            <li> A little messy but fairly easy to use</li>
            <li> But the results with that stuff were not long lasting enough, and I had to apply it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either they don&#x27;t have a good color or they smell so bad you can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that it does develop over the few hours following the application, my first time I didnt realize this and kept reapplying and ended up looking like I had spent the entire year in mexico.</li>
            <li> It still wasnt orange and actually looked like a real tan but was a big contrast to how pale i had been the day before!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when it starts to fade, it&#x27;s pretty splotchy.</li>
            <li> It only took minutes to dry and didn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes or sheets, and didn&#x27;t wash off the next day.</li>
            <li> Also the color is pretty dark so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This specific tanning spray has completly different look than other spray bottles..</li>
            <li> with the can you get multiple tans for about the same price and you can control how dark it is.</li>
            <li> I have used VersaSpa products for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about a sunless spray, you have to be careful with your polished nails.</li>
            <li> and I go tanning in a tanning bed to get a good base color.</li>
            <li> works good and doesn&#x27;t smell like crap</li>
            <li> used to be way less expensive but one of the better tanning sprays if you can keep it from clogging.</li>
            <li> The spray is really too heavy to go on smoothly, ie it comes out too thick, so I had streaks and its very hard to fix after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as this product is made I will not use another spray bronzer!</li>
            <li> I oNLY took 1 star due to product not the seller or Amazon.</li>
            <li> tan body thing going on and unless I do my makeup everyday I look kind of crazy.</li>
            <li> it is three single jets</li>
            <li> I have tried every single spray tan there is.. literally.  </li>
            <li> This does not, so the bottoms of my feet and my fingers turned dark orange, which had to be sanded off later.</li>
            <li> It is a very dark spray, so only apply once.</li>
            <li> I have ordered it multiple times and it usually last me at least a year.</li>
            <li> this is money well spent.</li>
            <li> Using the product almost everyday on my face it will last me close to a year.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful to wash your hands</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> , be careful on your feet and hands...</li>
            <li> No rubbing in or anything, spray, dry and go!!  </li>
            <li> It sprays in a single streak and then drips down your face.</li>
            <li> Spray it on while you are in the shower to prevent getting the product on other things.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product in lieu of tanning beds before weddings and other events.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful around your hands feet and elbows</li>
            <li> I ordered this product before and it came or as a mist fir a while but turned into a thick line when it got low</li>
            <li> When I put it on I waited for about 4 hours then went to lay down for a nap before I took a shower because the longer you leave it on the darker you get..  </li>
            <li> Well when I layed down in my bed</li>
            <li> The price on amazon is quite a bit less than what I pay for the product at the salon.</li>
            <li> So grateful to purchase it for so much less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This most recent purchase was awful.</li>
            <li> I used my hands and they were black by the end of me apply and rubbing into my skin.</li>
            <li> That way you don&#x27;t make a mess anywhere and your skin is moist and receptive to the color.  </li>
            <li> Overall, not a good experience.</li>
            <li> Little did they know that my vacation destination had been overcast &amp; rainy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so you would think that this would show up just a little</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to figure out how to get it even</li>
            <li> It feels a little &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It was streaky and very dark on my feet even though I moisturized.</li>
            <li> my makeup everyday because I don&#x27;t have time</li>
            <li> I sprayed and waited until it dried and when I looked into the mirror</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with routine trips to the salon for tans, and it takes my tan up a few notches.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does spray somewhat unevenly for me</li>
            <li> I can use everyday on my face in stead of makeup.</li>
            <li> so I have just been trying to deal with it and rub the uneven spray w a spong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> For me, too messy to use all over.</li>
            <li> So I get this pale face</li>
            <li> but it is a little hard to spray the backs of my legs</li>
            <li> and when you lay down your tan DOES NOT RUB OFF!!</li>
            <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Spray Tan</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t look fake and applies evenly and last about a week!</li>
            <li> this is NOT the real Stuff - Im so mad and upset because this is false advertisment, the picture says VERSA SPA.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to do self-spray</li>
            <li> How hard could it be to haven the nozzle spray mist?</li>
            <li> So I figured it would be hard to change the spray thats in the bottle..  </li>
            <li> but this is common sense with sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li> I emailed a complaint, but never heard from the company.  </li>
            <li> I tried washing it off but it was too late.</li>
            <li> Also it is much less expensive here than buying it in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I got it the spray tip was broken off due to poor packaging.</li>
            <li> The doorway comes out in a thick stream not a mist!</li>
            <li> I found it a bit hard to control the color and the spray is a bit weird to apply.</li>
            <li> My secret is to spray it on after my shower.</li>
            <li> I tried this after getting tired of paying $50/spray tan at the salon.  </li>
            <li> When I got this spray, the seal had been broken and it had been sprayed.  </li>
            <li> And also why was my container already opened and the nozzle broken off?</li>
            <li> Makes a horrible mess... worse than any other spray tan product.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for defective container parts.</li>
            <li> Was unable to use the bottle at all.</li>
            <li> and I got bored while she was at work.</li>
            <li> If you shy away from the sun or tanning beds</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY!!!  </li>
            <li> There is something about the design of the spray nozzle that is seriously flawed.</li>
            <li> not smell bad, and tan gradually gets deeper with time.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> WTF??!!  </li>
            <li> I even bought an at home spray tan machine (crap)</li>
            <li> It was awful!!</li>
            <li> -- this is an outrageous price . . .</li>
            <li> Its FAKE!!!!</li>
            <li> But I was WRONG!!!!  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that I got ripped off!!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You can even turn the can upside-down</li>
            <li> This stuff is LEGIT!!  I love it!  I&#x27;ve been using the DS faux Natural Sunless mist and I have to use a lot more of it than I do using the Sunless Pro mist!  I also love the tone it is as well.</li>
            <li> Love this self bronzer (sometimes nozzle gets clogged though;(. But easy to apply and color is natural. Make sure you clean area where you stand to spray tan - shower is best place......</li>
            <li> I have tried them all. Either they don&#x27;t have a good color or they smell so bad you can&#x27;t stand it. I bought this in the tanning salon as they told me it is the same product that is used in the spray tan booth. It is the best product!  I always get compliments on my tan and it does not smell.  My secret is to spray it on after my shower. That way you don&#x27;t make a mess anywhere and your skin is moist and receptive to the color.  The price on amazon is quite a bit less than what I pay for the product at the salon. You will live this self tanner !!!!!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this from amazon I got it from my local tanning salon but it&#x27;s so great I have to give it a review. I get spray tans and I go tanning in a tanning bed to get a good base color. I wash my face with a clarisonic everyday and use some pretty intense acne meds from peter thomas roth. So my tans look gorgeous at first... then my clarisonic and acne meds just scrub my tan right off my face. So I get this pale face tan body thing going on and unless I do my makeup everyday I look kind of crazy. I don&#x27;t so my makeup everyday because I don&#x27;t have time and I also want my skin to breath. So I tried some drug store tanners... haha I looked like a pumpkin. It was awful!! I went to the owner of the tanning salon I go to and told her my problem and told her I wanted the best thing for this and I didn&#x27;t care if it cost me 300$ I just wanted this problem fixed. This is what she gave me. It was 36$ I went home and honestly I was terrified that I was going to be orange. I sprayed and waited until it dried and when I looked into the mirror I was like omg it looks just as good an even as the spray tan I got 2 days before. It matched my face to my body perfectly!!!! This is amazing!! I will use this on any part of my body that starts to fade and I know it will turn out gorgeous!!! I&#x27;m no longer scared to use my clarisonic and skin care products. I can fix it in the time it takes to warm up my flat iron. If you want something for just your face like me or if your looking to do an all over tan this is what you want!!! I can&#x27;t speak for the stuff from amazon but if it&#x27;s the real deal it works like a charm!! A glorious tan is just minutes away!!! this is money well spent. I will buy this from now on. They have made me a loyal customer!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!!!.  I used to use the &amp;#34;Mystic&amp;#34; tan spray booths for all over tanning in the summer.  I would buy the &amp;#34;Mystic&amp;#34; tan self-tan lotion at the salon to use on my face during off seasons and in between spray booth tannings because the face would always fade the quickest.  The &amp;#34;Mystic&amp;#34; tan product was changed to the &amp;#34;SunlessPro&amp;#34; product.  It is even better.  Spray it on while you are in the shower to prevent getting the product on other things.  I mostly use it for my face.  After washing my face in the shower and applying a moisturizer, I make a cup with my hands and spray the product in my hands and rub all over my face and neck.  It actually makes the skin on the face look very nice and firmed.  It is so much better than the creams.  You can go without makeup it looks so natural and smooth.  Trust me on this product.  I try anything and this is truly the product that I would not want to live without.  Using the product almost everyday on my face it will last me close to a year.  It cost around $80 in the salon.  So grateful to purchase it for so much less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the tanning spray and bought several more after my first purchase.  Then I recommended it to friends but I think they changed the spray nozzle.  It is spraying in a streaming manner rather than evenly as when I purchased it before.  I purchased 4 bottles and they are all the same.  The nozzle that worked better had two symbols imprinted on the spray front; the Letter M and number 4.  The new nozzle has letter M and number 5.  The latter is the one that streams rather than spray evenly.  Good luck if you buy this product.  I really like the tanning chemicals, but the container needs work to be done.  Too expensive for defective container parts.</li>
            <li> Awesome results!! Immediate color!</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first, but this was wellll worth the $ spent. I usually use L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Spray Tan but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it recently so I gave this a try after seeing reviews. Seller sent it fast, even included a free sample of pre tanning lotion. The color I got was nice and dark, but not too dark. Absolutely NOOO orange look w this product.</li>
            <li> This product goes on without streaks or making your skin look orange.  Lasts for about a week and fab when you want to add quick color to face or wearing something that will show legs etc.  Highly recommend.  All others I have tried turns skin orange.</li>
            <li> The most realistic beautiful tan I ever had.  Thanks for this wonder product!  It was perfect for my cruise!</li>
            <li> I will NEVER be going back to sun tan city again! I simply spray this on after I get out of the shower and I&#x27;m instantly tan and feel BEAUTIFULLY sun kissed!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  I spray it lightly on my face and keep that summer glow year round. I have completely stopped using foundation makeup because I just don&#x27;t need it when I use this spray!!  Also it is much less expensive here than buying it in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  I have used VersaSpa products for a long time. The smell is not bad and the results are great. It is hard to do self-spray but if you take your time it turns out very well. I recommend doing one light coat at a time and waiting a full ten minutes for the spray to dry before applying a second coat.  This will guarantee even results and no splotches. I have been using this product in lieu of tanning beds before weddings and other events. I depend on it and it does not give me an orange look. You have to be very careful around your hands feet and elbows but this is common sense with sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li> I did not know anything about this bronzer spray but with a few gift-cards in hand, it seemed like something worth trying. I had been using ProTan spray- the one you apply with a sponge brush... with very nice results. But the results with that stuff were not long lasting enough, and I had to apply it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to SunlessPro, I was amazed after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sprays onto the skin nicely and evenly in a mist. DO NOT apply it too closely though, jeep the can away about 6 inches or more when spraying. Don&#x27;t worry your skin will still get misted. If you spray too close you could streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you spray as directed what you are left with is a fast noticeable bronze tan, no orange tints whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tan will last and last. I use this in conjunction with routine trips to the salon for tans, and it takes my tan up a few notches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is totally worth the price, one of the best sunless sprays I have ever used period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---Does not smell bad, and tan gradually gets deeper with time. Once it dries it also does not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> I also had a cancerous mole removed from my chest and had to give up tanning.  This stuff is awesome! So many compliments on my tan and it is  quick and easy to use.  I can even do my own back!  No rubbing in or anything, spray, dry and go!!  Love it!  I think it looks better than the spray booth tan even!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in tanning salons as well as Amazon before. This most recent purchase was awful. The spray nozzle was defective so it sprayed the spray in a straight line instead of a mist, which left a dark streak. Was unable to use the bottle at all. Will not buy online again.</li>
            <li> love it, but pricey.&lt;br /&gt;it used to be way less expensive but one of the better tanning sprays if you can keep it from clogging.</li>
            <li> This is the best bronzer I have ever used. My tanning salon quit caring this brand so I tried another and I couldn&#x27;t even stand to finish the can before checking to see if I could get it on Amazon. As long as this product is made I will not use another spray bronzer! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product..will order over and over again</li>
            <li> Pricey but a beautiful golden glow - better than any product we&#x27;ve ever tried.  Goes on in a super fine micro mist and doesn&#x27;t smell as if it&#x27;s going to give you lung cancer.</li>
            <li> There was a learning curve when it came to application.  I didn&#x27;t know that humans came in &amp;#34;zebra&amp;#34; until I learned how to spray it on more evenly.  Once I got the hang of it, it all smoothed out and looked good.  The color lasts for 3-4 days.  I plan on buying more of the product.</li>
            <li> works well... love the color but it does spray somewhat unevenly for me so i just use a tanning mit and rub it around! works great</li>
            <li> My friend has this in her bathroom and I got bored while she was at work. Decided to do a little sunless spray and was not disappointed. The color developed quickly (almost instantly) and was not orange at all. Later that day, I went out with some friends I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while and everyone was complimenting my tan - they thought it was from my vacation! Little did they know that my vacation destination had been overcast &amp; rainy!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot wait to purchase this product and start using it regularly! Just be careful to wash your hands REALLY well afterwards.</li>
            <li> The nozzle squirts out in a strait stream, no mist at all. You must rub in fast as it dries fast. This IS NOT fault of the seller. My email was returned in a prompt fashion and I have a credit coming for my purchase. This seems tone happening with VeraSpa themselves. They pick who makeshift these or make changes. I oNLY took 1 star due to product not the seller or Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the bronzer, and getting it through Amazon is way cheaper than getting it from the tanning salons.  However, when I went to use the bronzer first time out of the package a straigt heavy stream shot out.  There was no fixing it. I emailed a complaint, but never heard from the company.  If you shy away from the sun or tanning beds this is a great product that goes on nicely and gives an actual tan/brown color - not orange.  Also the 360 spray is great for getting your back or back of legs b/c no matter which way you hold the bottle the spay it comes out.  (when your bottle works properly that is!)</li>
            <li> My wife has purchase this product before and she really like the product. She has stopped tanning and only uses this product.</li>
            <li> Best at home sunless spray. The color is natural and not orange. I can use everyday on my face in stead of makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product 3 times now. works the best!</li>
            <li> Left me very streaky and spotty.</li>
            <li> this stuff is PRO quality. works great, stays on longer than any booth spray tan</li>
            <li> This product goes on evenly and looks natural! It&#x27;s very easy to apply and gives a great bronze color, and I have very pale skin. I get compliments all the time! My only complaint is that when it starts to fade, it&#x27;s pretty splotchy.</li>
            <li> On this last order the tube arrived damaged/defective. I&#x27;m trying to make it work but it doesn&#x27;t spray out properly. I didn&#x27;t see if it was returnable so I have just been trying to deal with it and rub the uneven spray w a spong.</li>
            <li> I am trying to locate a product comparable to the discontinued Mystic tan spray I used to buy--but this is NOT it. The 360 degree spray seems like it would be good, but unfortunately the whole time you are spraying the nozzle is leaking on your hand--my fingers were dark orange afterward. The spray is really too heavy to go on smoothly, ie it comes out too thick, so I had streaks and its very hard to fix after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystic tan has a blue cast (you can only see it on a sponge, etc, not your skin) to balance the orange. This does not, so the bottoms of my feet and my fingers turned dark orange, which had to be sanded off later. The reason my feet were effected is that so much overspray was wasted that it landed on the floor of the tub and I was standing in it. I tried washing it off but it was too late. It is a very dark spray, so only apply once. In 24 hours the spray was splitting and wearing off, so I looked like I had applied an animal print. Also, the overspray eventually landed all over my bathroom rug as well, and turned it brown. Fortunately it washed out!!!  Overall, not a good experience.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite tanning spray.  It always goes on evenly and doesn&#x27;t stink.  I found it at my tanning salon and have since quite going to the salon and just use this product myself at home! Love it. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Did exactly what i want, I had to rub it in really well. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that , but still quite pleased!</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected. It was streaky and very dark on my feet even though I moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before, it&#x27;s great. I spray it on after my shower and before I put my makeup on. No streaks at all, lasts almost a year (I use 2-3x a week). It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> it is a good product but after several uses it does not spray a mist it is three single jets</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok…rather do the real VersaSpa though...</li>
            <li> I do not like this product. It comes out in spurts and doesn&#x27;t spray evenly.  The color is not like to original product I have purchased at salons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like going to the Versa Spa ...I just use it on my face but can spray all over...It comes out in a mist, so it feelsl like the sunless tanning spray.  Good product.  Use same guidelines though as you would before going into the booth.  Clean, dry skin, no moisture.</li>
            <li> Makes a horrible mess... worse than any other spray tan product. If you are going to use this, go outside.</li>
            <li> Works like a tanning spa only more convenient and cheaper. It lasts several days and is the exact product in the tanning salon.  I actually cancelled my membership for spray tanning and bought this instead.  It is more expensive in the shops... so online pricing is best!  The bronzer effect is great because it looks tan immediately but continues to set your deeper tan over the next few hours.  Dries quickly so you can tan minutes before getting dressed.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product - it blends well and is very forgiving with bathing and even sweating.....Works great in combination with the cleanser and moisturizer...!</li>
            <li> Works well... A little messy but fairly easy to use</li>
            <li> Good product! Great dark color! It takes a little time to get it right. Spray too much &amp; it will run.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I tried this after getting tired of paying $50/spray tan at the salon.  A can lasts quite a while and while it&#x27;s not foolproof, it is very forgiving.  I use it all over, but find it&#x27;s especially useful for my face.  I&#x27;ve always been hesitant to use lotion tanners on my face for fear of it being streaky and not blending well around the edges of my face, but with the spray, it always comes out looking natural.  You can also layer it on for a deeper color.  This has become a staple in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> As much as I love the color of versa spa solution this product is useless. It sprays in a single streak and then drips down your face. How hard could it be to haven the nozzle spray mist? Versa spa needs to get it right.</li>
            <li> I guess my fears about buying tanning lotions/bronzers online have been confirmed!  When I got this spray, the seal had been broken and it had been sprayed.  It was supposed to have been NEW and unused and unopened!!!  Will not buy from this seller again!!! NOT HAPPY!!!  BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product today thinking this is the same stuff I have ordered before and Ive gotten at the Palm Beach Tan ... I get the package and it does not say VERSA SPA on it... this is NOT the real Stuff - Im so mad and upset because this is false advertisment, the picture says VERSA SPA.  On my invoice it says Comments: New Batch! Versa Not printed on Front.  I paided 45.00 for this product and thought I was getting something I wasnt.  DONT BUY --- NOT THE REAL PRODUCT AS SHOWN</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I mostly buy it for my face since I do the versa spa and my body stays tan but face does not since I use deep cleansers on my face. I use this in the mornings on my face and there is no difference whatsoever. I am very fair so you would think that this would show up just a little but it does not. If I layer it, (reapply it several times) I get a bit of a color but then my makeup looks cakey and my pores look enormous. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my sun tan booth place because I don&#x27;t ever tan my face (don&#x27;t need to accelerate aging!).  I LOVE this product.  It was so easy and dried fast.  I put it on right out of the shower and then let dry.  After it dried I added my moisturizer on top of it.  Later that day MANY people were complementing me on my tan.  It looks real and does NOT turn orange.  Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this but definitely buy it on line, saves around $10.</li>
            <li> What a great price for this product.What a great price for this product. Love the tanning bronzer, i use it every day.</li>
            <li> I am having a hard time to get this to tan my legs, The old bottle seemed to work better. I am thinking that they changed the formula, Why do companies do this? The old stuff was perfection.</li>
            <li> This is the best spray tan product there is!!! I have ordered it multiple times and it usually last me at least a year. It has a very fine mist so it goes on very evenly. The smell is also very good. I hope Amazon continues to sell it. I now have friends also using it!</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful brown color that&#x27;s even. Dries fast. Doesn&#x27;t stink or make me break out. I use on face and décolleté in between Versa Spa spray booth sessions. For me, too messy to use all over. Great design on nozzle...never clogs and gives airbrushed finish.</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller</li>
            <li> Awesome product and quick delivery</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  It works great and doesn&#x27;t steak or smear.  I use it on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> The VersaSpa sunless tanning is the best aerosol tan spray ever for me . . . perfect color.  I saw it priced for $96.90 online (incl shipping) by one retailer on December 7, 2015 -- this is an outrageous price . . . you should not pay more than $45 for it . . . no wonder there was &amp;#34;no charge&amp;#34; for shipping!</li>
            <li> While this product produces a great color and does not have that nasty tan smell, until the next day you can smell it a little, it provides great color. I found it a bit hard to control the color and the spray is a bit weird to apply. I tried a new product that is liquid to foam and that is much easier than this spray. While the color is very pretty, it&#x27;s not easy to apply. I used my hands and they were black by the end of me apply and rubbing into my skin. I had to wash my hands several times and then I had different wrist and hand color then.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it had received excellent online reviews by a major style magazine. The spray feature is nice, but I found it still required rubbing in to distribute evenly. I experienced some streaking on my lower legs, but nowhere else, so that could have been operator error. The color however is very nice, a deep tan color.</li>
            <li> The doorway comes out in a thick stream not a mist! Other than that the color is great. I ordered this product before and it came or as a mist fir a while but turned into a thick line when it got low so I ordered it again and it&#x27;s as if the spray top was broken from the beginning.  It doesn&#x27;t come out in a mist at all!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this- first time I bought it from Sun Tan City and paid about $50, this time I bought here on amason and spent $34 for the exact same product. Takes a little bit to figure out how to get it even but once you get the hang of it you get a pretty natural looking tan. Only problem is when it starts to wear off it looks a little funny. My friends claimed it looked fine but since I know what my skin looks like, I could tell. Great for when a quick tan is needed--I used it for when I decided to wear a short dress on new years and didnt want to blind everyone with my legs :)  If you go to Sun Tan City to get a spray tan done, it is around $35 for 1 tan, with the can you get multiple tans for about the same price and you can control how dark it is. Just keep in mind that it does develop over the few hours following the application, my first time I didnt realize this and kept reapplying and ended up looking like I had spent the entire year in mexico. It still wasnt orange and actually looked like a real tan but was a big contrast to how pale i had been the day before!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stuff before and like it. Unfortunately when I got it the spray tip was broken off due to poor packaging. I was able to put it back on but now it sprays only a little stream. If it wasn&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This spray tanner works great!!!! Don&#x27;t worry about putting too much on- the more you spray the more even your color will be. When it fades it fades evenly without streaks or that &amp;#34;rubbed-off&amp;#34; look. I much prefer using this product than getting a spray tan; and forget those tanning lotions, this goes on like a dream and looks so natural! I have really sensitive skin too and I had NO allergic reaction! Oh, and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy it through Amazon than in the tanning salons (just FYI).</li>
            <li> Love it. Be sure to wash your hands afterwards.</li>
            <li> Perfect for touch ups in between Versa Spa spray tan in the booth. I also sometimes use it just on my legs if I know I&#x27;m going to be wearing shorts. Very easy to apply and looks natural. Versa Spa really is the best spray tan product out on the market today. Does not smell as much as the others and looks completely natural. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this versaspa tanning spray thinking it was going to be the same as the tanning salons but it wasnt!!!!  Its SUPPOSED to be the EXACT same formula as the versaspa sunless tanning booth at Sun Tan City, But it is NOT!!!!  This tanning spray has a COMPLETLEY different smell than the versaspa sunless tanning spray at sun tan city..  They are the EXACT same bottles and everything but the one I bought from amazon is not the real stuff!!  Its FAKE!!!! When I put it on I waited for about 4 hours then went to lay down for a nap before I took a shower because the longer you leave it on the darker you get..  Well when I layed down in my bed ALL OF THE TANNING SPRAY RUBBED OFF ON MY PILLOW AND MY SHEETS!!!!  WTF??!!  That is NOT supposed to happen..  The REAL stuff drys within 2 to 3 minutes and your good to go and when you lay down your tan DOES NOT RUB OFF!! I bought this off amazon because it was so much cheaper than sun tan city.. I paid $36 plus shipping and at the salon its like $80 !!!! But I wish I never bought this item from amazon!!!! I know that amazon sometimes sells stuff that isnt the real deal.. But I figured they couldnt pull this one off just because of how its in a spray bottle and its not just a sticker around the bottle.. This specific tanning spray has completly different look than other spray bottles.. So I figured it would be hard to change the spray thats in the bottle..  But I was WRONG!!!!  Also The tanning spray I recieved smelled pretty good, like a cucumber smell almost mixed with like a beach smell..  And if you have ever spray tanned at sun tan city then you know the tanning solution from the versaspa Does Not smell good at ALL!!!!  I am so disappointed that I got ripped off!!!! Now I dont know whether or not to trust amazon anymore!!!!  I have been buying stuff off amazon for years but now Im not so sure about it anymore!!!! I would NOT RECCOMEND This item to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect product to sustain your tan during &amp;#34;in between&amp;#34; times . Great for the face cause it&#x27;s got a very natural looking color .</li>
            <li> The color is nice not orange.  Easy application.  Good to extend spray tan or use if you want some color.Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> SunlessPro Tanning Bronzer 360 is a great product.  It works best if you mask your face and use a body scrub once or twice a week.  Sometimes I spray the tanning creme on  a sponge wipe gently over face and neck.  The product has a pleasant smell.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about a sunless spray, you have to be careful with your polished nails. The Sunless tanning Crème will discolor your Gel Polish.</li>
            <li> Does a great job without streaks...don&#x27;t shake the can</li>
            <li> It works very well for the first few applications but after that it no longer sprays as a mist but rather a direct stream which defeats the purpose. There is something about the design of the spray nozzle that is seriously flawed. I have experienced this on every canister that I have ordered. You pay for a full canister that is only effective for 1/2 of the intended use. Versa... Please correct and you will have a great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I&#x27;ve always gone to the salon for spray tans and this is exactly like that but way cheeper, and in the privacy of your own home. It only took minutes to dry and didn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes or sheets, and didn&#x27;t wash off the next day. It smells really good too. They only negative is that it&#x27;s a little hard to get it perfectly even, you have to run it in a bit. Also the color is pretty dark so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this product especially for the great color that it gives. Super easy to apply dries fast.  Really extends the versa tan up to a full week.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single spray tan there is.. literally.  I even bought an at home spray tan machine (crap) this actually looks like a real tan! Goes on evenly! The one thing I do recommend is that you do hold it 7-8 inches away from your body because that is key. The first time I tried this stuff I kept messing up because I held it too close. Also, I might add this actually lasts and does not wash off the very next day like many others. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. It truly is the best there is. Totally worth the price!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful on your feet and hands... i hold the can even further away when doing my feet and hands!:)</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that this is a great product and it&#x27;s so fast and easy.  I learned the best way is to spray it on then wait a few minutes and apply lotion.  It seems to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it and make the color even.  It feels a little &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; at first but just let it completely dry and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave 4 stars is it rubs off on certain places quicker than others. For example, where your sandle straps are on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, love the product and will re-order</li>
            <li> I LOVE SunlessPro 360.  It is the best sunless tanner that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone who enjoys sunless tanners.  This product has bronzing agents that work immediately.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> All I an say is that it turns a bit orange but not as bad as others!&lt;br /&gt;Looking for the best!</li>
            <li> The color is great. Natural looking not orange. Only draw back is that it doesn&#x27;t apply evenly.Would still buy again.</li>
            <li> love this spray!! doesn&#x27;t look fake and applies evenly and last about a week! will be repurchasing soon</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. It sprays as a mist making is more likely to result in an even tan versus other self tanners. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is still my favorite self tanning product.  It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever tried and I still like to try others.  I love trying new things but this is still by far the best self tanning product that I&#x27;ve ever used.  Besides the fact that it&#x27;s the best color for my skin, it&#x27;s also the quickest to apply.  I&#x27;m pretty lazy so I love that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem the same like you buy in the store!</li>
            <li> Fabulous !!! Used this for about a year. Spray your face than dab it with a pad .  Also great for hands etc. Does get darker as day goes on.  Gives you a real fresh look.. Always get compliments. Great product!!</li>
            <li> works good and doesn&#x27;t smell like crap</li>
            <li> So much easier than going to the salon for a spray tan--exact same product!</li>
            <li> Goes on even...great color and no horrible smell! Love love!!! I would recommend the product. I&#x27;m a blonde, fair skinned and color is great.</li>
            <li> This is an update. I ordered again but why did I not receive the ACTUAL VERSA SPA BRAND sunless pro?? Why is it generic? And also why was my container already opened and the nozzle broken off? Very disappointed!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I use the pre-tan conditioner first&lt;br /&gt;and then apply!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! Gets me through the summer, in between spray tans.  Great for touch-ups or even to use all over if you&#x27;re feeling pale.  Sprays evenly and smells nice (nice for a tanning product).  A must-have item!</li>
            <li> I love this spray.  It is a great color, goes on easily and looks natural.  Be sure to wash your hands after.</li>
            <li> Best spray tan ever.. not orange and looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell horrible like most self tanners and is so effective, quick and easy! Would recommend to anyone! Definitely good buy</li>
            <li> My first few tries with this weren&#x27;t great but I did notice some color.  I just need more practice applying.</li>
            <li> This turned out so much better than expected. I did have to have my husband assist in spraying me but that was not a big deal for me. Great safe alternative to tanning!</li>
            <li> Really great color and coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of self tanners and this one is by far the best one!! It gives u great color that lasts, doesn&#x27;t turn u orange at ALL!!</li>
            <li> I love how you get instant color but it is a little hard to spray the backs of my legs so I ended up spraying and rubbing it in fast and washing my hands really good afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use this product to refreshen my versaspa spray tan I get at the salon! It&#x27;s perfect for touch ups in between visits.</li>
