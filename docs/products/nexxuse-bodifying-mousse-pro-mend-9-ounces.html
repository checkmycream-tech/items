    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Makes perfect controlled waves.</li>
            <li>Great body and fullness.</li>
            <li>Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li>However, this mousse truly is magic and produces miracles!</li>
            <li>Great for fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I applied it before roller setting my hair and the shine I got after using this product was amazing.</li>
            <li>Handy.</li>
            <li>My sisters love it too.</li>
            <li>I love it even more.  </li>
            <li>Then I comb it through to make sure it&#x27;s all even.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products that say they are &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; or give your hair more body.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it smells great, and provides a nice shine.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous mousse.</li>
            <li>This item was great and totally met my expectations.</li>
            <li>This mousse adds great volume, prevents frizz, and does so without any kind of residue--so only soft, shiny curls; no crunchy curls.</li>
            <li>It has really helped and made my fine hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and would definitely purchase it again</li>
            <li>The smell is also nice and not too strong like some other hair brands out there (looking at you Pantene).  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling smooth and my natural curls are frizz free.</li>
            <li>I figure if you&#x27;re going to spend the money getting a nice hair cut, you might as well pay a few extra bucks to keep it healthy!</li>
            <li>and I get a lot of volume, plus my hair feels soft and light like the day I walked out of the salon.  </li>
            <li>Used it to repair some burned ends from a hot curling.  </li>
            <li>My hair is always soft, stronger and full of body.</li>
            <li>I did not return because I can still use it if I hold the applicator button a certain way.</li>
            <li>Nexxus mousse really works...</li>
            <li>If you use the right amount it makes your hair feel volumous and soft.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, and so many products either leave my hair dry or heavy.  </li>
            <li>Just a little puff and my hair stays ok for a day without feeling greasy or crackly.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different mousse products and this is by far the most helpful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to blow dry my hair right away without having to wait for the mousse to dry because it&#x27;s really fluffy and light weight and doesn&#x27;t soak my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first product that actually worked for me.</li>
            <li>And so far, no split</li>
            <li>Not sure whether it&#x27;s really that much better than a similar, less expensive mousse that I&#x27;ve tried, but still a very good product.</li>
            <li>after I got a haircut because I was tired of the split ends that my fine straight hair had suffered from (lots of blow drying and straightening done over here!)  </li>
            <li>Item came with applicator top broken.  </li>
            <li>Very definitely adds body to thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I had a little extra to the bottom and really rub it on the ends.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have used in the past and it really did mend my split ends.  </li>
            <li> definitely recommend spending the extra money and getting the Nexxus brand vs. other leading brands that claim they work just as well as salon products.  </li>

            <li> I have tried several different mousse products and this is by far the most helpful. It helps to control my hair and does keep the loose ends in control. It makes a difference for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous mousse. It keep the style in without being too stiff. My sisters love it too. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This item was great and totally met my expectations. I am very pleased with the product and would definitely purchase it again</li>
            <li> Handy. Just a little puff and my hair stays ok for a day without feeling greasy or crackly.  It seems to last forever</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, and so many products either leave my hair dry or heavy.  I was using the regular NEXXUS bodify mousse and then saw the promend version.  I love it even more.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it smells great, and provides a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Great body and fullness. Leaves my hair feeling smooth and my natural curls are frizz free.</li>
            <li> Great for fine, curly hair. Lightweight, controls frizz and keeps my curls for days with lots of body.</li>
            <li> This is nice--nothing wrong with it--but it is quite a bit more expensive than other brands in the stores and I cannot tell any difference in the brands costing less.</li>
            <li> Item came with applicator top broken.  I did not return because I can still use it if I hold the applicator button a certain way.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now (along with the shampoo and conditioner) after I got a haircut because I was tired of the split ends that my fine straight hair had suffered from (lots of blow drying and straightening done over here!)  I have very limp hair, especially on the day after I wash my hair, and I can really tell a difference when I use this.  I never used to use a mousse in my hair because I always thought it would weigh my hair down, but this actually does the opposite.  I use a round bristle brush when blow drying and I get a lot of volume, plus my hair feels soft and light like the day I walked out of the salon.  The smell is also nice and not too strong like some other hair brands out there (looking at you Pantene).  And so far, no split ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use a little at a time and work your way through your hair.  I had a little extra to the bottom and really rub it on the ends.  Then I comb it through to make sure it&#x27;s all even.  I&#x27;m able to blow dry my hair right away without having to wait for the mousse to dry because it&#x27;s really fluffy and light weight and doesn&#x27;t soak my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend spending the extra money and getting the Nexxus brand vs. other leading brands that claim they work just as well as salon products.  I figure if you&#x27;re going to spend the money getting a nice hair cut, you might as well pay a few extra bucks to keep it healthy!</li>
            <li> It actually does what it is supposed to do. I have tried many products that say they are &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; or give your hair more body. This is the first product that actually worked for me.</li>
            <li> Used it to repair some burned ends from a hot curling.  It has really helped and made my fine hair more manageable.  Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Nexxus mousse really works...I have used in the past and it really did mend my split ends.  I also use it with the ProMend shampoo and conditioner. My hair is always soft, stronger and full of body.</li>
            <li> I used this product after a wash and rinse. I applied it before roller setting my hair and the shine I got after using this product was amazing. I will buy another one this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff &amp; was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore</li>
            <li> Phasing this one out it seems.  Difficult to find now.  I like this a lot.  Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Makes perfect controlled waves. Delivery was very quick. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Works well. However use sparely or it will make your hair feel like it has a lot of product in it and dry. If you use the right amount it makes your hair feel volumous and soft.</li>
            <li> the lid came snapped off, and item is unusable.</li>
            <li> I am an extremely frugal person, so $8 - $10 a bottle would normally be a ridiculous amount for me. However, this mousse truly is magic and produces miracles! I have thin, curly hair that usually frizzes up and never has volume (despite my curls). This mousse adds great volume, prevents frizz, and does so without any kind of residue--so only soft, shiny curls; no crunchy curls.</li>
