    <ol>
            <li>but again not the best quality!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>but these do a great job.</li>
            <li>They work great,  never a problem.</li>
            <li>Over all, the Satin Edge scissors seems to be a good entry level pair of eyebrow scissors that you can put in your travel bag or use at home.</li>
            <li>These eyebrow scissors are fair quality.</li>
            <li>People leave my chair with nice looking eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The scissors themselves were great, but I had to clean with rubbing alcohol before using them.</li>
            <li>this is great quality, good price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I use these every time I do my brows, the difference they make is huge!</li>
            <li>Perfect size for smaller hands.</li>
            <li>Very straightforward.</li>
            <li>and I like to do them myself, but had not found a pair of trimming scissors that were easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great simple, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>For some uses that may be fine, but for trimming my eyebrows, I&#x27;d prefer something smoother.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these scissors.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, there is a good chance that spending twice as much money, or more, on a good pair of Japanese made trimmers might be the better value in the long run.</li>
            <li>I hope these additional product details will be useful to others.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Great little pair of scissors!</li>
            <li>has some stain, doesn&#x27;t look like a brand new one even thought it comes in a unopened pack, works fine though</li>
            <li>good scissors for the money but a little sticky....</li>
            <li>Otherwise, sharp scissors that cut nicely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what grade of stainless, but most likely a lower quality stainless.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to work with and sharp.</li>
            <li>otherwise nice quality and very sharp.</li>
            <li>; I wouldn&#x27;t consider these large finger holes.</li>
            <li>Those with large fingers might have some difficulty with the finger holes.</li>
            <li>The scissors are really good and small enough to fit into my purse.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and this is the highest quality scissors for the cheapest price</li>
            <li>The scissors are made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>and they work really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thus, there is a potential for loss of control due to the extra resistance experienced when opening and closing the scissors.  </li>
            <li>it works great for the little eyebrow hairs that needed a small trimming.</li>
            <li>If you desire an effortless scissors action, then avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>The pair I received are sharp and open smoothly.</li>
            <li>The blades on these are just the right length to trim your eyebrows and have stayed sharp over the months of use.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, there is a draw-back in that it requires more force to open and close the scissors since the two scissor blades are pushing against each other and bending.</li>
            <li>These scissors are quite sharp, and they&#x27;ve been useful especially for trimming my bangs.</li>
            <li>While the product description didn&#x27;t address all of my product questions, I took a chance on this purchase based on the average ratings of the reviews, which leaned toward positive, and because of the low cost.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think they will last for a long time, but they will serve their purpose until then.</li>
            <li> The Satin Edge scissors might provide a viable cutting solution for many years.</li>
            <li> The unit I received has a small blemish near the tip.</li>
            <li> The two scissor blades curve inward toward each other and cross each other by a couple microns at the tips.</li>
            <li> I find the scissors hard to open and close and they are pretty dull.</li>
            <li> When the scissors are closed, there is a visible gap between the blades, except at the tip.</li>
            <li> I guess I only paid a few dollars for them</li>
            <li> As the scissor handles are squeezed together, the two blades rub tightly against each other at the point of contact only.</li>
            <li> However, my main complaint is that the scissors are stiff, and it requires a little bit of effort to open and close them.</li>
            <li> Listen to the other reviews on here.</li>
            <li> For eyebrow scissors, I would expect lightweight, sharp scissors.  </li>
            <li> Having the blades curve toward each other seems to make for an effective cutting edge along the entire cutting surface at the point of contact between the two blades.</li>
            <li> With this curved blade design, they can get away with having a cheaper steel and less sharp of an edge for a while, or maybe longer.</li>
            <li> Works alright, just hard to open</li>
            <li> Therefore, I paid less than $5 and no shipping charges.</li>
            <li> The finger holes are slightly oval shaped and about 3/4&amp;#34; in diameter on the narrower side of the oval opening.</li>
            <li> If it gets lost, then it is less of an impact compared to losing a top-of-the-line scissors.  </li>
            <li> They are also a bit stiff as other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what I expected</li>
            <li> I have thick, long eyebrow hairs</li>
            <li> needs WD 40 as it&#x27;s too tight.</li>
            <li> They are a little on the heavier side</li>
            <li> but I was hoping they would be a little nicer.</li>
            <li> Almost chopped off half my eyebrow!</li>
            <li> These scissors are honestly pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Long-term performance will be determined by the tensile strength of the raw material, which is undisclosed on the product packaging.</li>
            <li> veeeeru small finger holes</li>
            <li> The cutting edges of the scissors are about 1 1/4&amp;#34; long and terminates to a sharp point at the tip.</li>
            <li> They are very difficult to open and close (almost like the screw is screwed in too tightly).</li>
            <li> These were very stiff.</li>
            <li> kinda dull</li>
            <li> Dull.  </li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t close smoothly, so it&#x27;s impossible to use them on an eyebrow, for example.</li>

            <li> works well. does the job</li>
            <li> has some stain, doesn&#x27;t look like a brand new one even thought it comes in a unopened pack, works fine though</li>
            <li> These were very stiff. If I&#x27;m putting these things by my eyes, I want ease of control not the need to apply force.</li>
            <li> I use these every time I do my brows, the difference they make is huge!</li>
            <li> Great little pair of scissors!</li>
            <li> Item matches description</li>
            <li> needs WD 40 as it&#x27;s too tight. otherwise nice quality and very sharp.</li>
            <li> this is great quality, good price, and fast shipping. it works great for the little eyebrow hairs that needed a small trimming. thank you.</li>
            <li> These scissors are honestly pretty bad. Listen to the other reviews on here. They are very difficult to open and close (almost like the screw is screwed in too tightly). Almost chopped off half my eyebrow! Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> doesnt cut well. kinda dull</li>
            <li> The scissors are really good and small enough to fit into my purse. The shipping was fast and this is the highest quality scissors for the cheapest price</li>
            <li> While the product description didn&#x27;t address all of my product questions, I took a chance on this purchase based on the average ratings of the reviews, which leaned toward positive, and because of the low cost. This was an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item to my order. Therefore, I paid less than $5 and no shipping charges. I just received this item and have just started using it. Therefore, this serves as an initial review only. I hope these additional product details will be useful to others.&lt;br /&gt;  The Satin Edge Eyebrow Scissors are made in Pakistan and imported by Burmax Co., Holtsville, NY. The over-all length is almost 4&amp;#34;. The finger holes are slightly oval shaped and about 3/4&amp;#34; in diameter on the narrower side of the oval opening. The packaging states, &amp;#34;Large finger holes for control.&amp;#34; I wouldn&#x27;t consider these large finger holes. Perfect size for smaller hands. Those with large fingers might have some difficulty with the finger holes. The scissors are made of stainless steel. I don&#x27;t know what grade of stainless, but most likely a lower quality stainless. The cutting edges of the scissors are about 1 1/4&amp;#34; long and terminates to a sharp point at the tip. The unit I received has a small blemish near the tip. It looks like an &amp;#34;ink spot&amp;#34; from the process of inscribing the words, &amp;#34;Satin Edge&amp;#34; on the side of the scissor blade.  Over-all product finish seems good.&lt;br /&gt;  The two scissor blades curve inward toward each other and cross each other by a couple microns at the tips. As the scissor handles are squeezed together, the two blades rub tightly against each other at the point of contact only. This seems to effectively sheer off the hairs at that point of contact. When the scissors are closed, there is a visible gap between the blades, except at the tip. Having the blades curve toward each other seems to make for an effective cutting edge along the entire cutting surface at the point of contact between the two blades. Long-term performance will be determined by the tensile strength of the raw material, which is undisclosed on the product packaging. With this curved blade design, they can get away with having a cheaper steel and less sharp of an edge for a while, or maybe longer. On the other hand, there is a draw-back in that it requires more force to open and close the scissors since the two scissor blades are pushing against each other and bending. Thus, there is a potential for loss of control due to the extra resistance experienced when opening and closing the scissors.  If you desire an effortless scissors action, then avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;  Over all, the Satin Edge scissors seems to be a good entry level pair of eyebrow scissors that you can put in your travel bag or use at home. If it gets lost, then it is less of an impact compared to losing a top-of-the-line scissors.  The Satin Edge scissors might provide a viable cutting solution for many years. On the other hand, there is a good chance that spending twice as much money, or more, on a good pair of Japanese made trimmers might be the better value in the long run.</li>
            <li> Dull.  Would not purchase or recommend. They definitely do not cut your eyebrows!  I will stick to purchasing in the store, so that I can see what I&#x27;m buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a while now and they work really well. The pair I received are sharp and open smoothly.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these scissors. I have thick, long eyebrow hairs and I like to do them myself, but had not found a pair of trimming scissors that were easy to use. They are not all created equally! The blades on these are just the right length to trim your eyebrows and have stayed sharp over the months of use. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Great simple, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> good scissors for the money but a little sticky....they seem to do the job but again not the best quality!</li>
            <li> Very straightforward. Item is as pictured and functions properly. Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> veeeeru small finger holes</li>
            <li> These scissors are quite sharp, and they&#x27;ve been useful especially for trimming my bangs. However, my main complaint is that the scissors are stiff, and it requires a little bit of effort to open and close them. For some uses that may be fine, but for trimming my eyebrows, I&#x27;d prefer something smoother.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know a lot about eyebrow scissors but these do a great job. They are very easy to work with and sharp. I had no problem. Thanks</li>
            <li> These eyebrow scissors are fair quality. They are a little on the heavier side and I feel like they&#x27;re something you can get from the dollar store for the same quality. They are also a bit stiff as other reviewers mentioned. I don&#x27;t think they will last for a long time, but they will serve their purpose until then.</li>
            <li> Works alright, just hard to open</li>
            <li> For eyebrow scissors, I would expect lightweight, sharp scissors.  These were blunt and clunky, and I had to toss them out.</li>
            <li> The scissors themselves were great, but I had to clean with rubbing alcohol before using them. They were obviously used, and even dented. Otherwise, sharp scissors that cut nicely.</li>
            <li> These simply do not cut ... At all! The blades don&#x27;t close smoothly, so it&#x27;s impossible to use them on an eyebrow, for example.</li>
            <li> I find the scissors hard to open and close and they are pretty dull. I guess I only paid a few dollars for them so I&#x27;m not sure what I expected but I was hoping they would be a little nicer.</li>
            <li> I use these every day. They work great,  never a problem. People leave my chair with nice looking eyebrows. Thank you</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very smooth.  I am hoping that once they are used a bit that will improve.</li>
