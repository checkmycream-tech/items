            <li>Good quality, good service .</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing from a sanitary perspective....</li>
            <li>Great price, better value than others I&#x27;ve seen at the store.</li>
            <li>Nice size bath loufas, although they had a smell to them when I opened the bag.</li>
            <li>Lasts a while and suds up nicely with Dr. Bronner soap.</li>
            <li>Have held up nicely.  </li>
            <li>Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>A strong plastic smell.</li>
            <li>String is securely attached to poof.</li>
            <li>The hanging handle is a soft ribbon and that&#x27;s better than many that have scratchy nylon braid.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about them, they do the job that is asked of them.</li>
            <li>These are much bigger than I anticipated, which is good in my opinion.</li>
            <li>that 4 came in the pack for such a good price.</li>
            <li>Durable and full.  </li>
            <li>Very amusing, not very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Followup: Not all of these sponges fell apart right away.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first one after dozens of uses.  </li>
            <li>This net sponge is so much better than the ones I have bought in the stores.</li>
            <li>These are fairly large poufs.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s held together very well.</li>
            <li>They are sewn together rather than tied, and seem to hold up really well.</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>These missed punches are very well-made</li>
            <li>Cute but not worth 4.97</li>
            <li>Nice quality not large but not tiny</li>
            <li>It says these are high quality.</li>
            <li>I must recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>Instead of a sponge, you&#x27;ll suddenly be holding yards and yards of colorful plastic mesh.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very soft, though.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you expect, feels a little denser than other ones I have used which made better use of the soap/gel product.</li>
            <li>Soft and a must have in the shower.</li>
            <li>Very dense and fluffy, high quality, expect them to stand up for the 3 to 4 months I use them for!</li>
            <li>Nothing really better than any other mesh shower sponge I&#x27;ve used, maybe a little softer.</li>

            <li> Instead of a little rope, they have a ribbon.</li>
            <li> The sponge is held together by a string that is not waterproof and will come untied after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> The item was poorly manufactured and the description did not say set of 4 sponges for a one month supply purchase 24 sponges.</li>

            <li> It says these are high quality. Yes, they are. They are the good ones. Instead of a little rope, they have a ribbon. That&#x27;s about the only &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; thing I can say about these. They are a really great value. I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> Had previously bought shower sponges from that Bath place, but these are just as nice, less expensive, and I don&#x27;t have to go to the Mall to get them!</li>
            <li> Do not buy except as a prank.  The sponge is held together by a string that is not waterproof and will come untied after a few uses.  Instead of a sponge, you&#x27;ll suddenly be holding yards and yards of colorful plastic mesh.  Very amusing, not very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followup: Not all of these sponges fell apart right away.  The hanging handle is a soft ribbon and that&#x27;s better than many that have scratchy nylon braid.</li>
            <li> The sponges feel apart within 3 days of using them. This was a total rip off. The item was poorly manufactured and the description did not say set of 4 sponges for a one month supply purchase 24 sponges.</li>
            <li> Could had went to the dollar store. Cute but not worth 4.97</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I wonder if they are selling two different brands.  For me, these are extremely long lasting.  I&#x27;m still on my first one after dozens of uses.  I must recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> These are much bigger than I anticipated, which is good in my opinion. They aren&#x27;t very soft, though. I&#x27;ve used one for about two months and it&#x27;s held together very well.</li>
            <li> Nice quality not large but not tiny</li>
            <li> Do what there supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Good product with good price.</li>
            <li> This net sponge is so much better than the ones I have bought in the stores. They are sewn together rather than tied, and seem to hold up really well. They are also a heavier gauge of nylon net.</li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly. They&#x27;re great. Nothing really better than any other mesh shower sponge I&#x27;ve used, maybe a little softer. They lather great and I like that 4 came in the pack for such a good price. I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
            <li> Has plastic scent and breaks into a strip after less than 10 times of usage.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good service .</li>
            <li> Soft and a must have in the shower. You have to experience it for yourself. It lathers up well and you don&#x27;t have that scratching feel.</li>
            <li> Nice size bath loufas, although they had a smell to them when I opened the bag. A strong plastic smell.</li>
            <li> These are fairly large poufs. Nothing special about them, they do the job that is asked of them.</li>
            <li> Lasts a while and suds up nicely with Dr. Bronner soap.</li>
            <li> Very dense and fluffy, high quality, expect them to stand up for the 3 to 4 months I use them for!</li>
            <li> Are much smaller than anticipated</li>
            <li> Work well. Very durable. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you expect, feels a little denser than other ones I have used which made better use of the soap/gel product.</li>
            <li> These missed punches are very well-made</li>
            <li> Have held up nicely.  Durable and full.  Great price, better value than others I&#x27;ve seen at the store. Will be purchasing again. String is securely attached to poof.</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable.  Suds great.  Fell apart faster than the cheaper ones....  Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing from a sanitary perspective....</li>
