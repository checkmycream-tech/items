    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am willing to do a lot of things to fight the signs of aging.  I have some wrinkles creeping into my forehead as well as around my eyes.  When I saw all the great things Majestic Pure Retinol Moisturizer Cream had to offer, ) hydrates skin and helps recapture a youthful appearance, reduce wrinkles, blemishes, age spots, blotches and other signs of aging,) I figured I would give it a try.  After all, what did I have to loose, it comes with a money back guarantee.  It feels great on my skin. It&#x27;s not at all greasy.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or tight.  I have only been using this product for about a week and I already see my wrinkles diminishing!  I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.!  I have received this product at a reduced rate in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my cousin who is in her late 20s and is starting to see those fine lines more clearly. She is really happy with this cream and says those fine lines and pores are appearing finer and smaller. The stuff smells great. It goes on easily, a little goes a long way, and absorbs quickly. The cream is very nice and leaves your face feeling nice and smooth. She intends to continue using this and will probably buy more.</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOISTURIZERS THAT I HAVE EVER USED.  IT ABSORBS QUICKLY AND DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE MY FACE FEELING GREASY.  I STARTED USING THIS AROUND MY MOUTH TO START WITH.  I STARTED SEEING THE LINES LIGHTENING UP, SO NOW I USE IT ALL OVER MY FACE.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have!  I&#x27;ve used majestic pure items in the past so I knew this purchase was going to be a good one.&lt;br /&gt;This arrived in a sealed box and had no leakage from the bottle.  It&#x27;s a pump style bottle&lt;br /&gt;It took 4-5 pumps to prime my bottle.  The cream came out and it&#x27;s a white thick cream.  I applied all over my face and neck.  A little goes a very long ways.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbed into my skin very easily and fast.  I then applied myalgic and it went on smooth and with ease.  My makeup stayed on all day and had no issues with it rubbing off or separating due to the oil in the lotion&lt;br /&gt;The lotion did not leave my face greasy or oily and did not irritate my sensitive skin.  I had no breakouts from it.&lt;br /&gt;This could easily be compared to high quality products.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend everyone to try this product you will not be disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to write my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this in exchange to leave a review and I can say that I love it!!!! It&#x27;s refreshing and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Due to my current regimen, I went from oily t-zone to normal/dry and so was looking for a good moisturizer that could still pack a punch. This is a retinol cream, so it fit the bill. Using it for a few days, it works great! I have no adverse reactions and I really like having one less step I have to do since my retinol is now part of my moisturizer. It absorbs well and in the morning, my face is not shiny with oil. My dermatologist recommended a retinol and a simple moisturizer at minimum for good skin. Warning: only use this at night. Retinols make your skin sensitive to sunlight and sun damage, so this should really be used as a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;In the summer, it’s perfect! Might add a heavier moisturizer in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;*Honest review for discounted product*</li>

            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Fragrance: Lotiony, slightly herbal.&lt;br /&gt;* Feel during application: This is a very thick white cream. It feels smooth and rich going on.&lt;br /&gt;* Feel after absorption: Moisturized and soft. You can feel something there, but it&#x27;s more pleasing than annoying because it feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;* Is it best for a certain skin type?: Dry to normal skin, because this is a rich moisturizer. A tad too oily for my oily facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;* Is it tested on animals?: No indication.&lt;br /&gt;* Packaging: .5oz plastic container with pump top. Pump is easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;* Immediate cosmetic effects: Skin looks brighter, and moist.&lt;br /&gt;* Potential long-term effectiveness:* With retinol, vitamins E and B5, shea butter, and propolis, this is a good moisturizer with the positive effects of retinol. You can get formulas with far more active ingredients in one product, but if you need moisture and want to add retinol to your regimen without any other complications, this is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.</li>

            <li> I love to see that more and more health and wellness creams are going organic, or at least mostly. This one is 71% organic, which is amazing! It makes for much healthier skin in general. I have noticed since switching that the fine lines are disappearing, my skin is softer, and I generally look less tired. The cream is easy to apply, you don&#x27;t need much, so the small bottle will go a long way. Majestic pure has very high quality products and this one does not disappoint! I have already recommended it to a friend and will keep on doing so. The smell is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been developing some brown spots as of late and I wanted to check this product out to see if it would help lighten them or minimize them.  I like that this cream isn&#x27;t super runny or goopy unlike some drugstore moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I&#x27;ve had to be cautious of when I apply it due to it being crazy hot and sunny here in Atlanta right now.  Retinol increases your sensitivity to the sun so I&#x27;ve been using this cream just before I go to bed at night. It has a nice scent which is great since I&#x27;m putting it on at night, who wants to go to bed smelling weird? Not me!  In the time that I have been using it I can tell that there has been a slight improvement in my spots.  I am hopeful that with prolonged use I will see even more results.  I purchased this item at a promotional rate for review purposes, my reviews are always unbiased and fair.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I use with my PTR scrub, cleanser, toner, and sunscreen. I noticed positive results instantly. I ordered the eye serum,which is great, and I just ordered the vitamin C. I&#x27;m 41 and needed a line that focuses on aging reversal. Glad I explored this.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a great organic product that leaves your skin feeling soft. I have only used it for a few days but I have liked the results I have had. I usually use it in the morning and like that it is very light and does not leave my face oily. I use it in the morning and like that it helps my face be a clean canvas for my make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product thru a program that offers you a discount on products for you to review honestly.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Retinol Moisturizer Cream, Youth Formula, 0.5 fl. oz.  FOR REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product , sure you can try to make your own magic potion but in this product it is already blended. no mess just dab it on rub it in and off you go.  the wife has a lot of respect for this product and is very confident in their claims , it works very well</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was the one who started using this product first. The first time I tried it I immediately loved it. It has a refreshing cucumber scent and a nice texture that glides on your skin very nicely. I was surprised how well I was able to spread the little amount that came out with one pump. Ive been using this product religiously for about one week now and I notice little changes. It does a really good job with moisturizing. I will def keep using this product. Its a great buy and the price is nice too.</li>
            <li> I buy retinol cream on a regular basis. I don&#x27;t have a reaction to it. I use to use Retin A from the dermatologist. which was something I had to ease into, because it did make my skin red and peel in the beginning. I haven&#x27;t had an issue with this one. Its creamy and works nice as a moisturizer around my eyes and my neck. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent which I like. The bottle is small enough to easily fit in your pocketbook, which I like, since I also use this on my hands. Your neck, outside of your eyes and your hands are the first to show aging. Most people forget how important keeping your hands young looking is and there aren&#x27;t a lot of creams or lotions meant for that. Its nice to add a dab on the tops of your hands a few times a day DISCLAIMER: MY No Nonsense Thoughts: I could copy the description or retell you that you have already read in the description, But you&#x27;ve already read it. I will try and tell you what I see, smell, hear, what happens, and my opinion as well as I can. So it&#x27;s easier for you decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone. I have money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description. As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well. I have no connection to this seller and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I have never been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I&#x27;m rarely going to give a perfectly polished review and very often I don’t spell check or my dyslexia takes over.. But I will do my best to be honest with you.</li>
            <li> I love beauty products and i am always trying new stuff and Majestic product really amaze me! I love this moisturizing cream. I applied it at night and my skin felt rejuvenated in the next morning. When i look in the mirror it felt like i have a bottox. Lol but yea i cant compose a word to review this product. I love it and it works really good on my skin. My skin is so sensitive and i have been trying a lot of stuff. I experience waking up with pimple in the morning with other products! But this one rocks! :) Thank youuuuuu</li>
            <li> A very luxurious product.  I have used this for a few days now and it makes my skin feel so soft and I already see noticeable changes in the fine lines on my face, especially around the eyes. I am anxious to see more results after a longer period of use.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product for the feel of my skin alone, but the rest of the advantages makes this a very worthy product.  I do add sunscreen over this product (I have applied twice daily, morning and evening), because retinol makes your skin very sensitive to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a reduced price for my fair and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure is one of my favorite brands. They offer a money back guarantee &amp; offer quality products. This Retinol Moisturizer Cream is another winner. You just need a bit &amp; it feels so silky &amp; smooth &amp; so does your skin. There is no oily, greasy feel &amp; didn&#x27;t cause me any burning or redness.  It was refreshing &amp; the added moisturizer kept the Retinol from drying out my skin. I did receive this cream at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I really love retinol in facial products. It helps to gently exfoliate dead skin cells and increase cell turn over, making it an excellent choice for oily, scarred, or acne prone skin. So far this is a good choice for me. It&#x27;s a good price and is a very high quality. Great serum in my opinion!</li>
            <li> It made my skin break out. I usually think skin products are overpriced, but next time I won&#x27;t choose a brand I don&#x27;t recognize.</li>
            <li> I became obsessed with trying different beauty products available via Amazon. Not all products with good reviews are actually good.  but this one is amazing</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see results, but I do have sensitive skin and felt a little discomfort which leads me to believe it&#x27;ll work.&lt;br /&gt;Small bottle, but it&#x27;s retinol so you don&#x27;t have to use much. I did get this to do preventative maintenance as I am 28 now. I will update this review in a few weeks and let ya&#x27;ll know if I have less fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cream. Does the work.</li>
