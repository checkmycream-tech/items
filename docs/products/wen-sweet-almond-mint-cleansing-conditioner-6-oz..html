            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>This product smells great and would be great for Med.</li>
            <li>This product smells great, but it made my hair look greasy even without using it as a leave-in conditioner (and I don&#x27;t have oily hair).  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I liked the Almond Mint the best.  </li>
            <li>I experienced no issues with my scalp, hair loss, etc...</li>
            <li>This product smells great, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>This is great for your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is also great for her hair.  </li>

            <li>Great size for travel</li>
            <li>This stuff really is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>But most of the time the WEN products do a very good job.</li>
            <li>It smelled amazing and made my hair look GREAT -</li>
            <li>This would be good for shoulder length hair or shorter.  </li>
            <li>but I must say that Wen is terrifically superior.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>bottle is good for I think 5-6 washes.  </li>
            <li>I loved the way my hair felt as a cleansing cream</li>
            <li>Hair One is good, too, though....</li>
            <li>4b curly hair type, it is good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Nice smell makes ur scalp feel tingly in a good way</li>
            <li>Save your money for a good sulfate free shampoo and you will be happy you did.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a month now and love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Love the WEN product line!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it, but also it didn&#x27;t do anything amazing, as was advertised.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>It smelled ok, but that didn&#x27;t make up for the fact that it just didn&#x27;t do any good to my hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t excited about the idea of a product smelling like &amp;#34;almond mint,&amp;#34; but I ended up loving the scent, and it does a great job at removing tangles.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing, love when I style my hair</li>
            <li>excellent, my girlfriend loves this product after trying so many brands finally found something that control that rebel hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>OK, now how do we get these hair product manufacturers to take alcohol out of their ingredients as well asthe sulfate?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments about how healthy my hair looks</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Best bet is to buy from a third party or a friend who can&#x27;t get out of her contract.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, even tho&#x27;</li>
            <li>As a result, my hair styled perfectly and held its luster for several days.    </li>
            <li>I love the WEN conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Just shiny, healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>just ordered more.</li>
            <li>For now, I&#x27;m trying out the more clarifying formula Cucumber Aloe.</li>
            <li>it works lots better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results from a store-bought conditioner costing $4</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t leave that conditioned &#x27;feel&#x27; that I love for my hair to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things I enjoyed about the product:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I just use it as a conditioner, and use MANY fewer pumps than is suggested on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I tried it a couple of times and I just wasn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
            <li>I have used Wen for 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li>love the way my hair is not frizzy anymore..</li>
            <li>I do love the product but can&#x27;t see myself purchasing it to the point where I use it all the time.</li>
            <li>i may spritz some in mixed with water on the ends and it is one of the best ways to cleanse my hair......</li>
            <li>tried this, and won&#x27;t be buying any more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>This item smells great but the recommended amount of the product seems to be a bit much.</li>
            <li>My hair is lightly bleached and this shampoo works wonders!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I have more body too.</li>
            <li>(Again I love the conditioner, but the leave in and</li>
            <li>Was told this product works great, you just have to rinse it out really well.</li>
            <li>fragrance is pleasant and there is a large variety to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy routine, I don&#x27;t use styling products and my hair is shiny all the time and smooth!</li>
            <li>Now my hair won&#x27;t stay clean!</li>
            <li>It smells great all day, make your hair soft, but it just doesn&#x27;t control the frizz.  </li>
            <li>While it is NOT as good as Wen, it is far more affordable on my full-time-student budget and still provides better results than salon-level Revlon/Matrix products.  </li>
            <li>I was very worried because it smelled so good -</li>
            <li>Love the REAL WEN!!!</li>
            <li>My hair will never be perfect or easy to wash because of the lack of water pressure compared to other showers, but still it&#x27;s healthier in comparison to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>but I can easily comb through it after getting out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it just flattened it out.</li>
            <li>The hair felt fine after using each time, but because of this issue, the bottle ran out in about 6 uses.  </li>
            <li>product arrived safely and quickly.</li>
            <li>I felt it did not leave my hair frizz free.  </li>
            <li>I like the smooth look</li>
            <li>Wen keeps my frizzies smoother when I wear my hair curly, and keeps it really smooth and shiny when I use the iron.  </li>
            <li>Got this 6oz bottle 1st as I&#x27;m Amazon Prime (free 2 day ship)and</li>
            <li>My husband is happy because I&#x27;m not buying multiple bottles of shampoos and conditioners and leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li>AND BY THE WAY, I WAS PROMISED A FREE BEAUTY GIFT AND NEVER RECEIVED IT...</li>
            <li>(Tressemme moisture rich conditioner)</li>
            <li>but worth a try!</li>
            <li>My hair did not feel clean after I used it</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel clean...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe the marketing scheme that I&#x27;d see supermodel results with one use, but it did clean my hair well.</li>
            <li>I feel this is an great buy for those like myself who was in interested in the entire kit just yet.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and frizzy and this is the first time I have found a shampoo that works for me.</li>
            <li>This bottle is really small, and my hair felt incredibly sticky each time I put this product on it, unless I used a ton of product as directed by the label.  </li>
            <li>but my hair is soft, feels and smells clean, and most of all I can go TWO days between cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Right after using this product it didn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference in the shine and appearance in my hair but the very next morning it looked amazing and not greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny and easy to manage!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very straight and can get oily, so this cleansing conditioner was not the right fit for me.  </li>
            <li>I buy this product often and it is always exactly what the wife likes!</li>
            <li>so I guess it is worth it.</li>
            <li>like it leads you to believe  Cant afford it but worth the amazon price</li>
            <li>1st let me say I do not cut corners on my hair or skincare, paying the $ for quality of product is worth it there.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think my hair would feel clean enough, especially since I use a lot of styling products, but it cleans great.  </li>
            <li>I tried for 2-3 months to find the right combination of products (cleansing conditioner, styling cream, texture balm, etc.)</li>
            <li>Clever marketing isn&#x27;t it, the sound of the word WEN and ONE?  </li>
            <li>Used this for the first time after reading so many, many reviews by other folks.</li>
            <li>and it works great if you are going to wear a natural style or blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li>We have been doing this for the past two years and it has been great.  </li>
            <li>the 1st day was fine but after that, give me my regular shampoo, the cheap stuff</li>
            <li>Without being limp or oily, my hair looks very conditioned, and those styling products work great in conjunction.  </li>
            <li>(i have a lot of vary fine, curly/wavy shiny soft hair)</li>
            <li>The 6 oz size makes it really convenient for travel!  </li>
            <li>I am glad I only bought 1 instead of the package from the T.V.</li>
            <li>At first, I used as directed.</li>
            <li>Used my regualar shampoo first  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the product with the idea that client first experiemnet with it.</li>
            <li>I HAVE SHORT HAIR AND LOVE THIS SHAMPOO.  </li>
            <li>I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE ON LONG HAIR.  </li>
            <li>I refused to believe it was my precious WEN as I just used it for 45 days prior with NO issues.  </li>
            <li>She does this first thing and leaves it in while she washes - rinses and is out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying any Wen products.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are the same, alcohol and more alcohol.</li>
            <li>Wen was ok my only problem was that you had to use 20-30 pumps to get the desired results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey, however, and I&#x27;m not into the whole, &amp;#34;conditioner to replace shampoo&amp;#34; concept.  </li>
            <li>A great business strategy for WEN, but not pleasant for me to do the math on what it must have cost each time I showered.</li>
            <li>SALLY&#x27;S in Landmark Plaza and a huge beauty supply store across from Sally&#x27;s in the same strip mall, and found in each several products that are also sulfate free like WEN.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>leaves my scalp very oily and my hair has a ton of build up when I used this product.</li>
            <li>if my hair is very dirty/sweaty I think I can get it cleaner using a separate shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>i have color treated 40 vol lifted blonde hair that is wavy and sometimes frizzy..just below my shoulders...have been using sulfate free everything, with no luck.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try Wen since it claims to be more natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Immediately after rinsing, my curly hair would tangle more did not feel as soft and supple as when I used a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and reduced the amount by half and got great results.</li>
            <li>First, consistancy was different as I had to use more and didnt feel same in my hair.</li>
            <li>Holds the style well on the second day and still feels clean despite the use of styling products.</li>
            <li>I think that for someone with straight hair, this would probably be a decent product.  </li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t work too well, I&#x27;ll come back to Sweet Almond Mint because I really did see the beginning of some results.</li>
            <li>After a couple of uses, my hair was normal, but the small bottle didn&#x27;t allow for very many uses.</li>
            <li>did not go limp, is super soft and shiny and more manageable, again NOT for everyone as i see here.....</li>
            <li>I signed up from the actual website  and ordered the whole kit (love the six thirteen conditioner btw) to see if the entire product line might help.</li>
            <li>I had less frizz, more body, volume.  </li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  </li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS HIGHLY OVERRATED</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, which I&#x27;ve been using a flat hair iron on to smooth the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair oily pretty sure it is a fake the nozel isn&#x27;t like the original.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is very thick</li>
            <li>I guess you have to buy the whole line of products for this to be completely affective.</li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair and this made me very frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and so much healthier.</li>
            <li>And I finally have pretty much that youthful shine, feel and movement to my hair again.  </li>
            <li>Lightly towel dried  Blow dried with warm air    </li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use this a few times before the pump broke.</li>
            <li>My coworker mentioned this product because hers is unmanageable and I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>After 1 treatment of the new stuff from QVC</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughters super curley hair and It made her hair feel dry.</li>
            <li>but it left it feeling kind of heavy.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the best, but was sadly disappointed.  </li>
            <li>and it feels so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I love this only thing is It made my hair soft but not smooth and straight</li>
            <li>After a quick email, the seller gave me a partial discount for the mistake and said I could keep the product.</li>
            <li>We had a few problems at first and just experimented to get it to work right.  </li>
            <li>I also switch off, once in a while, with ULTA&#x27;s Ultimate PURE COLOR sulfate-free moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile my hair is not shiney, soft, light and flowey anymore, actually very unmanagable and dull.  </li>
            <li>The styling cream seems like it could be a decent product on its own, but beware of using with any other products as it will congeal and leave you with little gelatinous chunks in your hair!       </li>
            <li>Hair can be cleaned without foaming action.</li>
            <li>Remember, when you see it advertised on TV with the models, they all have had their hair styled professionally.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>I have used this WEN product once so far.</li>
            <li>But I was amazingly surprised of the results.</li>
            <li>My daughter has extremely sensitive skin and has had acne breakouts since she was 6 years old.  </li>
            <li>All ingredients looked natural.</li>
            <li>I found that if we get her hair wet and put Wen on - then wet the hair and add a bit more Wen - then work it through her hair</li>
            <li>I think I will use more as a deep conditioning product versus a everyday item.</li>
            <li>I will buy the product again for the summer months, when it is too hot to blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li>so I purchased a small bottle of the Sweet Almond Mint from Amazon - it smelled exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I ordered a larger bottle of the same sweet almond mint and noticed that the ingredients were different.</li>
            <li>I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS PRODUCT AFTER WATCHING THE INFOMERCIAL SEVERAL TIMES.</li>
            <li>Have only used it a couple of times but my hair seems to be more managable and less dry</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this product and didn&#x27;t really want to spend thar amount of money in such a little bottle.</li>
            <li>I really thought  the product would weigh my hair down, but instead it&#x27;s fuller, shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>It left my hair really heavy and never looking clean.</li>
            <li>My hair was definitely softer than before, but completely out of control.    </li>
            <li>but I had to try as I have naturally curly hair that is constantly fighting frizz.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions carefully, but after the first use, I cut back on the product.</li>
            <li>After my first use, I found that It really cleansed my hair as I have thick kinky curly hair (3B/3C/4B type).</li>
            <li>Continued use and noticed that my hair felt super soft and I was shedding less, but my hair looked extra frizzy and gradually got more limp and dull looking.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t satisfied was expensive made me loose more hair than usual</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottles did not travel well and made a large mess in my bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use as much as they say to (about half) as I don&#x27;t find it necessay.</li>
            <li>It killed me to pay so much for a bottle of WEN especially after having spent so much money over the years for different shampoos and, combination or separate, hair conditioning products</li>
            <li>but it did not clean my hair very well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product smells great and would be great for Med.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but it made my hair look greasy even without using it as a leave-in conditioner (and I don&#x27;t have oily hair).  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I liked the Almond Mint the best.  </li>
            <li> I experienced no issues with my scalp, hair loss, etc...</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> This is great for your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is also great for her hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product if you need to wash your hair 2 times a day.  </li>
            <li> Great size for travel</li>
            <li> This stuff really is amazing!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> But most of the time the WEN products do a very good job.</li>
            <li> It smelled amazing and made my hair look GREAT -</li>
            <li> This would be good for shoulder length hair or shorter.  </li>
            <li> but I must say that Wen is terrifically superior.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> bottle is good for I think 5-6 washes.  </li>
            <li> I loved the way my hair felt as a cleansing cream</li>
            <li> Hair One is good, too, though....</li>
            <li> 4b curly hair type, it is good.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Nice smell makes ur scalp feel tingly in a good way</li>
            <li> Save your money for a good sulfate free shampoo and you will be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month now and love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> Love the WEN product line!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it, but also it didn&#x27;t do anything amazing, as was advertised.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> It smelled ok, but that didn&#x27;t make up for the fact that it just didn&#x27;t do any good to my hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t excited about the idea of a product smelling like &amp;#34;almond mint,&amp;#34; but I ended up loving the scent, and it does a great job at removing tangles.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing, love when I style my hair</li>
            <li> excellent, my girlfriend loves this product after trying so many brands finally found something that control that rebel hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> OK, now how do we get these hair product manufacturers to take alcohol out of their ingredients as well asthe sulfate?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments about how healthy my hair looks</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Best bet is to buy from a third party or a friend who can&#x27;t get out of her contract.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, even tho&#x27;</li>
            <li> As a result, my hair styled perfectly and held its luster for several days.    </li>
            <li> I love the WEN conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Just shiny, healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> just ordered more.</li>
            <li> For now, I&#x27;m trying out the more clarifying formula Cucumber Aloe.</li>
            <li> it works lots better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results from a store-bought conditioner costing $4</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t leave that conditioned &#x27;feel&#x27; that I love for my hair to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things I enjoyed about the product:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I just use it as a conditioner, and use MANY fewer pumps than is suggested on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I tried it a couple of times and I just wasn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen for 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li> love the way my hair is not frizzy anymore..</li>
            <li> I do love the product but can&#x27;t see myself purchasing it to the point where I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> i may spritz some in mixed with water on the ends and it is one of the best ways to cleanse my hair......</li>
            <li> tried this, and won&#x27;t be buying any more.  </li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> This item smells great but the recommended amount of the product seems to be a bit much.</li>
            <li> My hair is lightly bleached and this shampoo works wonders!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I have more body too.</li>
            <li> (Again I love the conditioner, but the leave in and</li>
            <li> Was told this product works great, you just have to rinse it out really well.</li>
            <li> fragrance is pleasant and there is a large variety to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an easy routine, I don&#x27;t use styling products and my hair is shiny all the time and smooth!</li>
            <li> Now my hair won&#x27;t stay clean!</li>
            <li> It smells great all day, make your hair soft, but it just doesn&#x27;t control the frizz.  </li>
            <li> While it is NOT as good as Wen, it is far more affordable on my full-time-student budget and still provides better results than salon-level Revlon/Matrix products.  </li>
            <li> I was very worried because it smelled so good -</li>
            <li> Love the REAL WEN!!!</li>
            <li> My hair will never be perfect or easy to wash because of the lack of water pressure compared to other showers, but still it&#x27;s healthier in comparison to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I can easily comb through it after getting out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it just flattened it out.</li>
            <li> The hair felt fine after using each time, but because of this issue, the bottle ran out in about 6 uses.  </li>
            <li> product arrived safely and quickly.</li>
            <li> I felt it did not leave my hair frizz free.  </li>
            <li> I like the smooth look</li>
            <li> Wen keeps my frizzies smoother when I wear my hair curly, and keeps it really smooth and shiny when I use the iron.  </li>
            <li> Got this 6oz bottle 1st as I&#x27;m Amazon Prime (free 2 day ship)and</li>
            <li> My husband is happy because I&#x27;m not buying multiple bottles of shampoos and conditioners and leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> AND BY THE WAY, I WAS PROMISED A FREE BEAUTY GIFT AND NEVER RECEIVED IT...</li>
            <li> (Tressemme moisture rich conditioner)</li>
            <li> but worth a try!</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel clean after I used it</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel clean...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the marketing scheme that I&#x27;d see supermodel results with one use, but it did clean my hair well.</li>
            <li> I feel this is an great buy for those like myself who was in interested in the entire kit just yet.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and frizzy and this is the first time I have found a shampoo that works for me.</li>
            <li> This bottle is really small, and my hair felt incredibly sticky each time I put this product on it, unless I used a ton of product as directed by the label.  </li>
            <li> but my hair is soft, feels and smells clean, and most of all I can go TWO days between cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Right after using this product it didn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference in the shine and appearance in my hair but the very next morning it looked amazing and not greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny and easy to manage!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very straight and can get oily, so this cleansing conditioner was not the right fit for me.  </li>
            <li> I buy this product often and it is always exactly what the wife likes!</li>
            <li> so I guess it is worth it.</li>
            <li> like it leads you to believe  Cant afford it but worth the amazon price</li>
            <li> 1st let me say I do not cut corners on my hair or skincare, paying the $ for quality of product is worth it there.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my hair would feel clean enough, especially since I use a lot of styling products, but it cleans great.  </li>
            <li> I tried for 2-3 months to find the right combination of products (cleansing conditioner, styling cream, texture balm, etc.)</li>
            <li> Clever marketing isn&#x27;t it, the sound of the word WEN and ONE?  </li>
            <li> Used this for the first time after reading so many, many reviews by other folks.</li>
            <li> and it works great if you are going to wear a natural style or blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> We have been doing this for the past two years and it has been great.  </li>
            <li> the 1st day was fine but after that, give me my regular shampoo, the cheap stuff</li>
            <li> Without being limp or oily, my hair looks very conditioned, and those styling products work great in conjunction.  </li>
            <li> (i have a lot of vary fine, curly/wavy shiny soft hair)</li>
            <li> The 6 oz size makes it really convenient for travel!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I only bought 1 instead of the package from the T.V.</li>
            <li> At first, I used as directed.</li>
            <li> Used my regualar shampoo first  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the product with the idea that client first experiemnet with it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SHORT HAIR AND LOVE THIS SHAMPOO.  </li>
            <li> I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE ON LONG HAIR.  </li>
            <li> I refused to believe it was my precious WEN as I just used it for 45 days prior with NO issues.  </li>
            <li> She does this first thing and leaves it in while she washes - rinses and is out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time trying any Wen products.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are the same, alcohol and more alcohol.</li>
            <li> Wen was ok my only problem was that you had to use 20-30 pumps to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricey, however, and I&#x27;m not into the whole, &amp;#34;conditioner to replace shampoo&amp;#34; concept.  </li>
            <li> A great business strategy for WEN, but not pleasant for me to do the math on what it must have cost each time I showered.</li>
            <li> SALLY&#x27;S in Landmark Plaza and a huge beauty supply store across from Sally&#x27;s in the same strip mall, and found in each several products that are also sulfate free like WEN.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> leaves my scalp very oily and my hair has a ton of build up when I used this product.</li>
            <li> if my hair is very dirty/sweaty I think I can get it cleaner using a separate shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> i have color treated 40 vol lifted blonde hair that is wavy and sometimes frizzy..just below my shoulders...have been using sulfate free everything, with no luck.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try Wen since it claims to be more natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Immediately after rinsing, my curly hair would tangle more did not feel as soft and supple as when I used a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and reduced the amount by half and got great results.</li>
            <li> First, consistancy was different as I had to use more and didnt feel same in my hair.</li>
            <li> Holds the style well on the second day and still feels clean despite the use of styling products.</li>
            <li> I think that for someone with straight hair, this would probably be a decent product.  </li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t work too well, I&#x27;ll come back to Sweet Almond Mint because I really did see the beginning of some results.</li>
            <li> After a couple of uses, my hair was normal, but the small bottle didn&#x27;t allow for very many uses.</li>
            <li> did not go limp, is super soft and shiny and more manageable, again NOT for everyone as i see here.....</li>
            <li> I signed up from the actual website  and ordered the whole kit (love the six thirteen conditioner btw) to see if the entire product line might help.</li>
            <li> I had less frizz, more body, volume.  </li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS HIGHLY OVERRATED</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, which I&#x27;ve been using a flat hair iron on to smooth the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair oily pretty sure it is a fake the nozel isn&#x27;t like the original.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is very thick</li>
            <li> I guess you have to buy the whole line of products for this to be completely affective.</li>
            <li> have naturally curly hair and this made me very frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and so much healthier.</li>
            <li> And I finally have pretty much that youthful shine, feel and movement to my hair again.  </li>
            <li> Lightly towel dried  Blow dried with warm air    </li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use this a few times before the pump broke.</li>
            <li> My coworker mentioned this product because hers is unmanageable and I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> After 1 treatment of the new stuff from QVC</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters super curley hair and It made her hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> but it left it feeling kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the best, but was sadly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and it feels so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I love this only thing is It made my hair soft but not smooth and straight</li>
            <li> After a quick email, the seller gave me a partial discount for the mistake and said I could keep the product.</li>
            <li> We had a few problems at first and just experimented to get it to work right.  </li>
            <li> I also switch off, once in a while, with ULTA&#x27;s Ultimate PURE COLOR sulfate-free moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile my hair is not shiney, soft, light and flowey anymore, actually very unmanagable and dull.  </li>
            <li> The styling cream seems like it could be a decent product on its own, but beware of using with any other products as it will congeal and leave you with little gelatinous chunks in your hair!       </li>
            <li> Hair can be cleaned without foaming action.</li>
            <li> Remember, when you see it advertised on TV with the models, they all have had their hair styled professionally.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> I have used this WEN product once so far.</li>
            <li> But I was amazingly surprised of the results.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely sensitive skin and has had acne breakouts since she was 6 years old.  </li>
            <li> All ingredients looked natural.</li>
            <li> I found that if we get her hair wet and put Wen on - then wet the hair and add a bit more Wen - then work it through her hair</li>
            <li> I think I will use more as a deep conditioning product versus a everyday item.</li>
            <li> I will buy the product again for the summer months, when it is too hot to blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> so I purchased a small bottle of the Sweet Almond Mint from Amazon - it smelled exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I ordered a larger bottle of the same sweet almond mint and noticed that the ingredients were different.</li>
            <li> I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS PRODUCT AFTER WATCHING THE INFOMERCIAL SEVERAL TIMES.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a couple of times but my hair seems to be more managable and less dry</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this product and didn&#x27;t really want to spend thar amount of money in such a little bottle.</li>
            <li> I really thought  the product would weigh my hair down, but instead it&#x27;s fuller, shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> It left my hair really heavy and never looking clean.</li>
            <li> My hair was definitely softer than before, but completely out of control.    </li>
            <li> but I had to try as I have naturally curly hair that is constantly fighting frizz.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully, but after the first use, I cut back on the product.</li>
            <li> After my first use, I found that It really cleansed my hair as I have thick kinky curly hair (3B/3C/4B type).</li>
            <li> Continued use and noticed that my hair felt super soft and I was shedding less, but my hair looked extra frizzy and gradually got more limp and dull looking.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t satisfied was expensive made me loose more hair than usual</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottles did not travel well and made a large mess in my bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use as much as they say to (about half) as I don&#x27;t find it necessay.</li>
            <li> It killed me to pay so much for a bottle of WEN especially after having spent so much money over the years for different shampoos and, combination or separate, hair conditioning products</li>
            <li> but it did not clean my hair very well.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that my long thick wavy hair is actually more manageable and it&#x27;s less frizzy.</li>
            <li> but doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To start off, I have naturally curly hair that oils slightly at the scalp.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dry and not conditioned.</li>
            <li> only needed to use a single product in the shower, not a shampoo + conditioner</li>
            <li> I had been using Revlon and Matrix salon products and found that having to wash my hair less often with Wen and only purchase one item it actually came to about the same cost....  </li>
            <li> I dont know if is is because you have to use his whole product line or because of my hard water.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 30 day trial of WEN and the 6 oz bottle would have only lasted me a little over a week because of my long hair (my length is mid back)</li>
            <li> I have long, color treated, hair.  </li>
            <li> Tried other similar but wen has made a wen girl out of me</li>
            <li> I prefer to use the WEN when I am letting my hair dry curly.</li>
            <li> If you use it and blow dry your hair it seems to leave a film.</li>
            <li> I tried to let my hair air dry and used the hair dryer too.  </li>
            <li> I use 1-2 pumps of this product after I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> B0024NPAAQ TRESemme Shampoo and Conditioner for Dry or Damaged Hair</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my feel dry</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth spending $30 on a cleansing cream that won&#x27;t last so</li>
            <li> It left my hair slightly softer.  </li>
            <li> I had short hair at the time, or I would have used half the bottle in one wash.</li>
            <li> time around, I researched the different scents, and learned that the product do differ slightly.</li>
            <li> Overall my little routine is working out for me.  </li>
            <li> The directions said for extra effect, leave a little on as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and this product makes it so much fuller.</li>
            <li> I never really noticed a difference</li>
            <li> So each time I rinsed it out, following the directions to rinse for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> so when I learned that sulfate is a major hair destroying culprit I went to a few beauty supply stores in Northern VA.</li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive but it replaces shampoo and your conditioner</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference in using this product on her hair than I do when using any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I try to use very minimal and wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> will stick to the conventional moisture shampoo and moisture conditioner.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Cucumber Aloe cleanser and did try it for several days and thought it wasn&#x27;t bad; but I couldn&#x27;t stand the medicinal smell of the cleanser (almost like witchhazel or another astringent)</li>

            <li> somewhat dried out.</li>
            <li> I tried that once and once my hair dried it looked as if I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair for weeks.</li>
            <li> Looked at the ingredients on the bottle (6oz size) and noticed nothing harsh.</li>
            <li> I also use a lot less hair products when styling it and my waves are curlier then usual.</li>

            <li> So I can&#x27;t comment on how it works, because I couldn&#x27;t get past having my hair smelling like something from a medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> But obviously read this listing wrong.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> and it was very limp.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been hard to maintain if there is any moisture in the air.  </li>
            <li> to thick hair.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and the claims made of what it will do for your hair are false.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with medium to thick hair.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like Wen though, but the price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The price is outrageous; recommended use is ten times what you need; and if you sign up for regular deliveries, you will be swamped with product.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair limp and looked dirty within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t follow up with another order of Wen until a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that does not make her break out - but it was not good on her hair.  </li>
            <li> Things I disliked about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terribly expensive.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in light of the expensive cost of this product.</li>
            <li> For one thing, I needed at least 30 pumps!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;SO NOT HAPPY...</li>
            <li> SO Sorry I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my review won&#x27;t have Amazon&#x27;s &#x27;Verified Purchase&#x27; seal because, on paper, I had purchased the Tea Tree scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***Do NOT buy this product from the infomercials!!&lt;br /&gt;Their high-pressure phone sales tactics are horrible and I was charged for $210 of extra product that I DID NOT ORDER.</li>
            <li> I AM NOT IMPRESSED BY THE PRICE OR THE PRODUCT.I&#x27;LL STICK TO WHAT I&#x27;VE BEEN USING ALL ALONG, UNTIL I FIND A PRODUCT THAT REALLLY</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this shampoo at all.</li>
            <li> Wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive...</li>
            <li> I am officially giving it up as its a lot of money for a lot of mediocre products.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and did not even need the recommended amount of pumps they specify in the booklet</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this until bottle was empty and not a fan ( especially since it is so expensive)</li>
            <li> Great product but doesnt last long. Works best when used once a week with Wen six thirteen.</li>
            <li> I like that this added moisture to my hair. This would be good for shoulder length hair or shorter.  Mine is mid back length.  I have to use one third of the bottle in one use. Not economical for my lengthy hair that I&#x27;m growing out to donate.  I&#x27;m saving to use it for after I cut my hair.  My coworker mentioned this product because hers is unmanageable and I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and I think it is a terrific product.  The only complaint I have is that I have oily hair and this product tends to build up on my hair and I do need to use a clarifying shampoo once a month.  My hair is thin and this product makes it so much fuller.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it, but also it didn&#x27;t do anything amazing, as was advertised. I feel it&#x27;s over-priced for the lackluster results.</li>
            <li> It killed me to pay so much for a bottle of WEN especially after having spent so much money over the years for different shampoos and, combination or separate, hair conditioning products but I must say that Wen is terrifically superior.  Still, I can&#x27;t abide by the price so when I learned that sulfate is a major hair destroying culprit I went to a few beauty supply stores in Northern VA. I went to ULTA in Springfield, SALLY&#x27;S in Landmark Plaza and a huge beauty supply store across from Sally&#x27;s in the same strip mall, and found in each several products that are also sulfate free like WEN.  A product called ONE, a cleanser-conditioner like WEN, is a close runner up and one third the cost of WEN. Clever marketing isn&#x27;t it, the sound of the word WEN and ONE?  I&#x27;m trying to stretch WEN by mixing ONE with it.  There&#x27;s nothing like Wen though, but the price is ridiculous. I also switch off, once in a while, with ULTA&#x27;s Ultimate PURE COLOR sulfate-free moisturizing shampoo. In addition, I occasionally give my hair a castor oil or olive oil mask.  And in between such treatments I once in a while dab these oils at my hairline for a mini treatment. I think that if I could afford WEN it alone could be enough. It&#x27;s that good.  Btw, I currently use the cucumber aloe perfumed Wen and have yet to try the lavender perfumed one. Overall my little routine is working out for me.  And I finally have pretty much that youthful shine, feel and movement to my hair again.  I&#x27;m 61 and hate old-lady hair. Don&#x27;t some of these straw haired ladies just make you want to dunk their heads in mayo of something? If you haven&#x27;t tried a sulfate-free cleanser-conditioner yet keep in mind that it won&#x27;t foam. Hair can be cleaned without foaming action. Remember, sulfate is a detergent that damages and harshly strips hair. Psychologically I use to need foaming when cleaning my hair, but not anymore.   OK, now how do we get these hair product manufacturers to take alcohol out of their ingredients as well asthe sulfate?</li>
            <li> This product made my daughter&#x27;s head ITCH LIKE CRAZY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO Sorry I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t read the reviews until AFTER I got it days later. A co-worker mentioned I should try it on her and what a mistake that was!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t satisfied was expensive made me loose more hair than usual</li>
            <li> I prefer to use the WEN when I am letting my hair dry curly. If you use it and blow dry your hair it seems to leave a film. I will buy the product again for the summer months, when it is too hot to blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month now and love it! My hair is so soft and shiny and easy to manage!</li>
            <li> i refused shipment on the product, and after 1 month, i still have not received my reimbursement.  sad, terrible service.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the best, but was sadly disappointed.  If you do not wash your hair everyday, then this product is not for you.  My hair did not feel clean after I used it and it was very limp.  Remember, when you see it advertised on TV with the models, they all have had their hair styled professionally.  Save your money for a good sulfate free shampoo and you will be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I guess you have to buy the whole line of products for this to be completely affective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments about how healthy my hair looks and I have well water so that&#x27;s saying something. My hair will never be perfect or easy to wash because of the lack of water pressure compared to other showers, but still it&#x27;s healthier in comparison to shampoo and conditioner. I pair this, using it 6 days of the week (or all but one day that I wash my hair), with Suave clarifying shampoo so get out any excess buildup from the well water or if my hair gets a little too oily. It&#x27;s an easy routine, I don&#x27;t use styling products and my hair is shiny all the time and smooth!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with mixed thoughts.  I read the reviews even ones not on Amazon.com.  I felt the product didn&#x27;t work for me.  The product and not a shampoo this replaces your shampoo and conditioner.  I consider this product to be a conditioner.  I felt it did not leave my hair frizz free.  I tried to let my hair air dry and used the hair dryer too.  It left my hair slightly softer.  Keep in mind you have to leave the product in your hair for I think 3-5 min. while in the shower then comb through it then rinse it out. It is a little time consuming. I figured I would try it since it did work for some people.  Everyone&#x27;s hair type is different so someone might say it worked for them but then you try it and it doesn&#x27;t work for you.  I bought the smallest bottle I could find just in case I didn&#x27;t like it which I didn&#x27;t.  The 6 oz. bottle is good for I think 5-6 washes.  You have to pump out 20-30 pumps for one use.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  The lack of sudsing took a little getting used to but my hair is soft, feels and smells clean, and most of all I can go TWO days between cleaning.  Holds the style well on the second day and still feels clean despite the use of styling products.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 30 day trial of WEN and the 6 oz bottle would have only lasted me a little over a week because of my long hair (my length is mid back) I loved the way my hair felt as a cleansing cream but it&#x27;s not worth spending $30 on a cleansing cream that won&#x27;t last so I decided on using WEN as a leave in conditioner instead. I use 1-2 pumps of this product after I towel dry my hair and I comb it through and wait a few minutes before styling as usual. I never really noticed a difference but I have been getting a lot of compliments about how shiny and beautiful my hair is so I guess the product does work. I starting paying attention to my hair and I noticed that my long thick wavy hair is actually more manageable and it&#x27;s less frizzy. I also use a lot less hair products when styling it and my waves are curlier then usual. I keep getting compliments about my hair so I definitely think this is a keeper. I&#x27;ll continue using it as a leave in conditioner. I  still use shampoo but I try to use very minimal and wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Cucumber Aloe cleanser and did try it for several days and thought it wasn&#x27;t bad; but I couldn&#x27;t stand the medicinal smell of the cleanser (almost like witchhazel or another astringent); I decided it was from the Aloe so I purchased a small bottle of the Sweet Almond Mint from Amazon - it smelled exactly the same. So I can&#x27;t comment on how it works, because I couldn&#x27;t get past having my hair smelling like something from a medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite hair cleanser! The 6 oz size makes it really convenient for travel!  I love this product.  I never have a bad hair day anymore.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel clean... the 1st day was fine but after that, give me my regular shampoo, the cheap stuff</li>
            <li> This product smells great and would be great for Med. to thick hair. I have fine hair and it just flattened it out. I am glad I only bought 1 instead of the package from the T.V.</li>
            <li> Nice smell makes ur scalp feel tingly in a good way</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It works almost instantly to thicken and soften your hair. Unfortunately, it is marketed in highly unethical ways. The price is outrageous; recommended use is ten times what you need; and if you sign up for regular deliveries, you will be swamped with product. Best bet is to buy from a third party or a friend who can&#x27;t get out of her contract.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, which I&#x27;ve been using a flat hair iron on to smooth the frizzies.  I like the smooth look but it&#x27;s been hard to maintain if there is any moisture in the air.  Wen keeps my frizzies smoother when I wear my hair curly, and keeps it really smooth and shiny when I use the iron.  I really love this product, even tho&#x27; it took a few times to get used to no lather.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product now for about three weeks. At first, I used as directed. However, found that hair was a bit heavey. Then, I tried the following:    Used my regualar shampoo first  Used one and half pumps  Let stand for two minutes  Throughly rinsed hair  Lightly towel dried  Blow dried with warm air    As a result, my hair styled perfectly and held its luster for several days.    I would recommend the product with the idea that client first experiemnet with it.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product after watching the infomercial.  I have naturally curly hair and I&#x27;m always looking for products that will give me frizz control without weighing my hair down or making it crunchy.  This product smells great, but it made my hair look greasy even without using it as a leave-in conditioner (and I don&#x27;t have oily hair).  It also left it twice as frizzy, regardless of which products I used after washing.  My hair was definitely softer than before, but completely out of control.    The styling cream seems like it could be a decent product on its own, but beware of using with any other products as it will congeal and leave you with little gelatinous chunks in your hair!       I think that for someone with straight hair, this would probably be a decent product.  It smells great all day, make your hair soft, but it just doesn&#x27;t control the frizz.  I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love the WEN conditioner.  But obviously read this listing wrong.  I thought it was 16oz.,,,,,,,very over priced for 6oz!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.It is pretty expensive but it replaces shampoo and your conditioner so I guess it is worth it. My hair is fine and frizzy and this is the first time I have found a shampoo that works for me.I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> WOW.  What CAN&#x27;T I say about Wen products??  I loved this stuff!  It smelled amazing and made my hair look GREAT - I have long, color treated, hair.  I had been using Revlon and Matrix salon products and found that having to wash my hair less often with Wen and only purchase one item it actually came to about the same cost....  This stuff really is amazing!  I used it for about 8 months.  I liked the Almond Mint the best.  I experienced no issues with my scalp, hair loss, etc... Just shiny, healthy hair.  I had less frizz, more body, volume.  My hair looked awesome.  I was impressed.  I&#x27;ve never seen an infomercial product actually do what it said it was going to do...  I do need to add, however... I do not use Wen any longer and have since switched to Hair One - a Fiske/Sally Beauty Supply version of a cleansing cream.  While it is NOT as good as Wen, it is far more affordable on my full-time-student budget and still provides better results than salon-level Revlon/Matrix products.  If you can afford Wen - stick with it!  It&#x27;s AMAZING!  Hair One is good, too, though.... I&#x27;ve been using cleansing creams for over a year now and will never go back to a shampoo/conditioner regimen!!</li>
            <li> Love the WEN product line!  It leaves the hair healthier. It is not necessary to buy extra products like conditioners. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife loves WEN Shampoo! Great gift! I buy this product often and it is always exactly what the wife likes!</li>
            <li> I have used this WEN product once so far. It left my hair soft and full of body.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but that&#x27;s about it.  My hair is naturally very straight and can get oily, so this cleansing conditioner was not the right fit for me.  It left my hair really heavy and never looking clean.</li>
            <li> This is great for your hair.  I have curly/kinky grade and it works great if you are going to wear a natural style or blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this product and didn&#x27;t really want to spend thar amount of money in such a little bottle. But I was amazingly surprised of the results. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and my hair has changed  textures.  This product does wonderfully. Will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SHORT HAIR AND LOVE THIS SHAMPOO.  I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE ON LONG HAIR.  I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO HAS HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product. Not only is expensive but it&#x27;s different than anything else I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not a shampoo, its a cleanser and conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t foam and you work it into your roots and then through your hair. You don&#x27;t need a second conditioner either.&lt;br /&gt;My hair had become dry, brittle and flyaway,and since it&#x27;s also thin I really thought  the product would weigh my hair down, but instead it&#x27;s fuller, shiny and soft! Not only that, but I can easily comb through it after getting out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered more.</li>
            <li> I love this only thing is It made my hair soft but not smooth and straight like it leads you to believe  Cant afford it but worth the amazon price</li>
            <li> It made my hair a little softer, but also greasy and heavy. That&#x27;s not worth the trade off. It feels like I bought into the hype and wasted $30 dollars. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> product arrived safely and quickly. would buy from this buyer again. i would not have a problem buying again from this person.</li>
            <li> Everything seems the same here but the contents inside. 1st let me say I do not cut corners on my hair or skincare, paying the $ for quality of product is worth it there.  I have a short Victoria Beckham highlighted razor cut.  I flatiron everyday.  I 1st tried WEN from an infomercial and within 2 washings OMG my hair was the softest, shiney and healthiest is has ever looked, like silk.  SOLD!!  I don&#x27;t use as much as they say to (about half) as I don&#x27;t find it necessay. Anyway...my initial (12oz bottle lasted me about 45 days and went to Amazon to see if I could get it cheaper, tried this 6oz bottle cuz I wanted a travel size bottle and found best price at QVC on the 32oz bottle plus they offered 3 month pay option.  Got this 6oz bottle 1st as I&#x27;m Amazon Prime (free 2 day ship)and started on it.  First, consistancy was different as I had to use more and didnt feel same in my hair. Smelled very similar. Within 2 days I had broke out in a itchy rash on my neck, sholders, back, bum and back of legs (all the places it hits when rinsing is my guess)  I refused to believe it was my precious WEN as I just used it for 45 days prior with NO issues.  So I continued to use anyway and tried finding out if it was something else I was using.  Meanwhile my hair is not shiney, soft, light and flowey anymore, actually very unmanagable and dull.  I ran out of the 6oz bottle just as my 32oz came in...YAY! After 1 treatment of the new stuff from QVC OMGosh I have my hair back!!!!! And my rash is healing!  Amazing just how transformed my hair was with just ONE use!! Love the REAL WEN!!! My personal opinion after using this one was that this is cut product with something else added to it.  I WILL NOT buy it here again!  I will get ONLY from QVC or the actual WEN official site.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my review won&#x27;t have Amazon&#x27;s &#x27;Verified Purchase&#x27; seal because, on paper, I had purchased the Tea Tree scent. However, this one was shipped to me. After a quick email, the seller gave me a partial discount for the mistake and said I could keep the product. Anyway onto the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off, I have naturally curly hair that oils slightly at the scalp. I followed the instructions carefully, but after the first use, I cut back on the product. Thank goodness I had short hair at the time, or I would have used half the bottle in one wash. I didn&#x27;t believe the marketing scheme that I&#x27;d see supermodel results with one use, but it did clean my hair well. My curls didn&#x27;t seem to change at all, not that I had a big problem to begin with. After the bottle had been used up, the formula started to make visible improvements. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t follow up with another order of Wen until a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around, I researched the different scents, and learned that the product do differ slightly. This scent, and Pomegranate, are the basic formulas. For now, I&#x27;m trying out the more clarifying formula Cucumber Aloe. If that doesn&#x27;t work too well, I&#x27;ll come back to Sweet Almond Mint because I really did see the beginning of some results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This is such a scam, but I still fell for it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 6 months ago...on a regular basis.  Because I color my hair, I was looking for something that would extent the time of my color.  This product does the trick!  Probably will never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely sensitive skin and has had acne breakouts since she was 6 years old.  We found out that it is actually an allergic reaction to lotions, hair products, etc.  We were given shampoo by a dermatologist - that does not make her break out - but it was not good on her hair.  We tried tons of products for about 4 years. I finally decided to try Wen since it claims to be more natural.  I was very worried because it smelled so good - I thought the scent would make her break out.  It was fabulous!!!!  Since we have been using Wen she does not have break outs like before.  It is also great for her hair.  We had a few problems at first and just experimented to get it to work right.  I found that if we get her hair wet and put Wen on - then wet the hair and add a bit more Wen - then work it through her hair it works lots better.  She does this first thing and leaves it in while she washes - rinses and is out of the shower.  It is not quite 3 minutes - but it works great!    We have been doing this for the past two years and it has been great.  We love Wen!!!!!  Now if we can just find moisturizer that works as good!</li>
            <li> not worth they hype but I had to try as I have naturally curly hair that is constantly fighting frizz.  if you use the recommended \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; at each application, you&#x27;d be out of this product in 3 days.  this will probably last a week for me which is ridiculous and there is nothing life changing about it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the benefits this stuff has on my hair. I&#x27;m in love. (Wife of David ). My husband is happy because I&#x27;m not buying multiple bottles of shampoos and conditioners and leave in conditioners. This one product works for all of it.</li>
            <li> This has helped my chemo damaged hair, but I still need an anti-frizz serum after.</li>
            <li> excellent, my girlfriend loves this product after trying so many brands finally found something that control that rebel hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> This bottle is really small, and my hair felt incredibly sticky each time I put this product on it, unless I used a ton of product as directed by the label.  The hair felt fine after using each time, but because of this issue, the bottle ran out in about 6 uses.  A great business strategy for WEN, but not pleasant for me to do the math on what it must have cost each time I showered.</li>
            <li> Things I disliked about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terribly expensive. I&#x27;ve had better results from a store-bought conditioner costing $4 (Tressemme moisture rich conditioner) similar to:[[ASIN:B0024NPAAQ TRESemme Shampoo and Conditioner for Dry or Damaged Hair 2/44 oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair and this made me very frizzy. It did not work well at all as a leave-in conditioner after showering. I tried for 2-3 months to find the right combination of products (cleansing conditioner, styling cream, texture balm, etc.) but in the end I went back to Infusium [[ASIN:B0019RKS5K Infusium 23 (Frizz)ologie Leave-In Treatment, Step 3, 16 oz.]] and a bit of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The estimate of a \\&quot;30 day supply\\&quot; is a joke. I would wash my hair about every other day and it still lasted less than half the time. My hair is very thin and did not even need the recommended amount of pumps they specify in the booklet but I was though a 16oz bottle in under 14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after rinsing, my curly hair would tangle more did not feel as soft and supple as when I used a regular conditioner. It just didn&#x27;t leave that conditioned &#x27;feel&#x27; that I love for my hair to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles did not travel well and made a large mess in my bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I enjoyed about the product:&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is pleasant and there is a large variety to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;I only needed to use a single product in the shower, not a shampoo + conditioner so it was somewhat convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Do NOT buy this product from the infomercials!!&lt;br /&gt;Their high-pressure phone sales tactics are horrible and I was charged for $210 of extra product that I DID NOT ORDER.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t excited about the idea of a product smelling like &amp;#34;almond mint,&amp;#34; but I ended up loving the scent, and it does a great job at removing tangles.  It&#x27;s pretty pricey, however, and I&#x27;m not into the whole, &amp;#34;conditioner to replace shampoo&amp;#34; concept.  I just use it as a conditioner, and use MANY fewer pumps than is suggested on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters super curley hair and It made her hair feel dry. I tried it a couple of times and I just wasn&#x27;t pleased. So I tried it on my hair. It didn&#x27;t make my feel dry but it left it feeling kind of heavy. It just wasn&#x27;t for us.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen for 2 years and love it. I use the 6oz for travel and even bought one for my daughter. She has now ordered the 32oz bottle</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THE WEN KIT..I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS PRODUCT AFTER WATCHING THE INFOMERCIAL SEVERAL TIMES. THIS PRODUCT IS HIGHLY OVERRATED AT THE LEAST.I HAVE FINE,COMBINATION TYPE HAIR. I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO FIGHT THE FRIZZES I HAVE AND SOMETHING TO USE N PLACE OF MOISTURIZER,GLOSSER,ETC. AND NOT WEIGH MY HAIR DOWN..THE PRODUCTS SMELL GREAT,HOWEVER MY HAIR WAS TANGLED WHILE RINSING,AND WHILE WASHING.THE STYLING CREME MADE MY HAIR FEEL  GREASY AND WEIGHED DOWN. I AM NOT IMPRESSED BY THE PRICE OR THE PRODUCT.I&#x27;LL STICK TO WHAT I&#x27;VE BEEN USING ALL ALONG, UNTIL I FIND A PRODUCT THAT REALLLY WORKS..&lt;br /&gt;SO NOT HAPPY...OH AND BY THE WAY, I WAS PROMISED A FREE BEAUTY GIFT AND NEVER RECEIVED IT...</li>
            <li> I feel this is an great buy for those like myself who was in interested in the entire kit just yet. After my first use, I found that It really cleansed my hair as I have thick kinky curly hair (3B/3C/4B type). If you have always wanted to try, give this item a try.</li>
            <li> My daughter has messy hair. This product does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> love the way my hair is not frizzy anymore.. Tried other similar but wen has made a wen girl out of me</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, love when I style my hair I get less frizz and it feels so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this shampoo at all. I expected it to leave the hair feeling soft and conditioned and instead found it left my daughter&#x27;s hair somewhat dried out. I noticed no difference in using this product on her hair than I do when using any other shampoo. Very disappointed in light of the expensive cost of this product.</li>
            <li> leaves my scalp very oily and my hair has a ton of build up when I used this product. it doesn&#x27;t cleanse hair.</li>
            <li> Wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive...I do love the product but can&#x27;t see myself purchasing it to the point where I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Never ever again would I put this on my hair. For one thing, I needed at least 30 pumps! I was able to use this a few times before the pump broke. I used this thinking I wasn&#x27;t going to see results over night, even though that&#x27;s the claim. I was patient and continued to use it. It left my hair feeling dry and not conditioned. It smelled ok, but that didn&#x27;t make up for the fact that it just didn&#x27;t do any good to my hair. The directions said for extra effect, leave a little on as a leave in conditioner. I tried that once and once my hair dried it looked as if I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair for weeks. So each time I rinsed it out, following the directions to rinse for a few minutes. It was a waste of money and the claims made of what it will do for your hair are false.</li>
            <li> I admit I don&#x27;t use WEN products 100% of the time... if my hair is very dirty/sweaty I think I can get it cleaner using a separate shampoo and conditioner.  But most of the time the WEN products do a very good job.</li>
            <li> Product appears to perfor according to claims.  Have only used it a couple of times but my hair seems to be more managable and less dry</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying any Wen products. I have watched all of the commercial and was intrigued. But I found this product made my hair feel greasy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> i have color treated 40 vol lifted blonde hair that is wavy and sometimes frizzy..just below my shoulders...have been using sulfate free everything, with no luck. i decided to try this and it works well for me, i don&#x27;t use another conditioner!!!! i may spritz some in mixed with water on the ends and it is one of the best ways to cleanse my hair......did not go limp, is super soft and shiny and more manageable, again NOT for everyone as i see here.....but worth a try! i like the product! (btw: i tried the Loreal drugstore brand 1st to see if i could get used to this concept, while it worked, not as conditioning as Wen)</li>
            <li> tried this, and won&#x27;t be buying any more.  will stick to the conventional moisture shampoo and moisture conditioner. thank you</li>
            <li> I love this product...4b curly hair type, it is good.</li>
            <li> This item smells great but the recommended amount of the product seems to be a bit much. I have long hair and reduced the amount by half and got great results. Right after using this product it didn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference in the shine and appearance in my hair but the very next morning it looked amazing and not greasy. I think I will use more as a deep conditioning product versus a everyday item.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner performs as claimed.  I didn&#x27;t think my hair would feel clean enough, especially since I use a lot of styling products, but it cleans great.  Without being limp or oily, my hair looks very conditioned, and those styling products work great in conjunction.  I would recommend this to anyone with medium to thick hair.  My hair is lightly bleached and this shampoo works wonders!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you need to wash your hair 2 times a day.  I do not use the ammount they suggest.  Just 1 pump to wash then 1 pump to rinse.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for a month.  My hair is so soft and so much healthier. I have more body too. My husband even noticed!</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time after reading so many, many reviews by other folks. I had just colored my hair and after about a week or so of using this product, I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised but did not work as promised.  Leaves hair limp and looked dirty within a few hours.  Gave the product away and that friend had same outcome. It went in the trash.</li>
            <li> I ordered a sample bottle off of amazon to give it a try. Looked at the ingredients on the bottle (6oz size) and noticed nothing harsh. All ingredients looked natural. After a couple of uses, my hair was normal, but the small bottle didn&#x27;t allow for very many uses. I ordered a larger bottle of the same sweet almond mint and noticed that the ingredients were different. This one had alcohol. Continued use and noticed that my hair felt super soft and I was shedding less, but my hair looked extra frizzy and gradually got more limp and dull looking. (i have a lot of vary fine, curly/wavy shiny soft hair) I also noticed an increase in dandruff. If I used dawn dish soap once every couple of weeks it seemed to remove any buildup, so I kept trying. I signed up from the actual website  and ordered the whole kit (love the six thirteen conditioner btw) to see if the entire product line might help. The ingredients are the same, alcohol and more alcohol. With worsening dandruff, I couldn&#x27;t give up the shampoo for the lack of shedding it caused, so I switched to the cucumber melon formula. Cleared up the flakes, but now I&#x27;m shedding again. I am officially giving it up as its a lot of money for a lot of mediocre products. (Again I love the conditioner, but the leave in and the anti frizz creams are meh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, my mom used the pomegranate formula and started to have an increase in hair loss and split ends, which she never had before.</li>
            <li> Made my hair oily pretty sure it is a fake the nozel isn&#x27;t like the original. Now my hair won&#x27;t stay clean!</li>
            <li> It smells good and is very thick but it did not clean my hair very well. It felt greesy after I used it. I did use it several times. I dont know if is is because you have to use his whole product line or because of my hard water.</li>
            <li> Great size for travel</li>
            <li> Was told this product works great, you just have to rinse it out really well. I have never done such a thorough job washing my hair- it made it look like I haven&#x27;t washed it in a week. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Wen was ok my only problem was that you had to use 20-30 pumps to get the desired results. It just seemed like you were wasting product.</li>
