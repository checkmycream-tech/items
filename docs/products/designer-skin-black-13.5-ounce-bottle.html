            <li>i noticed i was a nice color..</li>
            <li>These two are the best if u want a tan fast.</li>
            <li>This is ABSOLUTELY the best tanning lotion out there.  </li>
            <li>, I won&#x27;t have the nice color I wanted for tomorrow&#x27;s event</li>
            <li>This lotion had a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Smelled ok and worked good</li>
            <li>Nice smell, keeps you from burning and helps with a nice even tan.  </li>
            <li>The bronzers worked nicely as well.</li>
            <li>The company answered all of my questions and were prompt and courteous.</li>
            <li>I was going on a cruise in 10 days, started tanning with this lotion and by the time I went on the cruise I had nice color.</li>
            <li>I like a good bit of color to my bronzing lotions and this one is okay</li>
            <li>My skin looks nice.</li>
            <li>lotion is good, it has a great texture and leaves my skin soft and it smells good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s new and sealed and just perfect!!!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, smells amazing, and gave me a nice bronze tan that everyone compliments</li>
            <li>Read SO many good reviews about this product and I am extremely glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and smells good, like a citrus grape fruit smell.</li>
            <li>Great tanner, my skin is a nice golden brown.</li>
            <li>I bought this product very good price fast shipping package came sealed, I have used it 3 times now</li>
            <li>This lotion smells good and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I know this is one of the most popular bronzing lotions out on the market.</li>
            <li>For those who love tingle factor the bombshell works amazing</li>
            <li>It is well worth it for the price and the great  ingredients .</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it works nicely.  </li>
            <li>It smells delicious, makes your skin feel soft, and I noticed a difference after just one session.</li>
            <li>Great price and works great will be back to buy more when the time come to reorder.</li>
            <li>gives me a quick tan and good color.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly also :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and super fast delivery was awesome!!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells awesome, is easy to apply and makes you tan super fast!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and the smell is okay, but it didn&#x27;t help to deepen my tan.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to find it on here for so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Mostly bronzes leave color on your hands and in between your fingers after applying it but not this one.</li>
            <li>They sell more also so they are not looseing money.</li>
            <li>In terms of quickening your tan, I think it does a better job than Luminary.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Also, the lotion does not have a funky smell like most bronzers do.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Designer skin has much better smelling lotions.   </li>
            <li>but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li>The reviews of the company are MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>This was ok for me.</li>
            <li>I am more of a tingle girl</li>
            <li>this one just was OK.</li>
            <li>and I get such good color with this lotion!!</li>
            <li>You cannot find a better product.</li>
            <li>Mostly because I used to work at a tanning salon and know this retails for $100.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on my color</li>
            <li>Will be ordering 2 more soon.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion for tanning.</li>
            <li>I love the refreshing (not tanning lotion like) smell of it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this potion..</li>
            <li>Worked as advertised and actually the best I have used.</li>
            <li>I have used many Designer Skin lotions and have had much better results.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this lotion isnt breath taking, but is more than tolerable.</li>
            <li>LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have had this lotion for quite a while now hoping it would eventually get better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion of all time.</li>
            <li>I love all of DS products, but I really love the color I get from using this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The 14K Gold works better.</li>
            <li>and I am purchasing a bottle to extend my tan even more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>My favorite and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many .</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>-- I LOVE designer skin as a brand</li>
            <li>but this wasn&#x27;t my favorite product of theirs.</li>
            <li>Has been the top selling tanning lotion for about 5 years now.</li>
            <li>It delivers amazing color and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li>and I love the color it is giving me</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the silicone in</li>
            <li>more of a manly smell..</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with all of the Obsession line...</li>
            <li>I need more.</li>
            <li>Smells great and was very affordable.</li>
            <li>Soooo I love this tanning lotion you barley</li>
            <li>the price is fabulous too!</li>
            <li>Ok, this product was about $35.00</li>
            <li>Smells great and gets you really bronzed.</li>
            <li>way better price then getting in a salon.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy again when my bottle runs out!:)</li>
            <li>The lotion felt ok - silky, though a bit runny.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to extend my tan even more.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t use many lotions</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this stuff</li>
            <li>the scent is ok..</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a better insta bronze-&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not terrible.</li>
            <li>I have ordered tanning lotions from amazon many times and had no issues.</li>
            <li>I waited the suggested 4 hours before showering for the best possible results and there was nothing!</li>
            <li>this feels so good for the tanning bed and does not stink like most lotions worth the buy if you use the tanning bets</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It works well and has an OK scent.</li>
            <li>Love this for tanning</li>
            <li>Much better price than at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Over all, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This lotion was good enough and It had a great after tan smell.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it  </li>
            <li>Love tanning</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>My son and daughter love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it cheaper.</li>
            <li>Instead, it sat on top of my skin and eventually flaked</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>More a a bronzer than intensifier.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I recieved this lotion a couple days before it was actually supposed to arrive which made me really happy !</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product !!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tried TONS of lotions and this is one of my favorite now.</li>
            <li>So silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Both of us love the feel of our skin and</li>
            <li>After one session, he love it.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for the overall package, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li>I will definetly be buying my product here again :)</li>
            <li>Just make sure that when you are buying tanning lotion off of amazon you are buying it from sellers that are legit.</li>
            <li>Worship Me is better.</li>
            <li>I receive many complements about my tan.</li>
            <li>I recieved the next day (today) as paid for and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!!</li>
            <li>this lotion seems to be the real thing!!!!  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Great lotion for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I am a red head with fair skin, using this lotion helps me get warm natural color which I love !!!</li>
            <li>when i first started it, i LOVED the smell of it, it smells like grapefruit or something like that.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and a good value.</li>
            <li>, I say I got a pretty dang good</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, smells great and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I would never spend $100 on a tanning lotion in a salon, so I was very happy to find this for only $35 and free shipping with my Prime membership.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and makes skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>Works great and leaves your skin feeling so soft!</li>
            <li>First time using this lotion been very pleased with it</li>
            <li>Try and Enjoy. :)</li>
            <li>i like this product because it feels so silky smooth on your skin and ITS NOT GREASY like most tanning lotions..</li>
            <li>so the bronzers in this do a great job of giving me a natural looking color.</li>
            <li>After just a week I had a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li>Really does a good job and helps me maintain my tan.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and this price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>Definitely some good tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>Originally tried the sample at the salon (their selling price was $90) and was excited to find this lotion at such a great deal on here!</li>
            <li>For the price this is an excellent buy, and the product was even shipped to my house before it was expected to arrive!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what a couple more tans will look like.</li>
            <li>so i decided to test it out for myself and i am not the person who is easily persuaded by the so called \\&quot;best\\&quot; products out there.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into the skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I tan really easy.</li>
            <li>Almost all tanning lotions are way to strong on the perfume side.</li>
            <li>Good so far!!</li>
            <li>Like the lotion it smells pretty good and got it quickly.</li>
            <li>I get dark after 3 tanning session and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li>So nice to be able to get this at a decent price.</li>
            <li>This is hands down one of the best lotions i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I ordered this lotion hoping that it would be as good as the lotion that I buy at the tanning salon, but it really isn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got color within 3 tans, but personally I think Adore and Splurge are the best for getting color fast that lasts!</li>
            <li>Black is the BEST!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Great product, gives you good color, BUT usually leaves a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>Also speeds up the tanning process tremendously!</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on super smooth and makes you twice as tan after tanning!</li>
            <li>My lotion got to me really quickly!</li>
            <li>My tan doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly!</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>There is no way I can afford to pay that much money for a lotion no matter how much I love it!</li>
            <li>and I am already noticing a huge difference in my tan and how moisturized my skin is.</li>
            <li>Light smell not over powering and no after tan stink.</li>
            <li>I use this outside and it works great.</li>
            <li>This lotion is velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and it was an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>Went on smooth, and after tanning did not leave my body slimy.</li>
            <li>Bottle arrived today, was wrapped in the cheap plastic shrink wrap you heat with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>it smelled fantastic</li>
            <li>Great product, isn&#x27;t streaky and doesn&#x27;t have a womanly smell.  </li>
            <li>it has too much alcohol in it, doesn&#x27;t leave a nice sheen on your skin.  </li>
            <li>just dont see the big draw for it or why its so overpriced..and I am an experienced tanner</li>
            <li>The seller even sent me a free sample of Grease tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>It was a light peach color with no bronzer</li>
            <li>There is a reason why these lotions are so cheap on here.</li>
            <li>I am naturally quite fair</li>
            <li>Also, instead of leaving your skin sort of orange and streaky in places (like between your fingers) like a lot of lotions with bronzers, it gives you really good natural color.</li>
            <li>Best of all I paid way less than I would have at my tanning salon!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as decribed!!</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, left my skin feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Black 20X by Designer Skin has a nice feel, smell and gave good tanning results.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and designer skin shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>This one makes your skin a lot softer and hydrated after tanning than other lotions and smells so good!</li>
            <li>Even after I still smelled fruity :) It seemed to work the first time</li>
            <li>I have achieved my golden glow in nine days!  </li>
            <li>Okay this is my first review on something like this..</li>
            <li>it in two days with amazon prime, so worth it!</li>
            <li>So i got all excited waiting for it</li>
            <li>Make sure that you rub it in very well!  </li>
            <li>Not the best smelling lotion i&#x27;ve used in the past,</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this lotion in the beds.</li>
            <li>but I remembered my mom&#x27;s friend was using this at one point and it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to order this lotion, choosing to trust the 4-5 star reviews instead of the 1 star ones.</li>
            <li>and it smelled nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>I will order this again because it is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than buying it from a tannjng salon.</li>
            <li>This product appears to be the original, not some knock off.  </li>
            <li>It went on so smooth and soaked in quickly.</li>
            <li>20X by far had the best overall customer reviews</li>
            <li>I am able to keep a nice colored tan only going onece or twice a week</li>
            <li>If the tanning salon tries to sell anything to you for that price, make sure you do your homework and spend your money wisely.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find my favorite tanning lotion on Amazon at at third of the cost in the salon.  </li>
            <li>Diverted products are many times counterfeit, contaminated, old or expired products that may not be safe to use.</li>
            <li>this is BY FAR my favorite lotion i have ever used!</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel like silk afterwards, it will not sweat off you like most other lotions, and it smells good.  </li>
            <li>I recieved this lotion yesterday and used it right away!</li>
            <li>Leaves a very nice fruity smell even after a fake bake :) I haven&#x27;t even used a quarter of it and I am getting so many compliments on my tan!</li>
            <li>One of the best lotions to get you dark Fast</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of the tropics: a fruity, lightly sweet aroma.</li>
            <li>It works just as good indoors as it does outside.</li>
            <li>Just makes me worried that the rumors of receiving a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; product could be true.  </li>
            <li>I do wonder now if I was sold a true Designer Skin product or something \\&quot;else\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li>this actually make me look good ...</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li>i HIGHLY recommend it! :)</li>
            <li>but I think this will help me achieve my color fast based on many reviews and suggestions online for this product.</li>
            <li>My husband said he couldn&#x27;t tell I had been tanning, that was the true test for this lotion.</li>
            <li>I will order from this seller again, since I had such a good experience this time.</li>
            <li>The smell is good as everyone has said but that is the only plus.</li>
            <li>Nice feeling, makes skin soft.</li>
            <li>I just got done using &amp;#34;The Phoenician&amp;#34; after looking at the rave reviews (especially for people with fair skin).</li>
            <li>No downsides really, I can&#x27;t see why so many people insist on commenting with these &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; comments.</li>
            <li>and I have to admit that the bottle looks cool.</li>
            <li>For the price, not bad.</li>
            <li>SO happy I was able to get it for dirt cheap compared to the $100 it usually goes for in the salon!</li>
            <li>product was shipped pretty quick and overall great purchase</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and the product is so soft and nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, to the point where people have pointed out to me, \\&quot;I never noticed how white you are,\\&quot; or \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>The only lotion I love more than this one is Obsidian.</li>
            <li>Honestly I was very concerned about ordering a tanning lotion from online, thanks to my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>It dosent break me out, it leaves me super silky.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin super moistured.</li>
            <li>Quick tan with out any oily residue.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to get a quick tan before my senior prom</li>
            <li>Shipped quick, responded to me quick</li>
            <li>Sometimes ordering offline makes me nervous, but this product is very consistent.</li>
            <li>but there are some others that&#x27;s great also like Dark Princess , Jwoww , Snookie .</li>
            <li>The package came as promised and came very fast!</li>
            <li>but this is great hands down</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping was about the only good thing I can say about this lotion.  </li>
            <li>it is just as stated and a great value half the price of tanning salons will order again</li>
            <li>This product is great if you want to spend less time tanning.  </li>
            <li>First off, why would someone spend money on buying the real stuff, AND THEN spend more money on a lotion to replace it with?</li>
            <li>This lotion also smells pretty good,  not that gross burnt skin smell after tanning.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is so smooth it makes my skin soo soft more so than any other lotion I have from like bath n body.</li>
            <li>Very nice dark tan</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what results I get in the higher pressure beds!</li>
            <li>but this product was exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting !</li>
            <li>but only it cost about $85.00 MORE!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!  </li>
            <li>Also so much cheaper than buying it from th stores!!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe this is the real product!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend to anyone who wants a quick tan!</li>
            <li>but the good reviews other people are leaving are soooo true.</li>
            <li>Gives a great, dark and even color!</li>
            <li>You will just waste your money on a great product.</li>
            <li>It gets you so dark also and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, it&#x27;s like a musky orange smell.</li>
            <li>It gives me a natural looking tan and not the orange tint most lotions do.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth</li>
            <li>Smells fresh.</li>
            <li>And it has to be the lotion because I bought a different kind and immediately seen a change in my color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was old or the fact that it was not sealed when I received it or what, but I won&#x27;t spend that much money for something that is just as effective as the inexpensive brands.</li>
            <li>After reading many many bad reviews and many good I decided to purchase I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it</li>
            <li>IT WAS SEALED AND FRESH.</li>
            <li>and I know I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Also, it does not get absorbed well into the skin when you apply it.</li>
            <li>, It spreads well, the bronzers are nice and very nice about not staining your hands or looking fake.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t normally tan easily,</li>
            <li>It smells great, make a your skin silky soft, helps you get a dark tan fast, and its cheap!</li>
            <li>but i know with other lotions i can feel and even see results with good lotions and this one just isn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li>my advise and make the right</li>
            <li>I should have repacked it and printed a return label right away, but being out of everything else</li>
            <li>and I spent the money looking for exceptional reviews and</li>
            <li>I have tried different lotions and Black by Designer Skin is thee best lotion ......for me!</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best feeling wise and becomes addicting because of the way it leaves your akin feeling (especially when you use the Black after tan : extender/moisturizer after using this.</li>
            <li>I have used HEMPHATIC in the past and it was great.</li>
            <li>, i would recommend this to anyone, smells great, works great, and ill definitely order again</li>
            <li>But everywhere else is a nice tan and didn&#x27;t take long to get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped within 3-4 days!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it had kind of a strange after smell..</li>
            <li>Long lasting color and good price for it!</li>
            <li>I would definitely HIGHLY recommend this beauty to anyone wanting a very deep, even brown with no orange and very quick return on tanning investment :)</li>
            <li>Mostly I was excited about how fast it got here, only took like 4 days!</li>
            <li>so I loved that Amazon had it for way less</li>
            <li>Most of the time the mark up is double than what the product is actually worth.</li>
            <li>Company was quick to respond and said it must have been a shipping error and the product is real.</li>
            <li>It smells better, but as far as my tan goes, it hasn&#x27;t made much difference.  </li>
            <li>It does not increase your tan at all, its just some good smelling lotion in a bottle that looks like Designer Skin&#x60;s Black 20x.</li>
            <li>I am even tanning more frequent and still haven&#x27;t notice any real difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with certain brands and bronzers in the past, but Designer Skin is a wonderful high-end lotion for those people that have problems with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all I am tanned and quite dark but above all this product smells great, leaves my skin so smooth, seems like it darkens it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not pleased will not buy again going back to JWOWW lotion much better and smells great</li>
            <li>I left my skin soft, glowing, and smelled pretty darn good after I got out of the bed.</li>
            <li>Got my lotion very fast-</li>
            <li>My wife the sun worshiper loved this stuff, she claim the tanning time is amazingly fast compared to other tanning products she has used.</li>
            <li>So I was in school and received an amazon gift card for doing a survey, so i got excited because i needed new tanning lotion...</li>
            <li>Not to mention this product is off the charts crazy good :))  the best Bronzer on the market and saved over half buying it off Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>If prices ever get to the same price, I would purchase some more.</li>
            <li>This exact bottle costs anywhere from $50 to $100 at a tanning salon, so</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion when it first came out</li>
            <li>After using it that first time, that was the darkest I had EVER been</li>
            <li>They inreturn  salons and etc sell the product at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my first monthly tanning package of 2014.</li>
            <li>After the first time i used it in the tanning booth, I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this tanning lotion since I first started tanning</li>
            <li>My skin felt like silk when I got out of the tanning bed, and I was noticeably darker just after the first try.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>so i know my tanning lotions :) will definitely be buying from them again.</li>
            <li>Today, I purchased another bottle at my tanning salon at a much higher price and had immediate results.  </li>
            <li>I have tried probably close to 100 different ones in the past year and this is still the best!!</li>
            <li>My order arrived exactly the time it said it would</li>
            <li>i have to say buying lotion for the first time online instead of a tanning salon</li>
            <li>I have used MANY different tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>However,  this is the only one I&#x27;ve purchased more than once.</li>
            <li>However, this is not the real product!</li>
            <li>I do think I get better results if I alternate.</li>
            <li>NOT fake as some were saying it is.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This has been one of my top favorites of all the lotions I have used, I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li>just one use i got pretty tan</li>
            <li>So I bought this first time</li>
            <li>It work ;))))</li>
            <li>This is not the real thing!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter and she tanned fast!</li>
            <li>The price is so much cheaper than in tanning salons!</li>
            <li>was better than most of the lotions I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Would recommend and not the first time I have purchased from them.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I want, and it is much more cheaper than I buy in local salon...</li>
            <li>I like the price I got on Amazon but for the tan - its not the hot shot item its been claimed to be for me.</li>
            <li>THE ONLY SELL TOP SALONS</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used it .I</li>
            <li>Tried this lotion for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have ordered this product online.</li>
            <li>I have a great dark tan and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this highly be sure to wash hands or it will leave stain was only thing</li>
            <li>It is my first product like that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, absorbs well, smells clean and gives dark color.</li>
            <li>So sad, but I should have known better!!!</li>
            <li>This lotion did not work as well for me as it does for other people, but I have seen amazing results from this lotion.  </li>
            <li>This helps boost my tan quickly and has a grapefruit scent to it, which I like much better than the scents of other tanning lotaions I have used.</li>
            <li>The lotion was delivered quickly, brand new.</li>
            <li>Overall a good basic lotion.</li>
            <li>For me, it was worth buying a high end lotion that didn&#x27;t break me out in a rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it works great!</li>
            <li>It came to me FAST, and exactly how it was advertised and described.</li>
            <li>Is because the smell could be a little better although it is not bad</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and definitely improves color after a few uses.</li>
            <li>She raved about how dark it made her, which it may have, but for me it was just a really great smelling lotion that left my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>I received my tanning lotion quick and wow</li>
            <li>In a short time, this has given me a color more like someone with some \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; blood rather than my normal, surface-y,</li>
            <li>Great product for dark tanning in a short time.</li>
            <li>Of course I would suggest rotating your lotions regardless so that your akin doesn&#x27;t get too accustomed to one particular lotion, though I would recommend this as one of the lotions that you choose to rotate between!</li>
            <li>Amazing for people looking to achieve fast dark color without tanning a lot!</li>
            <li>As good as it is, it&#x27;s hard to justify $108 for tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>even the girls at the tanning salon highly recomend this product!  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no way to really tell</li>
            <li>I tan much faster and get darker when using this lotion.</li>
            <li>This lotion did not do much at all...</li>
            <li>My lotion came SEALED in plast wrapping which I was very thankful with.</li>
            <li>and they sell the real stuff</li>
            <li>suntan lotion,&lt;br /&gt;i really can&#x27;t rate it, because i didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it.it got stolen out of my car.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li>But to my surprise it was real.</li>
            <li>Thank you soo much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>A+ fast delivery</li>
            <li>It was also much cheaper than in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt buy it in the tanning salons at the price for $110, but I would HIGHLY recommend buying this from Amazon!</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very Caucasian.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>, you are really white\\&quot; (from my doctor).</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>This lotion does have bronzers, so I noticed that I had a bit of orange streaking around my toes when I used too much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>and I know what they did look like and what they now look like much firmer.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t tan me.</li>
            <li>I tan very well</li>
            <li>If you want a tan and fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan very well at all.</li>
            <li>the real deal.</li>
            <li>It also really helps increase your tan.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;grapefruit&#x27; smell is IMO not even close to the real thing</li>
            <li>Would absolutely buy from this seller again.  </li>
            <li>I expected better results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any bronzing effect to this product.</li>
            <li>Dries Fast</li>
            <li>So much cheaper on Amazon too.</li>
            <li>I did see some color from it, but not as much as some people are saying.</li>
            <li>Really keeps my skin moisturized for as much sun as I am in.</li>
            <li>Def provided gave more color with minimal use.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference from my normal bronzer on the first use.  </li>
            <li>, it helps me from burning when I used this.&lt;br /&gt;Great value as the cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I like the way this lotion smells, which is one thing about which I am very picky.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made me much darker.</li>
            <li>Very smelly and doesn&#x27;t really do anything for your tan/bronze.</li>
            <li>But DO NOT purchase it at high cost at your salon!</li>
            <li>I visibly tanned much faster when using this lotion.</li>
            <li>I thought it was the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I had tanned much darker using a level one tanning product that I had purchased from my salon that didn&#x27;t even have a bronzer in it, then upgraded to this product and lost everything I had gained.  </li>
            <li>cause she couldn&#x27;t really afford the 100 dollars they want for it at the salon.</li>
            <li>it worked out really well for her.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment, no complication.</li>
            <li>Is a great lotion with a silicone base and nice smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth when you put it on, unlike some other lotions that leave you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>So I think I&#x27;m pretty lucky to have found the lotion for such a reasonable price here.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 57 years old!!!</li>
            <li>Just love Designer Skin Black, I saw results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It also left me more smooth than any other that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>When I received the lotion it was packaged very well,I even received it a day earlier than what I was originally told, and I cannot wait to use it.</li>
            <li>The other reason I gave it a 5 is because the smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I feel like other 21x bronzers did more.</li>
            <li>Other than that, satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>other designer skin products better...</li>
            <li>Packaging was clean and protected item from possible damage.</li>
            <li>This lotion really gives you a wonderfully dark tan, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It smells okay, not bad but not amazing.</li>
            <li>gets you super dark super fast.</li>
            <li>I love the real Designer Skin Black</li>
            <li>As far as I am aware, the product, itself, was as described and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>what can they say?They have to sell their products marked 150% higher than you can find them anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Good starter lotion, not a good plateau-breaker.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t watch my tan go down the drain in the shower</li>
            <li>The lotion arrived fast an in new condition.</li>
            <li>Will try something new very soon.</li>
            <li>20X Bronzing Body Silk Mega Magical Silicone Emulsion Black Lotion 13.5</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better than a previous Designer tanner.....</li>
            <li>but I have had better lotions for a lot less...</li>
            <li>For the price compared to the sister product ( Most tanning salons don&#x27;t carry Black any longer because manufacture has updated it &amp; improved it)</li>
            <li>Its better then what the tanning place sales it for and 20x&#x27;s less then what they sale it for.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and it has a decent smell to it</li>
            <li>I had researched this product at my local tanning salon, who had it priced more than double the amount I paid for it here on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of the designer skin \\&quot;black\\&quot; just a few days ago, and absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have been tanning on and off for about 10 years, and most recently, it&#x27;s been about a month since I switched back to the beds from self-tanners.</li>
            <li>Second favorite lotion next to Luminary.</li>
            <li>Decent buy overall shipped quickly</li>
            <li>My fair skinned son just recently started using it outdoors and he quickly went from looking sick to looking healthy.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very soft!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product and seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and the seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I am DARK! :)</li>
            <li>But when I used the bottle, I realized it was old!!</li>
            <li>Black lotion is my favorite lotion i have tried so far!</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin very soft for days after use and it doesn&#x27;t have a really loud odor like many other tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li>I really hope I did not waste my money.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft, the smell is like grapefruits, but I don&#x27;t get much color.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin sooooo soft and really enhances your tan.</li>
            <li>this bottle definitely gives you a great non orange color and tanning will appear only after a few couple tanning bed session.</li>
            <li>I use Designer Skin products frequently and this is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>The business normally buys in bulk and gets the products at a lower rate .</li>
            <li>I love designer skin lotions, they make my skin so soft and normally get me dark.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use a bronzer lotion for that reason, but thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the product was the real stuff that was sent to me or if I am just use to better stuff</li>
            <li>I tried 5 different types of tanners from Designer Skin, and I would recommend this one and Smile</li>
            <li>Anyway, I went straight to the tanning salon and compared it to the bottle they have, exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is normally sealed in plastic, over the bottle AND the cap -</li>
            <li>I contacted the actual Designer Skin company through their customer service line and was told that the product being sold through Amazon is most likely counterfeit or \\&quot;Old Stock\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love designer skin black tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>I loved it!!!I&#x27;m always trying new tanning lotions and get tired of over paying at the tanning salon for them.</li>
            <li>I also have Italian skin, so the outcome may be different for lighter skin tones, or people that don&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
            <li>A slight downfall is tanning more frequently to maintain/increase my tan.</li>
            <li>I thought it was an amazing deal, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t buy 30 dollar tanning lotion that was listed for over 100?</li>
            <li>You can definitely go out right after tanning if you&#x27;d like to.  </li>
            <li>Was mailed as promised and brand new.</li>
            <li>Having said that, it was shipped to me from within the state I live in.</li>
            <li>Came brand new</li>
            <li>I was at a standpoint in my tan and wated to try something new.</li>
            <li>I already have a subtle tan and the product smells amazing.</li>
            <li>the plastic was sliced off, probably with an xacto knife, around the bottom of the bottleneck - which normally one needs to rip prior to first use.</li>
            <li>Judging from the smell, this is a very old or heat damaged lotion, which the seller is opening and diluting.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>was new product, exact same as sold in salons for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>and ive noticed a huge difference in how dark I am.</li>
            <li>I used it last night for the first time</li>
            <li>So man compliments on my dark, smooth tan.</li>
            <li>is in the SAME EXACT bottle as sold in salons.</li>
            <li>I order a lot of things on line, but this will be the first and last time time</li>
            <li>We have had tanning salon in our past and we sure like this one.</li>
            <li>I usually NEVER get noticed for being tan</li>
            <li>it makes your skin feel really soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 4 or 5 different types and this one smells better than those other ones.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>same exact one that I would of purchased for 3x the price at salon</li>
            <li>--This is directly from the Brand&#x27;s website!</li>
            <li>It smells more like clementines than tanning lotion, so if you&#x27;re tanning right before work or something it won&#x27;t offend the delicate sensibilities of the gal in the next cube.</li>
            <li>Gives a rich, dark color without any hint of orange.</li>
            <li>I love Black and its the only thing I use.</li>
            <li>Packaging was a little flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>very good color no streaking and not too bad of an after smell at all</li>
            <li>I did a little research because I was so surprised by the cheap price tag.  </li>
            <li>I darken quickly and easily, so as far as the bronzing agent, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from other ones I used.</li>
            <li>I got sooooo dark pretty fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Above all is a great product, never have I purchased such an expensive item, orig price is 100$</li>
            <li>FYI came completely sealed.</li>
            <li>So far this product is not giving me the results I want.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a foul smell, heavy odor of cheap self tanner, does not smell like the product sold in salons.</li>
            <li>I completely fell for this scam.</li>
            <li>I dont mind going tanning before work, because it feels so soft and silky like on your skin.</li>
            <li>I used 3 packets of this from my salon, and I got so much color from it, especially on my legs which are hardest to tan!</li>
            <li>But, for the price, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been too surprised.</li>
            <li>As far as the lotion.</li>
            <li>used it but left my skin very streaky</li>
            <li>Gives natural color when used in tanning bed.</li>
            <li>But it does make skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for quite a few years now and have tried many different tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of lotions and stopped with any others when I discovered this a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>The lotion was ok, not amazing.</li>
            <li>I asked to see this same lotion at the tanning salon and put it right back</li>
            <li>the only drawback is that it will turn your hands yellow if you dont wash right after using..and even then it still does..</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference between this lotion and some other lotions I bought for a similar price.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super dark after using this, but I did notice some color.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m super dark.</li>
            <li>and this got me dark, also came quickly.</li>
            <li>the next go around, but it is decent .</li>
            <li>They are EXACTLY the same product, the same smell, same texture, and yes it was in the same exact bottle.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it was fake...</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the label was glued on CROOKED, which was my first red flag.  </li>
            <li>fast.i only use it in the high pressure beds</li>
            <li>It works fast and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have been tanning on and off for 7 years and have gone threw plenty tanning products from the most expensive to reasonably cheap, with not much difference in color</li>
            <li>I showered and exfoliated as I normally would prior to using any bronzer.</li>
            <li>product was same in picture and new.</li>
            <li>I like this lotion so much I came back for a second bottle.</li>
            <li>The bottle came wrapped in plastic and clearly was unsealed by whoever refilled it with something other than the real thing.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not very dark.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical buying lotion over the Internet, reading some reviews that they filled it with Wal-Mart lotion or whatever.</li>
            <li>however I did not see as much color as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Have only used it once, so far in just one use I see a difference in color.</li>
            <li>I got so dark so fast!  </li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty average on this product, nothing to drive home about.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see Designer Skin product priced so low.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, and there are some that state that Black 20X makes them tan very quickly.</li>
            <li>Super tan after using only a few times.</li>
            <li>Considering I got my dad&#x27;s side fair skin and not my mom&#x27;s side, my skin is mean to be pale, however with this product I only have to tan twice a week</li>
            <li>What do you mean overpriced this lotion retails for $101.00 and you bought it for 33.00 with free priority mail.  </li>
            <li>I am naturally tan but do go occasionally to keep it up, especially in the winter days.</li>
            <li>If you want a deep, dark tan really really fast... get this.!</li>
            <li>i dont know about this 20x broner stuff of how dark you get how fast..</li>
            <li>But if u want it fast and dark stick around black20x and Elusive it will get you dark fast..</li>
            <li>I love it, it gives you a dark tan in a short period of time and the tanning last much longer than with other lotions i had used in the past.  </li>
            <li>This product lasted a long time and completely changed the color of my skin.</li>
            <li>So because it was such a good deal, I almost expected to get some fake lotion.</li>
            <li>First off, I ordered it and within a few days it was in my mailbox.</li>
            <li>Still curious I read through many other reviews and learned that if I put a little dab on the back of my hand, the real thing would bronze it a shade darker than the other.  </li>
            <li>so the scent was a thumbs down ,and the price is alittle too much for my taste.</li>
            <li>I was a little disappointed, I had done research on the best indoor tanning products and this kept showing up</li>
            <li>my Black 20x lotion was Not sealed and there was no cap that determines how much comes out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this lotion, it instantly rolled off once it dried.</li>
            <li>Overall a really decent deal since your other option is pay $100 for the same product at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I tanned every day for two weeks in all high level stand up beds at my salon and did not get dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Dark as the top two Designer Skin Black products, the accelerators do wonders and are safer for your skin since you get the result with less amount of time under the UV lights.</li>
            <li>It smelled like a bad mix of chemicals and did not have the smooth and silky feel as it absorbed into the skin that I&#x27;d been promised.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Amazon is amazing.</li>
            <li> So , for this price it truly is an amazing product, if  I have to pay 100$ that would never happen.</li>
            <li> but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I already have a amazing color.</li>
            <li> AMAZING after smell.</li>

            <li> I liked the way it went on</li>

            <li> Honestly, like I&#x27;ve heard \\&quot;oh don&#x27;t buy from amazon</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it smells so good</li>

            <li> i noticed i was a nice color..</li>
            <li> These two are the best if u want a tan fast.</li>
            <li> This is ABSOLUTELY the best tanning lotion out there.  </li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t have the nice color I wanted for tomorrow&#x27;s event</li>
            <li> This lotion had a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Smelled ok and worked good</li>
            <li> Nice smell, keeps you from burning and helps with a nice even tan.  </li>
            <li> The bronzers worked nicely as well.</li>
            <li> The company answered all of my questions and were prompt and courteous.</li>
            <li> I was going on a cruise in 10 days, started tanning with this lotion and by the time I went on the cruise I had nice color.</li>
            <li> I like a good bit of color to my bronzing lotions and this one is okay</li>
            <li> My skin looks nice.</li>
            <li> lotion is good, it has a great texture and leaves my skin soft and it smells good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new and sealed and just perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, smells amazing, and gave me a nice bronze tan that everyone compliments</li>
            <li> Read SO many good reviews about this product and I am extremely glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply and smells good, like a citrus grape fruit smell.</li>
            <li> Great tanner, my skin is a nice golden brown.</li>
            <li> I bought this product very good price fast shipping package came sealed, I have used it 3 times now</li>
            <li> This lotion smells good and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I know this is one of the most popular bronzing lotions out on the market.</li>
            <li> For those who love tingle factor the bombshell works amazing</li>
            <li> It is well worth it for the price and the great  ingredients .</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it works nicely.  </li>
            <li> It smells delicious, makes your skin feel soft, and I noticed a difference after just one session.</li>
            <li> Great price and works great will be back to buy more when the time come to reorder.</li>

            <li> It goes on very smoothly also :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and super fast delivery was awesome!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome, is easy to apply and makes you tan super fast!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> and the smell is okay, but it didn&#x27;t help to deepen my tan.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great to find it on here for so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Mostly bronzes leave color on your hands and in between your fingers after applying it but not this one.</li>
            <li> They sell more also so they are not looseing money.</li>
            <li> In terms of quickening your tan, I think it does a better job than Luminary.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Also, the lotion does not have a funky smell like most bronzers do.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Designer skin has much better smelling lotions.   </li>
            <li> but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> The reviews of the company are MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> This was ok for me.</li>
            <li> I am more of a tingle girl</li>
            <li> this one just was OK.</li>
            <li> and I get such good color with this lotion!!</li>
            <li> You cannot find a better product.</li>
            <li> Mostly because I used to work at a tanning salon and know this retails for $100.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on my color</li>
            <li> Will be ordering 2 more soon.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this potion..</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised and actually the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I have used many Designer Skin lotions and have had much better results.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this lotion isnt breath taking, but is more than tolerable.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have had this lotion for quite a while now hoping it would eventually get better.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion of all time.</li>
            <li> I love all of DS products, but I really love the color I get from using this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The 14K Gold works better.</li>
            <li> and I am purchasing a bottle to extend my tan even more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> My favorite and</li>

            <li> -- I LOVE designer skin as a brand</li>
            <li> but this wasn&#x27;t my favorite product of theirs.</li>

            <li> It delivers amazing color and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li> and I love the color it is giving me</li>

            <li> more of a manly smell..</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with all of the Obsession line...</li>

            <li> Ok, this product was about $35.00</li>
            <li> Smells great and gets you really bronzed.</li>
            <li> way better price then getting in a salon.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy again when my bottle runs out!:)</li>
            <li> The lotion felt ok - silky, though a bit runny.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to extend my tan even more.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use many lotions</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff</li>
            <li> the scent is ok..</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a better insta bronze-&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not terrible.</li>
            <li> I have ordered tanning lotions from amazon many times and had no issues.</li>
            <li> I waited the suggested 4 hours before showering for the best possible results and there was nothing!</li>
            <li> this feels so good for the tanning bed and does not stink like most lotions worth the buy if you use the tanning bets</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It works well and has an OK scent.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it cheaper.</li>
            <li> Instead, it sat on top of my skin and eventually flaked</li>

            <li> Just make sure that when you are buying tanning lotion off of amazon you are buying it from sellers that are legit.</li>
            <li> Worship Me is better.</li>
            <li> I receive many complements about my tan.</li>
            <li> I recieved the next day (today) as paid for and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!!</li>
            <li> this lotion seems to be the real thing!!!!  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Great lotion for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I am a red head with fair skin, using this lotion helps me get warm natural color which I love !!!</li>
            <li> when i first started it, i LOVED the smell of it, it smells like grapefruit or something like that.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and a good value.</li>
            <li> , I say I got a pretty dang good</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, smells great and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I would never spend $100 on a tanning lotion in a salon, so I was very happy to find this for only $35 and free shipping with my Prime membership.  </li>
            <li> Great smell and makes skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Works great and leaves your skin feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> First time using this lotion been very pleased with it</li>
            <li> Try and Enjoy. :)</li>
            <li> i like this product because it feels so silky smooth on your skin and ITS NOT GREASY like most tanning lotions..</li>
            <li> so the bronzers in this do a great job of giving me a natural looking color.</li>
            <li> After just a week I had a nice golden tan.</li>
            <li> Really does a good job and helps me maintain my tan.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and this price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li> Definitely some good tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> Originally tried the sample at the salon (their selling price was $90) and was excited to find this lotion at such a great deal on here!</li>
            <li> For the price this is an excellent buy, and the product was even shipped to my house before it was expected to arrive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what a couple more tans will look like.</li>
            <li> so i decided to test it out for myself and i am not the person who is easily persuaded by the so called \\&quot;best\\&quot; products out there.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into the skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I tan really easy.</li>
            <li> Almost all tanning lotions are way to strong on the perfume side.</li>
            <li> Good so far!!</li>
            <li> Like the lotion it smells pretty good and got it quickly.</li>
            <li> I get dark after 3 tanning session and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> So nice to be able to get this at a decent price.</li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best lotions i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion hoping that it would be as good as the lotion that I buy at the tanning salon, but it really isn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got color within 3 tans, but personally I think Adore and Splurge are the best for getting color fast that lasts!</li>
            <li> Black is the BEST!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, gives you good color, BUT usually leaves a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> Also speeds up the tanning process tremendously!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on super smooth and makes you twice as tan after tanning!</li>
            <li> My lotion got to me really quickly!</li>
            <li> My tan doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly!</li>
            <li> It smells good and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> There is no way I can afford to pay that much money for a lotion no matter how much I love it!</li>
            <li> and I am already noticing a huge difference in my tan and how moisturized my skin is.</li>
            <li> Light smell not over powering and no after tan stink.</li>
            <li> I use this outside and it works great.</li>
            <li> This lotion is velvety smooth.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and it was an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Went on smooth, and after tanning did not leave my body slimy.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived today, was wrapped in the cheap plastic shrink wrap you heat with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> it smelled fantastic</li>
            <li> Great product, isn&#x27;t streaky and doesn&#x27;t have a womanly smell.  </li>
            <li> it has too much alcohol in it, doesn&#x27;t leave a nice sheen on your skin.  </li>
            <li> just dont see the big draw for it or why its so overpriced..and I am an experienced tanner</li>
            <li> The seller even sent me a free sample of Grease tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> It was a light peach color with no bronzer</li>
            <li> There is a reason why these lotions are so cheap on here.</li>
            <li> I am naturally quite fair</li>
            <li> Also, instead of leaving your skin sort of orange and streaky in places (like between your fingers) like a lot of lotions with bronzers, it gives you really good natural color.</li>
            <li> Best of all I paid way less than I would have at my tanning salon!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as decribed!!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, left my skin feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Black 20X by Designer Skin has a nice feel, smell and gave good tanning results.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and designer skin shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> This one makes your skin a lot softer and hydrated after tanning than other lotions and smells so good!</li>
            <li> Even after I still smelled fruity :) It seemed to work the first time</li>
            <li> I have achieved my golden glow in nine days!  </li>
            <li> Okay this is my first review on something like this..</li>
            <li> it in two days with amazon prime, so worth it!</li>
            <li> So i got all excited waiting for it</li>
            <li> Make sure that you rub it in very well!  </li>
            <li> Not the best smelling lotion i&#x27;ve used in the past,</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this lotion in the beds.</li>
            <li> but I remembered my mom&#x27;s friend was using this at one point and it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this lotion, choosing to trust the 4-5 star reviews instead of the 1 star ones.</li>
            <li> and it smelled nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> I will order this again because it is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than buying it from a tannjng salon.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be the original, not some knock off.  </li>
            <li> It went on so smooth and soaked in quickly.</li>
            <li> 20X by far had the best overall customer reviews</li>
            <li> I am able to keep a nice colored tan only going onece or twice a week</li>
            <li> If the tanning salon tries to sell anything to you for that price, make sure you do your homework and spend your money wisely.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find my favorite tanning lotion on Amazon at at third of the cost in the salon.  </li>
            <li> Diverted products are many times counterfeit, contaminated, old or expired products that may not be safe to use.</li>
            <li> this is BY FAR my favorite lotion i have ever used!</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel like silk afterwards, it will not sweat off you like most other lotions, and it smells good.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this lotion yesterday and used it right away!</li>
            <li> Leaves a very nice fruity smell even after a fake bake :) I haven&#x27;t even used a quarter of it and I am getting so many compliments on my tan!</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions to get you dark Fast</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of the tropics: a fruity, lightly sweet aroma.</li>
            <li> It works just as good indoors as it does outside.</li>
            <li> Just makes me worried that the rumors of receiving a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; product could be true.  </li>
            <li> I do wonder now if I was sold a true Designer Skin product or something \\&quot;else\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li> this actually make me look good ...</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li> i HIGHLY recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> but I think this will help me achieve my color fast based on many reviews and suggestions online for this product.</li>
            <li> My husband said he couldn&#x27;t tell I had been tanning, that was the true test for this lotion.</li>
            <li> I will order from this seller again, since I had such a good experience this time.</li>
            <li> The smell is good as everyone has said but that is the only plus.</li>
            <li> Nice feeling, makes skin soft.</li>
            <li> I just got done using &amp;#34;The Phoenician&amp;#34; after looking at the rave reviews (especially for people with fair skin).</li>
            <li> No downsides really, I can&#x27;t see why so many people insist on commenting with these &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; comments.</li>
            <li> and I have to admit that the bottle looks cool.</li>
            <li> For the price, not bad.</li>
            <li> SO happy I was able to get it for dirt cheap compared to the $100 it usually goes for in the salon!</li>
            <li> product was shipped pretty quick and overall great purchase</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and the product is so soft and nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, to the point where people have pointed out to me, \\&quot;I never noticed how white you are,\\&quot; or \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> The only lotion I love more than this one is Obsidian.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was very concerned about ordering a tanning lotion from online, thanks to my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> It dosent break me out, it leaves me super silky.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin super moistured.</li>
            <li> Quick tan with out any oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to get a quick tan before my senior prom</li>
            <li> Shipped quick, responded to me quick</li>
            <li> Sometimes ordering offline makes me nervous, but this product is very consistent.</li>
            <li> but there are some others that&#x27;s great also like Dark Princess , Jwoww , Snookie .</li>
            <li> The package came as promised and came very fast!</li>
            <li> but this is great hands down</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping was about the only good thing I can say about this lotion.  </li>
            <li> it is just as stated and a great value half the price of tanning salons will order again</li>
            <li> This product is great if you want to spend less time tanning.  </li>
            <li> First off, why would someone spend money on buying the real stuff, AND THEN spend more money on a lotion to replace it with?</li>
            <li> This lotion also smells pretty good,  not that gross burnt skin smell after tanning.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is so smooth it makes my skin soo soft more so than any other lotion I have from like bath n body.</li>
            <li> Very nice dark tan</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what results I get in the higher pressure beds!</li>
            <li> but this product was exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting !</li>
            <li> but only it cost about $85.00 MORE!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!  </li>
            <li> Also so much cheaper than buying it from th stores!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe this is the real product!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend to anyone who wants a quick tan!</li>
            <li> but the good reviews other people are leaving are soooo true.</li>
            <li> Gives a great, dark and even color!</li>
            <li> You will just waste your money on a great product.</li>
            <li> It gets you so dark also and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, it&#x27;s like a musky orange smell.</li>
            <li> It gives me a natural looking tan and not the orange tint most lotions do.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth</li>
            <li> Smells fresh.</li>
            <li> And it has to be the lotion because I bought a different kind and immediately seen a change in my color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was old or the fact that it was not sealed when I received it or what, but I won&#x27;t spend that much money for something that is just as effective as the inexpensive brands.</li>
            <li> After reading many many bad reviews and many good I decided to purchase I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it</li>
            <li> IT WAS SEALED AND FRESH.</li>
            <li> and I know I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Also, it does not get absorbed well into the skin when you apply it.</li>
            <li> , It spreads well, the bronzers are nice and very nice about not staining your hands or looking fake.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t normally tan easily,</li>
            <li> It smells great, make a your skin silky soft, helps you get a dark tan fast, and its cheap!</li>
            <li> but i know with other lotions i can feel and even see results with good lotions and this one just isn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li> my advise and make the right</li>
            <li> I should have repacked it and printed a return label right away, but being out of everything else</li>
            <li> and I spent the money looking for exceptional reviews and</li>
            <li> I have tried different lotions and Black by Designer Skin is thee best lotion ......for me!</li>
            <li> It is hands down the best feeling wise and becomes addicting because of the way it leaves your akin feeling (especially when you use the Black after tan : extender/moisturizer after using this.</li>
            <li> I have used HEMPHATIC in the past and it was great.</li>
            <li> , i would recommend this to anyone, smells great, works great, and ill definitely order again</li>
            <li> But everywhere else is a nice tan and didn&#x27;t take long to get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped within 3-4 days!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it had kind of a strange after smell..</li>
            <li> Long lasting color and good price for it!</li>
            <li> I would definitely HIGHLY recommend this beauty to anyone wanting a very deep, even brown with no orange and very quick return on tanning investment :)</li>
            <li> Mostly I was excited about how fast it got here, only took like 4 days!</li>
            <li> so I loved that Amazon had it for way less</li>
            <li> Most of the time the mark up is double than what the product is actually worth.</li>
            <li> Company was quick to respond and said it must have been a shipping error and the product is real.</li>
            <li> It smells better, but as far as my tan goes, it hasn&#x27;t made much difference.  </li>
            <li> It does not increase your tan at all, its just some good smelling lotion in a bottle that looks like Designer Skin&#x60;s Black 20x.</li>
            <li> I am even tanning more frequent and still haven&#x27;t notice any real difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with certain brands and bronzers in the past, but Designer Skin is a wonderful high-end lotion for those people that have problems with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all I am tanned and quite dark but above all this product smells great, leaves my skin so smooth, seems like it darkens it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not pleased will not buy again going back to JWOWW lotion much better and smells great</li>
            <li> I left my skin soft, glowing, and smelled pretty darn good after I got out of the bed.</li>
            <li> Got my lotion very fast-</li>
            <li> My wife the sun worshiper loved this stuff, she claim the tanning time is amazingly fast compared to other tanning products she has used.</li>
            <li> So I was in school and received an amazon gift card for doing a survey, so i got excited because i needed new tanning lotion...</li>
            <li> Not to mention this product is off the charts crazy good :))  the best Bronzer on the market and saved over half buying it off Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> If prices ever get to the same price, I would purchase some more.</li>
            <li> This exact bottle costs anywhere from $50 to $100 at a tanning salon, so</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion when it first came out</li>
            <li> After using it that first time, that was the darkest I had EVER been</li>
            <li> They inreturn  salons and etc sell the product at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my first monthly tanning package of 2014.</li>
            <li> After the first time i used it in the tanning booth, I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tanning lotion since I first started tanning</li>
            <li> My skin felt like silk when I got out of the tanning bed, and I was noticeably darker just after the first try.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!  </li>
            <li> so i know my tanning lotions :) will definitely be buying from them again.</li>
            <li> Today, I purchased another bottle at my tanning salon at a much higher price and had immediate results.  </li>
            <li> I have tried probably close to 100 different ones in the past year and this is still the best!!</li>
            <li> My order arrived exactly the time it said it would</li>
            <li> i have to say buying lotion for the first time online instead of a tanning salon</li>
            <li> I have used MANY different tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> However,  this is the only one I&#x27;ve purchased more than once.</li>
            <li> However, this is not the real product!</li>
            <li> I do think I get better results if I alternate.</li>
            <li> NOT fake as some were saying it is.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my top favorites of all the lotions I have used, I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> just one use i got pretty tan</li>
            <li> So I bought this first time</li>
            <li> It work ;))))</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she tanned fast!</li>
            <li> The price is so much cheaper than in tanning salons!</li>
            <li> was better than most of the lotions I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Would recommend and not the first time I have purchased from them.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I want, and it is much more cheaper than I buy in local salon...</li>
            <li> I like the price I got on Amazon but for the tan - its not the hot shot item its been claimed to be for me.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY SELL TOP SALONS</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it .I</li>
            <li> Tried this lotion for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ordered this product online.</li>
            <li> I have a great dark tan and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this highly be sure to wash hands or it will leave stain was only thing</li>
            <li> It is my first product like that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth, absorbs well, smells clean and gives dark color.</li>
            <li> So sad, but I should have known better!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion did not work as well for me as it does for other people, but I have seen amazing results from this lotion.  </li>
            <li> This helps boost my tan quickly and has a grapefruit scent to it, which I like much better than the scents of other tanning lotaions I have used.</li>
            <li> The lotion was delivered quickly, brand new.</li>
            <li> Overall a good basic lotion.</li>
            <li> For me, it was worth buying a high end lotion that didn&#x27;t break me out in a rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it works great!</li>
            <li> It came to me FAST, and exactly how it was advertised and described.</li>
            <li> Is because the smell could be a little better although it is not bad</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and definitely improves color after a few uses.</li>
            <li> She raved about how dark it made her, which it may have, but for me it was just a really great smelling lotion that left my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> I received my tanning lotion quick and wow</li>
            <li> In a short time, this has given me a color more like someone with some \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; blood rather than my normal, surface-y,</li>
            <li> Great product for dark tanning in a short time.</li>
            <li> Of course I would suggest rotating your lotions regardless so that your akin doesn&#x27;t get too accustomed to one particular lotion, though I would recommend this as one of the lotions that you choose to rotate between!</li>
            <li> Amazing for people looking to achieve fast dark color without tanning a lot!</li>
            <li> As good as it is, it&#x27;s hard to justify $108 for tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> even the girls at the tanning salon highly recomend this product!  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no way to really tell</li>
            <li> I tan much faster and get darker when using this lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion did not do much at all...</li>
            <li> My lotion came SEALED in plast wrapping which I was very thankful with.</li>
            <li> and they sell the real stuff</li>
            <li> suntan lotion,&lt;br /&gt;i really can&#x27;t rate it, because i didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it.it got stolen out of my car.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> But to my surprise it was real.</li>
            <li> Thank you soo much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> A+ fast delivery</li>
            <li> It was also much cheaper than in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt buy it in the tanning salons at the price for $110, but I would HIGHLY recommend buying this from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very Caucasian.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> , you are really white\\&quot; (from my doctor).</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> This lotion does have bronzers, so I noticed that I had a bit of orange streaking around my toes when I used too much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> and I know what they did look like and what they now look like much firmer.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t tan me.</li>
            <li> I tan very well</li>
            <li> If you want a tan and fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan very well at all.</li>
            <li> the real deal.</li>
            <li> It also really helps increase your tan.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;grapefruit&#x27; smell is IMO not even close to the real thing</li>
            <li> Would absolutely buy from this seller again.  </li>
            <li> I expected better results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any bronzing effect to this product.</li>
            <li> Dries Fast</li>
            <li> So much cheaper on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> I did see some color from it, but not as much as some people are saying.</li>
            <li> Really keeps my skin moisturized for as much sun as I am in.</li>
            <li> Def provided gave more color with minimal use.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference from my normal bronzer on the first use.  </li>
            <li> , it helps me from burning when I used this.&lt;br /&gt;Great value as the cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I like the way this lotion smells, which is one thing about which I am very picky.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made me much darker.</li>
            <li> Very smelly and doesn&#x27;t really do anything for your tan/bronze.</li>
            <li> But DO NOT purchase it at high cost at your salon!</li>
            <li> I visibly tanned much faster when using this lotion.</li>
            <li> I thought it was the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I had tanned much darker using a level one tanning product that I had purchased from my salon that didn&#x27;t even have a bronzer in it, then upgraded to this product and lost everything I had gained.  </li>
            <li> cause she couldn&#x27;t really afford the 100 dollars they want for it at the salon.</li>
            <li> it worked out really well for her.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, no complication.</li>
            <li> Is a great lotion with a silicone base and nice smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth when you put it on, unlike some other lotions that leave you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> So I think I&#x27;m pretty lucky to have found the lotion for such a reasonable price here.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 57 years old!!!</li>
            <li> Just love Designer Skin Black, I saw results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It also left me more smooth than any other that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> When I received the lotion it was packaged very well,I even received it a day earlier than what I was originally told, and I cannot wait to use it.</li>
            <li> The other reason I gave it a 5 is because the smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I feel like other 21x bronzers did more.</li>
            <li> Other than that, satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> other designer skin products better...</li>
            <li> Packaging was clean and protected item from possible damage.</li>
            <li> This lotion really gives you a wonderfully dark tan, and I love it.</li>
            <li> It smells okay, not bad but not amazing.</li>
            <li> gets you super dark super fast.</li>
            <li> I love the real Designer Skin Black</li>
            <li> As far as I am aware, the product, itself, was as described and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> what can they say?They have to sell their products marked 150% higher than you can find them anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Good starter lotion, not a good plateau-breaker.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t watch my tan go down the drain in the shower</li>
            <li> The lotion arrived fast an in new condition.</li>
            <li> Will try something new very soon.</li>
            <li> 20X Bronzing Body Silk Mega Magical Silicone Emulsion Black Lotion 13.5</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better than a previous Designer tanner.....</li>
            <li> but I have had better lotions for a lot less...</li>
            <li> For the price compared to the sister product ( Most tanning salons don&#x27;t carry Black any longer because manufacture has updated it &amp; improved it)</li>
            <li> Its better then what the tanning place sales it for and 20x&#x27;s less then what they sale it for.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and it has a decent smell to it</li>
            <li> I had researched this product at my local tanning salon, who had it priced more than double the amount I paid for it here on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of the designer skin \\&quot;black\\&quot; just a few days ago, and absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning on and off for about 10 years, and most recently, it&#x27;s been about a month since I switched back to the beds from self-tanners.</li>
            <li> Second favorite lotion next to Luminary.</li>
            <li> Decent buy overall shipped quickly</li>
            <li> My fair skinned son just recently started using it outdoors and he quickly went from looking sick to looking healthy.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very soft!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product and seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and the seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I am DARK! :)</li>
            <li> But when I used the bottle, I realized it was old!!</li>
            <li> Black lotion is my favorite lotion i have tried so far!</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin very soft for days after use and it doesn&#x27;t have a really loud odor like many other tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li> I really hope I did not waste my money.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft, the smell is like grapefruits, but I don&#x27;t get much color.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin sooooo soft and really enhances your tan.</li>
            <li> this bottle definitely gives you a great non orange color and tanning will appear only after a few couple tanning bed session.</li>
            <li> I use Designer Skin products frequently and this is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> The business normally buys in bulk and gets the products at a lower rate .</li>
            <li> I love designer skin lotions, they make my skin so soft and normally get me dark.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a bronzer lotion for that reason, but thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product was the real stuff that was sent to me or if I am just use to better stuff</li>
            <li> I tried 5 different types of tanners from Designer Skin, and I would recommend this one and Smile</li>
            <li> Anyway, I went straight to the tanning salon and compared it to the bottle they have, exactly the same.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is normally sealed in plastic, over the bottle AND the cap -</li>
            <li> I contacted the actual Designer Skin company through their customer service line and was told that the product being sold through Amazon is most likely counterfeit or \\&quot;Old Stock\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love designer skin black tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> I loved it!!!I&#x27;m always trying new tanning lotions and get tired of over paying at the tanning salon for them.</li>
            <li> I also have Italian skin, so the outcome may be different for lighter skin tones, or people that don&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
            <li> A slight downfall is tanning more frequently to maintain/increase my tan.</li>
            <li> I thought it was an amazing deal, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t buy 30 dollar tanning lotion that was listed for over 100?</li>
            <li> You can definitely go out right after tanning if you&#x27;d like to.  </li>
            <li> Was mailed as promised and brand new.</li>
            <li> Having said that, it was shipped to me from within the state I live in.</li>
            <li> Came brand new</li>
            <li> I was at a standpoint in my tan and wated to try something new.</li>
            <li> I already have a subtle tan and the product smells amazing.</li>
            <li> the plastic was sliced off, probably with an xacto knife, around the bottom of the bottleneck - which normally one needs to rip prior to first use.</li>
            <li> Judging from the smell, this is a very old or heat damaged lotion, which the seller is opening and diluting.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> was new product, exact same as sold in salons for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> and ive noticed a huge difference in how dark I am.</li>
            <li> I used it last night for the first time</li>
            <li> So man compliments on my dark, smooth tan.</li>
            <li> is in the SAME EXACT bottle as sold in salons.</li>
            <li> I order a lot of things on line, but this will be the first and last time time</li>
            <li> We have had tanning salon in our past and we sure like this one.</li>
            <li> I usually NEVER get noticed for being tan</li>
            <li> it makes your skin feel really soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 or 5 different types and this one smells better than those other ones.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> same exact one that I would of purchased for 3x the price at salon</li>
            <li> --This is directly from the Brand&#x27;s website!</li>
            <li> It smells more like clementines than tanning lotion, so if you&#x27;re tanning right before work or something it won&#x27;t offend the delicate sensibilities of the gal in the next cube.</li>
            <li> Gives a rich, dark color without any hint of orange.</li>
            <li> I love Black and its the only thing I use.</li>
            <li> Packaging was a little flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> very good color no streaking and not too bad of an after smell at all</li>
            <li> I did a little research because I was so surprised by the cheap price tag.  </li>
            <li> I darken quickly and easily, so as far as the bronzing agent, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from other ones I used.</li>
            <li> I got sooooo dark pretty fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Above all is a great product, never have I purchased such an expensive item, orig price is 100$</li>
            <li> FYI came completely sealed.</li>
            <li> So far this product is not giving me the results I want.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a foul smell, heavy odor of cheap self tanner, does not smell like the product sold in salons.</li>
            <li> I completely fell for this scam.</li>
            <li> I dont mind going tanning before work, because it feels so soft and silky like on your skin.</li>
            <li> I used 3 packets of this from my salon, and I got so much color from it, especially on my legs which are hardest to tan!</li>
            <li> But, for the price, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been too surprised.</li>
            <li> As far as the lotion.</li>
            <li> used it but left my skin very streaky</li>
            <li> Gives natural color when used in tanning bed.</li>
            <li> But it does make skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for quite a few years now and have tried many different tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of lotions and stopped with any others when I discovered this a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> The lotion was ok, not amazing.</li>
            <li> I asked to see this same lotion at the tanning salon and put it right back</li>
            <li> the only drawback is that it will turn your hands yellow if you dont wash right after using..and even then it still does..</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference between this lotion and some other lotions I bought for a similar price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super dark after using this, but I did notice some color.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m super dark.</li>
            <li> and this got me dark, also came quickly.</li>
            <li> the next go around, but it is decent .</li>
            <li> They are EXACTLY the same product, the same smell, same texture, and yes it was in the same exact bottle.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it was fake...</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the label was glued on CROOKED, which was my first red flag.  </li>
            <li> fast.i only use it in the high pressure beds</li>
            <li> It works fast and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning on and off for 7 years and have gone threw plenty tanning products from the most expensive to reasonably cheap, with not much difference in color</li>
            <li> I showered and exfoliated as I normally would prior to using any bronzer.</li>
            <li> product was same in picture and new.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion so much I came back for a second bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottle came wrapped in plastic and clearly was unsealed by whoever refilled it with something other than the real thing.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very dark.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical buying lotion over the Internet, reading some reviews that they filled it with Wal-Mart lotion or whatever.</li>
            <li> however I did not see as much color as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Have only used it once, so far in just one use I see a difference in color.</li>
            <li> I got so dark so fast!  </li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty average on this product, nothing to drive home about.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see Designer Skin product priced so low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, and there are some that state that Black 20X makes them tan very quickly.</li>
            <li> Super tan after using only a few times.</li>
            <li> Considering I got my dad&#x27;s side fair skin and not my mom&#x27;s side, my skin is mean to be pale, however with this product I only have to tan twice a week</li>
            <li> What do you mean overpriced this lotion retails for $101.00 and you bought it for 33.00 with free priority mail.  </li>
            <li> I am naturally tan but do go occasionally to keep it up, especially in the winter days.</li>
            <li> If you want a deep, dark tan really really fast... get this.!</li>
            <li> i dont know about this 20x broner stuff of how dark you get how fast..</li>
            <li> But if u want it fast and dark stick around black20x and Elusive it will get you dark fast..</li>
            <li> I love it, it gives you a dark tan in a short period of time and the tanning last much longer than with other lotions i had used in the past.  </li>
            <li> This product lasted a long time and completely changed the color of my skin.</li>
            <li> So because it was such a good deal, I almost expected to get some fake lotion.</li>
            <li> First off, I ordered it and within a few days it was in my mailbox.</li>
            <li> Still curious I read through many other reviews and learned that if I put a little dab on the back of my hand, the real thing would bronze it a shade darker than the other.  </li>
            <li> so the scent was a thumbs down ,and the price is alittle too much for my taste.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed, I had done research on the best indoor tanning products and this kept showing up</li>
            <li> my Black 20x lotion was Not sealed and there was no cap that determines how much comes out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this lotion, it instantly rolled off once it dried.</li>
            <li> Overall a really decent deal since your other option is pay $100 for the same product at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I tanned every day for two weeks in all high level stand up beds at my salon and did not get dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Dark as the top two Designer Skin Black products, the accelerators do wonders and are safer for your skin since you get the result with less amount of time under the UV lights.</li>
            <li> It smelled like a bad mix of chemicals and did not have the smooth and silky feel as it absorbed into the skin that I&#x27;d been promised.  </li>
            <li> it was sent in like a sealed SOFT plastic (like a plastic bag not a hard plastic case like it usually comes in)..</li>
            <li> (feel free to click on my name and read my other reviews) and I always read the negative reviews before buying anything.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because it was so cheap</li>
            <li> However, the tan is a little different shade than my normal skin tone.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this lotion bur i have used it twice now seeing as I dont tan much</li>
            <li> Black 20x gives the user a very good bronze base and also allows the user a maximum tan.  </li>
            <li> It was brand new and not full price.</li>
            <li> I have used so many lotions in the past and the ones I have used have gotten me a little dark</li>
            <li> Alittle goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> To be honest I was very skeptical of this product.</li>
            <li> I had a light base tan to begin with and this lotion really gave it a boost!!</li>
            <li> I got very dark and it leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have previously been using an apparent lower grade lotion purchased at my local salon.</li>
            <li> I usually shower right after tanning because of the smell, didn&#x27;t have to after using Black.</li>
            <li> I spent $35 (which was higher than all of the other lotions I was looking at) and I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic price, as it is still expensive in salons.  </li>
            <li> I was really worried about buying any tanning lotion online after reading the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Long time buyer of Designer Skin products; always bought online.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is discoloured and smells strange.</li>
            <li> and I believe to be the legit stuff (not old or tampered with)</li>
            <li> But for the price that the salons are selling this stuff at (over 100.00 in the tanning salons) - I clearly do not notice any difference in my tan.</li>
            <li> and I have a really good base tan started.</li>
            <li> I have used another indoor lotion that was less expensive and  had more color.</li>
            <li> also the same result from the lotion my boyfriend is using that i bought the same day (black)</li>
            <li> Not only did it exceed my expectations, the price was half that of my local salon.</li>
            <li> I have a very picky boyfriend that has never liked a single one of my tanning lotions (and I have over 50 bottles from owning a salon)</li>
            <li> This lotion did not do much as everyone is saying it does I have used other lotions that cost less then this and got me really dark</li>
            <li> No extra color other then from the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, it seems like my tan went away quicker than it does with other lotions.</li>
            <li> the lotion is fake, they take the bottle and empty it and replace it with cheap stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I would have reviewed much sooner but have had serious matters come up.</li>
            <li> This particular bottle of &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; is creamy, thick, and does not spread well over the skin.</li>
            <li> my arms are finally get as dark as the rest of my body.   </li>
            <li> I used it for a full week to give it time to work but it failed to deliver.</li>
            <li> They loose money when you purchase on line.</li>
            <li> A little bit gOrs a long way do it last forever</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend this Seller &amp; Deigner Skin&#x27;s Black 20x Bronzing Body Silk!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Black for years and this is not the same thing.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this lotion after trying the &#x27;Black Storm&#x27; and hating it.</li>
            <li> I still had some lotion left over from the Designer Skin Black 20X</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it plenty of times since then and it will always be my \\&quot;little secret\\&quot; and back up lotion.</li>
            <li> however I get little color and it does not last!</li>
            <li> i am a red head, so it&#x27;s hard for me to get a \\&quot;good\\&quot; lasting color...</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed when I asked the girls at the counter of my salon how much this stuff cost.</li>
            <li> almost as a tingle lotion but not really.</li>
            <li> but I do not enjoy the smell initially.</li>
            <li> This is the only product for sale at the salon that was for sale a few years ago when I began tanning, and I think that speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> But here don&#x27;t waste your money paying double at a salon</li>
            <li> I have pink undertones</li>
            <li> After careful consideration and alot of review searching, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I did buy another bottle in hopes it proves me wrong.</li>
            <li> I have used a few of different lotions over the years.</li>
            <li> ITS LIKE A PINK COLOR</li>
            <li> SO HOW THESE PEOPLE GET THIS LOTION IS UNKNOWN</li>
            <li> I have a nice base tan now</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from my tanning salon before and loved it, but hated the price (around $100).</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t give you that gross after tan smell and it doesn&#x27;t have that typical \\&quot;bronzer\\&quot; smell either!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m naturally pale with red hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely pale skin (I&#x27;m of Irish descent)</li>
            <li> Seemed a little expensive but after reading several  positive reviews, I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> This product is silicone based therefor a little goes a long way, DO NOT over apply.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this lotion but was a little skeptical on getting it as it was only $30 and my tanning salon sold it for over a $100.</li>
            <li> I received my order before the expected date!</li>
            <li> I usually get this and Obsidian at the same time and switch off each time I go.</li>
            <li> Would not buy any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> I read past reviews stating that it was possibly a knock off because it wasn&#x27;t sealed or it was watery(sp).</li>
            <li> But i wasn&#x27;t to nuts about it due to the ability of the orange/brown spots in-between your fingers that you can achieve</li>
            <li> so freaken itchy for hours can&#x27;t sleep due to the itchy feeling</li>
            <li> Totally moisturizes my skin (I usually have to put on lotion after a tanning bed visit but</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure if that is the way it has always been, as it has been years since i last bought this lotion… but the packaging made me wonder if it had been tampered with..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement over any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> Your body isn&#x27;t greasy like other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> NOT REAL!</li>
            <li> It is some other lotion in the packaging of Designer Skin</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box, I was immediately weary of the badly crushed and OBVIOUSLY PREVIOUSLY OPENED blister pack.</li>
            <li> I usually switch between three other lotions every visit, but I always use Black when I need instant color.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say, only that it hasn&#x27;t been a noticeable difference over other lotions used.</li>
            <li> but im shopping around for other lotions by designer black..</li>
            <li> I am well-versed with Black, Luminary, and other silicon-based tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try to set the record straight as one reviewer stated that lotions on line were fake.</li>
            <li> It does help with the tan, but it did not make me dark overnight.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t burn at all either, and it takes a lot of tanning for me to get dark.</li>
            <li> This lotion will make you dark.  </li>
            <li> It works well and gets me dark</li>
            <li> Within 3 times of tanning, I was so dark that it looked like I had been tanning all summer.</li>
            <li> It did not give me the dark tan that the reviews claimed it would do.</li>
            <li> 0 stars, because the actual product did not work, and the customer service/company SUCKS.</li>
            <li> However, it is not as dark as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything other than Black and Black Noir.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t let me down</li>
            <li> I did burn a little bit but maybe shouldn&#x27;t have started out in the tanning bed for 20 minutes or maybe recommend to go every other day.</li>
            <li> I did not get as dark when I used this 1 versus the black I bought in the tanning salon</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bargain, that being said it is heavily watered down &amp; doesn&#x27;t bronze as well as other products do.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it leaves less marks on clothes than Luminary.  </li>
            <li> After I started using Black 20x</li>
            <li> and i have used the black before bought from my salon</li>
            <li> If you are looking for Black by Designer Tan get the one that is from Glamour Tanning...</li>
            <li> Costs so much less than at salon.</li>
            <li> Designer Skin Black</li>
            <li> it Black 50x.</li>
            <li> I am supposed to be reviewing is \\&quot;Designer Skin Black, 13.5 OZ.</li>
            <li> What I received is \\&quot;Designer Skin Black Tanning Lotion Ultimat</li>
            <li> The item arrived in less time than it was estimated and it was the correct product.</li>
            <li> Had to try Black 20X,after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I looked like I had olive skin tone when I started tanning and amazon price was 1/2 price less than a tanning salon ...</li>
            <li> I like this product and will probably keep a bottle on hand as a change.from the Ed Hardy Black Elixer.  </li>
            <li> Tanned  less with product than tanning with no product.</li>
            <li> The Designer Skin Black 13.5 oz bottle of tanning lotion meets description.</li>
            <li> Defiantly got a darker tan with Black.</li>
            <li> The Designer Skin Black works well and does keep tanning after you leave the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> I am a bronzer lover and will  not use anything less.</li>
            <li> A couple years ago my brother ordered Black online...</li>
            <li> The day i got the Black 20X</li>
            <li> When I ordered Designer Skin Black</li>
            <li> With Black, I don&#x27;t get oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used lotions I have bought from amazon</li>
            <li> and they got my tanner than this product and were half the price.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it was in an Obsidian by Designer Skin looking bottle with the Black emblem.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you orange or leave your hands a mess.  </li>
            <li> I only rate this a 4 because it didn&#x27;t leave me as dark as the girl behind the counter claimed it would.</li>
            <li> Lotion is very average.</li>
            <li> I get very dark in the summer but wanted to get a head start</li>
            <li> I received this item within a few days after ordering.</li>
            <li> Used it just ONCE and already got so dark its unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 5 for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> n been using for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I compared that lotion to this lotion from Green Web.</li>
            <li> The smell is not fantastic either.</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t make me as dark as my past Designer Skin lotions.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product but wouldn&#x27;t recommend tanning everyday can&#x27;t wait to try it outdoors as well.&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smells nice before you roast and isn&#x27;t awful after!</li>
            <li> it was my money gone to waste.  </li>
            <li> I just wasted my money</li>
            <li> However it just didn&#x27;t cut it and the differences were stark.</li>
            <li> I use it for everyday lotion because it makes my skin feel so silky.</li>
            <li> am taking a trip to Belize in less than a month and needed something to quicken the tanning process since it usually takes me a little over a month to get to the level I want to be at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After reading some of the negative reviews, mainly the ones of the product being fake, being opened, and so on I had to admit I was a little leery.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can continue to use this product I feel like I may have wasted my money not like</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to tell if the real product or not.  </li>
            <li> i didnt read the reviews (bad ones) before buying it because they really throw you off a product..</li>
            <li> Tan in just a few days!</li>
            <li> The product I received works well though it tends to be difficult to wash off later.</li>
            <li> When you get a $100 bottle of lotion priced at $30-something, you get what you pay for... Not authentic.</li>
            <li> but I am not satisfied</li>
            <li> so I am not sure what happened here.</li>
            <li> sort of fake looking \\&quot;white girl\\&quot; tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past couple weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> so I usually get an orange color</li>
            <li> Never been this tan :\</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with the results of this lotion.</li>
            <li> and I kid you not my boobs feel like they are very firm.</li>
            <li> My friend who is incapable of even reaching a base tan used this yesterday and has to skip tanning for a few days because her skin got so much color.  </li>
            <li> and I have a VERY pale complexion.</li>
            <li> It came with much bronzer out of container :(</li>
            <li> Ive tired a few others this past year, and none of them compare to this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the lot, the company I purchased it from, or just me, but I completely lost my dark base tan using this product.  </li>
            <li> makes it hard to read the text.  </li>
            <li> How come i sold 2000 bottles of this in January without one complaint?  </li>
            <li> and now it is late at night</li>
            <li> I will be returning this item and leaving a complaint with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not amazingly tan.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews that said it was a fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other lotions in the past and I feel dirty and smelly after I tan.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when I got out of the tanning bed, I smelled SO bad.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago when I was a serious tanner.</li>
            <li> This is not true!!!</li>
            <li> so I can tan during my lunch break and go back to work without thinking I smell bad.</li>
            <li> I had read a few reviews saying that the lotion was fake.</li>
            <li> I am in no way affiliated with a competitor, or have reason to write a false negative review.</li>
            <li> - imagine my shock, when I saw that the lotion settled in a FILM on my skin, with zero absorption, and as I ran my hands over other areas, it all came off in these tiny disgusting rolls, like peeling skin!!!</li>
            <li> reviews\\&quot; very hard to believe.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable results!!</li>
            <li> I like for my lotions to mask the tanning bed smell, but this seemed to make it worse</li>
            <li> Smell was terrible and I didn&#x27;t see too much progress after three tanning</li>
            <li> I will def repurchase this after I build back up my base tan again.</li>
            <li> The bottle also broke after a few uses so that was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with &amp;#34;double seals&amp;#34; broken.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced the orange-ness some bronzers can cause.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to be fake to me, but I have never owned this lotion before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and this is a fake.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Plus, if you go tanning, you know how expensive this lotion is in the salons, this lotion was like 1/3 of the price it is in salons.</li>
            <li> I read the 1 star reviews and it said that this product was fake...</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no need to be skeptical buying from sellers on here.</li>
            <li> Like they put random lotion in a designer skin bottle.</li>
            <li> I think what may be happening is that some people are ordering this lotion, switching out the lotion for something cheaper, returning it, and it is being resold so that some customers are getting fake lotion.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the lotion I purchased based on reviews</li>
            <li> Just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
            <li> This was a gift; however, the recipient failed to inform me of lotion allergies, so she had an allergic reaction and discontinued use.</li>
            <li> but I think I know whay is so expensive now.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fake.</li>
            <li> metal name plate is weird and I ripped it off.</li>
            <li> I am begining to think that if its not a Devoted Creations product that it will be useless to buy.</li>
            <li> This is clearly fake.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to tan everyday, after base tan, once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> At the time I purchased this I never bothered to write a review, but I need to let others know this definitely fake.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this lotion, and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> horrible service, i am very disappointed i really like designer skin</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about this product as I had read some bad reviews saying this product is fake.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fake!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult for me to tan indoors, and impossible for me to tan outdoors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s citrusy smelling and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad smell after tanning.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> And the after smell was bad.</li>
            <li> and I am very angry and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t hate the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> So i would not purchase this product, you will be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product I received here</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> THIS LOTION IS FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m not giving this lotion a 5 is because of its terrible bottle design.</li>
            <li> but it from them for outrageous prices.</li>
            <li> i just read te bad reviews after using and finishing this bottle of lotion this week and thank god!!</li>
            <li> and there is a horrible chemical quality to the smell.</li>
            <li> ALL OVER IN BLISTERS AND STARTED ITCHING REAL BAD.  </li>
            <li> Plus the worst part even after I showered</li>
            <li> I still smelled like that horrible after tan.</li>
            <li> the citrusy grapefruit smell is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got my lotion very fast- I used it last night for the first time and I liked it! It didn&#x27;t seem to be fake to me, but I have never owned this lotion before. I wasn&#x27;t super dark after using this, but I did notice some color. My only complaint is that when I got out of the tanning bed, I smelled SO bad. I like for my lotions to mask the tanning bed smell, but this seemed to make it worse</li>
            <li> Love this product.  If prices ever get to the same price, I would purchase some more.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it went on and the smell is okay, but it didn&#x27;t help to deepen my tan.  Price was great compared to the salon&#x27;s asking price.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and I love it!! It&#x27;s velvety not greasy at all which is amazing!! Light smell not over powering and no after tan stink. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! The silicon makes it go on very nicely and my skin smells amazing after I tan. This exact bottle costs anywhere from $50 to $100 at a tanning salon, so it&#x27;s great to find it on here for so much cheaper. Really great bronzer.</li>
            <li> Great tanning product! It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and it has a decent smell to it so I can tan during my lunch break and go back to work without thinking I smell bad. Still could never get any color on my legs even with this but that could be just because of my skin complexion. I&#x27;m naturally fair skin. But everywhere else is a nice tan and didn&#x27;t take long to get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped within 3-4 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone who wants a quick tan!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller, great price, fast shipping, thank you...!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion when it first came out (07/08) and it&#x27;s still one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used! After using it that first time, that was the darkest I had EVER been and I&#x27;m naturally pale with red hair. I&#x27;ve used it plenty of times since then and it will always be my \\&quot;little secret\\&quot; and back up lotion. I&#x27;m forever a Designer Skin girl after this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and this is a fake. Mostly bronzes leave color on your hands and in between your fingers after applying it but not this one. I should have listened to the other reviews that said it was a fake. No extra color other then from the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> The same tanning lotion in the salon was close to $100.00. This lotion smells good and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great.I loved it!!!I&#x27;m always trying new tanning lotions and get tired of over paying at the tanning salon for them. I asked to see this same lotion at the tanning salon and put it right back cause it cost $130 so I loved that Amazon had it for way less so I but bought it and loved it.</li>
            <li> Will not ever purchase.  lotion from the tanning salon when you can get in on amazon for a much better price! This lotion was around $80 or $90 and I got if for around $30 on here. It is a good lotion. I will not say it is the best, but it did get me a shade darker. Probably won&#x27;t buy again...will try something else the next go around, but it is decent .</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion works with no streaking. I wanted to try to set the record straight as one reviewer stated that lotions on line were fake. This is not true!!! Desiginer Skin and others only sell to a business. The business normally buys in bulk and gets the products at a lower rate . They inreturn  salons and etc sell the product at a much higher cost. Most of the time the mark up is double than what the product is actually worth.Thats how they make their money. Some of the buyers sell their products on line at a cheaper price why??? There is no overhead to pay and etc.etc..They sell more also so they are not looseing money. The salons dont tell you that, they tell you to buy from them. why? They loose money when you purchase on line. You just have to becareful  who you buy from . Read reviews and etc etc. This is a great lotion and excellent price. When you tan in a bed you  are not going to acheive the same color that you would get by laying in the sun. I use this outside and it works great.And no I dont sell tanning products. Im just a consumer who has done her homework.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very pleasant. It moisturizes the skin well and smells marvellous even after tanning in a bed. The smell reminds me of the tropics: a fruity, lightly sweet aroma. In terms of quickening your tan, I think it does a better job than Luminary. However, take this statement with a grain of salt because everyone&#x27;s skin is different - some people develop a tan quicker with Luminary. I&#x27;ve read the other reviews, and there are some that state that Black 20X makes them tan very quickly. It does help with the tan, but it did not make me dark overnight. I also noticed that it leaves less marks on clothes than Luminary.  The reason I&#x27;m not giving this lotion a 5 is because of its terrible bottle design. Why does Designer Skin keep on doing this? Although the screw-cap is nice, the logo-on-a-chain snags and the sparkly bottle makes it hard to read the text.  Ordered from seller Sunless Liquidators.</li>
            <li> Great Deal .. smells great. even the girls at the tanning salon highly recomend this product!  One of the best lotions to get you dark Fast</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion did not do its job. I bought it for my first monthly tanning package of 2014. I  have been tanning for years so I have had a lot of experience with tanning lotions. I tanned 5 days a week for 1 month. I am not one shade darker. This lotion seems as if it blocked all of the tanning rays. I have never had this problem before with a lotion. Now that my months package is up I am VERY disappointed. I do not recommend this lotion. Seller is great though! I received my order before the expected date!</li>
            <li> I received my tanning lotion quick and wow it was awesome now my tanning days have started I would and will be purchasing from seller again product came as I went to the store and bought it thank you u are awesome</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.  I will never pay for overpriced lotion from a salon again.  Black 20x gives the user a very good bronze base and also allows the user a maximum tan.  I have been using it for over a year now and I absolutely love it.  After I started using Black 20x I noticed my skin kept its tan longer.  Also, the lotion does not have a funky smell like most bronzers do.  I urge buyers to purchase this lotion!</li>
            <li> The scent was good however I did not see as much color as I expected.  I have used another indoor lotion that was less expensive and  had more color.</li>
            <li> even though this lotion has a 20x bronzer i find it to be a exstremly good lotion. when i get out of the booth it gives me a tint of red and then eventually turns to tan. almost as a tingle lotion but not really. i only used this lotion for the face and arms. ima guy so the scent was a thumbs down ,and the price is alittle too much for my taste.</li>
            <li> the lotion smells okay but i feel like its not helping me tan.. on the back of the bottle it has a 18 month expiration so i&#x27;m wondering if it was sold to me expired. there&#x27;s no way to really tell but i know with other lotions i can feel and even see results with good lotions and this one just isn&#x27;t doing it for me. also the same result from the lotion my boyfriend is using that i bought the same day (black) and i have used the black before bought from my salon and i just feel as if the ones i ordered from here are not working the same as im used too.</li>
            <li> I received this item within a few days after ordering. Packaging was clean and protected item from possible damage. Side note: this lotion is awesome! I love that I don&#x27;t watch my tan go down the drain in the shower, it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes. Also speeds up the tanning process tremendously! Tan in just a few days! Will definitely buy from this seller again! A +++</li>
            <li> This lotion is velvety smooth. I love designer skin lotions, they make my skin so soft and normally get me dark. I could tell it accelerated my tan, but I also noticed it made me look a bit orange only after using it twice. I don&#x27;t normally use a bronzer lotion for that reason, but thought I&#x27;d try it. I will only use it on occasion, but won&#x27;t buy it again after it&#x27;s gone. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, it&#x27;s like a musky orange smell. Designer skin has much better smelling lotions.   However, the seller is great and I will buy from them again, they sent a free sample with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference between this lotion and some other lotions I bought for a similar price. I tan much faster and get darker when using this lotion. I do alternate my lotions from time to time but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanning lotion with bronzer.  It doesn&#x27;t make you orange or leave your hands a mess.  Highly recommended product and seller.</li>
            <li> I recieved this lotion yesterday and used it right away! It went on so smooth and soaked in quickly. It has a grapefruit scent before and after tanning that is not overpowering. It also doesn&#x27;t give you that gross after tan smell and it doesn&#x27;t have that typical \\&quot;bronzer\\&quot; smell either! The bronzers are great, I woke up this morning with some nice color that isn&#x27;t streaky or orange! Best of all I paid way less than I would have at my tanning salon! I will definitely purchase from Sealed Tanning Lotions again!</li>
            <li> I am naturally tan but do go occasionally to keep it up, especially in the winter days. I used this lotion in hopes that the higher bronzer would get me darker than my usual \\&quot;Made for Love\\&quot; by Designer Skin. I was wrong. This lotion did not do much at all... Although, it smelled amazing, and did leave my skin feeling smoother than ever. If you are looking for a gradual tan, this is perfect. I wouldn&#x27;t use this expecting wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I tried a ton of tasnning lotions before I tried this one, and lemme tell you... buying this tanning lotion was the best choice a tanner can make! After the first time i used it in the tanning booth, I could tell a difference. Even my friend commented saying that I looked darker then the day before! If you want a deep, dark tan really really fast... get this.! I use it every day when I go tanning. It works wonders!</li>
            <li> The only lotion I love more than this one is Obsidian. This lotion goes on super smooth and makes you twice as tan after tanning! I usually get this and Obsidian at the same time and switch off each time I go. This one makes your skin a lot softer and hydrated after tanning than other lotions and smells so good!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It leaves your skin smelling troipcal before and after tanning. It&#x27;s very smooth when you put it on, unlike some other lotions that leave you feeling sticky. After just a week I had a nice golden tan. It&#x27;s been two weeks now and I am DARK! :)</li>
            <li> My lotion got to me really quickly! I would definantly reccomend this supplier. Plus, if you go tanning, you know how expensive this lotion is in the salons, this lotion was like 1/3 of the price it is in salons. Mostly I was excited about how fast it got here, only took like 4 days!</li>
            <li> Well. So this package was unsealed. I have not used it, and I am not taking any chances. I read the 1 star reviews and it said that this product was fake... So I am trusting those. I don&#x27;t trust unsealed products. Don&#x27;t buy this. If you are looking for Black by Designer Tan get the one that is from Glamour Tanning... The reviews of the company are MUCH better. And not about condoms. This company sends out condoms and not lotions. So obviously not as trustworthy. I am putting this in the male for RETURN AS I TYPE.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best bronzing lotion available. It retails for 96$ at the local salon. This price is amazing and the product can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I had researched this product at my local tanning salon, who had it priced more than double the amount I paid for it here on Amazon.com. So glad I checked out this site and retailer BEFORE I purchased it elsewhere! Very satisfied customer!!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have used, and I used to work for a tanning salon during college and have tried EVERYTHING. This product is silicone based therefor a little goes a long way, DO NOT over apply. You will just waste your money on a great product. I would definitely refer this product  to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. At first I was skeptical buying lotion over the Internet, reading some reviews that they filled it with Wal-Mart lotion or whatever. My lotion came SEALED in plast wrapping which I was very thankful with. And I&#x27;m super dark. I love this.</li>
            <li> Packaging was a little flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> This was ok for me. I am more of a tingle girl and I spent the money looking for exceptional reviews and this one just was OK.</li>
            <li> So man compliments on my dark, smooth tan. Costs so much less than at salon.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! My skin is so fair and I get such good color with this lotion!! A little bit gOrs a long way do it last forever it feels like!</li>
            <li> I find all of these \\&quot;horror reviews\\&quot; very hard to believe. I ordered this earlier in the week and just received it. Used it just ONCE and already got so dark its unbelievable. darker than bombshell! just perfect. I feel like these slandering reviews are salon owners trying to scare people into buying their overpriced lotion. Honestly, like I&#x27;ve heard \\&quot;oh don&#x27;t buy from amazon the lotion is fake, they take the bottle and empty it and replace it with cheap stuff\\&quot;. First off, why would someone spend money on buying the real stuff, AND THEN spend more money on a lotion to replace it with? Don&#x27;t question lotions on amazon. mine is just perfect. This is the second lotion i have ordered off of amazon and each lotion is in the SAME EXACT bottle as sold in salons. The lotions smell as they do in the salon and are the same color and consistency. there&#x27;s no need to be skeptical buying from sellers on here. I&#x27;m sure all sellers are great but I have bought from glamour tanning twice and they sell the real stuff and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It&#x27;s very smooth, absorbs well, smells clean and gives dark color. What else could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it smells so good I put it on every-morning...even when not tanning.  Makes my skin feel like silk and of course is a awesome tanning lotion.  Will defiantly buy more designer skin products!  FYI came completely sealed.</li>
            <li> I have a very picky boyfriend that has never liked a single one of my tanning lotions (and I have over 50 bottles from owning a salon) and this one he LOVES the smell of! I can actually tan and see him without having to shower in between. Also, after only two tans I was four to five shades darker without any fading (meaning not from the bronzers alone). I would definitely HIGHLY recommend this beauty to anyone wanting a very deep, even brown with no orange and very quick return on tanning investment :)</li>
            <li> I really hope I did not waste my money. So far this product is not giving me the results I want. I use stand up beds level 5 and for some reason I&#x27;m not amazingly tan.</li>
            <li> suntan lotion,&lt;br /&gt;i really can&#x27;t rate it, because i didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it.it got stolen out of my car. that is what i get for leaving it unlocked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tanning lotion since I first started tanning and i&#x27;m totally hooked! It smells amazing and citrusy, but not overbearing. It leaves a beautiful bronze glow on your skin as well and i&#x27;d recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> Would not buy any other lotion.  Some of my friends use others that leave their hands stained.  This lotion does not and you get a great tan!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over two years now. You cannot find a better product. It helps keep skin hydrated and the color it helps you achieve and keep is AMAZING. I use it for both indoor and outdoor tanning. It has a great citrus sent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and just adds to the feeling of freshness. My fair skinned son just recently started using it outdoors and he quickly went from looking sick to looking healthy. I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s made my skin healthier and feel like silk after use. I don&#x27;t use anything other than Black and Black Noir.</li>
            <li> Like the lotion it smells pretty good and got it quickly. Would do business again. The lotion feels a bit greasy but overall I do like it</li>
            <li> didnt do anything...i wish i could return it</li>
            <li> To be honest I was very skeptical of this product. Mostly because I used to work at a tanning salon and know this retails for $100. So because it was such a good deal, I almost expected to get some fake lotion. But to my surprise it was real. It shipped fast and it was an amazing deal. Thank you soo much. I would definatly buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This lotion works amazing!! I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but it works great! I am very fair skinned have never tried tanning and did a lot of research before buying a product. Designer Skin Black 20X by far had the best overall customer reviews and I can see why!! I already have a subtle tan and the product smells amazing. It&#x27;s citrusy smelling and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad smell after tanning. I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> Black lotion is my favorite lotion i have tried so far! I have had many compliments on my color and I don&#x27;t smell like burnt skin after tanning.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with my order.delivery was fast. Will be ordering 2 more soon.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion for tanning.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of the designer skin \\&quot;black\\&quot; just a few days ago, and absolutely fell in love with it. I love the refreshing (not tanning lotion like) smell of it. My skin felt like silk when I got out of the tanning bed, and I was noticeably darker just after the first try. I was pretty disappointed when I asked the girls at the counter of my salon how much this stuff cost. They sell it for 100 bucks! There is no way I can afford to pay that much money for a lotion no matter how much I love it! So I think I&#x27;m pretty lucky to have found the lotion for such a reasonable price here.After reading some of the negative reviews, mainly the ones of the product being fake, being opened, and so on I had to admit I was a little leery. I had kept what was left of the sample I had purchased, and studied the bottle itself at the tanning salon. They are EXACTLY the same product, the same smell, same texture, and yes it was in the same exact bottle. When I received the lotion it was packaged very well,I even received it a day earlier than what I was originally told, and I cannot wait to use it. I will be buying from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!  It arrived sealed and only took a day to get here. Pleasant smell, left my skin feeling silky and smooth.  I had a light base tan to begin with and this lotion really gave it a boost!! After using it once I have a deep bronze glow. This same bottle retails for $101.00 at the tanning spa that I go to. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I receieved my bottle today and will be using it after I get off of work. So far so good! The packaging was nice and it smells great! The lotion is very soft! I&#x27;ll update once I use it and see what kind of tan it gives me. Im fair skinned so heres to hoping!</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 5 for a few reasons. One big reason is that I received the product in 5 days...sealed! I read past reviews stating that it was possibly a knock off because it wasn&#x27;t sealed or it was watery(sp). This is the real deal!  The other reason I gave it a 5 is because the smell is fantastic! Even after I still smelled fruity :) It seemed to work the first time and I use low pressure beds. I will definately buy this product again from the same seller.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what results I get in the higher pressure beds!</li>
            <li> --I gave it five stars because it deserves it...not because I&#x27;m exaggerating.--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking a trip to Belize in less than a month and needed something to quicken the tanning process since it usually takes me a little over a month to get to the level I want to be at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with Paint it Black 50x. This was not acceptable lotion...Smell was terrible and I didn&#x27;t see too much progress after three tanning sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with Black20x I have achieved my golden glow in nine days!  The smell of the lotion is very nice. \\&quot;Grapefruit-ish\\&quot; I would say and smells good after tanning. You can definitely go out right after tanning if you&#x27;d like to.  It goes on very smoothly also :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to skip the cheaper stuff and go for this one. It hasn&#x27;t let me down</li>
            <li> very pleased with this purchase! received package by estimated delivery date. was new product, exact same as sold in salons for a fraction of the price. used to work at Sun***City so i know my tanning lotions :) will definitely be buying from them again. THANK YOU for providing us with amazing tanning lotion for an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Honestly I was very concerned about ordering a tanning lotion from online, thanks to my tanning salon. They told me stories that sellers would put a different lotion in the bottle and sell it to people making them think they was getting what they ordered when it wasn&#x27;t. I was very very happy with my lotion and got it much cheaper than what my salon sells it for. Now I know why they tell people that, so you will but it from them for outrageous prices. I am glad I got the nerve to buy this awesome lotion. It makes my skin feel silky from the time I put it on till I take a shower. My arms wasn&#x27;t tanning as well as I wanted but since I got this lotion my arms are finally get as dark as the rest of my body.   I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I love it. It works just as good indoors as it does outside.</li>
            <li> Wasnt even the lotion. Like they put random lotion in a designer skin bottle.</li>
            <li> Item I am supposed to be reviewing is \\&quot;Designer Skin Black, 13.5 OZ. Bottle\\&quot;. What I received is \\&quot;Designer Skin Black Tanning Lotion Ultimat 20X Bronzing Body Silk Mega Magical Silicone Emulsion Black Lotion 13.5 oz\\&quot;. The product I received matches what is displayed on their website.   Anyway, who knows? The product I received works well though it tends to be difficult to wash off later. I have used HEMPHATIC in the past and it was great. Went on smooth, and after tanning did not leave my body slimy. I do not know why I changed so it&#x27;s my fault and just have to remember if it works don&#x27;t change it.</li>
            <li> gets you super dark super fast. Absolutely LOVE this stuff it is 100% better then luminary in my opinion. It dosent break me out, it leaves me super silky. Absolutely love the smell. Lasts forever! Alittle goes such a long way. I used this years ago when I was a serious tanner. I will def repurchase this after I build back up my base tan again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this potion..it smells great!! Works wonderfully ..I will from now on only buy my lotion from here.!!!</li>
            <li> It works well and smells good.</li>
            <li> Perfect as described A+ fast delivery I would definitely recommend this seller to my friends and associates and look forward to doing business again in the future should a similar item be added</li>
            <li> The item arrived in less time than it was estimated and it was the correct product. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Works great but I do not enjoy the smell initially. The bottle also broke after a few uses so that was disappointing. Overall a good basic lotion.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Worked as advertised and actually the best I have used. It was also much cheaper than in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with &amp;#34;double seals&amp;#34; broken.  The company states no issues and to try it to see if I like it.  Just makes me worried that the rumors of receiving a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; product could be true.  Almost impossible to tell if the real product or not.  Will try it and see how it goes.  Company was quick to respond and said it must have been a shipping error and the product is real.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping was about the only good thing I can say about this lotion.  But when I used the bottle, I realized it was old!! I&#x27;ve always bought the Luminary lotion with no issues. The first time I used this lotion, it instantly rolled off once it dried. Very disappointed in this lotion, and a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best tanning lotion anyone who loves indoor tanning can possibly use.  I love it, it gives you a dark tan in a short period of time and the tanning last much longer than with other lotions i had used in the past.  I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lotion is a knockoff. I trusted the 5 star reviews and ignored the knockoff warnings. Bottle arrived today, was wrapped in the cheap plastic shrink wrap you heat with a hair dryer. The shrink wrap itself has several holes in it. The lotion has a foul smell, heavy odor of cheap self tanner, does not smell like the product sold in salons. I am in no way affiliated with a competitor, or have reason to write a false negative review. I completely fell for this scam. When you get a $100 bottle of lotion priced at $30-something, you get what you pay for... Not authentic. It did come with a sealed lotion sample, I don&#x27;t trust it to even try it.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for over two weeks now and have had no noticeable increase in color.  I do wonder now if I was sold a true Designer Skin product or something \\&quot;else\\&quot;?  I have used many Designer Skin lotions and have had much better results.  Today, I purchased another bottle at my tanning salon at a much higher price and had immediate results.  I guess you get what you pay for...  I order a lot of things on line, but this will be the first and last time time I will order tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for quite a few years now and have tried many different tanning lotions. This one is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried. It gives me a natural looking tan and not the orange tint most lotions do. It smells good and goes on very smooth. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The scent of this lotion isnt breath taking, but is more than tolerable. Also the effects from this product were quite rapid. I started with this level and noticed results the very next day.</li>
            <li> The lotion arrived fast an in new condition. I love this lotion it gives me a great tan! Works great with any kind of bed.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for almost a month now and ive noticed a huge difference in how dark I am. I went back to the tanning bed after not going for about 4 months. (I was VERY white) Within 2 weeks of using this in a top level bed, im the darkest Ive ever been! This lotion goes on really smoothly and smells great too, even after tanning. I dont mind going tanning before work, because it feels so soft and silky like on your skin. I wouldnt buy it in the tanning salons at the price for $110, but I would HIGHLY recommend buying this from Amazon! This product is well worth it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 5.28.2013&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this for over a year and I still feel the same way as before. Ive tired a few others this past year, and none of them compare to this one. Still 5 stars and I still recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7.7.2014&lt;br /&gt;This is still my number 1 tanning lotion. I have tried probably close to 100 different ones in the past year and this is still the best!! I fully recommend this 1000000% Still 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion. Smells yummy and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> After reading everyone else&#x27;s reviews I settled on this one.  It&#x27;s a really good tanning lotion. I got a month membership at desert sun and with this lotion that&#x27;s all I needed. In just about a week or two I was way darker then when I started. This lotion also smells pretty good,  not that gross burnt skin smell after tanning. It doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks either.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time also.</li>
            <li> My order arrived exactly the time it said it would and I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Designer Skin is by far..the best tanning lotion out there.  Had to try Black 20X,after reading the reviews.  I have used it about 3 times so far..darker..richer tan!  Unbelievable results!!</li>
            <li> i was doing alot of research on the best tanning lotions for beds, and this one was coming up alot.  so i decided to test it out for myself and i am not the person who is easily persuaded by the so called \\&quot;best\\&quot; products out there.  when i first started it, i LOVED the smell of it, it smells like grapefruit or something like that.  Anyways, i liked this product because it did what it said it would do, and that was to GET YOU DARKER!!!!  i love how my skin feels and looks when i am done tanning, this is a great product!!!  i am now trying the 30X lotion, i will update once i am done this bottle!!  HAPPY TANNING!!!</li>
            <li> I heard rave reviews on this lotion, Amazon had an amazing price on it! I have only had time try it once but the good reviews other people are leaving are soooo true. Great color, color that lasts and I&#x27;m very fair skinned, it takes an awesome product to make color show up and stay on me. This deos the trick. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!</li>
            <li> I have had this lotion for quite a while now hoping it would eventually get better. It makes my skin feel soft, the smell is like grapefruits, but I don&#x27;t get much color. I read the reviews about this and it seemed like there was a lot of happy customers who have gotten this. My salon (California Sun Centers) even agreed it is a great lotion however I get little color and it does not last! Not sure if the product was the real stuff that was sent to me or if I am just use to better stuff but I am not satisfied so I gave the lotion to my sister...better luck to her! I will say the lotion was sealed when I got it with plastic wrap around it so I am not sure what happened here.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion so much I came back for a second bottle. It smells good and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> First off, I ordered it and within a few days it was in my mailbox. Secondly, I love it! It smells good and is so smooth it makes my skin soo soft more so than any other lotion I have from like bath n body. It does not stain hands or clothing. It did make me darker with usage. I already had a killer sexy tan from tanning 2 months before using this and it made me even tanner! I love it n been using for a few weeks n no issues with it at all.</li>
            <li> I bought the same lotion a year ago, but at the salon for $100. Great product. Tan is noticeable as soon as you get out of the bed. I usually switch between three other lotions every visit, but I always use Black when I need instant color. I also have Italian skin, so the outcome may be different for lighter skin tones, or people that don&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
            <li> Okay this is my first review on something like this.. i just read te bad reviews after using and finishing this bottle of lotion this week and thank god!! i didnt read the reviews (bad ones) before buying it because they really throw you off a product..i have to say buying lotion for the first time online instead of a tanning salon i was a bit spectical. BUT i will like to inform all of you the lotion i received smelled really good like grape fruit and i noticed i was darker and it worked for me..i dont know about this 20x broner stuff of how dark you get how fast..but within i would say 3 days of using it i noticed i was a nice color..it worked great it smelled fantastic i would get it again but im shopping around for other lotions by designer black.. next one im trying is Elusive...so will see. but this one was good.</li>
            <li> Works well to deepen your tan faster.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion! Used it in the bed, used it on the beach. Now I have the perfect bronzed body!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion of all time. I love all of DS products, but I really love the color I get from using this lotion. There&#x27;s no DHA (self tanner) so it won&#x27;t turn you orange or rub off on your clothes after you tan. Sometimes ordering offline makes me nervous, but this product is very consistent.</li>
            <li> I had read a few reviews saying that the lotion was fake. I have a bottle of this that I bought at a salon for $108. I compared that lotion to this lotion from Green Web. It is the same lotion. I think what may be happening is that some people are ordering this lotion, switching out the lotion for something cheaper, returning it, and it is being resold so that some customers are getting fake lotion. One reviewer said that this lotion was not sealed, that she used to work in a tanning salon and she knows it&#x27;s supposed to be sealed. The bottle I bought at the salon was not sealed either. But these bottles did come in sealed bags. I really like this lotion. I&#x27;m very Caucasian. I don&#x27;t tan well, don&#x27;t burn at all either, and it takes a lot of tanning for me to get dark. Even at my darkest, my tan doesn&#x27;t have that deep brown look. In a short time, this has given me a color more like someone with some \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; blood rather than my normal, surface-y, sort of fake looking \\&quot;white girl\\&quot; tan. So nice to be able to get this at a decent price. As good as it is, it&#x27;s hard to justify $108 for tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> No streaking! Love it</li>
            <li> The 14K Gold works better.</li>
            <li> Great product! Really does a good job and helps me maintain my tan. Would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product for dark tanning in a short time.</li>
            <li> I have extremely pale skin (I&#x27;m of Irish descent) and I used this and got a GREAT base tan. I have since then changed to Obsidian (another one of Designer Skins products)</li>
            <li> I used to go tanning and this product worked for me ... I am white like a ghost ... I burn and I don&#x27;t get brown ...this actually make me look good ... I looked like I had olive skin tone when I started tanning and amazon price was 1/2 price less than a tanning salon ... It smell good too !</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, to the point where people have pointed out to me, \\&quot;I never noticed how white you are,\\&quot; or \\&quot;Wow, you are really white\\&quot; (from my doctor). It&#x27;s very difficult for me to tan indoors, and impossible for me to tan outdoors. I have been tanning on and off for about 10 years, and most recently, it&#x27;s been about a month since I switched back to the beds from self-tanners. I used 3 packets of this from my salon, and I got so much color from it, especially on my legs which are hardest to tan! I was trying out packets to see what worked, and this was definitely the one. It smells okay, not bad but not amazing. But it does work amazing. I have a nice base tan now and I am purchasing a bottle to extend my tan even more. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once, so far in just one use I see a difference in color. It doesn&#x27;t make me look orange, and that&#x27;s a good thing. Felt like silk going on. The smell wasn&#x27;t the best I have smelt, but it wasn&#x27;t horrible either. Will definitely purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Got it in two days with amazon prime, so worth it!</li>
            <li> So I was in school and received an amazon gift card for doing a survey, so i got excited because i needed new tanning lotion... so then i went onto amazon and was looking around, only to find this. I thought it was an amazing deal, I mean who wouldn&#x27;t buy 30 dollar tanning lotion that was listed for over 100? So i got all excited waiting for it (I had prime so it was only going to take 2 days) so then I got my mail and then opened it, It smelt amazing!!! But the color was distorted and it did not work. So i would not purchase this product, you will be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t hate the smell of this. It smells more like clementines than tanning lotion, so if you&#x27;re tanning right before work or something it won&#x27;t offend the delicate sensibilities of the gal in the next cube.</li>
            <li> I have used MANY different tanning lotions. However,  this is the only one I&#x27;ve purchased more than once. I LOVE this stuff. Makes your skin sooooo soft and really enhances your tan.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion! It works and smells great! Exactly as described and a good value. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion !! I was buying it at a salon then I found it on Amazon for a lot cheaper . My favorite and I&#x27;ve tried many .</li>
            <li> I love the real Designer Skin Black However, this is not the real product! It was a scam. So sad, but I should have known better!!!</li>
            <li> I know this is one of the most popular bronzing lotions out on the market. But i wasn&#x27;t to nuts about it due to the ability of the orange/brown spots in-between your fingers that you can achieve if you don;t rub the lotion in orrr if you don&#x27;t wash your hands after application. Is a great lotion with a silicone base and nice smell. Amazing for people looking to achieve fast dark color without tanning a lot!</li>
            <li> It works great.  Very nice dark tan</li>
            <li> Good stuff I can tell a color change just from one use! Definitely some good tanning lotion! Would buy again</li>
            <li> Excellent indoor tanning lotion. I don&#x27;t need to go out at all and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. We have had tanning salon in our past and we sure like this one. Now we have downsized to just an &amp;#34;MY HOUSE&amp;#34; business. But it is a wonderful addition to our products. Thnak you</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the lotion I purchased based on reviews</li>
            <li> I like this product and will probably keep a bottle on hand as a change.from the Ed Hardy Black Elixer.  I do think I get better results if I alternate.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this lotion but was a little skeptical on getting it as it was only $30 and my tanning salon sold it for over a $100. It is the best lotion ever! I love it. I wish I had got something with bronzer but this product was exactly what I was expecting! Yes I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed, I had done research on the best indoor tanning products and this kept showing up so I ordered it but I didn&#x27;t think it worked as well as what I had been using.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Super tan after using only a few times. Smells fresh. Like grapefruit. Keeps skin super moistured. Will keep buying . For those who love tingle factor the bombshell works amazing and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, but have an awesome tan after only four tanning sessions.  I would never spend $100 on a tanning lotion in a salon, so I was very happy to find this for only $35 and free shipping with my Prime membership.  Has a great scent, and no ATO..  Make sure that you rub it in very well!  This lotion does have bronzers, so I noticed that I had a bit of orange streaking around my toes when I used too much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick. No complaints there! Lotion is very average. I&#x27;m no darker than before I started using it. The smell is not fantastic either. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. Will try something new very soon.</li>
            <li> I loved this product! It work great! The only thing is, it seems like my tan went away quicker than it does with other lotions.</li>
            <li> Was great. I&#x27;m happy with my order. It was brand new and not full price. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Good lotion but not what I was hoping for.  It didn&#x27;t have a tingle effect that I like.  Also, it didn&#x27;t make me as dark as my past Designer Skin lotions. -- I LOVE designer skin as a brand but this wasn&#x27;t my favorite product of theirs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel like the same lotion I had tried in store. Bottle even looked like a knock off. Tanned  less with product than tanning with no product. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Great product! NOT fake as some were saying it is. Definitely will be buying this again in the future 👍</li>
            <li> It was what I needed and at a fraction of the cost at the local tanning salon.  She enjoys the scent and how it makes her skin feel.</li>
            <li> I feel like other 21x bronzers did more. May just be my skin though.</li>
            <li> Great product, isn&#x27;t streaky and doesn&#x27;t have a womanly smell.  Has been the top selling tanning lotion for about 5 years now.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product.  She is darker than she has ever been.  Great price!</li>
            <li> Great price and works great will be back to buy more when the time come to reorder. Great product for tanning</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better than a previous Designer tanner.....it has too much alcohol in it, doesn&#x27;t leave a nice sheen on your skin.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> My wife the sun worshiper loved this stuff, she claim the tanning time is amazingly fast compared to other tanning products she has used.</li>
            <li> Quick tan with out any oily residue.  Absorbs into the skin very quickly.  I am told the bottle should last the season ... we will see.</li>
            <li> The Designer Skin Black 13.5 oz bottle of tanning lotion meets description. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I loved it!!!! I will be buying it again and I will be telling my friends where to get there from too.. Very happy..</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Great smell and makes skin feel very soft. Gives a great brown color not orange at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with certain brands and bronzers in the past, but Designer Skin is a wonderful high-end lotion for those people that have problems with sensitive skin.  I was nervous about the fragrance at first, but it didn&#x27;t break me out and it smells wonderful.  I darken quickly and easily, so as far as the bronzing agent, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from other ones I used. For me, it was worth buying a high end lotion that didn&#x27;t break me out in a rash.</li>
            <li> Its a good tanner but i think once you go through one bottle it stops working as well. Its a good idea to switch it up often.</li>
            <li> I love designer skin black tanning lotion! It delivers amazing color and applies smoothly. A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion really gives you a wonderfully dark tan, and I love it. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. Just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting !</li>
            <li> First time using this lotion been very pleased with it</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Works great and leaves your skin feeling so soft! Gives a great, dark and even color! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This was a gift; however, the recipient failed to inform me of lotion allergies, so she had an allergic reaction and discontinued use. As far as I am aware, the product, itself, was as described and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> gives me a quick tan and good color.  Great price on this product and it works very well. My tanning salon was selling this for $100 a bottle</li>
            <li> Tanning salons employees insist that lotions bought online are knockoffs.....this lotion seems to be the real thing!!!!  Any others have the same experience?</li>
            <li> The lotion was delivered quickly, brand new. It smells great, and works pretty well, but I was hoping to see even more impressive results with my tan. Overall I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past couple weeks &amp; I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments on my tan. I usually NEVER get noticed for being tan but i have been now that I bought this! Will definitely be buying another bottle!</li>
            <li> Just love Designer Skin Black, I saw results the first time I used it. I will order this lotion again.  The price was about 1/4 of the price at the salon where I tan.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome, is easy to apply and makes you tan super fast! I think the number one best thing I enjoyed about buying it off Amazon was the fact that I got it for about $80 cheaper than what the tanning salon was selling it for!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR OPTIMAL TANNING EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I did try this one once but it does have a smell to it that I do not like, so not I am stuck with the bottle I used one time. I do not care for nor did it tan like Elusive does. So I think I will stick with my Elusive.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  It did nothing to boost my tan.  It left an oily feeling on my skin and was over priced!</li>
            <li> I bought this product very good price fast shipping package came sealed, I have used it 3 times now and I have a really good base tan started. I did burn a little bit but maybe shouldn&#x27;t have started out in the tanning bed for 20 minutes or maybe recommend to go every other day. I also would like to add that it does contain some sorta firming ingredient in it and I kid you not my boobs feel like they are very firm. And trust me I&#x27;ve had 3 kids and I know what they did look like and what they now look like much firmer. My husband can vouch for this. I would recommend this product but wouldn&#x27;t recommend tanning everyday can&#x27;t wait to try it outdoors as well.&lt;br /&gt;Okay so this is an update of this product, I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 weeks and I love the color it is giving me but afterwards I am broke out in like hives all over my body and so freaken itchy for hours can&#x27;t sleep due to the itchy feeling I do shower afterwards to rinse it off but it feels like I just rolled in fiberglass. Not sure if I can continue to use this product I feel like I may have wasted my money not like I could send it back now.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t tan me. Didn&#x27;t see a difference. And it has to be the lotion because I bought a different kind and immediately seen a change in my color. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Lovvvvve this tanning lotion! Originally tried the sample at the salon (their selling price was $90) and was excited to find this lotion at such a great deal on here! Totally moisturizes my skin (I usually have to put on lotion after a tanning bed visit but with this stuff, there is no need). Doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like the tanning bed! Leaves a very nice fruity smell even after a fake bake :) I haven&#x27;t even used a quarter of it and I am getting so many compliments on my tan! A little goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> Good so far!! I&#x27;m read headed and fair skin and I have a good tan going on for our vacation!</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say, only that it hasn&#x27;t been a noticeable difference over other lotions used. For the price, not bad.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I would never use anything else to tan with! Love the scent and the silicone in it makes your skin feel really soft!</li>
            <li> I use my tanning lotion at the salon and outside! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Defiantly got a darker tan with Black. Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> Not the best smelling lotion i&#x27;ve used in the past, but it definitely did the job. I used it for about a week and saw great results. I tan very well but this just gives me that extra bronze that i want. However my girlfriend said she got itchy from using it. (Shes a complainer though) Just a heads up. Try and Enjoy. :)</li>
            <li> i like this product because it feels so silky smooth on your skin and ITS NOT GREASY like most tanning lotions.. it soaks into your skin and doesn&#x27;t even feel like you just lathered up your skin.. its just nice.&lt;br /&gt;however, the product i received.. it had kind of a strange after smell.. more of a manly smell.. I&#x27;m not entirely sure if that is the way it has always been, as it has been years since i last bought this lotion… but the packaging made me wonder if it had been tampered with.. it was sent in like a sealed SOFT plastic (like a plastic bag not a hard plastic case like it usually comes in).. those were the only two suspicious things for me… I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;but it still works good</li>
            <li> The Designer Skin Black works well and does keep tanning after you leave the tanning bed.  However, the tan is a little different shade than my normal skin tone.</li>
            <li> This lotion will make you dark.  It cost over 90 dollars at the salon I go to.  It has a nice smell and leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li> I only rate this a 4 because it didn&#x27;t leave me as dark as the girl behind the counter claimed it would. She raved about how dark it made her, which it may have, but for me it was just a really great smelling lotion that left my skin feeling super soft. This has been one of my top favorites of all the lotions I have used, I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Considering I got my dad&#x27;s side fair skin and not my mom&#x27;s side, my skin is mean to be pale, however with this product I only have to tan twice a week and my tan looks as if I have been tanning for months. I tried 5 different types of tanners from Designer Skin, and I would recommend this one and Smile I&#x27;m Dark as the top two Designer Skin Black products, the accelerators do wonders and are safer for your skin since you get the result with less amount of time under the UV lights.</li>
            <li> I am a bronzer lover and will  not use anything less.I was excited to use this lotion in the beds.It works well and gets me dark fast.i only use it in the high pressure beds so i dont know how well it works in the regular beds.It is well worth it for the price and the great  ingredients .</li>
            <li> This lotion did not work as well for me as it does for other people, but I have seen amazing results from this lotion.  Your skin will feel like silk afterwards, it will not sweat off you like most other lotions, and it smells good.  My friend who is incapable of even reaching a base tan used this yesterday and has to skip tanning for a few days because her skin got so much color.  This is a fantastic price, as it is still expensive in salons.  This is the only product for sale at the salon that was for sale a few years ago when I began tanning, and I think that speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> Great lotion!!! Doesn&#x27;t streak!! Would definitely recommend!! Doesn&#x27;t take a lot to spread over your a body!!! A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> this is BY FAR my favorite lotion i have ever used! i am a red head, so it&#x27;s hard for me to get a \\&quot;good\\&quot; lasting color...but this does it every time! i HIGHLY recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> This product lasted a long time and completely changed the color of my skin. Smells nice before you roast and isn&#x27;t awful after! Win in my book.</li>
            <li> just one use i got pretty tan, i would recommend this to anyone, smells great, works great, and ill definitely order again</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have been tanning for several years and had always bought the cheapest lotion the salon had (broke college student!). A couple years ago my brother ordered Black online... And we have never looked back! This lotion is incredible. It goes on so smoothly and smells great. Best. Lotion. Ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 or 5 different types and this one smells better than those other ones. It also left me more smooth than any other that I&#x27;ve tried. Today was just day one of use but I think this will help me achieve my color fast based on many reviews and suggestions online for this product.</li>
            <li> If you want a tan and fast this is what u want; I tan in a tanning bed and used jwoww and a lot of others but this is great hands down it runs a race with Elusive. These two are the best if u want a tan fast. So I will only be ordering Elusive or Black20x but there are some others that&#x27;s great also like Dark Princess , Jwoww , Snookie . But if u want it fast and dark stick around black20x and Elusive it will get you dark fast.. All the best ones are by Designer Skin...</li>
            <li> I would have reviewed much sooner but have had serious matters come up.I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product I received here my Black 20x lotion was Not sealed and there was no cap that determines how much comes out of the bottle.So the bottle had leaked  all over the box it was delivered in.I have never returned a product to amazon but I think this one definitely needs to be.I can&#x27;t believe it.I don&#x27;t even want to use it.I want to hear back from the company ASAP so I know what to do next.I should have the return label somewhere but if I can&#x27;t locate it how do I return it??I&#x27;m so letdown by this purchase and it gets clunky on your skin.Maybe because the bottle was defective and the chain was broke on it too!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it was fake...</li>
            <li> I got sooooo dark pretty fast and it didn&#x27;t make me break out either</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is ABSOLUTELY the best tanning lotion out there.  The amount of color you get is phenomenal!  I got so dark so fast!  :)</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with all of the Obsession line...I only see the results I want when using a bed called the Matrix (it&#x27;s one of those non-burn beds). I am able to keep a nice colored tan only going onece or twice a week and I have a VERY pale complexion.</li>
            <li> I need more. It smells like grapefruit, and is not sticky. This is amazing. I could literally see a difference in one tanning visit. I have told everyone what a great product this is. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan very well at all. I have used so many lotions in the past and the ones I have used have gotten me a little dark but thats it. I decided to try this lotion out and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results. Within 3 times of tanning, I was so dark that it looked like I had been tanning all summer. Excellent lotion, and I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion! I get dark after 3 tanning session and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> quality product sent to home  on time</li>
            <li> Great price and great product. But here don&#x27;t waste your money paying double at a salon</li>
            <li> I was buying this at my tanning salon for about two to three times the price.  I love the smell and it works nicely.  Amazon is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, love the smell.  I&#x27;ve used this product for the past couple of years.  Although I tan only once a week, I&#x27;ve kept my tan.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and arrived on time. Smells great and was very affordable.</li>
            <li> Just finished up my last bottle and they all were top rated and in perfect never used condition. The color I got was off the charts great!!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Gives a rich, dark color without any hint of orange. Smell is pleasant &amp; lotion is not greasy</li>
            <li> love this stuff!!! helped me tan perfectly 3wks</li>
            <li> The ONLY tanning lotion I will use. It gives me the perfect bronze without that extream orange look. My biggest reason for loving this lotion is the pleasant tropical smell. Almost all tanning lotions are way to strong on the perfume side. This lotion is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This tannin lotion is amazing! I highly recommend it and the seller. I received it quickly and the product is so soft and nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> This product is very good. Was mailed as promised and brand new. works great. I would recommend this product for indoor tanning</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about this product as I had read some bad reviews saying this product is fake. Well the way i got it... not \\&quot;sealed\\&quot; is the SAME way the sell it at the salon. The day i got the Black 20X i went to the tanning salon and looked at the SAME product it looked, felt, and smelled the SAME but only it cost about $85.00 MORE! great deal here.. the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning lotion.  It keeps your skin very soft for days after use and it doesn&#x27;t have a really loud odor like many other tanning lotions.  It also really helps increase your tan.  I have pink undertones so I usually get an orange color the darker I get, and this helps me bronze easier.</li>
            <li> So I bought this first time but I promise you I am buying again SOON!!&lt;br /&gt;First of all I am tanned and quite dark but above all this product smells great, leaves my skin so smooth, seems like it darkens it too.&lt;br /&gt;Above all is a great product, never have I purchased such an expensive item, orig price is 100$ but I think I know whay is so expensive now.So , for this price it truly is an amazing product, if  I have to pay 100$ that would never happen.If the tanning salon tries to sell anything to you for that price, make sure you do your homework and spend your money wisely.They will say , it is not the same and it does not the same thing..hello??..what can they say?They have to sell their products marked 150% higher than you can find them anywhere else.Trust your instincts!!Take my advise and make the right choice.&lt;br /&gt;And this is IT!</li>
            <li> I was really worried about buying any tanning lotion online after reading the negative reviews. I buy a lot of stuff online (feel free to click on my name and read my other reviews) and I always read the negative reviews before buying anything. I went ahead and bought this bottle, and wow! Not only did it arrive the next day, it was sealed in plastic, not clam shell packaging, and no product was inside the cap or on the neck of the bottle. Having said that, it was shipped to me from within the state I live in. If it had to come from out of state, it may not have arrived without some of the product on the neck of the bottle. Who knows what happens during shipping! Anyway, I went straight to the tanning salon and compared it to the bottle they have, exactly the same. I left my skin soft, glowing, and smelled pretty darn good after I got out of the bed. I usually shower right after tanning because of the smell, didn&#x27;t have to after using Black. My husband said he couldn&#x27;t tell I had been tanning, that was the true test for this lotion. I could tell immediately afterwards that I appeared darker. I will order from this seller again, since I had such a good experience this time. I&#x27;m going to put up two pictures.</li>
            <li> I did not get as dark when I used this 1 versus the black I bought in the tanning salon</li>
            <li> After careful consideration and alot of review searching, I decided to give it a try. Seemed a little expensive but after reading several  positive reviews, I decided to buy it. I was very disappointed.  It did not give me the dark tan that the reviews claimed it would do. I used it for a full week to give it time to work but it failed to deliver. Will not buy again. I don&#x27;t know if it was old or the fact that it was not sealed when I received it or what, but I won&#x27;t spend that much money for something that is just as effective as the inexpensive brands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!  Goes on smooth, smells great and works very well.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I could not decide on which tanning lotion I was going to buy but I remembered my mom&#x27;s friend was using this at one point and it is definitely worth it! I would buy it again.. and buying it inside of tanning salons your going to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion hoping that it would be as good as the lotion that I buy at the tanning salon, but it really isn&#x27;t anything special.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my tan.  It smells better, but as far as my tan goes, it hasn&#x27;t made much difference.  But, for the price, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been too surprised.</li>
            <li> After reading many many bad reviews and many good I decided to purchase I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it same exact one that I would of purchased for 3x the price at salon I don&#x27;t know how but it is awesome! Thank you very much!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Soooo I love this tanning lotion you barley feel it when you put it on and it literally gives you amazing results! Never been this tan :\</li>
            <li> I have used many lotions, I like bronzers best. This is the best I have ever used, never streaks, goes on so smooth and smells great! I am a red head with fair skin, using this lotion helps me get warm natural color which I love !!! It work ;)))) the price is fabulous too!</li>
            <li> Ok, this product was about $35.00 and it is $115.00 at the tanning salon I go to, do I have to say anything else!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and gets you really bronzed. Lasts a while too, way better price then getting in a salon. I am going to buy again when my bottle runs out!:)</li>
            <li> I received a phone call from this company, complaining of my giving them a 3 star rating. I offered to change it, since it was not the comapnies fault their tanning lotion did not work for me, but then after receiving two e-mails from them as a reminder to change the rating, I decided not to because 1. It is MY opinion, why should I change it for their benefit &amp; 2. I will not be harrassed. Afterall it was my money gone to waste.  This was the e-mail I received after simply telling them to leave me alone..  ?  Are you the same person we spoke to on the phone?  What do you mean overpriced this lotion retails for $101.00 and you bought it for 33.00 with free priority mail.  The lotion does not work for you ah?  How come i sold 2000 bottles of this in January without one complaint?  You will not hear from us again since you are obviously malicious.  0 stars, because the actual product did not work, and the customer service/company SUCKS.</li>
            <li> If it were possible to give zero stars, I would. I was so excited to order this lotion, choosing to trust the 4-5 star reviews instead of the 1 star ones. Upon opening the box, I was immediately weary of the badly crushed and OBVIOUSLY PREVIOUSLY OPENED blister pack. The bottle itself is normally sealed in plastic, over the bottle AND the cap - the plastic was sliced off, probably with an xacto knife, around the bottom of the bottleneck - which normally one needs to rip prior to first use. I should have repacked it and printed a return label right away, but being out of everything else, I figured I would give it a try and just not order from this seller again. I showered and exfoliated as I normally would prior to using any bronzer. The lotion felt ok - silky, though a bit runny. The &#x27;grapefruit&#x27; smell is IMO not even close to the real thing and there is a horrible chemical quality to the smell. I put it all over my skin and did some tasks to let it absorb before going to bed. At one point, I rubbed my arm agains a piece of furniture and felt like there was something there so i went to brush it off - imagine my shock, when I saw that the lotion settled in a FILM on my skin, with zero absorption, and as I ran my hands over other areas, it all came off in these tiny disgusting rolls, like peeling skin!!! I had to re-shower and now it is late at night, I won&#x27;t have the nice color I wanted for tomorrow&#x27;s event and I am very angry and disappointed. I will be returning this item and leaving a complaint with Amazon. Judging from the smell, this is a very old or heat damaged lotion, which the seller is opening and diluting. UGH!!!</li>
            <li> Long time buyer of Designer Skin products; always bought online. I am happy with this product because it works awesome. Keep it on for 4-24 hours after tanning to let the bronzers work fully..</li>
            <li> This is my third product in the DS line.  I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement over any other lotion.  I was expecting it to extend my tan even more.</li>
            <li> product already opened with lotion smeared on the side! and it smelled nothing like the original. horrible service, i am very disappointed i really like designer skin</li>
            <li> Its nice and smells great</li>
            <li> Read SO many good reviews about this product and I am extremely glad I got it. I have used it twice and I am already noticing a huge difference in my tan and how moisturized my skin is. I have very sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use many lotions but this one is amazing. I have recommended it to everyone and will never use a different tanning lotion again!</li>
            <li> I tan during the cooler months and I have used MANY tanning lotions but especially love Designer Skin.  I bought this and use it just once, yesterday.  It&#x27;s smells wonderful!!  I had gorgeous color after just one use and looks beautiful.  If you are on the fence about trying this, go for it.  It&#x27;s a great lotion!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff</li>
            <li> This lotion had a nice scent. The bronzers helped me tan and the moisturizers were helpful as well to keep my skin from drying out. A slight downfall is tanning more frequently to maintain/increase my tan. For the price this is an excellent buy, and the product was even shipped to my house before it was expected to arrive!</li>
            <li> Second favorite lotion next to Luminary.</li>
            <li> I strictly use Designer Skin products for tanning. I am well-versed with Black, Luminary, and other silicon-based tanning lotions. This particular bottle of &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; is creamy, thick, and does not spread well over the skin. The lotion itself is discoloured and smells strange. I&#x27;ve been using Black for years and this is not the same thing. Absolutely fake.</li>
            <li> I BELIEVE THIS IS A SCAM. I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY FRIEND AND SHE HAS USED THIS LOTION ALOT.  SHE DOES BODY BUILDING SHOWS.  SHE BROKE OUT ALL OVER IN BLISTERS AND STARTED ITCHING REAL BAD.  IT LOOKS LIKE THE SAME, BUT WHEN I RECIEVED IT, IT WAS IN LIKE A PLASTIC BOX TO LOOK LIKE IT WAS SEALED AND FRESH. I WILL NEVER BY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product..sells for.almost $100 dollars in the tanning salon...the only drawback is that it will turn your hands yellow if you dont wash right after using..and even then it still does..the scent is ok..but I have had better lotions for a lot less...just dont see the big draw for it or why its so overpriced..and I am an experienced tanner</li>
            <li> Thank you!  I was thrilled to find my favorite tanning lotion on Amazon at at third of the cost in the salon.  The product is the same, I cannot tell a difference, if there is one.  I would definatley purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and helps with my tan every time I use it. Sell for over $100 at my tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a better insta bronze-&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not terrible. not too &amp;#34;tanning lotion&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;for this price vs my local retail who is charging $100 for it, I say I got a pretty dang good deal.&lt;br /&gt;The metal name plate is weird and I ripped it off.</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty average on this product, nothing to drive home about.  With that being said, the product itself I LOVE! Smells great before and after tan.  Sealed well, and I did not encounter any explosions.  The seller even sent me a free sample of Grease tanning lotion.  Would absolutely buy from this seller again.  As far as the lotion. Already darker after 1 session!! I would recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware!  This is not the real thing! I did a little research because I was so surprised by the cheap price tag.  I contacted the actual Designer Skin company through their customer service line and was told that the product being sold through Amazon is most likely counterfeit or \\&quot;Old Stock\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Designer Skin, is committed to a salon-only policy of sales and distribution of our indoor tanning lotions. Our products produce optimum results when chosen and sold by trained tanning salon professionals who understand their clients&#x27; tanning needs and objectives.

            <li> I worked in a tanning salon for about 6 years and have tried every bronzer out there. This stuff is amazing!! Definitely my favorite lotion! SO happy I was able to get it for dirt cheap compared to the $100 it usually goes for in the salon! Can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> Came brand new and I love the product!  I would recommend Designer Skin to anyone who is looking to get a healthy even tan!</li>
            <li> I have ordered tanning lotions from amazon many times and had no issues. I was at a standpoint in my tan and wated to try something new. When I ordered Designer Skin Black the reviews seemed great. Thought I would give it a try. The smell is good as everyone has said but that is the only plus. It was a light peach color with no bronzer what so ever in it. and it was so runny that i just felt like i covered myself in water before I got into the tanning bed. After tanning the lotion started to flake off my skin. And the after smell was bad. I waited the suggested 4 hours before showering for the best possible results and there was nothing! No results what so ever! Plus the worst part even after I showered I still smelled like that horrible after tan. Never buying this product again. I am begining to think that if its not a Devoted Creations product that it will be useless to buy. I want my money back!</li>
            <li> this feels so good for the tanning bed and does not stink like most lotions worth the buy if you use the tanning bets</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years. I know the way it looks, smells and feels on my skin. I know with 100% certainty that this stuff is legit. I will order this again because it is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than buying it from a tannjng salon.</li>
            <li> Smelled ok and worked good</li>
            <li> Disappointed. I expected better results. I did buy another bottle in hopes it proves me wrong. Price was good though</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps give an amazing tan and great company to order from!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because it was so cheap but as soon as I received this produce I was noticing results instantly thank you!</li>
            <li> used it but left my skin very streaky</li>
            <li> This is a totally Amazing Seller!!! I recieved the next day (today) as paid for and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!! It&#x27;s new and sealed and just perfect!!! Not to mention this product is off the charts crazy good :))  the best Bronzer on the market and saved over half buying it off Amazon!!! Highly, highly recommend this Seller &amp; Deigner Skin&#x27;s Black 20x Bronzing Body Silk!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she tanned fast!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this lotion anywhere and found it here on Amazon!!! love it and will be ordering it a lot more!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Smells good, not oily, nor streaky. I&#x27;ve used other lotions in the past and I feel dirty and smelly after I tan. With Black, I don&#x27;t get oily or sticky. Its easy to apply and smells good, like a citrus grape fruit smell. It works fast and lasts a long time. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning on and off for 7 years and have gone threw plenty tanning products from the most expensive to reasonably cheap, with not much difference in color this bottle definitely gives you a great non orange color and tanning will appear only after a few couple tanning bed session. Long lasting color and good price for it! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Nice feeling, makes skin soft. Smells good, and will get you a great looking tan. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be the original, not some knock off.  It works well and has an OK scent. I don&#x27;t really notice any bronzing effect to this product.</li>
            <li> Love this for tanning</li>
            <li> Black 20X by Designer Skin has a nice feel, smell and gave good tanning results. Would purchase this product again and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Works great! Gives natural color when used in tanning bed. I havent used it in the sun. Much better price than at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> For the price compared to the sister product ( Most tanning salons don&#x27;t carry Black any longer because manufacture has updated it &amp; improved it) it&#x27;s a bargain, that being said it is heavily watered down &amp; doesn&#x27;t bronze as well as other products do. But it does make skin silky soft. Over all, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Good product and smells really good! I don&#x27;t feel like I have to tan as often now that I use this lotion. My tan doesn&#x27;t fade as quickly!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as decribed!! Came in on time.  Also so much cheaper than buying it from th stores!! I am very happy with this purchase!! It also give you great color and smells great!!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product! The price is so much cheaper than in tanning salons! It gets you so dark also and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells Good! Dries Fast and I believe to be the legit stuff (not old or tampered with) but I didn&#x27;t get the brozing effect that I thought I would! Good Moisterizing Ingredients!</li>
            <li> Great ! Smells good and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fake! It does not increase your tan at all, its just some good smelling lotion in a bottle that looks like Designer Skin&#x60;s Black 20x. BAAAAAADDDDDDDDD DOOOOO NOOOOOTT BUYYYYYYYY! I just wasted my money, don&#x60;t let it happen to you. Idk how this even got 4 stars...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of lotions and stopped with any others when I discovered this a few years ago.  Nice smell, keeps you from burning and helps with a nice even tan.  So much cheaper on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It smells great, make a your skin silky soft, helps you get a dark tan fast, and its cheap! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Never had any problems with this tanning lotion! I Will be buying this again Fur Sure!</li>
            <li> This lotion was good enough and It had a great after tan smell. The bronzers worked nicely as well. Decent buy overall shipped quickly</li>
            <li> It works great and it smells amazing! I bought it to get a quick tan before my senior prom and I love it!</li>
            <li> The lotion was ok, not amazing. I did see some color from it, but not as much as some people are saying. Not orangey at all which is a plus and the bottle is cute!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and this price is very affordable.  Excellent bronzers.  Not a big fan of the smell though.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, smells amazing, and gave me a nice bronze tan that everyone compliments</li>
            <li> I was very happy with buying this product,I am still using it and loving it,I always recommend this product to everyone  and buying it here saves money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I love it. Really keeps my skin moisturized for as much sun as I am in. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> I have used a few of different lotions over the years. For a couple of years I was very satisfied with the &amp;#34;Smile You Are Dark&amp;#34; products. However I tried this and haven&#x27;t looked back. I am naturally quite fair so the bronzers in this do a great job of giving me a natural looking color. I just got done using &amp;#34;The Phoenician&amp;#34; after looking at the rave reviews (especially for people with fair skin). However it just didn&#x27;t cut it and the differences were stark.</li>
            <li> Love it  it is just as stated and a great value half the price of tanning salons will order again</li>
            <li> Great product! Love tanning and this got me dark, also came quickly. Will use this product again! Also, instead of leaving your skin sort of orange and streaky in places (like between your fingers) like a lot of lotions with bronzers, it gives you really good natural color. The company answered all of my questions and were prompt and courteous. Will be buying from this seller again. The price was fair and shipped as promised. No downsides really, I can&#x27;t see why so many people insist on commenting with these &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; comments.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Don&#x27;t normally tan easily, if I have somewhere to go I can tan just a couple times and have a noticeable tan. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from my tanning salon before and loved it, but hated the price (around $100). Since I have joined the amazon world, I decided to look for it on here. This helps boost my tan quickly and has a grapefruit scent to it, which I like much better than the scents of other tanning lotaions I have used. Great lotion for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lotion. I would purchase this again in a heartbeat. I got very dark and it leaves your skin very soft. 10 stars. :)</li>
            <li> My son and daughter love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Great lotion. I got great tan and the smell of the lotion was better than most of the lotions I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! I would recommend it to anyone! Awesome!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this lotion after trying the &#x27;Black Storm&#x27; and hating it. This is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried. It smells delicious, makes your skin feel soft, and I noticed a difference after just one session. I&#x27;ll probably stick to this lotion for a longggg time.</li>
            <li> Smells good-doesn&#x27;t make you orange! Nice glow!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion. It smells great and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and definitely improves color after a few uses. My local salon has this for sale for around $80-$100 and I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it cheaper.</li>
            <li> This lotion did not do much as everyone is saying it does I have used other lotions that cost less then this and got me really dark I was not pleased will not buy again going back to JWOWW lotion much better and smells great</li>
            <li> This is clearly fake.  The bottle came wrapped in plastic and clearly was unsealed by whoever refilled it with something other than the real thing.  Furthermore, the label was glued on CROOKED, which was my first red flag.  Still curious I read through many other reviews and learned that if I put a little dab on the back of my hand, the real thing would bronze it a shade darker than the other.  NOTHING.  It also did not smell great like I had been expecting.  It smelled like a bad mix of chemicals and did not have the smooth and silky feel as it absorbed into the skin that I&#x27;d been promised.  Instead, it sat on top of my skin and eventually flaked off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion. There are newer ones but I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Color was somewhat orange. More a a bronzer than intensifier. Other than that, satisfied with product. Def provided gave more color with minimal use.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and designer skin shipped super fast. Would recommend and not the first time I have purchased from them.</li>
            <li> Legit product, we compared it to a bottle at the tanning salon. Color, consistency and smell were identical. Great tanner, my skin is a nice golden brown.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I want, and it is much more cheaper than I buy in local salon...</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I have to admit that the bottle looks cool. But for the price that the salons are selling this stuff at (over 100.00 in the tanning salons) - I clearly do not notice any difference in my tan. I am even tanning more frequent and still haven&#x27;t notice any real difference. I like the price I got on Amazon but for the tan - its not the hot shot item its been claimed to be for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The last time I purchased this product I paid $110.00 in the tanning salon. Then I purchased three products from Amazon for $85.00. Very satisfied and I know I got my moneys worth. This product is awesome. Great bronzer. I tan really easy. I haven&#x27;t been in a tanning bed for three months. I just started back up this week and have only went three times and I already have a amazing color. Very satisfied! I will purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with the results of this lotion. I spent $35 (which was higher than all of the other lotions I was looking at) and I feel like I wasted my money. I tanned every day for two weeks in all high level stand up beds at my salon and did not get dark. I&#x27;ve previously used lotions I have bought from amazon and they got my tanner than this product and were half the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried different lotions and Black by Designer Skin is thee best lotion ......for me! I have never experienced the orange-ness some bronzers can cause. Def purchase again.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference from my normal bronzer on the first use.  It is a great moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> THIS LOTION IS FAKE!!! ITS LIKE A PINK COLOR WHEN IT IS SUPPOSE  TO BE BROWN TOOK IT TO A TANNING SALON THAT HAD THE SAME LOTION AND WE COMPARED IT ANS I WAS SO EMBARRASSED OF HOW DIFFERENT THEY WERE. I ALSO GOT IN CONTACT WITH DESIGNER SKIN AND THEY TOLD ME THE ONLY SELL TOP SALONS SO HOW THESE PEOPLE GET THIS LOTION IS UNKNOWN I RATE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO RATE IT BUT IT SHOULD GET 0</li>
            <li> Great buy vs paying tanning bed store prices!!</li>
            <li> This product is great if you want to spend less time tanning.  It seems to get me darker faster.  I don&#x27;t have to tan everyday, after base tan, once or twice a week.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It came with much bronzer out of container :( i Dont know why</li>
            <li> Great cost and love the lotion, it helps me from burning when I used this.&lt;br /&gt;Great value as the cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was going on a cruise in 10 days, started tanning with this lotion and by the time I went on the cruise I had nice color. I wasn&#x27;t orange.</li>
            <li> I like the way this lotion smells, which is one thing about which I am very picky. However, it is not as dark as I had hoped. I like a good bit of color to my bronzing lotions and this one is okay but it&#x27;s not very dark. I bought a sample of Designer Skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;Adore&amp;#34; from my salon and I think I will purchase that one next.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is good, it has a great texture and leaves my skin soft and it smells good but it&#x27;s not one of my personal favorites. It hasn&#x27;t made me much darker. I would recommend it to someone starting out in the tanning bed, but not to someone who is trying to get darker than they already are. Good starter lotion, not a good plateau-breaker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of this lotion.. Smells great, and works well! Finding it at this price was a steal.. I&#x27;ll always buy my future lotions via amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! its smells absolutely awesome! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I recieved this lotion a couple days before it was actually supposed to arrive which made me really happy ! It was sealed when I opened it and smelled/looked like its supposed to. I used it today and I already see a difference ! I&#x27;m excited to see what a couple more tans will look like. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product !!</li>
            <li> Smells and works great. Love this stuff and super fast delivery was awesome!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great on fair skin!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be without this product. I use it for everyday lotion because it makes my skin feel so silky. Plus, it smells great!</li>
            <li> I bought this from East West Beauty! It&#x27;s legit! Shipped quick, responded to me quick and I&#x27;ll totally buy my next bottle from them aswell because they&#x27;re one of the cheapest! I used to work at a tanning salon so I&#x27;ve tried TONS of lotions and this is one of my favorite now. I&#x27;ve got color within 3 tans, but personally I think Adore and Splurge are the best for getting color fast that lasts! It leaves like a matte feel after you put it on which I love! Your body isn&#x27;t greasy like other lotions I&#x27;ve used. AMAZING after smell. Designer skin is THE best of the best when it comes to tanning lotions. Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this lotion.  Loved the smell, and the color I have is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This lotion peeled off my skin when I rubbed it. Not to mention it was in an Obsidian by Designer Skin looking bottle with the Black emblem. The lotion itself doesn&#x27;t look the same as the salon&#x27;s either. I did some research and companies like Designer Skin DON&#x27;T sell online. They are strictly salon based. NEVER buying this P.O.S again. Salons are the only way to go when buying tanning lotion. There is a reason why these lotions are so cheap on here. THEY&#x27;RE NOT REAL! I wish I could chose ZERO STARS!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, works great.I noticed a difference the first time I used it .I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Tried this lotion for the first time yesterday. I was really impressed. I got really good color, It spreads well, the bronzers are nice and very nice about not staining your hands or looking fake. The best part was my skin felt like a dream when I got out of the tanning bed..So silky smooth! The reasons I gave it a 4 (I would have given it a 4 1/2 if I could) Is because the smell could be a little better although it is not bad and I felt like I was going through it kinda quickly,,,other than that it was an all over great lotion. I would recommend it to anyone,,even if just for the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> this does not give immediate color but does smell great and seems to work ok</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion! I have previously been using an apparent lower grade lotion purchased at my local salon. I immediately noticed a difference in skin color after just one use of this product. Not only did it exceed my expectations, the price was half that of my local salon. Great product! Great seller! Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Reviews had me nervous. I love Black and its the only thing I use. Its better then what the tanning place sales it for and 20x&#x27;s less then what they sale it for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell so I will not be buying this lotion again</li>
            <li> My hubby hates tanning but we have a Caribbean cruise coming up and needed to tan after winter. He did not want any &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; scent. Both of us love the feel of our skin and the scent is great. After one session, he love it.  We loved our cruise too</li>
            <li> Black is the BEST!!!!!!! I wont use anything else and I&#x27;m 57 years old!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, gives you good color, BUT usually leaves a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe this is the real product!! Very smelly and doesn&#x27;t really do anything for your tan/bronze.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the overall package, this is a great choice! It is hands down the best feeling wise and becomes addicting because of the way it leaves your akin feeling (especially when you use the Black after tan : extender/moisturizer after using this. It is not the darkest bronzer you can find but it gets the job done! Of course I would suggest rotating your lotions regardless so that your akin doesn&#x27;t get too accustomed to one particular lotion, though I would recommend this as one of the lotions that you choose to rotate between! But DO NOT purchase it at high cost at your salon! Find it cheaper through amazon or ebay, THOUGH CHECK THE LOTION AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE IT so that you can tell if it has separated or if it&#x27;s the way it is supposed to be. If you have good luck with getting it thru someone online I suggest always going thru that same person. and also purchase from someone who will refund you if there is a problem with the lotion once you receive it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ordered this product online. It came to me FAST, and exactly how it was advertised and described. I will definetly be buying my product here again :)</li>
            <li> I visibly tanned much faster when using this lotion. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy. The lotion is very smooth and smells great even when you get out of the tanning bed. Overall a really decent deal since your other option is pay $100 for the same product at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best lotions i&#x27;ve ever used. Just make sure that when you are buying tanning lotion off of amazon you are buying it from sellers that are legit.</li>
            <li> product was same in picture and new. very satisfied  with purchase I recommend. product was shipped pretty quick and overall great purchase</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this lotion bur i have used it twice now seeing as I dont tan much and I have noticed a difference in color. I am very pleased with the lotion and the smell is amazing. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> other designer skin products better...they say 20X theres not even 5X.. plus the citrusy grapefruit smell is awful. Worship Me is better.</li>
            <li> I am an experienced tanner and this lotion is great! very good color no streaking and not too bad of an after smell at all</li>
            <li> At the time I purchased this I never bothered to write a review, but I need to let others know this definitely fake. I use Designer Skin products frequently and this is not the real thing. The price is what caught my attention. I was surprised to see Designer Skin product priced so low. I thought it was the real thing.  It is some other lotion in the packaging of Designer Skin Back 20X. I still had some lotion left over from the Designer Skin Black 20X I purchased at the tanning salon I go to and compared to the one I purchased on Amazon. The color of the lotions are not the same. The packaging of the bottle does not match the one also that is purchased at a tanning salon. Also, it does not get absorbed well into the skin when you apply it.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. I should have never bought it. I though I would give it a try. I get very dark in the summer but wanted to get a head start so I ended up with another product.</li>
            <li> Purchased from All American Tanning.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the lot, the company I purchased it from, or just me, but I completely lost my dark base tan using this product.  I might as well had just put on body lotion and tanned.  I had tanned much darker using a level one tanning product that I had purchased from my salon that didn&#x27;t even have a bronzer in it, then upgraded to this product and lost everything I had gained.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for indoor tanning and smells amazing! I have a great dark tan and it looks natural. It does smell great and leaves me glowing. The package came as promised and came very fast! Great seller!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister cause she couldn&#x27;t really afford the 100 dollars they want for it at the salon. She loves it it worked out really well for her.</li>
            <li> loved the moist feel on my skin tanned really great. i would recommend this highly be sure to wash hands or it will leave stain was only thing no so good</li>
            <li> I love it! My skin looks nice. It is my first product like that. Fast shipment, no complication. I receive many complements about my tan.</li>
