            <li>Good quality brush draws a fine line.</li>

            <li>The upside to that is it gives you much more control.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in love for the products of Sigma.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Using this brush, I am finally able to both cover the spot AND blend the edges so that I end up with a &amp;#34;photoshopped&amp;#34; effect where the spot truly disappears.</li>
            <li>I love sigma brushes, except for this one.</li>
            <li>they are much better (yet cheaper) than sephora brand eye pencils</li>
            <li>It is very fine, which is perfect, and the bristles are quite long.</li>
            <li>its soft and does its job really good!..</li>
            <li>highly recommend it for those experienced in liquid makeup.</li>
            <li>As a lover of gel eyeliner, I have spent too many hours and too many pounds trying to find the perfect brush for application.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent one, providing you&#x27;re not new to liquid or gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I am able to do my wing with it just fine.</li>
            <li>I just recently started learning how to put on eyeliner using a brush with Gel liner and this one is very good.</li>
            <li>worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li>Plus the delivery is always very quick, well packed</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to control.</li>
            <li>The bristles bend fairly easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I can make a perfect wing now and get right into the inner corner of the eye.</li>
            <li>this E10 brush creates a fine line and is easily controlled.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a fine eye liner brush as I use the cake eyeliner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for both straight liners and winged looks (though prefer it with more of a classic liner look)</li>
            <li>Fine and flexible to a degree and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Lots of brushes available.</li>
            <li>It is too flimsy to give a precise application.</li>
            <li>and she was right!</li>
            <li>Ideal for the new gel eye liner application that last longer and almost seems like water proof!</li>
            <li>Other brushes are great though.</li>
            <li>Great brush, I use it with a little water or makeup fixative to make eyeliner from eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Sigma brushes are never a disappointment.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It gets the perfect thin line everytime</li>
            <li>Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it with my gel eyeliners, and it draws a perfect thin line without having to pull my eyelid taut.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and the quality on sigma products is amazing.. soft to the touch..</li>
            <li>recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time.</li>
            <li>You get right at the lash line .</li>
            <li>Shipped right away and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I ordered the right one</li>
            <li>Liner brush had multiple bristles poking out (4) and the brush is really not &amp;#34;small.&amp;#34; There are many other eye liner brushes that are much smaller and allow for a more precise application of gel liner for the perfect cat eye flick.</li>
            <li>This is a very tiny, very precise brush.  </li>
            <li>The best eyeliner brush I&#x27;ve ever used (and I have really expensive ones).  </li>
            <li>The first one must&#x27;ve came w something else I ordered</li>
            <li>I think they are waaaaaaay better than M.A.C. brushes and are about the same price.</li>
            <li>I love using this brush to apply my MAC fluid line gel.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily and has held its shape well after several cleanings</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about 2 weeks, so not too sure about how well it will hold up, but I have been washing it after every use and it still seems brand new.</li>
            <li>It is super thin and allows good control.  </li>
            <li>So hard to find good cake eyeliner brushes.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>I cant decide if I really like it or not just yet.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too big and the liner does not glide on smooth like the Sigma.</li>
            <li>Applies gel liner very well.  </li>
            <li>Real deal sigma.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>With a steady hand, I&#x27;ve been able to draw on thin and thick eyeliner, as well as flick the perfect cat or winged tips.</li>
            <li>This one is a real winner (my other favorite is the Sigma pencil brush).</li>
            <li>I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed just a basic small eyeliner brush for my mac blacktrack gel liner and this brush works great because it helps the application of the liner to be a bit easier than using an angledon&#x27;t eyeliner brush</li>
            <li>bristles are of a high quality, very supple.</li>
            <li>Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overall an awesome liner brush because the tip is so thin and can make clean thin lines really easily.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this brush + Dermablend stick as a power concealer combo.</li>
            <li>The brush is very small and gives such a precise line, it&#x27;s also very easy to do a winged cat eye.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>The downside is if you&#x27;re new to using this type of makeup it takes some practice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just recently bought my first Sigma brush kit, the Complete Kit plus another 8 brushes to go with them.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly without a mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just starting out in makeup and not experienced with making good lines.</li>
            <li>Unlike with fingers or other brushes I tried, it&#x27;s quite easy to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; just a tiny bit of the concealer and keep dabbing on without removing the previous layer (or as Lisa Eldridge calls it, &amp;#34;stippling&amp;#34;), resulting in seamless coverage.</li>
            <li>I wanted a brush that gave me the eyeliner look that was not thick, almost as if you couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing eyeliner, but you could see something different about my eyes, how they just POP!</li>
            <li>Only thing I hate is cleaning it lol !!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with eyeliner for years and using this brush, I&#x27;ve been able to attain the thinnest of thin wings.</li>
            <li>After searching for years for something to cover my sun spots, and striking out on multiple brands because brown spots are notoriously hard to conceal, I&#x27;ve finally discovered Dermablend QuickFix concealer which is super thick and pigmented</li>
            <li>I started using Latisse and hated the brushes provided with the product, this brush is perfect and I only need one drop for both eyes.  </li>
            <li>I still need a little more practice, but I&#x27;m getting there with the help of this small brush.</li>

            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I can make a perfect wing now and get right into the inner corner of the eye.</li>
            <li> this E10 brush creates a fine line and is easily controlled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a fine eye liner brush as I use the cake eyeliner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for both straight liners and winged looks (though prefer it with more of a classic liner look)</li>
            <li> Fine and flexible to a degree and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes available.</li>
            <li> It is too flimsy to give a precise application.</li>
            <li> and she was right!</li>
            <li> Ideal for the new gel eye liner application that last longer and almost seems like water proof!</li>
            <li> Other brushes are great though.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I use it with a little water or makeup fixative to make eyeliner from eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are never a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It gets the perfect thin line everytime</li>
            <li> Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it with my gel eyeliners, and it draws a perfect thin line without having to pull my eyelid taut.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and the quality on sigma products is amazing.. soft to the touch..</li>
            <li> recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time.</li>
            <li> You get right at the lash line .</li>
            <li> Shipped right away and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I ordered the right one</li>
            <li> Liner brush had multiple bristles poking out (4) and the brush is really not &amp;#34;small.&amp;#34; There are many other eye liner brushes that are much smaller and allow for a more precise application of gel liner for the perfect cat eye flick.</li>
            <li> This is a very tiny, very precise brush.  </li>
            <li> The best eyeliner brush I&#x27;ve ever used (and I have really expensive ones).  </li>
            <li> The first one must&#x27;ve came w something else I ordered</li>
            <li> I think they are waaaaaaay better than M.A.C. brushes and are about the same price.</li>
            <li> I love using this brush to apply my MAC fluid line gel.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily and has held its shape well after several cleanings</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about 2 weeks, so not too sure about how well it will hold up, but I have been washing it after every use and it still seems brand new.</li>
            <li> It is super thin and allows good control.  </li>
            <li> So hard to find good cake eyeliner brushes.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I cant decide if I really like it or not just yet.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too big and the liner does not glide on smooth like the Sigma.</li>
            <li> Applies gel liner very well.  </li>
            <li> Real deal sigma.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> With a steady hand, I&#x27;ve been able to draw on thin and thick eyeliner, as well as flick the perfect cat or winged tips.</li>
            <li> This one is a real winner (my other favorite is the Sigma pencil brush).</li>
            <li> I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed just a basic small eyeliner brush for my mac blacktrack gel liner and this brush works great because it helps the application of the liner to be a bit easier than using an angledon&#x27;t eyeliner brush</li>
            <li> bristles are of a high quality, very supple.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overall an awesome liner brush because the tip is so thin and can make clean thin lines really easily.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this brush + Dermablend stick as a power concealer combo.</li>
            <li> The brush is very small and gives such a precise line, it&#x27;s also very easy to do a winged cat eye.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The downside is if you&#x27;re new to using this type of makeup it takes some practice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just recently bought my first Sigma brush kit, the Complete Kit plus another 8 brushes to go with them.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly without a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting out in makeup and not experienced with making good lines.</li>
            <li> Unlike with fingers or other brushes I tried, it&#x27;s quite easy to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; just a tiny bit of the concealer and keep dabbing on without removing the previous layer (or as Lisa Eldridge calls it, &amp;#34;stippling&amp;#34;), resulting in seamless coverage.</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush that gave me the eyeliner look that was not thick, almost as if you couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing eyeliner, but you could see something different about my eyes, how they just POP!</li>
            <li> Only thing I hate is cleaning it lol !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with eyeliner for years and using this brush, I&#x27;ve been able to attain the thinnest of thin wings.</li>
            <li> After searching for years for something to cover my sun spots, and striking out on multiple brands because brown spots are notoriously hard to conceal, I&#x27;ve finally discovered Dermablend QuickFix concealer which is super thick and pigmented</li>
            <li> I started using Latisse and hated the brushes provided with the product, this brush is perfect and I only need one drop for both eyes.  </li>
            <li> I still need a little more practice, but I&#x27;m getting there with the help of this small brush.</li>
            <li> The only reason I have it four stars is cause the brush is so soft that sometimes it has a hard time picking up my gel liner--which could be my fault since my liner is pretty dry.</li>
            <li> Still works very well, but not as stiff as I hopped.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one and use it everyday w my Bobbie Brown gel eye liner I have her eye liner</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I originally was using  the sigma E05 which was a little to thick to apply my cream eyeliner.</li>
            <li> find it&#x27;s a tad too long</li>
            <li> I am collecting a few Sigma brushes because I just don&#x27;t always want to pay MAC prices for something so basic.  </li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to fix the broken brush</li>
            <li> Not a fine enough point.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of person (like me) who has a hard time applying a thin straight line on your eye, this brush is for you.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mess up.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday with my MAC Fluidline and Chromaline eyeliners.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand how a brush could have been sent completely damaged and unable to use.</li>
            <li> However, due to the thickness of the concealer, it is also quite hard to blend, so I ended up covering the spots but now having the concealer itself be  visible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, thin, flexible but not too limp.</li>
            <li> A good gel eyeliner brush should be thick at the base and narrow at the tip to allow for thick lines when applying heavier pressure or thin lines using just the tip.</li>
            <li> It creates a thin or thick line and the bristles actually stay together.  </li>
            <li> This small eye liner brush makes applying eye liner easier.</li>
            <li> Small, precision, ease of handling and detailed......perfect.</li>
            <li> If the tip of the brush is too thick it starts to smudge</li>
            <li> The brush is very small but the hairs are haywire.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a thin line like I wanted</li>
            <li> All were mediocre compared to the Sigma E10.</li>
            <li> and I like a very thin line.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>

            <li> This Sigma brush is the best I&#x27;ve used for applying my tarte Amazonian Clay Pot Liner and my Bobbi Brown liners. The brush is very small and gives such a precise line, it&#x27;s also very easy to do a winged cat eye. I just recently bought my first Sigma brush kit, the Complete Kit plus another 8 brushes to go with them. I am so pleased with the performance of these brushes, I don&#x27;t know how I applied makeup with the brushes I was using before! I highly recommend the Sigma F80 for foundation application, amazing sturdy brush!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it! Works great. I used it with Mac liquid gel liner. I couldn&#x27;t get a thin line like I wanted but I&#x27;m still happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> Once again great stuff, I was told by a friend from Brazil that this was very good quality Brushes and she was right! Ideal for the new gel eye liner application that last longer and almost seems like water proof! Plus the delivery is always very quick, well packed and I could track it!</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner brush I&#x27;ve ever used (and I have really expensive ones).  The handle isn&#x27;t flimsy and has a nice weight to it.  This is more like an artist&#x27;s brush!  Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Very good!  Excellent!</li>
            <li> This is just what you would expect it to be.  Fine and flexible to a degree and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Liner brush had multiple bristles poking out (4) and the brush is really not &amp;#34;small.&amp;#34; There are many other eye liner brushes that are much smaller and allow for a more precise application of gel liner for the perfect cat eye flick.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. I just recently started learning how to put on eyeliner using a brush with Gel liner and this one is very good. You get right at the lash line . The brush is easy to control. great buy</li>
            <li> As a lover of gel eyeliner, I have spent too many hours and too many pounds trying to find the perfect brush for application. I have tried mac, no.7, and e.l.f. but though good, none gave the kind of precise line I wanted. I heard great things about sigma from the online beauty company so decided to give this one a try. I needn&#x27;t look any longer for a great brush, this is exactly what i have been wanting- a soft, dense, fine brush that gives my cat eyes the perfect point.</li>
            <li> After seeing a bunch of YouTubers recommend this brush, I decided to give it a try. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I use it everyday with my MAC Fluidline and Chromaline eyeliners.</li>
            <li> In love with this eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> this E10 brush creates a fine line and is easily controlled.  for a more noticeable line, reapply liner.  bristles are of a high quality, very supple.</li>
            <li> Great item! Based on a video I saw from Lisa Eldridge I bought this eye liner brush for concealer use. It works very well.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner brush and I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner brush. It is quality built and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> This is a very tiny, very precise brush.  The quality is excellent and will help you achieve the perfect cat-eye.  I am collecting a few Sigma brushes because I just don&#x27;t always want to pay MAC prices for something so basic.  This one is a real winner (my other favorite is the Sigma pencil brush).</li>
            <li> Thank you for the good quality product. I&#x27;ll be purchasing another style soon. Happy customer!</li>
            <li> I love all my sigma brushes. I originally was using  the sigma E05 which was a little to thick to apply my cream eyeliner. This one creates the perfect wing and a precise line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a fine eye liner brush as I use the cake eyeliner and I like a very thin line.  I am so pleased with this brush.  It&#x27;s perfect.  Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used liquid eyeliner for years now, and with it a number of eyeliner brushes. This is an excellent one, providing you&#x27;re not new to liquid or gel eyeliner. It is very fine, which is perfect, and the bristles are quite long. The upside to that is it gives you much more control. The downside is if you&#x27;re new to using this type of makeup it takes some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for those experienced in liquid makeup. If you&#x27;re newer, I would recommend a shorter bristle until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> The brush is dense which is great for applying the eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Worked great the first couple of times then the tip lost it pointiness. It&#x27;s also not as sturdy/stiff as I thought. The bristles bend fairly easy. It&#x27;s ok but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this pencil liner again.</li>
            <li> Bought this in suggestion of my favorite makeup artist, Lisa Eldridge, who pinpoints all her concealing.  It&#x27;s like magic.  Works wonders!</li>
            <li> This brush is ok for eyeliner. I cant decide if I really like it or not just yet. I feel it should be a bit thinner and the bristles could be closer together. That said, it gets the job done. I am able to do my wing with it just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner brush.  I have used it with bobbi brown eyeliner gel and make up forever aqua cream.  It creates a thin or thick line and the bristles actually stay together.  I have only been using it for about 2 weeks, so not too sure about how well it will hold up, but I have been washing it after every use and it still seems brand new.</li>
            <li> This brush makes putting on gel eyeliner a breeze! Plus the eyeliner looks perfect. Could not be happier with this brush! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This small eye liner brush makes applying eye liner easier.</li>
            <li> The perfect eyeliner brush. Great quality and nice tip.  Everyone that uses eyeliners should have this.  Yahoo yahoo yahoo.  And one more yahoo.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Sigma brushes!  This one is perfect for creating the smallest lines and getting in the corners.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite eyeliner brushes. It&#x27;s great for gel liner.</li>
            <li> Fine tipped and quite good.</li>
            <li> yassss!! its perfect. it is so easy to apply eye liner now!!!</li>
            <li> I totally love this brush.. if u want an eye liner brush this is the one u need!.. its soft and does its job really good!.. worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li> I bought 2. The first one must&#x27;ve came w something else I ordered and I just didnt notice it and got lost in the packaging and got thrown out. I ordered a new one and use it everyday w my Bobbie Brown gel eye liner I have her eye liner but it&#x27;s too big and the liner does not glide on smooth like the Sigma. Very happy w this</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are never a disappointment. I think they are waaaaaaay better than M.A.C. brushes and are about the same price. They make a good product. No compalnts.</li>
            <li> I will never apply gel/cream eyeliner with anything else ever again. I can make a perfect wing now and get right into the inner corner of the eye. I love this.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected. Still works very well, but not as stiff as I hopped.</li>
            <li> very precise I love it!</li>
            <li> well made brush!  Applies gel liner very well.  Well worth the price.  Shipped right away and arrived on time. Lots of brushes available.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush draws a fine line.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of person (like me) who has a hard time applying a thin straight line on your eye, this brush is for you. It gets the perfect thin line everytime and I don&#x27;t mess up. I&#x27;m just starting out in makeup and not experienced with making good lines. If the tip of the brush is too thick it starts to smudge and I have to wipe and go over. Not with this! I wanted a brush that gave me the eyeliner look that was not thick, almost as if you couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing eyeliner, but you could see something different about my eyes, how they just POP! I love this! definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this item. It&#x27;s smooth and easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes and I carry it with me everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> All hairs were falling off...... very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to fix the broken brush but there was no way to repair. Don&#x27;t understand how a brush could have been sent completely damaged and unable to use.</li>
            <li> The brush is very small but the hairs are haywire. I used the brush that came with my eye liner instead of this sigma e10. I will use this for conturing my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with eyeliner for years and using this brush, I&#x27;ve been able to attain the thinnest of thin wings. It&#x27;s incredible what you can accomplish with this brush. It&#x27;s great for both straight liners and winged looks (though prefer it with more of a classic liner look)</li>
            <li> This brush was very easy to use, and definitely authentic. For a beginner makeup wearer, I had no problem using this very fine liner brush with gel liners to line my eyes. A must have for your brush collection.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and very fine. I am sure it will last a long time. Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyce B. Kalamazoo, MI</li>
            <li> Love this eye liner brush. Real deal sigma. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I love using this brush to apply my MAC fluid line gel. Goes on smoothly without a mess. Definitely would recommend it!</li>
            <li> The sigma brushes are wonderful, the finishes of the shadows and application of blush and powder is fantastic. The brushes are very soft and fluffy. I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever brushes good, the best is even Sigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time. What is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love for the products of Sigma.</li>
            <li> Yea! I ordered the right one</li>
            <li> Gives a good fine line with gel liner.  Easy to use.  Would recommend for those wanting a close line or cat eye.</li>
            <li> This brush is awsome, if you like doin winged liner and need precision this is definely the brush for you!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just learning how to apply gel eyeliner and doing a cat eye. I must say this brush made it very easy. I still need a little more practice, but I&#x27;m getting there with the help of this small brush. Definitely for beginner&#x27;s. The brush doesn&#x27;t fall apart even after several times I used it.</li>
            <li> Small, precision, ease of handling and detailed......perfect.</li>
            <li> This serves it&#x27;s purpose well. I needed just a basic small eyeliner brush for my mac blacktrack gel liner and this brush works great because it helps the application of the liner to be a bit easier than using an angledon&#x27;t eyeliner brush so A+ !!! Only thing I hate is cleaning it lol !!!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for very thin lines in your lids !!! You can use creamy or liquid eyeliners and the result is perfect! I love it</li>
            <li> Nothing to say here, its my favourite brush, I use it with gel liner and can create all the looks</li>
            <li> great investment would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Not a fine enough point. A good gel eyeliner brush should be thick at the base and narrow at the tip to allow for thick lines when applying heavier pressure or thin lines using just the tip.</li>
            <li> Brush came with bristles permantly bent, I tried wetting them to put them back together but had no luck.</li>
            <li> I started using Latisse and hated the brushes provided with the product, this brush is perfect and I only need one drop for both eyes.  It is super thin and allows good control.  I do know that one drop is enough because I can feel the moisture when applying to the second eye.  I &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; the brush on my eyebrows and it still feels damp.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner brush! So hard to find good cake eyeliner brushes. Great price as well!</li>
            <li> This brush is well priced and performs perfectly. I&#x27;ve been using it with my gel eyeliners, and it draws a perfect thin line without having to pull my eyelid taut. Cleans easily and has held its shape well after several cleanings</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overall an awesome liner brush because the tip is so thin and can make clean thin lines really easily. The only reason I have it four stars is cause the brush is so soft that sometimes it has a hard time picking up my gel liner--which could be my fault since my liner is pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because it was used as a spot concealer brush in one of Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s videos. After searching for years for something to cover my sun spots, and striking out on multiple brands because brown spots are notoriously hard to conceal, I&#x27;ve finally discovered Dermablend QuickFix concealer which is super thick and pigmented so it actually covers those damn spots as well as doesn&#x27;t oxidate so the color remains the same throughout the day. However, due to the thickness of the concealer, it is also quite hard to blend, so I ended up covering the spots but now having the concealer itself be  visible. Using this brush, I am finally able to both cover the spot AND blend the edges so that I end up with a &amp;#34;photoshopped&amp;#34; effect where the spot truly disappears. Unlike with fingers or other brushes I tried, it&#x27;s quite easy to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; just a tiny bit of the concealer and keep dabbing on without removing the previous layer (or as Lisa Eldridge calls it, &amp;#34;stippling&amp;#34;), resulting in seamless coverage. I highly recommend using this brush + Dermablend stick as a power concealer combo.</li>
            <li> I love sigma brushes, except for this one. It is too flimsy to give a precise application. Other brushes are great though.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush! I&#x27;ve been very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Great brush, I use it with a little water or makeup fixative to make eyeliner from eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and the quality on sigma products is amazing.. soft to the touch.. they feel great on the face! they are much better (yet cheaper) than sephora brand eye pencils</li>
            <li> After 3 different brushes, I&#x27;ve finally found what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve tried thicker rounded brushes, slant edge brushes and even a different brand&#x27;s eyeliner brush. All were mediocre compared to the Sigma E10. This brush is great. It&#x27;s long, thin, flexible but not too limp. The bristles are soft but don&#x27;t fall out (even through rough cleanings, not one hair has fallen out). With a steady hand, I&#x27;ve been able to draw on thin and thick eyeliner, as well as flick the perfect cat or winged tips. Honestly so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it&#x27;s a tad too long but it&#x27;s nothing that I&#x27;d moan and groan about. I&#x27;d buy it again and again. Great brush, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
