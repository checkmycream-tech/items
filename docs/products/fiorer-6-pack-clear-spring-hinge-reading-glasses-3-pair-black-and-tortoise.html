            <li>First item in my order received, quick, quick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had such nice readers before.</li>
            <li>good glasses, the spring hinges make them fit better and less fragile then the glasses without the hinges.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>Excellent Reading Glasses, I have purchased a few times now and did go to another Vendor once and came right back to these guys.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend these glasses!</li>
            <li>I bought these for a friend and he was so happy with the first set that we came back and ordered him a second set.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated the price point and that there were 6 in the package because he tends to go through readers pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed</li>
            <li>They certainly are better made than the ones I was buying in our local stores.  </li>
            <li>They are true to the strength that I ordered &amp; so far have been very sturdy.</li>
            <li>fast delivery of described item</li>
            <li>I ordered the 3.50 and had them delivered straight to my mother&#x27;s house.  </li>
            <li>Being the old relic that I am, I rely on powerful reading glasses to help me see things up close.</li>
            <li>the frames are much sturdier.</li>
            <li>These are very helpful to the baha&#x27;is in our devotions</li>
            <li>He really like these glasses and has a pair in every room in our house so he can see when he struggles with reading.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy, not at all flimsy.</li>
            <li>Very cheep plastic.  </li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for,  I would have expected better.</li>
            <li>Good for the man who loses or breaks his reading glasses.</li>
            <li>When he loses most of these I&#x27;m sure we will be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them and would not hesitate to buy them again.</li>
            <li>These were for my husband, and he told me these glasses were better than some of the high dollar ones he has had in the past.</li>
            <li>The frames are sturdy and comfortable,  If you are looking for extra pairs because you are constantly losing them.  </li>
            <li>Purchased 3.50s for my father who is not a small guy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if one could get actual glass lenses in the prescription ones, I&#x27;ll try for that next, but these serve quite decently and are cheap enough to leave lying around</li>
            <li>Also delivered early.  </li>
            <li>These seem to last as well as my prescription glasses did, and serve very well in their place.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find higher number (higher than 2.5) but decent quality reading glasses at an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>As I tend to be pretty rough (that is, careless) with them, it seemed like a good idea to grab these inexpensive babies.</li>
            <li>These were purchased for my husband, but I have had the woman&#x27;s set for about 6 months now and have not broken a single pair yet.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted at a price lower than I expected + fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Only complaint would be frames crack easily but some of it my fault with constant on-off and put-away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting too how the company obviously stands behind their product.....</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s interesting too how the company obviously stands behind their product.....</li>
            <li> The temples feel a bit delicate, but no more so than most inexpensive readers.</li>
            <li> (At one point, from another vendor, I bought a $15 pair and it lasted as long as one of these.)  </li>
            <li> Also, with multiple pairs, I can leave them in strategic places without worrying where I put the last pair down.  </li>
            <li> I typically shop for reading glasses at a local dept store or pharmacy.</li>
            <li> and I like having a pair in a few different places.</li>
            <li> I am constantly misplacing them and this has saved me a lot of time and trouble.</li>
            <li> They are not very durable.    </li>
            <li> They are just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Due to this issue, I do not recommend buying the product.</li>
            <li> Less than two weeks and</li>
            <li> It keeps them tight against my head while working.</li>
            <li> so I can usually find a pair.</li>
            <li> Too small for medium size head.</li>
            <li> Reading glasses with a power of over 3.00 is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I tend to be hard on glasses.</li>
            <li> So hard to find 3.50</li>
            <li> And I am not in the least bit dissatisfied with my decision.</li>
            <li> already the ear piece on two pair have broken of at the hinge.  </li>
            <li> No need to buy the expensive ones at the supermarket.</li>

            <li> fast delivery of described item</li>
            <li> my husband needs these reading glasses and we haven&#x27;t found a better price than this.  It&#x27;s great to have 6 pairs since they tend to get lost in the house.</li>
            <li> Great Product and price.  Also delivered early.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed</li>
            <li> Ordered these glasses on Monday and received them on Thursday.  You can&#x27;t ask for a quicker delivery.  The quality of the glasses appears to be excellent.  They certainly are better made than the ones I was buying in our local stores.  The fit is perfect and the lenses are as advertised.  The price is also very fair.</li>
            <li> Great reading glasses.  Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Super!  Sturdy and attractive</li>
            <li> Super comfortable. Durable. Just as advertised. Quick shipping. Super satisfied.</li>
            <li> These were for my husband, and he told me these glasses were better than some of the high dollar ones he has had in the past.</li>
            <li> I typically shop for reading glasses at a local dept store or pharmacy. Reading glasses with a power of over 3.00 is hard to find. My mother now uses a 3.25 or above. While perusing Amazon for another item, I came across this set. The price was fantastic. I ordered the 3.50 and had them delivered straight to my mother&#x27;s house.  She was impressed with the quality and promptness of the delivery.  Now she has a set of six that will last her for awhile.</li>
            <li> Being the old relic that I am, I rely on powerful reading glasses to help me see things up close. As I tend to be pretty rough (that is, careless) with them, it seemed like a good idea to grab these inexpensive babies. And I am not in the least bit dissatisfied with my decision. They are what they are, and I love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. I can now leave glasses where I need them most. 6 pairs - 6 locations. I am never without a good pair of glasses now.</li>
            <li> Better quality than the comparable glasses from the $$ store.  I would recommend these to anyone I know who needs to leave a pair here and a pair there and a pair everywhere...</li>
            <li> These glasses are cheaper than the readers I was buying at Wal-Mart and the frames are much sturdier. Great deal!</li>
            <li> These seem to last as well as my prescription glasses did, and serve very well in their place. I don&#x27;t know if one could get actual glass lenses in the prescription ones, I&#x27;ll try for that next, but these serve quite decently and are cheap enough to leave lying around so I can usually find a pair.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and colors.  I wish they were full glass for the eye but I an adjusting to the smaller frames for reading.  I highly recommend them and would not hesitate to buy them again.</li>
            <li> These glasses are all over our home.  No need to buy the expensive ones at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> This is a great find.  This strength lens can&#x27;t be found in the stores.  A special for those who keep losing or breaking&lt;br /&gt;their reading glasses.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  I drop them all the time and they do not break.</li>
            <li> First item in my order received, quick, quick.  Excellent packing.  Wonderful quality.  Spring loaded arms keep glasses very&lt;br /&gt;comfortable.  Excellent value.  Would recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Purchased 3.50s for my father who is not a small guy.  He is very happy with the quality and has been wearing the same pair for a couple weeks now with no problems.  I appreciated the price point and that there were 6 in the package because he tends to go through readers pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Great glasses, great price, fast delivery, they work perfectly.  This is our 2nd order.  My wife and I go through these damn things very quickly for some reason.  One minute they&#x27;re there, the next they are gone.  Don&#x27;t know where they disappear to.  Maybe turn into clothes hangers or something.  We have too many of those.  Anyway, we&#x27;ll continue to order until our eyes get better or the company goes out of business.</li>
            <li> I love the new glasses, they are comfortable, durable and the price was just right.&lt;br /&gt;The only ones with a 3.50 and look and feel great.&lt;br /&gt;Josie</li>
            <li> These specs are fine, cost is competitive, arrived in good time, packaged with adequate protection.  The temples feel a bit delicate, but no more so than most inexpensive readers.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to break them.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend and he was so happy with the first set that we came back and ordered him a second set.  These are a great deal.  They arrived quickly and in well-protected packaging.  Thank you for being such a dependable seller.  When he loses most of these I&#x27;m sure we will be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Julie</li>
            <li> Very nice! I&#x27;ve not had such nice readers before. They are sturdy and easy to see through. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly- just as described- Thank you!</li>
            <li> GREAT! Just what I wanted at a price lower than I expected + fast delivery. I would recommend to others and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the glasses. They are true to the strength that I ordered &amp; so far have been very sturdy. I tend to be hard on glasses. I will definitely Re order. The price is excellent!</li>
            <li> I think they are a great price for what you get and I like having a pair in a few different places. I find then sturdy enough.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy reading glasses.  I am constantly misplacing them and this has saved me a lot of time and trouble.</li>
            <li> Less than two weeks and already the ear piece on two pair have broken of at the hinge.  Would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> I loved the reading glasses and I intend to order more.  These are very helpful to the baha&#x27;is in our devotions</li>
            <li> great quality,great price,  would buy it again.  hans warnecke</li>
            <li> Excellent Reading Glasses, I have purchased a few times now and did go to another Vendor once and came right back to these guys. Delivery is quick and the product is excellent!!!!</li>
            <li> Only complaint would be frames crack easily but some of it my fault with constant on-off and put-away. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> these glasses are wonderful.  The price is wonderful.  The frames are sturdy and comfortable,  If you are looking for extra pairs because you are constantly losing them.  Buy these!</li>
            <li> Solid, well made, not flimsy like dollar store glasses.  Looks like these will hold up to repeated use....how many times a day do we put them on, then take them off, ... right?  Also, with multiple pairs, I can leave them in strategic places without worrying where I put the last pair down.  It&#x27;s interesting too how the company obviously stands behind their product.....don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen that before. These were purchased for my husband, but I have had the woman&#x27;s set for about 6 months now and have not broken a single pair yet.  Amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> best  glasses and you get 6 of them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my husband who has very poor vision.  He really like these glasses and has a pair in every room in our house so he can see when he struggles with reading.  Great buy and he is very pleased with them.  We would recommend these reading glasses!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these reading glasses and they were sent right on time.  I would certainly recommend these glasses!</li>
            <li> always good to be able to see......</li>
            <li> good glasses, the spring hinges make them fit better and less fragile then the glasses without the hinges.</li>
            <li> Hinges did not last could not put screws back in these are cheap glasses so I got what I paid for. I do not recommend anyone to buy these unless you just want to throw away your money.</li>
            <li> Awesome, sturdy glasses that can be put in all the places you will use them.</li>
            <li> vert satisfied , specialy with the price. Will order again and tell my friends</li>
            <li> They are fine and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered the Fiore 6 pack of reading glasses. Both times i&#x27;ve been extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good price and quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent glasses! Very sturdy, not at all flimsy. Excrllent glasses, not flimsy. Excellent set of glasses that are very sturdy</li>
            <li> A bargain for someone like me who likes to have a pair of readers in every possible location, even a couple in my purse in case I leave a pair somewhere.  I no longer can find my strength (3.50) in stores so was real happy to get these. Have had them for a couple of months and none have broke and they seem to be true to the strength I ordered.  Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Great glasses. Super cheap price!</li>
            <li> Too small for medium size head. Very cheep plastic.  I guess you get what you pay for,  I would have expected better.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find higher number (higher than 2.5) but decent quality reading glasses at an inexpensive price. Yes, at this price, they will not last forever. (At one point, from another vendor, I bought a $15 pair and it lasted as long as one of these.)  Periodically you have to buy more. This where I buy them!</li>
            <li> WHAT A SAVINGS. THESE GLASSES ARE HIGH QUALITY AND FIT PERFECTLY. RECEIVED THEM WHEN THEY SAID IT WOULD BE SENT.</li>
            <li> These glasses work fine. However, I purchased them on 6/3/2014 and today 11/16/2014 the 6th pair broke. They are not very durable.    As my mother always said, \\&quot;You only get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Good for the man who loses or breaks his reading glasses. Nice looking and are the right fit for me.</li>
            <li> Fit nice and give me the vision aid I need.  I would recommend to anyone needing such a device for low vision</li>
            <li> I received the glasses in good condition. They are just as I expected. Comfortable and with the adequate graduation.</li>
            <li> To my surprise all of the glasses appear to have a foggy like haze on the lenses. Due to this issue, I do not recommend buying the product.</li>
            <li> I like these glasses, but braking every 2-3 months</li>
            <li> My husband and I feel that these glasses are of a superior quality and a very good value for the money we spent. We will definitely purchase any future glasses here in the future. The glasses arrived quickly and were well packed.</li>
            <li> very pleased. Like the spring in the bow. It keeps them tight against my head while working. Also like the idea of having a lot of extras. You can never have too many. So hard to find 3.50</li>
            <li> Arrived in great shape and work well. Now have pairs to leave in car, in den, every where.</li>
            <li> good glasses, excellent service and price.</li>
            <li> The person for whom I purchased these reading glasses thinks they are the best and loves them!</li>
