            <li>superior benefits to the skin.  </li>
            <li>At this point, I’ve tried and tested superior products.  </li>

            <li>Good price.</li>

            <li>I love this moisturizing gel!  </li>
            <li>Peter Roth, I love your products!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>But once it hits your skin, you will love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>The gel is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this PTR product for over a year now, and the difference to me is amazing...</li>
            <li>And, not in a dewy type of way, but in a go-wash-your-face kind of way.  </li>
            <li>I smells nice and feels nice and is nice.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; of my skin which has been nice since I do get a lot of sun exposure here in Los Angeles.  </li>
            <li>Great product; have bought this elsewhere for many dollars more.  </li>
            <li>I love Peter Thomas Roth products, they all smell so good.</li>
            <li>nice glow to the skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased it at a good price, but I see today it is over $15 more than what I paid.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was great, but as I started putting on my foundation (Skin79 Gold VIP BB Cream, love it by the way!)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s age reversing technologies, as I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but it sure is nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This goes on like grease and quite honestly my skin doesn&#x27;t look any better at all.  </li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin, and I can honestly say this did not make me break out like many moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, great price.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this moisturizer the minute I put in on my face.</li>
            <li>Tried so many products that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>You will love these products.</li>
            <li>They work and you will love them like I do.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing I read reviews here on Amazon and Sephora just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I ended up just buying a 1oz jar of Creme De La Mer (NOT OFF OF AMAZON, FOR SAFE MEASURE</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better than ever too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really do love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial moisturizer I have found!  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is significantly better than QVC, which is where I used to buy it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and don&#x27;t leave home without wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Also, applying make-up on top of this gel-cream did not go over well.  </li>
            <li>This is simply OK.</li>
            <li>I makes your skin feel OK</li>
            <li>It brightens and the longer I use it the better my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I gave the pads 5 star, and the cream 4, because I think they do the most work.</li>
            <li>Just another face cream promising great results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I do love my mother</li>
            <li>I love this and use it every morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used PTR products for many years now and they do not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for the top of the hands as well.</li>
            <li>and it works so much better.</li>
            <li>Love it, too.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I love all of PTR products.</li>
            <li>Smooth, moisturized but not greasy and with a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li>Peter Thomas Roth produces is top of the line in skin care.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture.</li>
            <li>The price here is MUCH better than Sephora.</li>
            <li>so I shall use it more during the colder and drier months.</li>
            <li>I will take that to the bank :)</li>
            <li>The application is luxuriant and achieves a healthy and moisturized flush appearance .</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have it 2 star since I am not 100% sure</li>
            <li>I love PTR products and this line of laser-free is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Love the way my face feels after applying.</li>
            <li>I had always used Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Aloe Cort for my redness but can&#x27;t find it any more.  </li>
            <li>Very silky and make up goes on great.  </li>
            <li>I love Peter Thomas Ross products.  </li>
            <li>But I love the feel and plan on to continue using it.</li>
            <li>I use Peter Thomas Roth products and am so pleased with allthe changes in my face.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect moisturizer, look no further.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is appropriate for all skin types.</li>
            <li>My skin gets smoother and more brighten.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s mostly petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love this cream--really softens the wrinkles</li>
            <li>The Laser-Free Regenator Makes a lot of promises and has a lot of interesting ingredients.</li>
            <li>Because I use this as a day-wear moisurizer, I have to layer my foundation and sunscreen on top of this.</li>
            <li>but so glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I will be trying more PTR products.</li>
            <li>I love this face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A gooey gel that does not absorb easily into the skin but sits on top of the skin and remains sticky until it is washed off.  </li>
            <li>The gel is very smooth going on and does make my skin feel porcelain smooth.  </li>
            <li>There are a number of unique ingredients, and proven ingredients on the list-the most interesting of which is Dragon&#x27;s Blood, from the plant genre Croton.</li>
            <li>So far happy with this product of Peter Thomas Roth....</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin silky smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I use this in the morning before putting on my makeup, and it makes the the makeup go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>Smooth,  light and my pores are shrinking!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the texture, it is a smooth gel that leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>brighter sunspots are starting to fade and the compliments I get on how healthy and youthful my face looks is all I need to continually use this great product.</li>
            <li>So smooth and cooling - makes the face feel soft and great under makeup</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new moisturizer with good hydration and, of course, anti-aging properties.</li>
            <li>but it does nothing for fine lines.</li>
            <li>It smelled fine though.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge PTR fan already</li>
            <li>I think its made a huge difference in the texture of my skin</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing moisturizer I have ever used .. completely non-traditional texture .</li>
            <li>and I thank God, my Heavenly Father, that this product is available to me.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never been softer and smooth looking.  </li>
            <li>This gel cream is moisturizing and makes your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>Fantastic value.</li>
            <li>I also use the Laser Free Regen.</li>
            <li>I love gels so much more than creams and this is kind of a cross.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and does not cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>The name of the product, Laser Free Regeneration, compares using this gel to Laser Treatments.  </li>
            <li>The cream does make your face feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>There are typos in the text on the jar which a genuine PTR product wouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>This cream makes my face feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>i have lost some weight and this has kept my face form and smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin silky smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>my face feels so smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>The product was lightweight with a wonderfully refreshing floral/fruity fragrance -- that&#x27;s about the only thing that I can say I loved about it.</li>
            <li>Very emollient!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this amazing cream and</li>
            <li>Yes, as many said, it has very unusual consistency and leaves grease/sticky feeling when applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the amount you get in the container, but I love the very soft smell (not notecable) and I love how it makes my skin feel satin-smooth.</li>
            <li>I have really good skin that can generally take on anything.</li>
            <li>it a good product generally.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds of anti-aging face products, and this is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that 3 out of the 4 are silicones....</li>
            <li>It is quite rich</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Based on the code printed on the bottom of this product ，it was manufactured in July 2012……not fresh!</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;m using this product and I love it.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special.</li>
            <li>I started with travel kit and re-ordered full size product because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product because I&#x27;ve had such great results with other Peter Thomas Roth products (loved the discontinued Pumpkin Gel Masque &amp;  </li>
            <li>I only have fine lines and light sun damage, but so far I have really liked the results: smooth, and YES - more radiant skin.</li>
            <li>I have used other products and never have been 100% happy.  </li>
            <li>Great price when compared to other web sites.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product as well as many other peter thomas roth products,  great amazon prices, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Awesome, quick, understandable seller.</li>
            <li>.. Was super greasy and made skin shiny.</li>
            <li>The moisturising cream seems to be Ok so far, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Having lived 60 years in the south and spending many hours in the hot afternoon summer sun, now at 66 I&#x27;ve come to understand the effects of sun damage and of course am now very distressed about the look of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a reduction in fine lines but I am using this as well as the &#x27;peeling gel&#x27; (really just a cleanser).</li>
            <li>It is much heavier, so use a light hand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price in my book.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to look in the mirror anymore.</li>
            <li>Rarely can afford.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel it absorbed in to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love how it keeps my face looking young and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is a different kind of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Even though I have sensitive eyes that water when anything touches, I have been able to use this in the eye area.</li>
            <li>Trust me, these products are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I like this because of it&#x27;s dual purpose (moisturizer and primer) and the fact that it is rapidly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>His other laser free products are also amazing, and&lt;br /&gt;give</li>
            <li>I never want to be without this&lt;br /&gt;regenerator, and the same is true for Peter&#x27;s laser free eye serum and laser free re-&lt;br /&gt;surfacing serum.</li>
            <li>The fine lines are definitely diminished and my skin is so smooth and fresh looking...</li>
            <li>This gel cream leaves my skin super smooth but doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used various types of facial products, but this one by far has been the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product because it just simply feels great</li>
            <li>Once applied, it seems to just sit on top of your skin instead of actually being absorbed which leaves one’s face too shiny and oily.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this amazing gel/cream, I could feel the difference on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much</li>
            <li>This would have been the first PTR product I have ever bought</li>
            <li>At first, I just heard from others about this product, then when I have it in hand, I realize the word &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I discovered after using this gel-cream consistently that none of these issues were addressed.  </li>
            <li>Feels so soft and silky on the skin, and is light.  </li>
            <li>I put this on and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but really mom!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the feel as it so checked out the first four ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first PTR product</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li>Silicones are amongst the first couple of ingredients then water.</li>
            <li>Now, while it is hot and humid I shall use it sparingly around my eyes and any area that is infammes.</li>
            <li>I have stopped the past 6 years and finally found the perfect product.  </li>
            <li>After the first two nights of using this I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>First time using this PTR product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely \\&quot;gel like\\&quot; but it goes on so smoothly!  </li>
            <li>soft, smooth and luscious.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of heavy , which makes it very moisturizing and good for the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>I have other Laser free items that are more like serums that I really like and no issues with these.</li>
            <li>Normally it is a bright clear pink color.  </li>
            <li>I have to say this is one of the FIRST beauty products I&#x27;ve purchased that really does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied and will keep using this line so a very long time.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and love this product.  </li>
            <li>Pores are smaller and my fine lines are fading away.</li>
            <li>Thanks to PTR  and all his products.</li>
            <li>They say: If its not broken why fix it.</li>
            <li>it is moisturizing but really didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really feel like it soaks into skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried to like this product, I really did.  </li>
            <li>I think more money was spent on the packaging rather than the contents.  </li>
            <li>Very velvety feeling.</li>
            <li>really helps with lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 days and my face broke out and looks very oily.</li>
            <li>but, I don&#x27;t think it hydrates very well</li>
            <li>and if broke out my skin if I use too much.</li>
            <li>But I really like it and will order it again.</li>
            <li>Thanks again PTR.</li>
            <li>really like the Laser-Free Resurfacer Face Serum).</li>
            <li>I really recommend the nightly serium (PM).  </li>
            <li>The texture of this gel is very fancy which is almost like a condensed primer.</li>
            <li>This is a dryer moisturizing gel than I am used to (H20 Sea Mineral, Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Gel, and FX Moisturizing Gel), and sits on the skin like a primer as it absorbs oils very well.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of the PTR Laser Free Regenerator Gel Cream is very different from anything I have used before.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this once so far, but I truly love it.</li>
            <li>This product is a red gel which imparts a nice tint to the skin along with moisturizing and acting as a primer.</li>
            <li>I did find over time the moisture didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>its only been few weeks that I been using it, but my face feels so much soft and the skin looks great.</li>
            <li>and I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love PTR products - ESPECIALLY the Instant FirmX (Botox in a bottle - highly recommend!).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>Interestingly, that price is still significantly less than what the product costs on PTR&#x27;s website or on qvc.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, now this jar is going to the way-way back of my beauty cabinet because I can’t even figure out what skin type this product would be best suited for.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like a nice comfy gel, but it really hydrates you skin for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li>smooth, creamy gel moisturizer, very rich and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have real sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a try because it claims to &#x27;calm&#x27; the skin, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t compatible with my sensitive/rosacea-prone skin.</li>
            <li>so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to add a few more of his products to my collection.</li>
            <li>Chock full of parabens (6 different ones) and even Sodium Metabisulfite (direct contact of sodium metabisulfite with your eyes can cause irritation, pain, stinging, tearing, redness, swelling, corneal damage and blindness.</li>
            <li>I like to mix and match and am seeing amazing results in very little time!</li>
            <li>However it absorbs quickly and skin is so soft and smooth just after few applications!</li>
            <li>This combined with the Brightening serum has created a smoother, more even complexion, which is not easy for 40+ at this cost.</li>
            <li>Love how soft and hydrated my skin feels with just a little that I apply morning and night.  </li>
            <li>I literally feel like I have new skin when I wake up in the morning after using this.</li>
            <li>to my skin, and this new regenerator is the miracle I was waiting for</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gotta tell ya, I get up each morning to check out my new complexion in the &#x27;sunlight&#x27;</li>
            <li>Oh well, you live and you learn so</li>
            <li>, it is my new night moisturizer/treatment.</li>
            <li>I live in the Midwest and my skin gets super dry itchy and flaky in the winter.</li>
            <li>In this Peter Thomas Roth product, it does make your skin very soft</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The Laser Free Regenerator from this seller was a dark plum cloudy color with specks of something in it.  </li>
            <li>My bare minerals make up doesn&#x27;t apply very well with this sitting on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t have a smell that bothers my sensitive allergies!</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have tried in the Laser-Free Line from PTR, but I have used MANY other Peter Thomas Roth products.</li>
            <li>but I have definitely seen this brand EVERYWHERE before as I frequent Sephora and many other beauty suppliers...</li>
            <li>I gave it a good solid try, but I found it to be very confusing.  </li>
            <li>Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, 48-Gram 1.7 oz.]].  </li>
            <li>Always complemented on how young I look.</li>
            <li>However, my skin is sensitive and it does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 years old and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>Skin is soft.  </li>
            <li>This stuff leaves my skin hydrated and soft all day and I feel the product tightening my skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you have inflamed skin and/or thinning, mature skin.</li>
            <li>This product makes your skin so soft and a youthful glow.</li>
            <li>Avon anew and oil of Olay works the same and is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never felt this soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels extremely soft with this product.  </li>
            <li>This cream makes my skin feel like it did when I was 30 years young...</li>
            <li>The price is nothing compared to having soft, shimmering skin.</li>
            <li>Love this  moisturizing gel cream its my last step I put on and lasts all day while keeping you moist and firm.</li>
            <li>Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but all good skin care products are.  </li>
            <li>The texture is very odd but smooth when applied to the skin which took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this and the Camu Camu moisturizer after I had my first facial at 30 years old and was basically lectured that I needed to start using a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling moisturized and looking soft and smooth but does very little for lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>No more cross-hatch marks or fine lines visible and</li>
            <li>being older, those lines are not going away totally.</li>
            <li>My skin was very oily all my life until MENopause hit, then it became dry.  </li>
            <li>I used it for 6 months without noticing any improvements and actually felt like I ended up exfoliating twice as frequently just to maintain a clear appearance.</li>
            <li>Major results after about 7 days of continuous use.  </li>
            <li>Moisturize, firm, calm, brighten, etc.  </li>
            <li>I think I expected too much.</li>
            <li>:O</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I received an old jar or if it was mixed with something.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use, my skin is brighter, has better texture, and is less blotchy.</li>
            <li>It soaks in very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave me with an oily mess.  </li>
            <li>Odd at first because it is a gel not a cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been only using this for like 3 days, so i dont know if that will bring me any long term effect yet, but so far i like it!</li>
            <li>In comparison with other brand name cosmetics, this one is of superior quality and not too expensive.  </li>
            <li>So that is also a huge plus for me because the least smell bothers me!</li>
            <li>so if I use too much it makes my skin look a little oilier.</li>
            <li>and I have never seen such a waste of money in cosmetic packaging - not even from the very high end well known skincare companies.</li>

            <li> superior benefits to the skin.  </li>

            <li> Good price.</li>

            <li> Peter Roth, I love your products!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> But once it hits your skin, you will love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> The gel is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this PTR product for over a year now, and the difference to me is amazing...</li>
            <li> And, not in a dewy type of way, but in a go-wash-your-face kind of way.  </li>
            <li> I smells nice and feels nice and is nice.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; of my skin which has been nice since I do get a lot of sun exposure here in Los Angeles.  </li>
            <li> Great product; have bought this elsewhere for many dollars more.  </li>
            <li> I love Peter Thomas Roth products, they all smell so good.</li>
            <li> nice glow to the skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased it at a good price, but I see today it is over $15 more than what I paid.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was great, but as I started putting on my foundation (Skin79 Gold VIP BB Cream, love it by the way!)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s age reversing technologies, as I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but it sure is nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This goes on like grease and quite honestly my skin doesn&#x27;t look any better at all.  </li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin, and I can honestly say this did not make me break out like many moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, great price.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this moisturizer the minute I put in on my face.</li>
            <li> Tried so many products that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> You will love these products.</li>
            <li> They work and you will love them like I do.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing I read reviews here on Amazon and Sephora just to be sure.</li>
            <li> I ended up just buying a 1oz jar of Creme De La Mer (NOT OFF OF AMAZON, FOR SAFE MEASURE</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better than ever too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I have found!  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is significantly better than QVC, which is where I used to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and don&#x27;t leave home without wearing it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Also, applying make-up on top of this gel-cream did not go over well.  </li>
            <li> This is simply OK.</li>
            <li> I makes your skin feel OK</li>
            <li> It brightens and the longer I use it the better my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I gave the pads 5 star, and the cream 4, because I think they do the most work.</li>
            <li> Just another face cream promising great results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I do love my mother</li>
            <li> I love this and use it every morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used PTR products for many years now and they do not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for the top of the hands as well.</li>
            <li> and it works so much better.</li>
            <li> Love it, too.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I love all of PTR products.</li>
            <li> Smooth, moisturized but not greasy and with a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth produces is top of the line in skin care.  </li>
            <li> I love the texture.</li>
            <li> The price here is MUCH better than Sephora.</li>
            <li> so I shall use it more during the colder and drier months.</li>
            <li> I will take that to the bank :)</li>
            <li> The application is luxuriant and achieves a healthy and moisturized flush appearance .</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have it 2 star since I am not 100% sure</li>
            <li> I love PTR products and this line of laser-free is no exception.  </li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after applying.</li>
            <li> I had always used Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Aloe Cort for my redness but can&#x27;t find it any more.  </li>
            <li> Very silky and make up goes on great.  </li>
            <li> I love Peter Thomas Ross products.  </li>
            <li> But I love the feel and plan on to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I use Peter Thomas Roth products and am so pleased with allthe changes in my face.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect moisturizer, look no further.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is appropriate for all skin types.</li>
            <li> My skin gets smoother and more brighten.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s mostly petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love this cream--really softens the wrinkles</li>
            <li> The Laser-Free Regenator Makes a lot of promises and has a lot of interesting ingredients.</li>
            <li> Because I use this as a day-wear moisurizer, I have to layer my foundation and sunscreen on top of this.</li>
            <li> but so glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I will be trying more PTR products.</li>
            <li> I love this face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A gooey gel that does not absorb easily into the skin but sits on top of the skin and remains sticky until it is washed off.  </li>
            <li> The gel is very smooth going on and does make my skin feel porcelain smooth.  </li>
            <li> There are a number of unique ingredients, and proven ingredients on the list-the most interesting of which is Dragon&#x27;s Blood, from the plant genre Croton.</li>
            <li> So far happy with this product of Peter Thomas Roth....</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin silky smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning before putting on my makeup, and it makes the the makeup go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> Smooth,  light and my pores are shrinking!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the texture, it is a smooth gel that leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> brighter sunspots are starting to fade and the compliments I get on how healthy and youthful my face looks is all I need to continually use this great product.</li>
            <li> So smooth and cooling - makes the face feel soft and great under makeup</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new moisturizer with good hydration and, of course, anti-aging properties.</li>
            <li> but it does nothing for fine lines.</li>
            <li> It smelled fine though.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge PTR fan already</li>
            <li> I think its made a huge difference in the texture of my skin</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing moisturizer I have ever used .. completely non-traditional texture .</li>
            <li> and I thank God, my Heavenly Father, that this product is available to me.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never been softer and smooth looking.  </li>
            <li> This gel cream is moisturizing and makes your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li> Fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I also use the Laser Free Regen.</li>
            <li> I love gels so much more than creams and this is kind of a cross.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and does not cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> The name of the product, Laser Free Regeneration, compares using this gel to Laser Treatments.  </li>
            <li> The cream does make your face feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> There are typos in the text on the jar which a genuine PTR product wouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my face feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> i have lost some weight and this has kept my face form and smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> my face feels so smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> The product was lightweight with a wonderfully refreshing floral/fruity fragrance -- that&#x27;s about the only thing that I can say I loved about it.</li>
            <li> Very emollient!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this amazing cream and</li>
            <li> Yes, as many said, it has very unusual consistency and leaves grease/sticky feeling when applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the amount you get in the container, but I love the very soft smell (not notecable) and I love how it makes my skin feel satin-smooth.</li>
            <li> I have really good skin that can generally take on anything.</li>
            <li> it a good product generally.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds of anti-aging face products, and this is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that 3 out of the 4 are silicones....</li>
            <li> It is quite rich</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> Based on the code printed on the bottom of this product ，it was manufactured in July 2012……not fresh!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;m using this product and I love it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special.</li>
            <li> I started with travel kit and re-ordered full size product because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because I&#x27;ve had such great results with other Peter Thomas Roth products (loved the discontinued Pumpkin Gel Masque &amp;  </li>
            <li> I only have fine lines and light sun damage, but so far I have really liked the results: smooth, and YES - more radiant skin.</li>
            <li> I have used other products and never have been 100% happy.  </li>
            <li> Great price when compared to other web sites.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product as well as many other peter thomas roth products,  great amazon prices, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Awesome, quick, understandable seller.</li>
            <li> .. Was super greasy and made skin shiny.</li>
            <li> The moisturising cream seems to be Ok so far, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Having lived 60 years in the south and spending many hours in the hot afternoon summer sun, now at 66 I&#x27;ve come to understand the effects of sun damage and of course am now very distressed about the look of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a reduction in fine lines but I am using this as well as the &#x27;peeling gel&#x27; (really just a cleanser).</li>
            <li> It is much heavier, so use a light hand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price in my book.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid to look in the mirror anymore.</li>
            <li> Rarely can afford.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel it absorbed in to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love how it keeps my face looking young and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is a different kind of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Even though I have sensitive eyes that water when anything touches, I have been able to use this in the eye area.</li>
            <li> Trust me, these products are worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I like this because of it&#x27;s dual purpose (moisturizer and primer) and the fact that it is rapidly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> His other laser free products are also amazing, and&lt;br /&gt;give</li>
            <li> I never want to be without this&lt;br /&gt;regenerator, and the same is true for Peter&#x27;s laser free eye serum and laser free re-&lt;br /&gt;surfacing serum.</li>
            <li> The fine lines are definitely diminished and my skin is so smooth and fresh looking...</li>
            <li> This gel cream leaves my skin super smooth but doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used various types of facial products, but this one by far has been the best I have found.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product because it just simply feels great</li>
            <li> Once applied, it seems to just sit on top of your skin instead of actually being absorbed which leaves one’s face too shiny and oily.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this amazing gel/cream, I could feel the difference on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much</li>
            <li> This would have been the first PTR product I have ever bought</li>
            <li> At first, I just heard from others about this product, then when I have it in hand, I realize the word &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I discovered after using this gel-cream consistently that none of these issues were addressed.  </li>
            <li> Feels so soft and silky on the skin, and is light.  </li>
            <li> I put this on and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but really mom!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feel as it so checked out the first four ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first PTR product</li>
            <li> My face is so soft and smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li> Silicones are amongst the first couple of ingredients then water.</li>
            <li> Now, while it is hot and humid I shall use it sparingly around my eyes and any area that is infammes.</li>
            <li> I have stopped the past 6 years and finally found the perfect product.  </li>
            <li> After the first two nights of using this I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> First time using this PTR product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely \\&quot;gel like\\&quot; but it goes on so smoothly!  </li>
            <li> soft, smooth and luscious.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of heavy , which makes it very moisturizing and good for the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I have other Laser free items that are more like serums that I really like and no issues with these.</li>
            <li> Normally it is a bright clear pink color.  </li>
            <li> I have to say this is one of the FIRST beauty products I&#x27;ve purchased that really does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied and will keep using this line so a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and love this product.  </li>
            <li> Pores are smaller and my fine lines are fading away.</li>
            <li> Thanks to PTR  and all his products.</li>
            <li> They say: If its not broken why fix it.</li>
            <li> it is moisturizing but really didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really feel like it soaks into skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried to like this product, I really did.  </li>
            <li> I think more money was spent on the packaging rather than the contents.  </li>
            <li> Very velvety feeling.</li>
            <li> really helps with lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 days and my face broke out and looks very oily.</li>
            <li> but, I don&#x27;t think it hydrates very well</li>
            <li> and if broke out my skin if I use too much.</li>
            <li> But I really like it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> Thanks again PTR.</li>
            <li> really like the Laser-Free Resurfacer Face Serum).</li>
            <li> I really recommend the nightly serium (PM).  </li>
            <li> The texture of this gel is very fancy which is almost like a condensed primer.</li>
            <li> This is a dryer moisturizing gel than I am used to (H20 Sea Mineral, Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Gel, and FX Moisturizing Gel), and sits on the skin like a primer as it absorbs oils very well.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the PTR Laser Free Regenerator Gel Cream is very different from anything I have used before.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far, but I truly love it.</li>
            <li> This product is a red gel which imparts a nice tint to the skin along with moisturizing and acting as a primer.</li>
            <li> I did find over time the moisture didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> its only been few weeks that I been using it, but my face feels so much soft and the skin looks great.</li>
            <li> and I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love PTR products - ESPECIALLY the Instant FirmX (Botox in a bottle - highly recommend!).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> Interestingly, that price is still significantly less than what the product costs on PTR&#x27;s website or on qvc.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, now this jar is going to the way-way back of my beauty cabinet because I can’t even figure out what skin type this product would be best suited for.  </li>
            <li> It goes on like a nice comfy gel, but it really hydrates you skin for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li> smooth, creamy gel moisturizer, very rich and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have real sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try because it claims to &#x27;calm&#x27; the skin, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t compatible with my sensitive/rosacea-prone skin.</li>
            <li> so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to add a few more of his products to my collection.</li>
            <li> Chock full of parabens (6 different ones) and even Sodium Metabisulfite (direct contact of sodium metabisulfite with your eyes can cause irritation, pain, stinging, tearing, redness, swelling, corneal damage and blindness.</li>
            <li> I like to mix and match and am seeing amazing results in very little time!</li>
            <li> However it absorbs quickly and skin is so soft and smooth just after few applications!</li>
            <li> This combined with the Brightening serum has created a smoother, more even complexion, which is not easy for 40+ at this cost.</li>
            <li> Love how soft and hydrated my skin feels with just a little that I apply morning and night.  </li>
            <li> I literally feel like I have new skin when I wake up in the morning after using this.</li>
            <li> to my skin, and this new regenerator is the miracle I was waiting for</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gotta tell ya, I get up each morning to check out my new complexion in the &#x27;sunlight&#x27;</li>
            <li> Oh well, you live and you learn so</li>
            <li> , it is my new night moisturizer/treatment.</li>
            <li> I live in the Midwest and my skin gets super dry itchy and flaky in the winter.</li>
            <li> In this Peter Thomas Roth product, it does make your skin very soft</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The Laser Free Regenerator from this seller was a dark plum cloudy color with specks of something in it.  </li>
            <li> My bare minerals make up doesn&#x27;t apply very well with this sitting on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have a smell that bothers my sensitive allergies!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have tried in the Laser-Free Line from PTR, but I have used MANY other Peter Thomas Roth products.</li>
            <li> but I have definitely seen this brand EVERYWHERE before as I frequent Sephora and many other beauty suppliers...</li>
            <li> I gave it a good solid try, but I found it to be very confusing.  </li>
            <li> Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, 48-Gram 1.7 oz.]].  </li>
            <li> Always complemented on how young I look.</li>
            <li> However, my skin is sensitive and it does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Skin is soft.  </li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my skin hydrated and soft all day and I feel the product tightening my skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend it if you have inflamed skin and/or thinning, mature skin.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin so soft and a youthful glow.</li>
            <li> Avon anew and oil of Olay works the same and is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never felt this soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels extremely soft with this product.  </li>
            <li> This cream makes my skin feel like it did when I was 30 years young...</li>
            <li> The price is nothing compared to having soft, shimmering skin.</li>
            <li> Love this  moisturizing gel cream its my last step I put on and lasts all day while keeping you moist and firm.</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but all good skin care products are.  </li>
            <li> The texture is very odd but smooth when applied to the skin which took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this and the Camu Camu moisturizer after I had my first facial at 30 years old and was basically lectured that I needed to start using a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling moisturized and looking soft and smooth but does very little for lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> No more cross-hatch marks or fine lines visible and</li>
            <li> being older, those lines are not going away totally.</li>
            <li> My skin was very oily all my life until MENopause hit, then it became dry.  </li>
            <li> I used it for 6 months without noticing any improvements and actually felt like I ended up exfoliating twice as frequently just to maintain a clear appearance.</li>
            <li> Major results after about 7 days of continuous use.  </li>
            <li> Moisturize, firm, calm, brighten, etc.  </li>
            <li> I think I expected too much.</li>
            <li> :O</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received an old jar or if it was mixed with something.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, my skin is brighter, has better texture, and is less blotchy.</li>
            <li> It soaks in very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave me with an oily mess.  </li>
            <li> Odd at first because it is a gel not a cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been only using this for like 3 days, so i dont know if that will bring me any long term effect yet, but so far i like it!</li>
            <li> In comparison with other brand name cosmetics, this one is of superior quality and not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> So that is also a huge plus for me because the least smell bothers me!</li>
            <li> so if I use too much it makes my skin look a little oilier.</li>
            <li> and I have never seen such a waste of money in cosmetic packaging - not even from the very high end well known skincare companies.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped very quickly, no complaints there, especially with the easy return and refund, but I felt like I was layering a thick primer on.</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t used it long enough to know the wrinkle effects yet.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth Laser Free Regenerator Moisturizing Gel-Cream promises to be everything in a jar, but, unfortunately, comes up short.  </li>
            <li> I have some dry areas on my face and this is the only product that has worked.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother since she only uses Ponds Cold Cream and needed something more for her aging skin.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SO SILKY AND SOFT THE SLIGHT TINT</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good base before I apply my regular makeup foundation.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying other products from his line.&lt;br /&gt;Please try this line African American Women.</li>
            <li> it helps to get rid of dead skin and yet it keep my skin soft</li>
            <li> my face and neck feel hydrated all day long.  </li>
            <li> Used the entire jar and saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I am looking for long term improvement now.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, and gel-like with a a texture, but it does absorb into the skin very well.</li>
            <li> After using the product for only a week or two I began noticing softer skin, less aggravation and smaller pores.  </li>
            <li> This container last along time and you need only a little.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone looking to try a different type of moisturizer, with oily skin, and a little extra money to spend.  </li>
            <li> It has very strange texture, not like a cream</li>
            <li> I am curious to see how this works in the long run.</li>
            <li> First, this is NOT as &#x27;moisturizer&#x27; as some reviewers seemed to be confused by.</li>
            <li> And I also think those marionette lines are also less obvious if not almost gone.  </li>
            <li> previously I used the cream of the French line of Sisley.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t beat the price at almost half of what it is in the big box retailers.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> You only need a little.</li>
            <li> to it - and you only need a little to do the job --</li>
            <li> I feel like this gel-cream tries to be everything, but accomplishes nothing.  </li>
            <li> I apologize for being so harsh, but definitely not a fan.</li>
            <li> The stuff was really a surprise – I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> Definitely not recommending for everyday use.</li>
            <li> For an cheaper way, I would use Mary Kay&#x27;s Pink Night Cream.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> other wrinkles also have been diminished.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird texture that kinda made me raise an eyebrow the first time I felt of it.</li>
            <li> It closed pores, soften skin, helped with dark spots and isa product</li>
            <li> Move over liquid gold, HELLO PINK GEL CREAM!</li>
            <li> The fact that this is a gel prevents it from sliding down my face like other face creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews in that the consistency of this gel alone is odd.  </li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;m looking at least 10 years younger than my 66 years of age.  </li>
            <li> I have a tender and delicate, European skin.</li>
            <li> My complaint with this product is really only the price.  </li>
            <li> While hunting down the Aloe Cort I decided to give this a try</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Plus this LFR moisturizer is half the price on Amazon than what it sells for in Ulta and Sephora.</li>
            <li> About half where I pay elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It’s definitely an odd concoction.  </li>
            <li> Not drying at all as a typical gel that dries on your skin.</li>
            <li> My previous moisturizer was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly a firm believer in their line.</li>
            <li> but when I received this product I was super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I return it THE NEXT DAY.</li>
            <li> This was the most terrible gel.</li>
            <li> I do not love this product.</li>
            <li> Usually like almost all PTR products but not this one.</li>
            <li> A lot of jar for a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> While there are not many studies on the effectiveness of this, it has been used for centuries in medicine and oils.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without sheen and lasts at least 9 hours.</li>
            <li> Even though it is too late to return it, she refuses to use it and I am out of $$$$$$ for buying it for her.</li>
            <li> Some creams are so thick, they make me sweat.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that the packaging is way over-the-top</li>
            <li> MEAN</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m thinking now that I&#x27;m up north in the dry cold</li>
            <li> not great, I would pass on this again and get a cream.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel like it had vassilene on it and made my skin look worse.</li>
            <li> After applying it, the stickiness is so annoying that I have to wash the product off and use a different moisturizer.   </li>
            <li> in fact I feel like it made my crows feet a but worse..</li>
            <li> Seriously, has taken years off!</li>
            <li> Laser-free Resurfacing eye serum, this, Laser-free Regenerator moisturizing gel-cream, has helped totally transform my skin from horrible lines and wrinkles I hated to see in the mirror to a much smoother complexion.  </li>
            <li> but I am just going to have to be one of the weird ones that absolutely reacted horribly to this.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong with PTR.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she is so set in her ways that she hasn&#x27;t even opened it and wanted to return it because she felt it was too expensive.</li>
            <li> This crème gel is weird...</li>
            <li> YOU WONT BE SORRY.</li>
            <li> It is the worst facial  </li>
            <li> This is a fake.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed by this product.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Bad product.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t do this one again :(.</li>
            <li> How insulting to buyers, comparing the results of applying this mediocre gel to the results of undergoing Laser Treatments.</li>
            <li> So disappointed..</li>
            <li> Hated the serumyas well</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this and the Camu Camu moisturizer after I had my first facial at 30 years old and was basically lectured that I needed to start using a daily moisturizer. I am a huge PTR fan already so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to add a few more of his products to my collection. Plus this LFR moisturizer is half the price on Amazon than what it sells for in Ulta and Sephora. I fell in love with this moisturizer the minute I put in on my face. It is not greasy at all. I literally feel like I have new skin when I wake up in the morning after using this. I have not had any breakouts from this moisturizer and I have pretty sensitive skin (the camu camu made me break out). Definitely recommend this product because it just simply feels great and you can&#x27;t go wrong with PTR.</li>
            <li> Love this  moisturizing gel cream its my last step I put on and lasts all day while keeping you moist and firm. I will not be with out these products. Tried so many products that doesn&#x27;t work. Thanks to PTR  and all his products. I am extremely satisfied and will keep using this line so a very long time. They say: If its not broken why fix it. Looking forward to trying other products from his line.&lt;br /&gt;Please try this line African American Women. You will love these products. They work and you will love them like I do.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing I read reviews here on Amazon and Sephora just to be sure. I have been looking for a new moisturizer with good hydration and, of course, anti-aging properties. This would have been the first PTR product I have ever bought but I have definitely seen this brand EVERYWHERE before as I frequent Sephora and many other beauty suppliers... but when I received this product I was super disappointed. The seller shipped very quickly, no complaints there, especially with the easy return and refund, but I felt like I was layering a thick primer on. At first I thought it was great, but as I started putting on my foundation (Skin79 Gold VIP BB Cream, love it by the way!) it started crumbling off and just got really gross. So I washed my face again and applied the moisturizer on AGAIN but this time by itself. My face started getting this tingling feeling around the chin area then after about 2 minutes a horrid BURN feeling... I ran to the bathroom to find my face in hive looking red splotches. UGH. Needless to say I return it THE NEXT DAY. I read a lot of good reviews but I am just going to have to be one of the weird ones that absolutely reacted horribly to this. I have really good skin that can generally take on anything. I dermaroll and use a chemical peel every 2 weeks. I ended up just buying a 1oz jar of Creme De La Mer (NOT OFF OF AMAZON, FOR SAFE MEASURE I BOUGHT IT AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE) and i&#x27;ve been quite happy with that purchase. My skin is looking better than ever too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome, quick, understandable seller. Bad product.</li>
            <li> I think I expected too much. being older, those lines are not going away totally. it a good product generally.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this gel is perfect for me.  I&#x27;ve learned to use sparingly.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds of anti-aging face products, and this is my favorite!  This gel cream leaves my skin super smooth but doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s worth the price in my book.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product.  I have just ordered it for a second time.</li>
            <li> At first, I just heard from others about this product, then when I have it in hand, I realize the word &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great price. About half where I pay elsewhere. Consistency jelly like. A little goes a long way.  I did find over time the moisture didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked. So I&#x27;m going to switch to the camu mask. And the price went up about twenty dollars by the time I needed to reorder.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Can&#x27;t find anything else like it. Very fast shipping, great price.</li>
            <li> Wow! This product does stimulate a cellular response!</li>
            <li> Another winner from PTR!  His other laser free products are also amazing, and&lt;br /&gt;give superior benefits to the skin.  This regenerator is just what my skin needs, as I use&lt;br /&gt;Peter&#x27;s Instant FirmX without rinsing off. Skipping the rinsing-off step is very&lt;br /&gt;drying to my skin, and this new regenerator is the miracle I was waiting for&lt;br /&gt;to rehydrate,remoisturize and repair all the dryness. I never want to be without this&lt;br /&gt;regenerator, and the same is true for Peter&#x27;s laser free eye serum and laser free re-&lt;br /&gt;surfacing serum. Also, now that Peter has added the regenerator to his skincare line, I&lt;br /&gt;will continue to use his instant firmX which should be relabeled facelift in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I have found!  The price on Amazon is significantly better than QVC, which is where I used to buy it.</li>
            <li> Major results after about 7 days of continuous use.  Skin texture hasn&#x27;t looked this good in about 20 years!</li>
            <li> it is perfect for my skin.  it helps to get rid of dead skin and yet it keep my skin soft</li>
            <li> I received a sample size with a recent purchase.  I have been a faithful user of Olay for 15+ years.  Not anymore.  I love this product and don&#x27;t leave home without wearing it.  Took a couple of days to get use to the texture (gel).  Made my skin feel baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Chock full of parabens (6 different ones) and even Sodium Metabisulfite (direct contact of sodium metabisulfite with your eyes can cause irritation, pain, stinging, tearing, redness, swelling, corneal damage and blindness. These effects may be irreversible.) :O</li>
            <li> It has very strange texture, not like a cream but a bit like &amp;#34;Vaseline&amp;#34; . It is kind of heavy , which makes it very moisturizing and good for the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Having lived 60 years in the south and spending many hours in the hot afternoon summer sun, now at 66 I&#x27;ve come to understand the effects of sun damage and of course am now very distressed about the look of my skin.  And I&#x27;m thinking now that I&#x27;m up north in the dry cold I&#x27;m paying double fold for the follies of my youth.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, along with the use of the Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM, and Laser-free Resurfacing eye serum, this, Laser-free Regenerator moisturizing gel-cream, has helped totally transform my skin from horrible lines and wrinkles I hated to see in the mirror to a much smoother complexion.  Each morning as I look in the mirror I am totally amazed and ever so thankful that I&#x27;ve come across this product that has made the world of difference to my face.  I think its made a huge difference in the texture of my skin and I think I&#x27;m looking at least 10 years younger than my 66 years of age.  No more cross-hatch marks or fine lines visible and other wrinkles also have been diminished.  And I also think those marionette lines are also less obvious if not almost gone.  And I can&#x27;t find my crow&#x27;s feet either!  Happier than a pig in sheet!&lt;br /&gt;Gotta tell ya, I get up each morning to check out my new complexion in the &#x27;sunlight&#x27; and I thank God, my Heavenly Father, that this product is available to me.  And thank you, Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
            <li> Great moisture - lasts all night!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Moisturizes without sheen and lasts at least 9 hours.</li>
            <li> it is moisturizing but really didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  Doesn&#x27;t really feel like it soaks into skin.  I&#x27;ll use it up, but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth Laser Free Regenerator Moisturizing Gel-Cream promises to be everything in a jar, but, unfortunately, comes up short.  I tried to like this product, I really did.  I gave it a good solid try, but I found it to be very confusing.  What was it supposed to do?  Moisturize, firm, calm, brighten, etc.  I discovered after using this gel-cream consistently that none of these issues were addressed.  I was very disappointed.  I agree with the other reviews in that the consistency of this gel alone is odd.  Once applied, it seems to just sit on top of your skin instead of actually being absorbed which leaves one’s face too shiny and oily.  And, not in a dewy type of way, but in a go-wash-your-face kind of way.  Also, applying make-up on top of this gel-cream did not go over well.  I don’t know.  I feel like this gel-cream tries to be everything, but accomplishes nothing.  Too bad.  It’s definitely an odd concoction.  I’m over forty with combination skin, but I just didn’t achieve the results or benefits as those mentioned in the 4-5 star reviews.  At this point, I’ve tried and tested superior products.  My advice: keep it moving.  Unfortunately, now this jar is going to the way-way back of my beauty cabinet because I can’t even figure out what skin type this product would be best suited for.  I apologize for being so harsh, but definitely not a fan.</li>
            <li> Feels so soft and silky on the skin, and is light.  I cannot speak as to it&#x27;s age reversing technologies, as I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but it sure is nice.</li>
            <li> Product looks good&lt;br /&gt;The moment has no effect, and perhaps to see results after would recommend to a friend  I like</li>
            <li> not great, I would pass on this again and get a cream. This did not feel moist or hydrating</li>
            <li> So far happy with this product of Peter Thomas Roth....its only been few weeks that I been using it, but my face feels so much soft and the skin looks great.</li>
            <li> This is simply OK. I makes your skin feel OK but it does nothing for fine lines. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found that makes my skin feel smooth! It brightens and the longer I use it the better my skin feels.</li>
            <li> The moisturising cream seems to be Ok so far, but nothing special.  Have used the cream for four days and nights now. I think more money was spent on the packaging rather than the contents.  The container has a container within a container and I have never seen such a waste of money in cosmetic packaging - not even from the very high end well known skincare companies.</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  My skin has never been softer and smooth looking.  I have used other products and never have been 100% happy.  With this I am amazed all the time.  I smells nice and feels nice and is nice.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff was great! It goes on like a nice comfy gel, but it really hydrates you skin for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I put this on and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  I will get this product again.</li>
            <li> The cream feels so good, after using it, my face become softer, I will keep on using this product !</li>
            <li> smooth, creamy gel moisturizer, very rich and a little bit goes a long way.  my face and neck feel hydrated all day long.  highly recommend this product as well as many other peter thomas roth products,  great amazon prices, too.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel wonderful. I look and feel years younger. Always complemented on how young I look. Seriously, has taken years off!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have some dry areas on my face and this is the only product that has worked. It leaves your skin silky smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; of my skin which has been nice since I do get a lot of sun exposure here in Los Angeles.  The texture is very odd but smooth when applied to the skin which took some getting used to.  I feel like in a week of using this I do feel my skin has become brighter and tighter BUT this as a moisturizer alone may not work for people in colder drier climates.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction to PTW Wrinkle Remover Pads. I gave the pads 5 star, and the cream 4, because I think they do the most work. I only have fine lines and light sun damage, but so far I have really liked the results: smooth, and YES - more radiant skin.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special. Just another face cream promising great results.  I have been using this twice daily.  It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother since she only uses Ponds Cold Cream and needed something more for her aging skin. Unfortunately, she is so set in her ways that she hasn&#x27;t even opened it and wanted to return it because she felt it was too expensive. Even though it is too late to return it, she refuses to use it and I am out of $$$$$$ for buying it for her. Oh well, you live and you learn so I won&#x27;t do this one again :(. I do love my mother but really mom!</li>
            <li> This was the most terrible gel. Made my skin feel like it had vassilene on it and made my skin look worse. That fancy jar is all you made paying for,and it&#x27;s plastic.will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this item!  My face neet no make up after use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesomsauce. I live in the Midwest and my skin gets super dry itchy and flaky in the winter. This is my go to when my face feels like its going to crack and fall off. It also smooths wrinkles and brightens.</li>
            <li> The product from this seller was discolored.  Normally it is a bright clear pink color.  The Laser Free Regenerator from this seller was a dark plum cloudy color with specks of something in it.  I don&#x27;t know if I received an old jar or if it was mixed with something.  It smelled fine though.  I have never used this seller before.</li>
            <li> I love this and use it every morning. Very velvety feeling.</li>
            <li> really helps with lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used PTR products for many years now and they do not disappoint.  This gel cream is moisturizing and makes your skin feel smooth and it doesn&#x27;t show any pores.  Great product; have bought this elsewhere for many dollars more.  Fantastic value.</li>
            <li> This product does triple duty. It acts as a regenerator, moisturizer and a primer under makeup. One warning though. It only takes a very small amount. I have oily skin so if I use too much it makes my skin look a little oilier. However, my skin is sensitive and it does not irritate at all. I recommend it for the top of the hands as well. It makes them glow and virtually erased lines.</li>
            <li> Did not absorb into my skin at all and I woke up next day with a bunch of red bumps. I have other Laser free items that are more like serums that I really like and no issues with these. This crème gel is weird...I didn&#x27;t like the feel as it so checked out the first four ingredients. These are: Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Isododecane, Polysilicone-11. I am pretty sure that 3 out of the 4 are silicones....I think silicones in skin care products do nothing except keep moisture from leaving your skin. I think they have some good application for smoothing hair but hair is not a living, breathing thing like skin.</li>
            <li> I love getting deals on this because it&#x27;s so expensive everywhere else I go for it.  It smooths my skin, hydrates it and gives it a beautiful glow.  Everyone notices it, not just me.  I&#x27;m 51 years old and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> The product and the service met my expectations. I would use this source again in the future. Product Met Expectations.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. I used it twice and saw no visible results. I switched and started using Olay Regenerist which costs about $15.00 and it works so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!  My skin leans towards the oily side, but this moisturizer is not.  It has a wonderful feeling texture.  Also, can use this as a primer.  Skin is soft.  I also use the Laser Free Regen. Eye Cream.  Love it, too.</li>
            <li> love this product. keeps your skin refreshed all day.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream! The fact that this is a gel prevents it from sliding down my face like other face creams I&#x27;ve tried. This stuff leaves my skin hydrated and soft all day and I feel the product tightening my skin.</li>
            <li> Another excellent product line by Peter Thomas Roth.  I like to mix and match and am seeing amazing results in very little time!</li>
            <li> The gel is amazing. I LOVE the texture, it is a smooth gel that leaves your skin smooth. Not drying at all as a typical gel that dries on your skin. This combined with the Brightening serum has created a smoother, more even complexion, which is not easy for 40+ at this cost.</li>
            <li> I love all of PTR products. I&#x27;m 51. I have real sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using for one year. I&#x27;m not afraid to look in the mirror anymore.</li>
            <li> I love gels so much more than creams and this is kind of a cross. Some creams are so thick, they make me sweat. I put this on before bedtime. I love Peter Thomas Roth products, they all smell so good. I am curious to see how this works in the long run.</li>
            <li> The stuff was really a surprise – I&#x27;m addicted. I got it based on the reviews and as a male I found it leaves my skin looking and feeling perfect.  Smooth, moisturized but not greasy and with a nice matte finish.  It&#x27;s my first PTR product and I&#x27;ll definitely be exploring the rest of the line.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the packaging is way over-the-top -- I wish it came in a more eco-friendly packaging – like a squeeze tube would be perfect.</li>
            <li> anything and everything Peter Thomas Roth produces is top of the line in skin care.  Love it!! skin looks fresher in 2 weeks time!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizing gel!  My face is so soft and smooth after I use it. Peter Roth, I love your products!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. Yes, as many said, it has very unusual consistency and leaves grease/sticky feeling when applied. However it absorbs quickly and skin is so soft and smooth just after few applications! I started with travel kit and re-ordered full size product because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One of the best face moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far, but I truly love it. I love the texture. The price here is MUCH better than Sephora.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this moisturizer because I was already using the serum. My previous moisturizer was discontinued.  So far so good.  I&#x27;ve used this type of gel moisturizer before.  I like that it&#x27;s not sticky or tacky.  It goes on smoothly and does not cause me to break out.  The price on Amazon is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve had it before!!! Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend it if you have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 days and my face broke out and looks very oily. Definitely not recommending for everyday use.</li>
            <li> nice glow to the skin.</li>
            <li> In this Peter Thomas Roth product, it does make your skin very soft but, I don&#x27;t think it hydrates very well and if broke out my skin if I use too much. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Glides over your skin. You only need a little.</li>
            <li> Very emollient!!! Silicones are amongst the first couple of ingredients then water. They act as occlusives which means that they prevent skin water from evaporating. It is quite rich so I shall use it more during the colder and drier months. Now, while it is hot and humid I shall use it sparingly around my eyes and any area that is infammes. I recommend it if you have inflamed skin and/or thinning, mature skin.</li>
            <li> Being 49 I have damaged my skin.  I have stopped the past 6 years and finally found the perfect product.  A little goes a long way. This is not like anything I have ever used. It&#x27;s a gel formation that when I put it on there is an instant transformation.  Being in menopause this has helped my face look timeless.  My face looks brighter sunspots are starting to fade and the compliments I get on how healthy and youthful my face looks is all I need to continually use this great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this PTR product for over a year now, and the difference to me is amazing... The fine lines are definitely diminished and my skin is so smooth and fresh looking...&lt;br /&gt;At 53... I will take that to the bank :)</li>
            <li> The application is luxuriant and achieves a healthy and moisturized flush appearance . I feel moisturized sufficiently with my combo skin. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product promptly.</li>
            <li> The texture is wonderful but I am allergic to it. It caused swelling, itching, burning skin lasting several days. I tried it several times each with the same result.</li>
            <li> Really feels great on your skin. Odd at first because it is a gel not a cream. But I really like it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite at a great price. Don&#x27;t know what in this stuff but it makes my complexion look great. Great price when compared to other web sites.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works. I have used it for 4 months now but don&#x27;t see any changes. I have it 2 star since I am not 100% sure</li>
            <li> I have a tender and delicate, European skin. This product is very suitable for my skin.i am use this product 1 mounts,  but the result is very good. previously I used the cream of the French line of Sisley. but it is much more expensive. and the result is the same. I recommend for my friends this product Peter Thomas Roth !</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin so soft and a youthful glow.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned in their reviews that this is a miracle worker - lines disappear and your face has a wonderful moisturized&lt;br /&gt;softness to it - and you only need a little to do the job -- Definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but pricey.. I like Peter Thomas Roth to begin with...</li>
            <li> I GAVE THIS A 2 STAR BECAUSE I DIDN;T LIKE IT.THIS DID NOTHING FOR MY SKIN. I USED IT ALL.BUT JUST BECAUSE ITS NOT FOR ME.IT DOESN;T MEAN THIS WANT WORK FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this a few months ago.  After the first two nights of using this I noticed a difference.  I now use this on a nightly basis before going to bed. It is worth money, but please purchase from Amazon for the best price.</li>
            <li> I love PTR products and this line of laser-free is no exception.  This is the most amazing moisturizer I have ever used .. completely non-traditional texture . feels like a million dollars.</li>
            <li> I do not love this product. It just sits on the skin. My bare minerals make up doesn&#x27;t apply very well with this sitting on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after applying.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much and it&#x27;s a good base before I apply my regular makeup foundation.  It gives a very smooth feeling to your skin and helps make your face look and feel flawless......</li>
            <li> I have used various types of facial products, but this one by far has been the best I have found.  After using the product for only a week or two I began noticing softer skin, less aggravation and smaller pores.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had always used Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Aloe Cort for my redness but can&#x27;t find it any more.  While hunting down the Aloe Cort I decided to give this a try and I love it!  Very silky and make up goes on great.  Worth every penny!  Amazon has the best price on this product.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try because it claims to &#x27;calm&#x27; the skin, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t compatible with my sensitive/rosacea-prone skin. My face was flaming red after applying this.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SO SILKY AND SOFT THE SLIGHT TINT MADE MY SKIN LOOK RADIANT.  THIS IS THE SECOND JAR I BOUGHT.  BUY IT YOU WONT BE SORRY.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and love this product.  It is a gel cream and a great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the am and also the pm.</li>
            <li> It is like rubbing silk on your face when you put it on. I love it so much, it is my new night moisturizer/treatment. Thanks again PTR.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because I&#x27;ve had such great results with other Peter Thomas Roth products (loved the discontinued Pumpkin Gel Masque &amp;  really like the Laser-Free Resurfacer Face Serum). The product was lightweight with a wonderfully refreshing floral/fruity fragrance -- that&#x27;s about the only thing that I can say I loved about it. I used it for 6 months without noticing any improvements and actually felt like I ended up exfoliating twice as frequently just to maintain a clear appearance. The gel had a silky feel to it, similar to silicone-based foundation primer and my skin would have a \\&quot;residue\\&quot; that even my husband could feel when he touched my face. I thought maybe it was my toner (Also PTR), so I tried it without it with the same effect. Will not be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(30+ Combination Skin-Type)</li>
            <li> Very nice. Feels good I love Peter Thomas Ross products.  Rarely can afford.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because the price just couldn&#x27;t be beat. I can&#x27;t live without this product! Pores are smaller and my fine lines are fading away. It makes my makeup look flawless.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews,thought I would give this a try.  I didn&#x27;t feel it absorbed in to my skin.  My skin felt drier.</li>
            <li> Good price. Shipingng is great. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels wonderful. It&#x27;s a weird texture that kinda made me raise an eyebrow the first time I felt of it. But once it hits your skin, you will love it! So soothing and just feels wonderful! I like to put it on my hands too after I have applied it to my face. Havn&#x27;t used it long enough to know the wrinkle effects yet. But I love the feel and plan on to continue using it. And it doesn&#x27;t have a smell that bothers my sensitive allergies! So that is also a huge plus for me because the least smell bothers me!</li>
            <li> A gooey gel that does not absorb easily into the skin but sits on top of the skin and remains sticky until it is washed off.  It is the worst facial  moisturizer I have ever tried.  After applying it, the stickiness is so annoying that I have to wash the product off and use a different moisturizer.   The name of the product, Laser Free Regeneration, compares using this gel to Laser Treatments.  How insulting to buyers, comparing the results of applying this mediocre gel to the results of undergoing Laser Treatments.</li>
            <li> Avon anew and oil of Olay works the same and is much cheaper.  This goes on like grease and quite honestly my skin doesn&#x27;t look any better at all.  It&#x27;s too expensive to be just okay.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but I do not feel that the price is acceptable.  For an cheaper way, I would use Mary Kay&#x27;s Pink Night Cream.  It is much heavier, so use a light hand.  My complaint with this product is really only the price.  The cream does make your face feel smooth.  I use Peter Thomas Roth products and am so pleased with allthe changes in my face.  I really recommend the nightly serium (PM).  It closed pores, soften skin, helped with dark spots and isa product I will always use.  I believe that it is the retinol.</li>
            <li> Move over liquid gold, HELLO PINK GEL CREAM! This luxurious gel cream imparts a moisturized yet satin finish to skin. I noticed an instantaneous boost in my complexion, diminished pore size and velvety texture. If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect moisturizer, look no further. In my opinion this is appropriate for all skin types. I have an oily t-zone and parched cheeks. This product normalized both areas. I am also prone to an occasional pimple but haven&#x27;t had one since using this product.</li>
            <li> I love love love this moisturizer!  My skin has never felt this soft.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever not using it.</li>
            <li> Like it. Good for me to use before sleep. My skin gets smoother and more brighten.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but all good skin care products are.  So smooth and cooling - makes the face feel soft and great under makeup</li>
            <li> The gel is very smooth going on and does make my skin feel porcelain smooth.  I did not, however, notice any anti-aging effects.  I have been using the product for a couple of months now.</li>
            <li> This is a fake. There are typos in the text on the jar which a genuine PTR product wouldn&#x27;t have. Broke me out. I think it&#x27;s mostly petroleum jelly. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This cream makes my face feel smooth and silky.  I apply it before putting on foundation and it works great as a primer as well. My make up stays in place all day.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed by this product.  Leaves skin feeling moisturized and looking soft and smooth but does very little for lines and wrinkles.  It is also quite expense for what it does.</li>
            <li> Great product and a good price</li>
            <li> cheap for a reason. Based on the code printed on the bottom of this product ，it was manufactured in July 2012……not fresh!</li>
            <li> My skin feels extremely soft with this product.  I use it immediately after washing my face and the gel just glides on.  In comparison with other brand name cosmetics, this one is of superior quality and not too expensive.  Another great product from Peter Thomas Roth.  I&#x27;m truly a firm believer in their line.</li>
            <li> Awesome, my skin is flawless and a great price!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for almost a year and have seen visible improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for about 6 months. This container last along time and you need only a little. i have lost some weight and this has kept my face form and smooth. i use every day. Love it.</li>
            <li> First time using this PTR product. So disappointed.. Used the entire jar and saw absolutely no difference. in fact I feel like it made my crows feet a but worse.. Usually like almost all PTR products but not this one. Never again. Hated the serumyas well.. Was super greasy and made skin shiny.</li>
            <li> First, this is NOT as &#x27;moisturizer&#x27; as some reviewers seemed to be confused by. It does not sink into your skin like a moisturizer. It goes on like a serum (if you&#x27;ve used Olay&#x27;s regenerist serum, the feel is similar). I love PTR products - ESPECIALLY the Instant FirmX (Botox in a bottle - highly recommend!). I use this in the morning before putting on my makeup, and it makes the the makeup go on more smoothly. Also use it at night before I go to bed. I have seen a reduction in fine lines but I am using this as well as the &#x27;peeling gel&#x27; (really just a cleanser). It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the amount you get in the container, but I love the very soft smell (not notecable) and I love how it makes my skin feel satin-smooth.</li>
            <li> A lot of jar for a small amount of product. That&#x27;s the only reason for 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  Smooth,  light and my pores are shrinking!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the feel of this on my face. Just another chemical cocktail of nothing great.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth and hydrated. I love how it keeps my face looking young and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been only using this for like 3 days, so i dont know if that will bring me any long term effect yet, but so far i like it! The texture of this gel is very fancy which is almost like a condensed primer. It leaves my face moisturized but not greasy. I am looking for long term improvement now.</li>
            <li> Love how soft and hydrated my skin feels with just a little that I apply morning and night.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> love this cream--really softens the wrinkles</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have tried in the Laser-Free Line from PTR, but I have used MANY other Peter Thomas Roth products. This is a different kind of moisturizer. On the jar this product is described as a gel-cream, and I don&#x27;t know if this quite describes the consistency. The consistency is thick, and gel-like with a a texture, but it does absorb into the skin very well. This is a dryer moisturizing gel than I am used to (H20 Sea Mineral, Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Gel, and FX Moisturizing Gel), and sits on the skin like a primer as it absorbs oils very well.  The Laser-Free Regenator Makes a lot of promises and has a lot of interesting ingredients. After a few weeks of use, my skin is brighter, has better texture, and is less blotchy. Even though I have sensitive eyes that water when anything touches, I have been able to use this in the eye area. The downside is the lack of sunscreen. Because I use this as a day-wear moisurizer, I have to layer my foundation and sunscreen on top of this. I have acne-prone skin, and I can honestly say this did not make me break out like many moisturizers.  There are a number of unique ingredients, and proven ingredients on the list-the most interesting of which is Dragon&#x27;s Blood, from the plant genre Croton. While there are not many studies on the effectiveness of this, it has been used for centuries in medicine and oils. Niacinamide is one of the proven ingredients in this concoction that stimulates collagen production, controls acne, and helps with hyperpigmentation.  I would recommend this to someone looking to try a different type of moisturizer, with oily skin, and a little extra money to spend.  Skin Type: Oily, Acne-Prone, Semi-Pigmented, Semi-Sensitive, Fine-Lines</li>
            <li> The consistency of the PTR Laser Free Regenerator Gel Cream is very different from anything I have used before.  It&#x27;s definitely \\&quot;gel like\\&quot; but it goes on so smoothly!  It leaves NO greasy residue on my face.  It soaks in very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave me with an oily mess.  In the morning, I use it after my PTR serum and before my SPF moisturizer [[ASIN:B002MSN3QQ Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, 48-Gram 1.7 oz.]].  My skin is smoother and glows.  I was skeptical but so glad I gave it a try.  Definitely recommended!  I will be trying more PTR products.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;m using this product and I love it. Notice a difference in my skin tone, and color after couple weeks of use. Definately will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is one of the FIRST beauty products I&#x27;ve purchased that really does exactly what it claims.  The first time I used this amazing gel/cream, I could feel the difference on my dry skin.  Also, it only takes a tiny amount, so this jar of cream should last me for months...My skin was very oily all my life until MENopause hit, then it became dry.  This cream makes my skin feel like it did when I was 30 years young...soft, smooth and luscious.  I highly recommend this amazing cream and also [[ASIN:B004P2LL2K Peter Thomas Roth Instant FIRMx Eye(TM) 1 oz]].  It also works the minute you put it on.  Trust me, these products are worth every penny.  The price is nothing compared to having soft, shimmering skin.</li>
            <li> Two for the price of one--a moisturizer and a primer! This product is a red gel which imparts a nice tint to the skin along with moisturizing and acting as a primer. Haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my skin, but I use a number of products that serve me well and this serves a dual purpose. I like this because of it&#x27;s dual purpose (moisturizer and primer) and the fact that it is rapidly absorbed into the skin. My only suggestions would be: 1) the addition of a utensil to scoop the material out of the jar--protects the product;  and 2) a lower price. I purchased it at a good price, but I see today it is over $15 more than what I paid. Interestingly, that price is still significantly less than what the product costs on PTR&#x27;s website or on qvc. My suggestion to potential buyers is to check Amazon daily to see if the price drops to under $40.</li>
            <li> I love this face moisturizer. my face feels so smooth and hydrated. you can&#x27;t beat the price at almost half of what it is in the big box retailers.</li>
