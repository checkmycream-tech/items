            <li>The molds don&#x27;t work the best, but they work good enough, and all my teeth aren&#x27;t exactly straight</li>
            <li>Some also said it hurts their teeth, and I&#x27;d also like to point out that it&#x27;s not like that at all as long as you try your best to keep the whitening gel away from your gums.</li>

            <li>Burned my mouth trying to get the mouth trays to work, because the first one wasn&#x27;t hot enough to mold good.  </li>
            <li>It is non-irritating and makes the teeth nice and shiny white.</li>
            <li>It would be great if you already had white teeth to maintain that white shine</li>
            <li>There are many complaints for this product and Blizzard White on the internet for these products.</li>
            <li>so I should be able to keep my teeth as white as their going to get for months.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my first time ordering from them</li>
            <li>It does not take much to start making them soft to fit.</li>
            <li>If you so much as get a drop or two on your gums though, it could really burn.</li>
            <li>Stuff does work very well.  </li>
            <li>Teeth and gums became very irritated.</li>
            <li>Dont use too much.</li>
            <li>The mouth trays are straight up junk, so if you&#x27;re like me and purchasing this because of the combination of carbamide + mouth trays, I&#x27;d try elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Be careful when putting the Teeth Molds in Hot Water to fit.</li>
            <li>you can really see the white smile</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them they didn&#x27;t work right, but I only left them on for 15 about minutes.</li>
            <li>you have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>i suggest you first dont leave it in your mouth for long because it does cause sensitivity.to me</li>
            <li>I had to spit continuously and after 25 minutes cleaned it out and used a sensitive toothpaste to stop the pain.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working so far.  </li>
            <li>This would be enough to whiten the whole tooth without the gum irritation.</li>

            <li>Powerful stuff...sign me White Teeth Red Gums</li>
            <li>there was a nice way of giving someone the second pair of mouthguards without being mean.</li>
            <li>After the initial daily treatment for the first week</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a little discomfort for the results</li>
            <li>Gave me the brightest smile with little to no discomfort  to my teeth or gums.</li>
            <li>got the results i wanted barely halfway through 1 tube.</li>
            <li>Seems strong, does burn the gums if you get them on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;The bleach crystallizes in a short period of time and it is hard to use.</li>
            <li>At first my gums got a little sore</li>
            <li>but it was absolutely the most difficult process ever!</li>
            <li>It may be sensitive afterwards, but shouldn&#x27;t be nothing too unbearable as long as you do as I just said above.</li>

            <li> i have tried many different products including that from the dentist which cost in excess of $200 and found this whitener to be as effective as any.if you have very sensitive teeth i suggest you first dont leave it in your mouth for long because it does cause sensitivity.to me it&#x27;s worth a little discomfort for the results but i am not super sensitive and the whitener from the dentist actually bothered my gums and teeth a little more.for people like me who have a \\&quot;dead\\&quot; tooth that darkens in time reguardless of hygeine this is a great answer.occassionally i have to bleach just to keep everything uniform and who doesn&#x27;t like a brighter smile.as a summary,this is an effective product at a good price that does eactly what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> I think these worked ok, nothing to get excited about. I probably just need to get them whitened by a dentist.</li>
            <li> Gave me the brightest smile with little to no discomfort  to my teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> I have used other whiteners before and purchased this because I noticed my teeth could use a spruce up. It seems to work well. It came with trays you can mold to fit your teeth but I use the ones y dentist made me a few years back.</li>
            <li> Action Pro White teeth whitener irritated my gums after two treatments, the company&#x27;s claims are false. There are many complaints for this product and Blizzard White on the internet for these products.</li>
            <li> I have custom trays from dentist and used this twice. Both times it foamed up even though I hardly used any and caused me to have shooting pains in one of my teeth and burning on my gums. I had to spit continuously and after 25 minutes cleaned it out and used a sensitive toothpaste to stop the pain. I even wiped any excess off with a kleenex. Don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working so far.  Delivery was rapid and packaging was good.  I will order this whitening kit again if it continues to work, which I expect.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year in February 2014 and still use them time to time. The first time I used them they didn&#x27;t work right, but I only left them on for 15 about minutes. The second time I left them on for 30 minutes and I could notice a pretty good difference right away, and for the $17 I paid shipped to my door, that&#x27;s great. The molds don&#x27;t work the best, but they work good enough, and all my teeth aren&#x27;t exactly straight and they still work well and get the job done. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap quick whitening solution.. just remember, you might have to leave it in a half hour+. Some also said it hurts their teeth, and I&#x27;d also like to point out that it&#x27;s not like that at all as long as you try your best to keep the whitening gel away from your gums. If you so much as get a drop or two on your gums though, it could really burn. It may be sensitive afterwards, but shouldn&#x27;t be nothing too unbearable as long as you do as I just said above.</li>
            <li> Ive always noticed instant results however you do need to maintain a routine.  This percentage of carbomide peroxide is perfect. Anything stronger and you&#x27;re just asking for burning gums. Just was just right! I will be buying again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Stuff does work very well.  I would advise not over using product and following instructions. I left on for over an hour and had discomfort to say the least.  Teeth and gums became very irritated. Powerful stuff...sign me White Teeth Red Gums</li>
            <li> I have used it twice for twenty minutes each time and my teeth are noticeably whiter.  The mouth pieces are easy to mold if you just follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Started seeing results right away and kept getting better.  I would highly recommend this product.  At first my gums got a little sore but after a few uses it no longer bothered me.  Over filling the trays cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Take heed of the suggestions you read here.  Dont use too much. wipe off excess immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the results i wanted barely halfway through 1 tube. stuck the rest in the fridge and use it for touchups now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was a nice way of giving someone the second pair of mouthguards without being mean.</li>
            <li> Burned my mouth trying to get the mouth trays to work, because the first one wasn&#x27;t hot enough to mold good.  The mouth trays are straight up junk, so if you&#x27;re like me and purchasing this because of the combination of carbamide + mouth trays, I&#x27;d try elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the trays but the whitening is great. Works like a charm! I&#x27;ll be getting a professional tray made so it&#x27;ll be more accurate.</li>
            <li> this is just way too strong for me the item was as described but it will eat your gums up.</li>
            <li> Seems strong, does burn the gums if you get them on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;The bleach crystallizes in a short period of time and it is hard to use.</li>
            <li> Great product 100% ill will buy again if my problem is sorted out the best I have add in a long time so people please try for yourself it&#x27;s amazing trust</li>
            <li> Have paid much more for Teeth Whitening Products. For the price and the amount that you receive this product works great.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought several times and will continue to buy. Be careful when putting the Teeth Molds in Hot Water to fit. It does not take much to start making them soft to fit. Learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> Whiteners (Crest strips etc) have not worked well for me. I don&#x27;t smoke or drink a lot of coffee. My teeth are not stained but at 62 years they are not bright white either. I read a dentist&#x27;s instructions about using home whiteners and his recommendation was to cover about 2/3 of the tooth with whitener. This would be enough to whiten the whole tooth without the gum irritation. So I use a little artist paint brush from a paint-by-number set to paint the gel onto my teeth as the dentist recommended and then insert the trays. After a week or 10 days (once a day) my teeth are noticeably whiter. I have used about 1/2 of one syringe so far, so I will get a lot of mileage out of this kit. I won&#x27;t ever achieve the level of whiteness I see these Hollywood stars getting or others that have glowingly white teeth, but I have achieved a level of whiteness that is a big improvement. After the initial daily treatment for the first week or so it is sufficient to treat once a week afterwards to maintain whiteness. These four tubes provide a lot of gel so I should be able to keep my teeth as white as their going to get for months. There has been no gum sensitivity or irritation.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using this stuff and people can really tell, my pictures you can really see the white smile, I don&#x27;t use much, i drink coffee daily and this stuff keeps my smile white white.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty good but to be honest I had hoped for better results. It would be great if you already had white teeth to maintain that white shine</li>
            <li> I have not actually use the whitening part of this kit since I am permanently stuck on the tray-making part of it!  I don&#x27;t know how other people did it but it was absolutely the most difficult process ever! The two-stars are for the price.</li>
            <li> Me and my friends were using this whitening system instead of the tapes and prepared things. It is non-irritating and makes the teeth nice and shiny white.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great prices for people like me trying to save a buck I give them 10 for their fast shipping and prices to. This isn&#x27;t my first time ordering from them Thanks Items are also top quality.</li>
