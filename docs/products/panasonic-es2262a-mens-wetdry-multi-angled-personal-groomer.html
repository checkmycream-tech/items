    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;The foil shaver, which is designed for body \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot;, shaves off those mini-hairs perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have had it for almost 2 years now and it works GREAT.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic groomer works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 or 5 years now and it still works great on body hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought Wahl and Conair before and wasn&#x27;t as happy as I am with this.</li>
            <li>The Norelco Body Groom worked great for me... until it broke after a year of use.  </li>
            <li>Good seller.</li>
            <li>Very nicely built and easy to reach all areas.</li>
            <li>So I started to use the ES2262 on my face and it was as good or better.</li>
            <li>I love the plastic depth attachments, they stay on and work good.</li>

            <li>To use garden analogies, this is more like a weed wacker and not a hedge clipper.</li>

            <li>body hair trimmer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The attachments snap-on securely.</li>
            <li>The product worked great and really appreciate that I shaved totally bare and clean, all within the confines of my shower for quick and easy clean up!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different trimmers and body groomers and this is probably the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>When using the trimmer, you will quickly notice that there is no area for the clipped hair to gather or to fall.   </li>
            <li>No cutting, no scratching.</li>
            <li>The flexible handle doesn&#x27;t lock in place so you can never get the right angle.  </li>
            <li>First off, this is the only Panasonic device I own.  </li>

            <li>There&#x27;s no small, special tabs waiting to be snapped off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems like so many of the negative reviewers here have bizarre expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really work well for me.  </li>
            <li>Horrable, really hurts even with soap.</li>

            <li>Other than than a OK</li>
            <li>I use them on eyebrows, chest, etc. and trim the back clean.</li>
            <li>The Norelco Body Groom is much better for the few weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a new one just to treat myself to some new blades</li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears that Amazon has gotten rid of most of the blatantly fake reviews, fortunately.  </li>
            <li>If it was any good, Panasonic wouldn&#x27;t have to pay people to plant fake reviews.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to chop down thick hair (which i have in spades) at full length; but once you use some powerful clippers or scissors, this will maintain your trim pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a new one only because I lost a couple of the snap-on attachments and the attachments aren&#x27;t sold separately.</li>
            <li>It does not extend far enough for the lower back but a pair of Vice Locks solved that problem.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What the... I wouldn&#x27;t get this if they gave it to me. If it was any good, Panasonic wouldn&#x27;t have to pay people to plant fake reviews. Check the review history of the reviewers before you listen to thier corporate propaganda!</li>
            <li> First off, this is the only Panasonic device I own.  I&#x27;ve had this product for over 1 year and it has worked with only a few minor problems.  It does not extend far enough for the lower back but a pair of Vice Locks solved that problem. I use the trimmer for all cutting. It isn&#x27;t fast but it is quicker than Nair and much less irritating.     I tried the Mangroomer and it promptly fell apart.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work well for me.  The blades pulled hair  -- and given the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas that this product is meant for, it rendered the product useless for me.</li>
            <li> NOT A VERY WELL THOUGHTOUT PRODUCT. THE HANDLE WON&#x27;T LOCK IN PLACE. THE TRIMMER WON&#x27;T LOCK IN PLACE, AND THE SHAVER COULDN&#x27;T SHAVE FUZZ OFF A PEACH. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> It was a waste on money and time.  It pinches skin, cut&#x27;s really bad.  Horrable, really hurts even with soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different trimmers and body groomers and this is probably the best one I&#x27;ve used. To use garden analogies, this is more like a weed wacker and not a hedge clipper. Don&#x27;t expect it to chop down thick hair (which i have in spades) at full length; but once you use some powerful clippers or scissors, this will maintain your trim pretty well. I never had a problem with the articulating handle staying put, once I figured out that it only \\&quot;locks\\&quot; when the unit is running. I think it&#x27;s a tiny bit better than the BodyGroom because of the extending handle. Someone really needs to make a unit that can handle the thick hair at any length though, especially for a men&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> ***Update 04/2013***&lt;br /&gt;It appears that Amazon has gotten rid of most of the blatantly fake reviews, fortunately.  I&#x27;m still leaving the rating as 1 star for the company trying to trick consumers even though I haven&#x27;t used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Original Review***&lt;br /&gt;Beware fake reviews on panasonic items!  These people only review panasonic items (check review history) and always give 5 stars.  Amazon needs to pick up on this, but at least you know now!</li>
            <li> The product worked great and really appreciate that I shaved totally bare and clean, all within the confines of my shower for quick and easy clean up! Panasonic products are always reliable and easy to use! Thank You Amazon!</li>
            <li> This thing is ridiculous.  The flexible handle doesn&#x27;t lock in place so you can never get the right angle.  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t stay up or down when you set it and the foil doesn&#x27;t work well either.      The Norelco Body Groom is much better for the few weeks it works.  This is a very disappointing product.  No one seems to be able to make a quality men&#x27;s body groomer</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001CS6BJS Panasonic ES2262A Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Multi-Angled Personal Groomer]] Very nicely built and easy to reach all areas. No snagging or pulling and trims very close.  It&#x27;s even more fun to use with a partner.  UPDATE:  I have had it for almost 2 years now and it works GREAT.  Just keep the blades free of accumulated hair!</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ES2262A Men&#x27;s personal Groomer and  the Man groomer. The Panasonic groomer works great. It does cut a lot closer than the man groomer. I just wish the Panasonic had a reach like the man groomer. I think then it will be a 5 star purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good price</li>
            <li> buen articulo llego a la fecha sin ningún problema 100% confiable el vendedor,operacion realizada sin ningun tipo de incoveniente el producto llena mi perspectiva</li>
            <li> does not do the job. Waste of my money.If you want garbbage then buy tihs piec e useless junk. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> This shavers works like a dream.  One pass on the skin and the hair if removed.  Not particularly fond of the extendable handle.</li>
            <li> I bought the ES 8078 for my face, because I&#x27;ve bought Panasonic wet/drys for the last 20 or 30 years and I was pretty happy, but that was a waste of 80 bucks because it didn&#x27;t seem very good after a year or so.  So I started to use the ES2262 on my face and it was as good or better. I&#x27;m a hairy mofo and I&#x27;ve used it front back and all over every week practically and that was before and after I started using it on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 or 5 years now and it still works great on body hair.  Yeah you have to watch how much pressure you apply when it&#x27;s extended or it will collapse, so learn some finesse for crissakes. And the trimmer goes down if you bump it, who&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t? I love the plastic depth attachments, they stay on and work good. I use them on eyebrows, chest, etc. and trim the back clean. I&#x27;ve bought Wahl and Conair before and wasn&#x27;t as happy as I am with this. I&#x27;m buying a new one just to treat myself to some new blades and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll find anything better until Roomba comes out with something that I can just lay on the floor and have it mow me over. IT&#x27;S 26 BUCKS PEOPLE GET A GRIP!!! Stay tuned for a video of me shaving me arse.</li>
            <li> Runs smooth while you shave under there. The only thing is the shaver is a little bit big. Other than than a OK</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES2262A has to be the absolute worst shaving device I have used in my life.  Even  the five dollar miniature  trimmers do a better job of shaving body hair then this device does.  The shaving foil can barely pick up hair, and the pop out trimmer is even worse.  When using the trimmer, you will quickly notice that there is no area for the clipped hair to gather or to fall.   Trimmed hair  jams up the blade with every pass. Sure it&#x27;s wet or dry... but the bad performance  gets worse  when your hair is slick or moist.    The Norelco Body Groom worked great for me... until it broke after a year of use.  Even that could provide a half decent body trim. In which this device cant offer any.  You are better off to pull out some icecubes and to tweeze your body hair rather  to use this device.  It is simply that bad.</li>
            <li> The product is not good, but the shaver works well. The trimmer function pulls the hair and sometimes it hurts. The articulated arm is not made ​​within tight delivery. Good seller.</li>
            <li> Seems like so many of the negative reviewers here have bizarre expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body hair trimmer is fantastic. I&#x27;ve had mine 2 years. I&#x27;m getting a new one only because I lost a couple of the snap-on attachments and the attachments aren&#x27;t sold separately. The trimmer performs as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments snap-on securely. They won&#x27;t break easily. (Unless you step on it, I guess.)  There&#x27;s no small, special tabs waiting to be snapped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extending handle is ingenious, and it indeed *does* click into place sufficiently for the intended purpose. For those of you who have trouble with that sliding handle part, I suspect you are pushing too hard on the trimmer. Extreme force will cause any similar-style of collapsible device to collapse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charge lasts quite a long time. It does not lose power mid-trim. You&#x27;ll be able to trim body hair from top to bottom without worrying about the battery sputtering out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil shaver, which is designed for body \\&quot;fuzz\\&quot;, shaves off those mini-hairs perfectly. No cutting, no scratching. No problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipped body hair falls just like a hair trimmer in the barber shop: onto the floor. I&#x27;m not sure why some of the reviewers here would expect this type of device to come with a hair-catcher-bag. (It&#x27;s not a lawn mower.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer *will* cut through thick hair. As with all similar devices, you need to go at a speed that allows the device to operate correctly. It&#x27;s a body hair trimmer. Use as directed!</li>
