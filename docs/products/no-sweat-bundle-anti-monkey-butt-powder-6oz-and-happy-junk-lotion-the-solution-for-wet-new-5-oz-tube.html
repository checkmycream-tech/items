            <li>The cream is awesome and it works great!</li>
            <li>This stuff works great!</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.</li>
            <li>wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It works amazing!</li>
            <li>It worked about as good as deodorant does</li>
            <li>This stuff works like magic for all the places you sweat that you can reach!</li>
            <li>Both very good, but I find that the cream doesn&#x27;t really become &amp;#34;dry powder&amp;#34; when applied, but its not horrible, so I will keep it.</li>
            <li>scent is very light and pleasing.</li>
            <li>But it smells nice, not too strong and it DOES absorb like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>i am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>much better than cornstarch or baking soda alone.  </li>
            <li>love these two together or separately.</li>
            <li>Bought as gift love it</li>
            <li>I would love for it to smell fresher.</li>
            <li>monkey butt powder is awesome.</li>
            <li>The fresh breasts worked ok.</li>
            <li>feel so much more comfy on hot days.</li>
            <li>especially with the hot weather we have been having this has been great.</li>
            <li>Received product quickly and as decribed</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the Fresh Breasts.</li>
            <li>I will say though in regards to the fresh breasts...</li>
            <li>Lady Anti- monkey butt powder is a nice product.</li>
            <li>While the scent is not unpleasant, it is very nondescript.  </li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t make you stop sweating but it really helps!</li>
            <li>The powder works really well on thighs as designed by that breast cream did absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li>And the Monkey Butt worked ok as well.</li>
            <li>Keeps all skin dry and itch free!</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple minutes to dry so walking around holding your boobs up is mandatory every time you use it, which is kind of a pain when it only works as well as deodorant does.</li>
            <li>No big deal, I am sure it is the same stuff, but I wish I had a someone to give it too!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to buyers.</li>
            <li>Both products help keep me dry and comfortable, more so than just plain powder, like baby powder.</li>
            <li>The lady monkey works wonders,, but the other breast cream wasn&#x27;t to effective.</li>
            <li>This Fresh Breast cream is supposed to go on and turn powdery to keep you dry.  </li>
            <li>Does keep me feeling fresh and dry for a period.</li>
            <li>The Monkey Butt worked ok, it only lasted as long as the dryness on my thighs lasted.</li>
            <li>This has really helped me get through this summer without rashes on all my female parts.</li>
            <li>The Fresh Breasts goes on like a cream, but dries to a powder so it can show on your dark clothes if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I work hound children every day and am very active at work, so I was looking for something that would help keep me smelling fresh and keep the underboob sweat under control.</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for these and wasn&#x27;t completely let down but neither was I blown away.</li>
            <li>I use the powder consistently but the lotion seems to take a long time to dry</li>
            <li>It did not dry powdery and did not keep me from feeling damp.  </li>
            <li>Wife likes the no sweat stuff I got her for a present to keep them cooled down in hot weather</li>

            <li> It works better than regular dusting powder, but I was a little disappointed that my package had the Lady Powder, but instead of the No Sweat Breast Lotion, I was sent the No Sweat Balls Lotion.  </li>
            <li> I thought these were two products designed to help boob sweat, but the Monkey Butt isn&#x27;t for that at all, so don&#x27;t waste your money on the set if you don&#x27;t have chub rub issues.</li>

            <li> It made my rash under the girls get even worse - left foul smell and peeling.</li>
            <li> no strong &amp;#34;statement&amp;#34; odor.</li>
            <li> and it was incredibly difficult to apply and was a big mess.</li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s woman&#x27;s baby , all subtle.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the Fresh Breasts. You have to wait until it dries to dress.&lt;br /&gt;Anti monkey butt powder is awesome.</li>
            <li> Keeps all skin dry and itch free! The cream is awesome and it works great!</li>
            <li> Been a fan of powder for a year now all of the flavors! Men&#x27;s woman&#x27;s baby , all subtle. It can&#x27;t make you stop sweating but it really helps! The liquid to powder works for me  Give it minutes to dry .</li>
            <li> The lady monkey works wonders,, but the other breast cream wasn&#x27;t to effective.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. The Fresh Breasts goes on like a cream, but dries to a powder so it can show on your dark clothes if you&#x27;re not careful. When this happened to me I just used a clothing sponge designed to remove deodorant marks from dark clothes, worked like a charm. Both products help keep me dry and comfortable, more so than just plain powder, like baby powder. I highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this now, especially in the Texas summer heat!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> The powder works really well on thighs as designed by that breast cream did absolutely NOTHING! in fact i continued to sweat after multiple appilications</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the powder, 4 for the cream.  Both very good, but I find that the cream doesn&#x27;t really become &amp;#34;dry powder&amp;#34; when applied, but its not horrible, so I will keep it.</li>
            <li> I saw this when I was ordering Anti-Monkey Butt powder for my boyfriend so I decided to try it.  It seems to be working well, but I haven&#x27;t put it to any serious tests yet.  The scent is not overly girly.</li>
            <li> The fresh breasts worked ok. It worked about as good as deodorant does so I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed. It takes a couple minutes to dry so walking around holding your boobs up is mandatory every time you use it, which is kind of a pain when it only works as well as deodorant does. And the Monkey Butt worked ok as well. I thought these were two products designed to help boob sweat, but the Monkey Butt isn&#x27;t for that at all, so don&#x27;t waste your money on the set if you don&#x27;t have chub rub issues. The Monkey Butt worked ok, it only lasted as long as the dryness on my thighs lasted. As soon as I got sweaty, the powder seemed to melt away.</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for these and wasn&#x27;t completely let down but neither was I blown away. I work hound children every day and am very active at work, so I was looking for something that would help keep me smelling fresh and keep the underboob sweat under control. Living in the Central Valley of California we have a terrible dry heat right now so I feel like I&#x27;m sweating everywhere. I at attempted to use the monkey butt on my back and it was incredibly difficult to apply and was a big mess. The fresh breasts lessened the sweat in my bra but didn&#x27;t stop it, it also helped what sweat did make it out to not smell bad though.</li>
            <li> Very necessary when temperatures rise and oneis prone to sweating.  Could not survive a summer without it.</li>
            <li> Wife likes the no sweat stuff I got her for a present to keep them cooled down in hot weather</li>
            <li> wonderful!  i am so pleased.  much better than cornstarch or baking soda alone.  scent is very light and pleasing.</li>
            <li> I like both products but I have discovered that my corn sensitivity isn&#x27;t just for ingested corn. I have a rash where I have applied the Lady Anti-Monkey Butt powder because the #1 ingredient is cornstarch! But it smells nice, not too strong and it DOES absorb like I wanted it to. I am sad. I cannot use it.</li>
            <li> especially with the hot weather we have been having this has been great.</li>
            <li> It made my rash under the girls get even worse - left foul smell and peeling. Not getting it ever again...</li>
            <li> It works better than regular dusting powder, but I was a little disappointed that my package had the Lady Powder, but instead of the No Sweat Breast Lotion, I was sent the No Sweat Balls Lotion.  No big deal, I am sure it is the same stuff, but I wish I had a someone to give it too!</li>
            <li> This Fresh Breast cream is supposed to go on and turn powdery to keep you dry.  I did  not find this to be the case.  It did not dry powdery and did not keep me from feeling damp.  While the scent is not unpleasant, it is very nondescript.  I am disappointed in the product and would not recommend it to other consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lady Anti- monkey butt powder is a nice product. Does keep me feeling fresh and dry for a period. I would highly recommend it to buyers.</li>
            <li> love these two together or separately. no strong &amp;#34;statement&amp;#34; odor. feel so much more comfy on hot days.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift love it</li>
            <li> This stuff saved my life. My bathroom no longer has the white film only baby powder can leave. I will say though in regards to the fresh breasts... it has zero scent so almost smells like plastic ... I would love for it to smell fresher. It works amazing!</li>
            <li> I use the powder consistently but the lotion seems to take a long time to dry so I haven&#x27;t used it much. That&#x27;s why I gave this a 3-star rating.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic for all the places you sweat that you can reach! My only complaint is the price. Pretty pricey!</li>
            <li> Works great. This has really helped me get through this summer without rashes on all my female parts.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly and as decribed</li>
