            <li>See the full review here http://essmin.blog.com/2014/12/15/winter-favorites/</li>
            <li>It works great when I first put it on, but by the time I get up in the morning, they are already dry.  </li>
            <li>It can be used sparingly and lasts a good long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best and the only cuticle cream for dry skin and nails.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this cream locally and then it was no longer available.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be reviewing a lot of them, however, this Orly Curticle Therapy is really worth making an exception.  </li>
            <li>It came promptly from the company, but I am not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>It really worked but was dissapointed to find out that there were parabens listed in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I tried putting it on AM and PM, but it didn&#x27;t make much difference.  </li>
            <li>It also has this really funky smell to it.</li>
            <li>I use this product once a day on each cuticle and gently massage it.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m real sensitive to fragrant smelling stuff).</li>
            <li>This actually absorbs and you can feel your cuticles becoming softer instantly.</li>
            <li>This is a full 2 oz jar and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>it comes in a decent size container, delivery was fast and overall it really has helped i defiantly do recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>For some reason they quit making that particular product, and I nearly drove myself batty trying to find something comparable.</li>
            <li>(I happen to be sensitive to scents so it may be fine for other people).</li>
            <li>Consistent use of this has helped in keeping my cuticles soft, well moisturized, thereby improving the overall appearance of my hands.</li>
            <li>This keeps my cuticles soft and stops them from tearing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since the early 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Using Cuticle Therapy Cream keeps my cuticles soft and assists in helping keep my nail bed healthier</li>
            <li>The texture is off, and the smell is much stronger than when I purchase this from a local retailer.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that the cream would end up coming in a tiny bottle , but to my surprise its a decent sized container .</li>
            <li>It is so thick, only a little is needed, and it works great.</li>
            <li>it helps but doesn&#x27;t last long but overall not a bad product</li>
            <li>I have used other products, but I like this one very much.  </li>
            <li>If you have bad cuticles like me, I think this is a great value at 8.99.</li>
            <li>In the three days since I have purchased the product, I have not only noticed a marked reduction in my cuticles, but my hangnails as well.</li>

            <li> so jar lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This Orly Cuticle Therapy Cream was suggested by a customer of mine to take control of dry crackly fingers.</li>
            <li> , I wash my hands a lot in my line of work so my cuticles are dry.  </li>
            <li> I often have problems with my dry, cracked and peeling cuticles.</li>
            <li> I use this every once in a while when I see that my cuticles are very dry and cracked looking</li>
            <li> Living in Minnesota we have very dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I get cuticles year round, but especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li> In about six weeks my cuticles have stopped peeling and the few cracks that are left in them are miniscule.</li>
            <li> This is pretty severe during winter due to the cold weather and I often look for different creams, lotions and moisturizers that help me manage this condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s summer now, so I&#x27;ll be interested to see how well my cuticles hold up during the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> but it helps a little with my arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it has a distinct smell to it.</li>
            <li> A few days use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say that will happen for everyone, as I am not sure that is the intended point of the product, but it happened.</li>
            <li> This cream has an unpleasantly perfumey smell that forced me to stop using it after the second application.</li>
            <li> My cuticles constantly split and nails were chipping and atrocious.</li>
            <li> Plus the cuticles on my thumbs use to grow very thick.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> The horrible smell was so bad, I washed it off the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> So, I stopped cutting them, started using an exfoliator once a week and applying the Orly cuticle therapy nightly.</li>
            <li> My cuticles used to crack and peel terribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I get cuticles year round, but especially in the winter time. This winter, I decided to take a preemptive strike against cuticles by purchasing Orly Cuticle Therapy Cream. In the three days since I have purchased the product, I have not only noticed a marked reduction in my cuticles, but my hangnails as well. I EVEN have noticed a softer skin for the calluses that form because I like to deadlift when weightlifting. I don&#x27;t want to say that will happen for everyone, as I am not sure that is the intended point of the product, but it happened. I am going to start using this stuff on my feet and will report to see if I see any changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the cream smells really nice. If you have bad cuticles like me, I think this is a great value at 8.99.</li>
            <li> My cuticles used to crack and peel terribly. Plus the cuticles on my thumbs use to grow very thick. So, I stopped cutting them, started using an exfoliator once a week and applying the Orly cuticle therapy nightly. In about six weeks my cuticles have stopped peeling and the few cracks that are left in them are miniscule. You do have to apply a nice amount  of the creme to each cuticle and massage it into to each one for about 20-30 seconds. I then place clean white socks on my hands for 5-10 minutes to give the cr√®me the best chance of penetrating the skin. This is the best my cuticles have looked in years. It&#x27;s summer now, so I&#x27;ll be interested to see how well my cuticles hold up during the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> I love this more than cuticle oil, which seems to just sit on top of my skin. This actually absorbs and you can feel your cuticles becoming softer instantly. See the full review here http://essmin.blog.com/2014/12/15/winter-favorites/</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for many years and I love it.  Worth the cost.  You use just a dab so jar lasts a long time.  You can see results within days.  Try it, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> I should have paid closer attention to the labeling. This cream has an unpleasantly perfumey smell that forced me to stop using it after the second application. The cream itself was fine. Wish I had purchased a non-scented version. A friend suggested applying a cuticle cream just before bedtime. The horrible smell was so bad, I washed it off the second time I used it. Sorry. Won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but NOT as great as the Revlon cuticle cream that disappeared from the market. I wish they would bring it back.</li>
            <li> This is the best and the only cuticle cream for dry skin and nails.  Used nightly, the cream will provide&lt;br /&gt;a seriously better softness and pliability to the cuticles. It can be used sparingly and lasts a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;So buy it!</li>
            <li> This Orly Cuticle Therapy Cream was suggested by a customer of mine to take control of dry crackly fingers. It is the only therapy cream that controls and mends the problem. I strongly recommend this product to cure the dryness of fingers.</li>
            <li> Before I found this, I used Revlon cuticle cream and loved it. For some reason they quit making that particular product, and I nearly drove myself batty trying to find something comparable. I found this at Sally&#x27;s, and I have a sneaky suspicion they are the same thing. They have the same ingredients and the same fragrance. It is so thick, only a little is needed, and it works great. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this cream locally and then it was no longer available. I&#x27;m so happy to find this alternative source. So is my daughter...she&#x27;s hooked on it, too.</li>
            <li> Nice cuticle cream.  It is creamy, not too oily and rubs in well. It has a fairly strong sent that is flowery. The scent is a bit strong for me, but it wears off pretty quickly and then it smells nice (I happen to be sensitive to scents so it may be fine for other people). It moisturizes quite well and is nice on the hands too.  Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I prefer Orly nail products to almost any others.  I have ordered so many I won&#x27;t be reviewing a lot of them, however, this Orly Curticle Therapy is really worth making an exception.  It is really a wonderful product that makes cuticles as smooth as silk.  Well worth purchasing if you have dry hard skin around your nails as I do.  This is a full 2 oz jar and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> This product is PERFECT for any cuticle issue from dryness to peeling and everything in between. It&#x27;s easy to use, and it smells great! I&#x27;ve used several different products to try and care for my cuticles, but nothing works as well as Orly. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and already I can see and feel an improvement in the health of my cuticles, and my nails are finally able to grow in a healthy state. I would recommend this to anybody looking for an easy and affordable way to revitalize their cuticles!</li>
            <li> I loved this cuticle cream.  It really worked but was dissapointed to find out that there were parabens listed in the ingredients.  I tossed it.</li>
            <li> So happy I discovered this product.  It is excellent for splitting, peeling nails .</li>
            <li> It came promptly from the company, but I am not crazy about it.  I put it on every night, I wash my hands a lot in my line of work so my cuticles are dry.  It works great when I first put it on, but by the time I get up in the morning, they are already dry.  I tried putting it on AM and PM, but it didn&#x27;t make much difference.  Perhaps I just need something heavier.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would work. It didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. It also has this really funky smell to it.</li>
            <li> I use this every once in a while when I see that my cuticles are very dry and cracked looking it helps but doesn&#x27;t last long but overall not a bad product</li>
            <li> Love this,  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cuticle cream to replace one I used that had been discontinued.  This keeps my cuticles soft and stops them from tearing.  It goes a long ways and is a great value .</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle cream.  It keeps my cuticles looking great and it makes your skin feel super soft.  My husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit(and I&#x27;m real sensitive to fragrant smelling stuff).</li>
            <li> This cream has healed up my hands and feet that used to crack and bleed!  Better than the prescription products...I think I needed the lanolin...I put it on at night with cotton gloves and socks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the early 80&#x27;s.  Great cuticle cream!!</li>
            <li> I wish it did more but it helps a little with my arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> I  likeits , only after 4 or 5 days  I see  a deference, My  cuticle  get look much better and stop growing in a  wrong way!Thank you</li>
            <li> I was worried that the cream would end up coming in a tiny bottle , but to my surprise its a decent sized container .</li>
            <li> I have hand lotions that feel more moisturizing than this cream. I&#x27;ll continue to use it, however I don&#x27;t see or feel a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  Also, it smells. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it has a distinct smell to it.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years and buy it in bulk to have one in each vehicle, at bedside and travel suitcase.</li>
            <li> I often have problems with my dry, cracked and peeling cuticles. This is pretty severe during winter due to the cold weather and I often look for different creams, lotions and moisturizers that help me manage this condition. I ordered this product initially from Amazon  based on a co-workers recommendation and have been using it regularly since then.I am definitely very impressed with this product so far.This cuticle cream by Orly has the right thickness and texture,pleasant fragrance and above all is a great moisturizer.I use this product once a day on each cuticle and gently massage it.Consistent use of this has helped in keeping my cuticles soft, well moisturized, thereby improving the overall appearance of my hands.This is definitely one of the best cuticle creme I have ever used and I would highly recommend this product to anyone because this does take very good care of cuticles.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have used this product for more than 20 years and I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  I will buy this over and over. Great cream that really makes a difference in the cuticles moisture level.</li>
            <li> Lets me start of by saying this is one of the best creams i have ever tried i had very dry cuticles that would crack all the time this cream helped so much my cuticles look great it comes in a decent size container, delivery was fast and overall it really has helped i defiantly do recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> delivered as described and on time. thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cuticle cream for about 3 weeks now.  My cuticles are in the best shape they have ever been.  I have used other products, but I like this one very much.  It has a pleasant fragrance, and really absorbs well into my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because a friend told me that she uses it for her cracked heels in the winter. A few days use and I can see the difference already!</li>
            <li> It a miracle creme, very happy with the results I have achieved. If you stick with it, after 7-10 days your cuticles will not only look great but feel great.</li>
            <li> I received my order of Orly Cuticle Therapy Cream two days earlier than promised.  The cream has a nice scent, not too strong.  The cream is light and airy and not too greasy on my skin.  There is no residual feeling on my skin or nails.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing my cuticles improving.</li>
            <li> Living in Minnesota we have very dry skin in the winter. My cuticles constantly split and nails were chipping and atrocious. Using Cuticle Therapy Cream keeps my cuticles soft and assists in helping keep my nail bed healthier so I have prettier nails.</li>
            <li> The texture is off, and the smell is much stronger than when I purchase this from a local retailer.  I could not get a replacement, so I am using it.  Will not buy this from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> very good. I recomend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is the closest to the old Revlon nail creme that we all loved.  Still wish that Revlon would make it again.</li>
