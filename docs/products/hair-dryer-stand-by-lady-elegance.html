    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This hair dryer holder/stand has been perfect for me to use as I am grooming my two dogs.</li>
            <li>I have learned how to deal with the quirks and am very happy I got this as one of my arms is injured</li>
            <li>so it is perfect for this stand.</li>
            <li>Not the best quality but what do you expect for the price.  </li>
            <li>It is a super buy!!!</li>
            <li>I have MS and this is a great tool for most everyone.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This product is meeting my needs nicely.  </li>
            <li>It stays nice and still on the counter and does not wobble</li>
            <li>My hairdryer is very light weight</li>
            <li>This tool is really a great value considering how much I use it (every day).  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend even if you would just enjoy hands free styling...that is a wonderful feeling!</li>
            <li>its crap..made out of cheap materials that will break very easily..</li>
            <li>It also frees my hands, so I can work the brush closer to the scalp and more precisely to get a straighter look.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hands free to use a brush or more than one tool.  </li>
            <li>I have used this stand several times and it works great.  </li>
            <li>and this really helps me style my own hair.</li>
            <li>Stable, good quality and very useful, plus great price for something that really saves me time, which like most of us I have very little of.  </li>
            <li>It has taken a couple of dips on the goose neck, but holds steady for the most part.  </li>
            <li>The snaking top is not the sturdiest, but it does hold my heavy dryer fairly well.  </li>
            <li>thing about this product is that I automatically put the hair dryer on backwards thinking it went that way, so be sure to look at the picture in the directions to make sure you have the hair dryer sitting in the stand properly.  </li>
            <li>didnt even get to try first use the cheap plastic broke when attempting to place my dryer in the clamp..</li>
            <li>It is an extremely useful device.  </li>
            <li>I put a second velcro on the top (from the similar stand I had before) to more securely attach my dryer to the stand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flimsy and light and a normal hairdryer like the one pictured topples it over.</li>
            <li>I can bend the holder arm so that the air goes exactly where I need it</li>
            <li>It holds the hair dryer, so I can flip upside down and more easily get to the thickest part of my hair that I sometimes missed completely drying before.  </li>
            <li>The plastic portion was strong enough, but no strength otherwise</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flimsy.</li>
            <li>was unsatisfied with the ability to support the dryer unit unless it was held by the clamps straight into the holder.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blow drying my hair straight for years.  </li>
            <li>Very usable item.</li>
            <li>If your hair dryer doesn&#x27;t have a long barrel then this is not so easy to use.</li>
            <li>The directions for assembly were a little confusing and the screw holes did not match perfectly but, once assembled, it is certainly satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Did the job, once we found a way to make it stay up a little better.</li>
            <li>and it leaves me hands free to brush out the wet dog.</li>
            <li>It would not hold my normal one.</li>
            <li>fortunately the seller gave me a full refund after i sent them a complaint about it..</li>
            <li>I bought a second one for a friend who really loves it too.</li>
            <li>It barely holds up my hairdryer without bending.</li>
            <li>I have a really heavy hair dryer and it holds it up pretty well.  </li>
            <li>good seller bad product</li>

            <li> I have found the hair dryer stand to be very stable, but at first when I had it the wrong direction it wasn&#x27;t quite holding up the dryer.  </li>
            <li> This stand holds my old heavy hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife because she has problems holding the hair blower with her hands for a long time.this product does work.she can dry her hair without having to be holding the dryer,I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, so it takes quite a while to dry - and, it has to be completely dry, so I can hot roll it.  </li>
            <li> The connection portion was not strong enough to control the unit in any other position.  </li>
            <li> I also apply make-up while drying my hair and brush my teeth and other things</li>
            <li> Some of the other comments on stability in the reviews might have put the hair dryer on backwards too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It just seemed like it should go the other direction..</li>
            <li> It holds the hair dryer with the help of the velcro strap, but the gooseneck that lets you position the dryer is not strong enough to stay up once it is bent over a little.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer stand is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> so it cuts down on your preparation time and allows you to multi-task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They sell similar equipment for grooming purposes, but the professional pet dryer is very expensive even in my wholesale pet grooming supply books.</li>
            <li> Assembly was easy, but was missing the screw to tighten at base.</li>
            <li> There were just a few glitches but duct tape helped.</li>
            <li> It was not easy to put together because the screws don&#x27;t line up with the holes.</li>
            <li> Also, once the dryer is velcroed in place it is hard to turn it on for use.</li>
            <li> I have to take it apart in order for this feature to work, then it loses it&#x27;s grip.</li>
            <li> The base is heavy, so it has never tipped.  </li>
            <li> sorry to say that this item is a piece of junk, not sturdy at all, falls apart something that I cannot recommend</li>
            <li> wrong!  </li>
            <li> VERY disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I suffer from terrible shoulder pain,  I wish I had found this years ago.  </li>

            <li> This hair dryer holder/stand has been perfect for me to use as I am grooming my two dogs. I can bend the holder arm so that the air goes exactly where I need it and it leaves me hands free to brush out the wet dog. They sell similar equipment for grooming purposes, but the professional pet dryer is very expensive even in my wholesale pet grooming supply books. This works and is a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I received this for Christmas from my wish list. I have MS and this is a great tool for most everyone. With the dryer stand you can control the brush with 2 hands. Assembly was easy, but was missing the screw to tighten at base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy. The hair dryer keeps falling over. The adjustable stand doesn&#x27;t lock into place 90% of the time. I have to take it apart in order for this feature to work, then it loses it&#x27;s grip.</li>
            <li> This product is meeting my needs nicely.  I have a really heavy hair dryer and it holds it up pretty well.  It has taken a couple of dips on the goose neck, but holds steady for the most part.  The base is heavy, so it has never tipped.  It is an extremely useful device.  The directions for assembly were a little confusing and the screw holes did not match perfectly but, once assembled, it is certainly satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. There were just a few glitches but duct tape helped. If your hair dryer doesn&#x27;t have a long barrel then this is not so easy to use. Also, once the dryer is velcroed in place it is hard to turn it on for use. I have learned how to deal with the quirks and am very happy I got this as one of my arms is injured and it has simplified the process of drying my hair with only one arm. Now if we could just use it to make dinner, we would be all set!!!!</li>
            <li> I am trying to put off shoulder replacement and I thought this could help.  It did!  When I&#x27;m blow drying the front of my hair, I put the stand between my legs, of course I&#x27;m sitting.</li>
            <li> So flimsy that you have to watch it so your dryer doesn&#x27;t hit the floor. Besides it is an eyesore in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer stand is not worth the money. It&#x27;s poorly designed and cheaply made. It was not easy to put together because the screws don&#x27;t line up with the holes.The adjustment piece doesn&#x27;t work. It barely holds up my hairdryer without bending. VERY disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this stand several times and it works great.  I use it in the lowest position and set it on the bathroom counter.  My hairdryer is very light weight so it is perfect for this stand.</li>
            <li> It stays nice and still on the counter and does not wobble but I did have to go and buy a lighter blow dryer.  It would not hold my normal one.</li>
            <li> This stand holds my old heavy hair dryer.  I only have use of one hand and this really helps me style my own hair.</li>
            <li> The stand can extend to accommodate taller people but doesn&#x27;t come with a component to lock in the height of the stand.  It&#x27;s got limitations but I will keep it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for when I broke my wrist. It&#x27;s flimsy and light and a normal hairdryer like the one pictured topples it over. I had to rig it with a hangar because the coil section bends with the weight of the dryer. Not worth the money. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife because she has problems holding the hair blower with her hands for a long time.this product does work.she can dry her hair without having to be holding the dryer,I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> was unsatisfied with the ability to support the dryer unit unless it was held by the clamps straight into the holder.  The connection portion was not strong enough to control the unit in any other position.  The plastic portion was strong enough, but no strength otherwise</li>
            <li> its crap..made out of cheap materials that will break very easily..didnt even get to try first use the cheap plastic broke when attempting to place my dryer in the clamp..fortunately the seller gave me a full refund after i sent them a complaint about it..good seller bad product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blow drying my hair straight for years.  My hair is very thick, so it takes quite a while to dry - and, it has to be completely dry, so I can hot roll it.  This stand has made life easier.  It holds the hair dryer, so I can flip upside down and more easily get to the thickest part of my hair that I sometimes missed completely drying before.  It also frees my hands, so I can work the brush closer to the scalp and more precisely to get a straighter look.  The snaking top is not the sturdiest, but it does hold my heavy dryer fairly well.  I put a second velcro on the top (from the similar stand I had before) to more securely attach my dryer to the stand.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality but what do you expect for the price.  Very usable item.</li>
            <li> I suffer from terrible shoulder pain,  I wish I had found this years ago.  It is a super buy!!! I highly reccomend even if you would just enjoy hands free styling...that is a wonderful feeling!</li>
            <li> sorry to say that this item is a piece of junk, not sturdy at all, falls apart something that I cannot recommend</li>
            <li> It holds the hair dryer with the help of the velcro strap, but the gooseneck that lets you position the dryer is not strong enough to stay up once it is bent over a little.  Did the job, once we found a way to make it stay up a little better.</li>
            <li> This tool is really a great value considering how much I use it (every day).  There are several advantages to this product.  It leaves your hands free to use a brush or more than one tool.  I also apply make-up while drying my hair and brush my teeth and other things so it cuts down on your preparation time and allows you to multi-task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about this product is that I automatically put the hair dryer on backwards thinking it went that way, so be sure to look at the picture in the directions to make sure you have the hair dryer sitting in the stand properly.  I have found the hair dryer stand to be very stable, but at first when I had it the wrong direction it wasn&#x27;t quite holding up the dryer.  Some of the other comments on stability in the reviews might have put the hair dryer on backwards too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just seemed like it should go the other direction.. wrong!  I totally recommend this product.  Stable, good quality and very useful, plus great price for something that really saves me time, which like most of us I have very little of.  I bought a second one for a friend who really loves it too.</li>
