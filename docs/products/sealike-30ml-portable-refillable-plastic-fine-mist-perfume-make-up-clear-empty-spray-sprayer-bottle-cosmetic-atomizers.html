            <li>Great price; however, if you are looking for a gentle mist, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>I got these to mist a small desk plant and they work great!</li>
            <li>Just the right size and sprays the right amount...</li>
            <li>Great small bottles..</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>2 inches tall and spray very well.</li>
            <li>Two of the bottles have plastic that is compromised with areas where the plastic is very soft (not hard as described) as if damaged by heat or something else.</li>

            <li> Perfect. I use these to hold my rosewater toner so I can spray directly on my Face. Also use these to hold a mix of essential oil that I keep in my purse as perfume. They are thick plastic and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Good product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Tiny little things and spray really well!!</li>

            <li> Not as described from the pic. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> These are junk. They do NOT spray a mist. They shoot a stream of water like a squirt gun. Refund my money!</li>
            <li> Two of the bottles have plastic that is compromised with areas where the plastic is very soft (not hard as described) as if damaged by heat or something else. Really disappointed.</li>
