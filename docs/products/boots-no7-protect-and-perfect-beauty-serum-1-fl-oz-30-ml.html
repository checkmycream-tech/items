            <li>This lasts all day which is great.</li>
            <li>Made my skin look and fee amazing!  </li>
            <li>however this is one of the very best skin care lines on the market and price makes it even that much more valuable.  </li>
            <li>I must state here for this review that I have really good skin and a good complexion to begin with - and I want to maintain it which is why I wanted to try this product line.</li>
            <li>Boots Restore &amp; Renew is a really good product.</li>
            <li>works good, will recommend this.</li>
            <li>I have always taken good care if my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good, if it helps you, I am all for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I was blessed with good skin time does take an effect.  </li>
            <li>helps with the fine lines around my eyes and this is a very good thing</li>
            <li>The products feel great (not greasy) and most are fragrance-free.    </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know what they were using because I sure haven&#x27;t seen the great results they supposedly had.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, its worth</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I want to keep my skin looking good and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have been using the cream for about 3 weeks now and to be honest, I don&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>It was nice feeling serum and did not cause any side effects</li>
            <li>It just felt nice.</li>
            <li>Make your own face masks and exfoliates using honey, yogurt, strawberry, avocado,egg, etc.   </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find that Target started to stock Boots products, including this one, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>The affordable price makes it even more appealing!</li>
            <li>try natural oils like coconut oil (my favorite), almond oil, Shea butter is great, alcohol free witch hazel is wonderful, etc .   </li>
            <li>Thus far, I&#x27;m very happy with this brand.</li>
            <li>My skin appears more supple, flawless, and bright, especially around the cheek and eye area.</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>That said, I have experienced positive results from this and the suite of Olay products and will continue to be a long-term customer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it for sure.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading a rave review and am so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I particularly love this serum.</li>
            <li>and I love the face wash (cream).</li>
            <li>My husband has noticed that my make up looks smoother and better when applied</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkles were not as prominent after 14 days.</li>
            <li>I still love it, and stand by what I said before.  </li>
            <li>I believe it needs more time.</li>
            <li>There is convincing data that it works alsmost as well as prescription tretoin.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks of using this product, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin from strangers and people I know.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Helps with many skin issues.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t work for them or even in the beauty industry, I just like many women was looking for an alternative to injections or $100 lotions.</li>
            <li>love love love it</li>
            <li>Like many of the products out there this one&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This serum is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after putting on this serum.</li>
            <li>I love the hydrating effect from this serun, but worry about the fact that it contains parabens.</li>
            <li>Saw this product on the Dr Oz show tried it and just love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and over the years have noticed my face pores are much more noticeable</li>
            <li>Worked ok but not miraculous.</li>
            <li>Heard so many raving reviews.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for a more aggressive anti-aging.</li>
            <li>love this serum.  </li>
            <li>love the tube much better than the glass container.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is probably more even.</li>
            <li>It does makes my skin feel really nice, but i think i have to use it longer to see the true effect.</li>
            <li>From the first time I put in on my face, my face felt good.</li>
            <li>I have loved this product since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this in 2008 I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Have only been using for a couple of weeks and got a compliment from my Dr., saying my skin looked nice and had great texture.</li>
            <li>If you have oily or combination skin, the Complexion Refining Deep Clean Mousse is excellent.      </li>
            <li>I makes my skin feel smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin more even and incredibly smooth.  </li>
            <li>And most important, it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>Being a licensed hairdresser for many years, skin care is extremely important to me.  </li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on the best skin creams and seriums on the market with the leading physicians, product being my line.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to expensive serums and works wonderfully, I purchased online because I did not have time to go to store.</li>
            <li>but it did nothing to improve fine lines, tone or texture.</li>
            <li>I can already see a difference in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also got huge, puffy bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I think that it is important to accurately pick the products within the Boots line that are for your skin type.</li>
            <li>It makes my makeup go on smooth, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>I apply it once a day after a shower so it will be more easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>The laugh lines are what bugs me the most.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this product and would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, as it was before I started using the serum.</li>
            <li>makes skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It makes a real difference when applied morning and evening before a regular moisturizer (I use the Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Day Cream).</li>
            <li>No.7 Protect &amp; Perfect serum comes in this regular formula and and in an INTENSE formula.  </li>
            <li>For the best results I use Boots No7 Restore &amp; Renew Beauty Serum under a high SPF sun screen such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I also found that the moisturizer I use after seems to go on more smoothly, easily and absorb more completely.  </li>
            <li>When it was first released there, it was a huge hit becoming sold out really quickly all over.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light, barely noticeable and I have had no reaction.</li>
            <li>Please read the list of ingredients and search even a handful of them and you will quickly see that there is very little good in this product and a whole lot of not so good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably keep using it, just because of the quick resullts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product leaves my face soft, and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>What I have noticed is how much softer and more supple my skin is and how much the appearance of my fine wrinkles is minimized when I wear the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this keeps my face very soft without it being greasy.  </li>
            <li>it is worth it..</li>
            <li>For $20, it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I have laugh (marionette) lines &amp; the beginning of crows feet.</li>
            <li>These things are safe and natural, chocked full of antioxidants and very inexpensive.   </li>
            <li>took this home and used it right away ...</li>
            <li>However, I have great skin, very few lines, some wrinkles, and pliant, elastic skin.</li>
            <li>While these two products have helped me maintain a youthful appearance, pay attention to a few simple rules to reap the best benefits.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Been using Boots 7 products and I like them very much</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way so great value!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different skincare products including those from department stores, infomercials, and the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought I was making stuff up in my head</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve received multiple comments on how much better my skin looks since changing my skin regimen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a lot of experimenting and have yet to find anything that I love enough to stick with.</li>
            <li>The package says the product is hypoallergenic, but be aware that it can cause an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>Better than Olay deep wrinkle when added to the night cream.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, smooth and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Intense\\&quot; works the same as the regular Protect &amp; Perfect Beauty Serum in my opinion so save the couple bucks &amp; just get the regular one.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I still LOVE lot of other Boots products and would recommend the Boots No. 7 Glycolic Peel Kit, No. 7 Micro-dermabrasion Scrub or the Boots Original Formula Overnight Cream.</li>
            <li>It is made in the UK, and I was under the impression that in europe products are a little more advanced than in the US.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY skin care product that really does make a noticeable difference in the more youthful appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is made up mostly of filler, and I&#x27;m doubting that there is enough retinal in this product to make much of any difference when it comes to anti-aging needs.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more than hyped up silicone in a bottle, this product is so full of silicones it would prevent any of it&#x27;s \\&quot;anti aging\\&quot; ingredients from penetrating at all, their \\&quot;study\\&quot; to prove this stuff \\&quot;really works\\&quot; was funded by, none other than guess who?</li>
            <li>In the long run, if you end up using it as frequently &amp; in as many places as I do thoes couple $$ add up to bottles over time.</li>
            <li>and at first it seems like it&#x27;s really \\&quot;working.\\</li>
            <li>But this has definitely worked for me to reduce the fine lines on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li>One person described it as a \\&quot;glow.\\&quot; I use it in combination with a very high PPD sunscreen, which seems to strengthen the effect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have uber-sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t speak to the other reviews on this product that have been less than ideal.</li>
            <li>I really can see an improvement.</li>
            <li>use the whole line...</li>
            <li>Much smoother.</li>
            <li>I really like the Boots No7 product line</li>
            <li>My face really does feel restored and renewed.</li>
            <li>Serum has not a cosmetic that I really needed or used.</li>
            <li>I do notice that my skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>However, it has not helped to even the skin tone as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>I watched very closely and</li>
            <li>, initially it makes your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>This product has very noticeable effects in reducing the depth of my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a month now and really like it.</li>
            <li>but this cream really works at reducing pores.</li>
            <li>The product is also very affordable.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I could really tell a difference in how my skin looked after I used this for a week or so.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to many different creams and make up, but I have had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li>I use a tiny dab and then another tiny dab of the No7 Day cream and my skin soft and supple and feels good all day.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how long it would take to see results, but so far the product is working well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it makes your skin feel like silk instantly</li>
            <li>Methylparaben, which is readily absorbed through the skin, has been found in large quantities in human breast cancer cells.  </li>
            <li>Better than many expensive products I have used.  </li>
            <li>In addition to the serum, the No7 moisturizer, eye cream, wrinkle filler, and Glycolic Peel kit are all highly recommended.      </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommmend this serum.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was highly recommended by an &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; I was watching on a network talk show.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing subtle improvement in facial lines--the product feels great going on</li>
            <li>For anti-aging benefits that are real and inexpensive, go natural....</li>
            <li>You apply it to a clean dry face, before moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal and i don&#x27;t see how boots works for some and not others.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if my skin will be better looking and firmer.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this on its own since Premier has helped with the skin tone, but if anyone is currently using other skin care lines, this would be a beneficial part to add!</li>
            <li>On days when I have had to use other skin lotions, even ones much more expensive then this, my skin has not felt or looked as good.</li>
            <li>I honestly get compliments on my skin everyday!!</li>
            <li>and I attribute this to the new Boots products that I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my mouth and eyes (and in between my eyes) seem much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I hope they make it in a bigger bottle eventually because 1oz goes fast!</li>
            <li>Better than Lancome which costs a small fortune and offers no noticeable result</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice anything extraordinary with my skin once the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li>My skin also tends to be a little sensitive so that is important.</li>
            <li>Users should keep in mind that the instructions clearly state that a moisturizer should be applied afterwords.  </li>
            <li>To be clear, I have not used this product.</li>
            <li>So far i like it</li>
            <li>My skin all ready feels and appears tighter, younger I will continue to order.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and I&#x27;m going to be 70 years old on December 1st.</li>
            <li>and wow.</li>
            <li>I always change skin care items reluctantly because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>And finally, if you really need retinal treatment,go to a Dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I am almost 60, but still have very oily skin &amp; occasional acne, AND now developing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s and started to see lines that no longer go away.</li>
            <li>This is very helpful in filling out wrinkles and aging skin, especially around the mouth.  </li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft with the deepness of wrinkles decreasing.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin feel soft and healthy after only a few times of using it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that lines have diminished, but the product feels soothing, and it creates a wonderfully silky base for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I HAVE BETTER RESULTS FROM THE PRODUCTS THAT JENNIFER FLAVIN STALLONE HAS ON SERIOUS SKINCARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are products costing the same or less which last longer and perform considerably better.</li>
            <li>This was my first Boots purchase, and it will definitely be the last.</li>
            <li>Especially if you are consistent with daily use.</li>
            <li>The Restore &amp; Renew serum only gives me the positive effects without leaving my face red and tender.</li>
            <li>, I do not look twenty years younger, but facial lines got much softer, my skin feels silky and soft, it is glowing(believe</li>
            <li>I have just started to use it - hopefully it will work as expected ;-)</li>
            <li>The ROC retinol serum I tried before had similar results with wrinkles but made my face very sensitive with just a week-long use.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I&#x27;m allergic to something in this product.</li>
            <li>I have eczema, and have no reaction so far (which would probably have been immediate, since it is an allergy related disease).  </li>
            <li>Not pink pimples or whiteheads, just a patch of bumps.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, not oily nor dry, and what I wanted was some assistance with lines.</li>
            <li>have very dry skin and Boots makes it moist and silky smooth with just a few drops.  </li>
            <li>I have never broken out from any other skin product</li>
            <li>one of the many silicones listed in this is known to build up for months and can be dangerous, this is example of how advertising can really fool people.</li>
            <li>The INTENSE is sold for $23 at Target and other stores; the regular for $19.  </li>
            <li>No topical skin lotion will permanently alter the look and feel of your skin, so I never expected those sorts of results from Boots</li>
            <li>Well worth the small price.  </li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>After years of spending money on a plethora of useless products, I finally came to realize that if it is advertised on Television as something miraculous, it is most likely complete garbage.  </li>
            <li>within the first few days I noticed a couple of the same bumps</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;m working to prevent further damage, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the price you only have to use a small amount.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> No. 7 Protect &amp; Perfect beauty serum.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on skin.</li>
            <li> When applied before make up,  it gives you a luminous glow and your make up application is beautiful!</li>
            <li> I replaced a product I had been using for a number of years with the Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum!</li>
            <li> This one is just perfect.</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> Great price, great product!</li>
            <li> Was not as impressed with this as everyone else and the claims of it being so good.</li>
            <li> Great firming lotion.  </li>
            <li> My neck looks great.  </li>
            <li> The product is a great deal.</li>
            <li> happy with this.</li>
            <li> Great buy on line or at Target.</li>
            <li> This lasts all day which is great.</li>
            <li> Made my skin look and fee amazing!  </li>
            <li> however this is one of the very best skin care lines on the market and price makes it even that much more valuable.  </li>
            <li> I must state here for this review that I have really good skin and a good complexion to begin with - and I want to maintain it which is why I wanted to try this product line.</li>
            <li> Boots Restore &amp; Renew is a really good product.</li>
            <li> works good, will recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have always taken good care if my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good, if it helps you, I am all for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I was blessed with good skin time does take an effect.  </li>
            <li> helps with the fine lines around my eyes and this is a very good thing</li>
            <li> The products feel great (not greasy) and most are fragrance-free.    </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know what they were using because I sure haven&#x27;t seen the great results they supposedly had.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, its worth</li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I want to keep my skin looking good and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for about 3 weeks now and to be honest, I don&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> It was nice feeling serum and did not cause any side effects</li>
            <li> It just felt nice.</li>
            <li> Make your own face masks and exfoliates using honey, yogurt, strawberry, avocado,egg, etc.   </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find that Target started to stock Boots products, including this one, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> The affordable price makes it even more appealing!</li>
            <li> try natural oils like coconut oil (my favorite), almond oil, Shea butter is great, alcohol free witch hazel is wonderful, etc .   </li>
            <li> Thus far, I&#x27;m very happy with this brand.</li>
            <li> My skin appears more supple, flawless, and bright, especially around the cheek and eye area.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> That said, I have experienced positive results from this and the suite of Olay products and will continue to be a long-term customer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it for sure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading a rave review and am so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I particularly love this serum.</li>
            <li> and I love the face wash (cream).</li>
            <li> My husband has noticed that my make up looks smoother and better when applied</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles were not as prominent after 14 days.</li>
            <li> I still love it, and stand by what I said before.  </li>
            <li> I believe it needs more time.</li>
            <li> There is convincing data that it works alsmost as well as prescription tretoin.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks of using this product, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin from strangers and people I know.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Helps with many skin issues.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t work for them or even in the beauty industry, I just like many women was looking for an alternative to injections or $100 lotions.</li>
            <li> love love love it</li>
            <li> Like many of the products out there this one&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This serum is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after putting on this serum.</li>
            <li> I love the hydrating effect from this serun, but worry about the fact that it contains parabens.</li>
            <li> Saw this product on the Dr Oz show tried it and just love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and over the years have noticed my face pores are much more noticeable</li>
            <li> Worked ok but not miraculous.</li>
            <li> Heard so many raving reviews.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a more aggressive anti-aging.</li>
            <li> love this serum.  </li>
            <li> love the tube much better than the glass container.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is probably more even.</li>
            <li> It does makes my skin feel really nice, but i think i have to use it longer to see the true effect.</li>
            <li> From the first time I put in on my face, my face felt good.</li>
            <li> I have loved this product since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this in 2008 I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Have only been using for a couple of weeks and got a compliment from my Dr., saying my skin looked nice and had great texture.</li>
            <li> If you have oily or combination skin, the Complexion Refining Deep Clean Mousse is excellent.      </li>
            <li> I makes my skin feel smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin more even and incredibly smooth.  </li>
            <li> And most important, it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> Being a licensed hairdresser for many years, skin care is extremely important to me.  </li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on the best skin creams and seriums on the market with the leading physicians, product being my line.  </li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to expensive serums and works wonderfully, I purchased online because I did not have time to go to store.</li>
            <li> but it did nothing to improve fine lines, tone or texture.</li>
            <li> I can already see a difference in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also got huge, puffy bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I think that it is important to accurately pick the products within the Boots line that are for your skin type.</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup go on smooth, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> I apply it once a day after a shower so it will be more easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> The laugh lines are what bugs me the most.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product and would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, as it was before I started using the serum.</li>
            <li> makes skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It makes a real difference when applied morning and evening before a regular moisturizer (I use the Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Day Cream).</li>
            <li> No.7 Protect &amp; Perfect serum comes in this regular formula and and in an INTENSE formula.  </li>
            <li> For the best results I use Boots No7 Restore &amp; Renew Beauty Serum under a high SPF sun screen such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I also found that the moisturizer I use after seems to go on more smoothly, easily and absorb more completely.  </li>
            <li> When it was first released there, it was a huge hit becoming sold out really quickly all over.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and light, barely noticeable and I have had no reaction.</li>
            <li> Please read the list of ingredients and search even a handful of them and you will quickly see that there is very little good in this product and a whole lot of not so good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably keep using it, just because of the quick resullts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face soft, and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> What I have noticed is how much softer and more supple my skin is and how much the appearance of my fine wrinkles is minimized when I wear the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and this keeps my face very soft without it being greasy.  </li>
            <li> it is worth it..</li>
            <li> For $20, it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I have laugh (marionette) lines &amp; the beginning of crows feet.</li>
            <li> These things are safe and natural, chocked full of antioxidants and very inexpensive.   </li>
            <li> took this home and used it right away ...</li>
            <li> However, I have great skin, very few lines, some wrinkles, and pliant, elastic skin.</li>
            <li> While these two products have helped me maintain a youthful appearance, pay attention to a few simple rules to reap the best benefits.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Been using Boots 7 products and I like them very much</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way so great value!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different skincare products including those from department stores, infomercials, and the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought I was making stuff up in my head</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve received multiple comments on how much better my skin looks since changing my skin regimen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of experimenting and have yet to find anything that I love enough to stick with.</li>
            <li> The package says the product is hypoallergenic, but be aware that it can cause an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Better than Olay deep wrinkle when added to the night cream.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, smooth and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Intense\\&quot; works the same as the regular Protect &amp; Perfect Beauty Serum in my opinion so save the couple bucks &amp; just get the regular one.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I still LOVE lot of other Boots products and would recommend the Boots No. 7 Glycolic Peel Kit, No. 7 Micro-dermabrasion Scrub or the Boots Original Formula Overnight Cream.</li>
            <li> It is made in the UK, and I was under the impression that in europe products are a little more advanced than in the US.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY skin care product that really does make a noticeable difference in the more youthful appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is made up mostly of filler, and I&#x27;m doubting that there is enough retinal in this product to make much of any difference when it comes to anti-aging needs.  </li>
            <li> Nothing more than hyped up silicone in a bottle, this product is so full of silicones it would prevent any of it&#x27;s \\&quot;anti aging\\&quot; ingredients from penetrating at all, their \\&quot;study\\&quot; to prove this stuff \\&quot;really works\\&quot; was funded by, none other than guess who?</li>
            <li> In the long run, if you end up using it as frequently &amp; in as many places as I do thoes couple $$ add up to bottles over time.</li>
            <li> and at first it seems like it&#x27;s really \\&quot;working.\\</li>
            <li> But this has definitely worked for me to reduce the fine lines on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> One person described it as a \\&quot;glow.\\&quot; I use it in combination with a very high PPD sunscreen, which seems to strengthen the effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have uber-sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t speak to the other reviews on this product that have been less than ideal.</li>
            <li> I really can see an improvement.</li>
            <li> use the whole line...</li>
            <li> Much smoother.</li>
            <li> I really like the Boots No7 product line</li>
            <li> My face really does feel restored and renewed.</li>
            <li> Serum has not a cosmetic that I really needed or used.</li>
            <li> I do notice that my skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> However, it has not helped to even the skin tone as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> I watched very closely and</li>
            <li> , initially it makes your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li> This product has very noticeable effects in reducing the depth of my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a month now and really like it.</li>
            <li> but this cream really works at reducing pores.</li>
            <li> The product is also very affordable.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I could really tell a difference in how my skin looked after I used this for a week or so.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to many different creams and make up, but I have had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I use a tiny dab and then another tiny dab of the No7 Day cream and my skin soft and supple and feels good all day.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how long it would take to see results, but so far the product is working well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it makes your skin feel like silk instantly</li>
            <li> Methylparaben, which is readily absorbed through the skin, has been found in large quantities in human breast cancer cells.  </li>
            <li> Better than many expensive products I have used.  </li>
            <li> In addition to the serum, the No7 moisturizer, eye cream, wrinkle filler, and Glycolic Peel kit are all highly recommended.      </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommmend this serum.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was highly recommended by an &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; I was watching on a network talk show.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing subtle improvement in facial lines--the product feels great going on</li>
            <li> For anti-aging benefits that are real and inexpensive, go natural....</li>
            <li> You apply it to a clean dry face, before moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal and i don&#x27;t see how boots works for some and not others.</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if my skin will be better looking and firmer.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this on its own since Premier has helped with the skin tone, but if anyone is currently using other skin care lines, this would be a beneficial part to add!</li>
            <li> On days when I have had to use other skin lotions, even ones much more expensive then this, my skin has not felt or looked as good.</li>
            <li> I honestly get compliments on my skin everyday!!</li>
            <li> and I attribute this to the new Boots products that I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The fine lines around my mouth and eyes (and in between my eyes) seem much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I hope they make it in a bigger bottle eventually because 1oz goes fast!</li>
            <li> Better than Lancome which costs a small fortune and offers no noticeable result</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice anything extraordinary with my skin once the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> My skin also tends to be a little sensitive so that is important.</li>
            <li> Users should keep in mind that the instructions clearly state that a moisturizer should be applied afterwords.  </li>
            <li> To be clear, I have not used this product.</li>
            <li> So far i like it</li>
            <li> My skin all ready feels and appears tighter, younger I will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and I&#x27;m going to be 70 years old on December 1st.</li>
            <li> and wow.</li>
            <li> I always change skin care items reluctantly because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> And finally, if you really need retinal treatment,go to a Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I am almost 60, but still have very oily skin &amp; occasional acne, AND now developing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s and started to see lines that no longer go away.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful in filling out wrinkles and aging skin, especially around the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft with the deepness of wrinkles decreasing.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin feel soft and healthy after only a few times of using it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that lines have diminished, but the product feels soothing, and it creates a wonderfully silky base for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BETTER RESULTS FROM THE PRODUCTS THAT JENNIFER FLAVIN STALLONE HAS ON SERIOUS SKINCARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are products costing the same or less which last longer and perform considerably better.</li>
            <li> This was my first Boots purchase, and it will definitely be the last.</li>
            <li> Especially if you are consistent with daily use.</li>
            <li> The Restore &amp; Renew serum only gives me the positive effects without leaving my face red and tender.</li>
            <li> , I do not look twenty years younger, but facial lines got much softer, my skin feels silky and soft, it is glowing(believe</li>
            <li> I have just started to use it - hopefully it will work as expected ;-)</li>
            <li> The ROC retinol serum I tried before had similar results with wrinkles but made my face very sensitive with just a week-long use.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I&#x27;m allergic to something in this product.</li>
            <li> I have eczema, and have no reaction so far (which would probably have been immediate, since it is an allergy related disease).  </li>
            <li> Not pink pimples or whiteheads, just a patch of bumps.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, not oily nor dry, and what I wanted was some assistance with lines.</li>
            <li> have very dry skin and Boots makes it moist and silky smooth with just a few drops.  </li>
            <li> I have never broken out from any other skin product</li>
            <li> one of the many silicones listed in this is known to build up for months and can be dangerous, this is example of how advertising can really fool people.</li>
            <li> The INTENSE is sold for $23 at Target and other stores; the regular for $19.  </li>
            <li> No topical skin lotion will permanently alter the look and feel of your skin, so I never expected those sorts of results from Boots</li>
            <li> Well worth the small price.  </li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> After years of spending money on a plethora of useless products, I finally came to realize that if it is advertised on Television as something miraculous, it is most likely complete garbage.  </li>
            <li> within the first few days I noticed a couple of the same bumps</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;m working to prevent further damage, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the price you only have to use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy natural oils, and other stuff to heal my face from the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for those heading into their 40s and 50s, who would just like to go a little longer without wrinkles and lines.</li>
            <li> I used this product only in the wrinkled areas at the sides of my chin (marionette lines), above my upper lip, and on my forehead, and it made those areas feel greasy all day and then break out (although I was careful to use it sparingly, only IN the wrinkles as much as possible).  </li>
            <li> A few days into using it 2x a day my dry, sensitive skin seems to have calmed down some and is so much softer.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my skin and, as a skin care professional, I say not worth it.</li>
            <li> so I would never think of using anything other than formulas that are for dry, mature skin.</li>
            <li> I see some positive benefits but not amazing.</li>
            <li> they just give a long shelf life.</li>
            <li> I think this must work for some people but clearly not for all skin types.  </li>
            <li> After trying many expensive products found in high end departments stores and being disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised that this drugstore serum does live up to its hype.</li>
            <li> For example, I have dry skin</li>
            <li> not really live up to it&#x27;s hype</li>
            <li> Some people with sensitive skin had a bad experience with this product, but that may be due to the retinol palmitoylate (a strong acid used to treat acne).  </li>
            <li> My skin feels less oily overall</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used this product a few days, I have seen immediate results.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a reduction in wrinkles yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t drink enough water or wear SPF everyday (like in your moisturizer and/or foundation)</li>
            <li> I am using it for a few month already and will definitely continue.</li>
            <li> So I will keep using until the tube is empty</li>
            <li> Not sure why other than I guess my skin is different than others.</li>
            <li> Any lotion or cream containing Alpha Hydroxy acid (or other alpha or beta acids) in a 10% to 12% concentration and a pH of around 3.0-4.0 will give your skin noticeable improvements in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAME PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes but unfortunately, the product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Doctors\\&quot;, I felt the need to chime in and give a \\&quot;Don&#x27;t waste your money!\\&quot; warning.  </li>
            <li> I was using Premier Dead Sea products for months</li>
            <li> so I shouldn&#x27;t be so impatient I guess.</li>
            <li> (moisturizers alone have not worked in the past).  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the fuss is about.</li>
            <li> There is no magic potion beyond surgery or injection</li>
            <li> Just the small ones.</li>
            <li> It was just too thick and the opening in the bottle was too small.   </li>
            <li> My skin tends to be papery dry which is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I had a conjunctivitis in my eyes, I had to go to an optician to check my eyes because I hardly see, after I had a herpes from the serum.</li>
            <li> I am in my late sixties, and I realize that I may be looking for miracles.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its the crème for me because I sometimes breakout and wonder if it&#x27;s not good for combination skin.</li>
            <li> I mean: there is no miracle</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 30 days and am still seeing improvement.</li>
            <li> I purchase this approximately every 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> I shall stop spending money on useless purchases.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Broke out my face, product was expired (that&#x27;s what the bad smell is).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really can see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I kept hearing about it and it&#x27;s everything I&#x27;d heard. I will buy it again when I run out. Better than Lancome which costs a small fortune and offers no noticeable result</li>
            <li> THEY TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, NO 7, ON DOCTOR OZ---AT LEAST I BELIEVE IT IS THE SAME PRODUCT.  BUT I DIDN&#x27;T SEEM TO NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE ---- I HAVE BETTER RESULTS FROM THE PRODUCTS THAT JENNIFER FLAVIN STALLONE HAS ON SERIOUS SKINCARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dwissick@tampabay.rr.com</li>
            <li> So far i like it but i dont see any miricles. It does makes my skin feel really nice, but i think i have to use it longer to see the true effect.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a couple of weeks and got a compliment from my Dr., saying my skin looked nice and had great texture. I didn&#x27;t have a stitch of make-up on..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the whole line...it is worth it..</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 1 month now and the biggest difference is a improved feel in my skins texture. Much smoother. I&#x27;ll keep using it for sure.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! My skin all ready feels and appears tighter, younger I will continue to order. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading a rave review and am so pleased with the results.  A few days into using it 2x a day my dry, sensitive skin seems to have calmed down some and is so much softer.  The fine lines around my mouth and eyes (and in between my eyes) seem much less noticeable.  I also found that the moisturizer I use after seems to go on more smoothly, easily and absorb more completely.  THILLED with this product.  Go get it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different skincare products including those from department stores, infomercials, and the drugstore.  The Boots No7 line of products does what it says!      Since using the line of products, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how my looks and feels.  At first, I thought I was making stuff up in my head but I&#x27;ve received multiple comments on how much better my skin looks since changing my skin regimen.  The products feel great (not greasy) and most are fragrance-free.    In addition to the serum, the No7 moisturizer, eye cream, wrinkle filler, and Glycolic Peel kit are all highly recommended.      If you have oily or combination skin, the Complexion Refining Deep Clean Mousse is excellent.      Try the products, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I really like the Boots No7 product line and I particularly love this serum. From the first time I put in on my face, my face felt good. It made my skin feel soft and healthy after only a few times of using it. I must state here for this review that I have really good skin and a good complexion to begin with - and I want to maintain it which is why I wanted to try this product line. I&#x27;ve done a lot of experimenting and have yet to find anything that I love enough to stick with. However, this may just be the product line for me. I think that it is important to accurately pick the products within the Boots line that are for your skin type. For example, I have dry skin so I would never think of using anything other than formulas that are for dry, mature skin. I want to keep my skin looking good and healthy. I use this product with the day and night cream and I love the face wash (cream). My husband has noticed that my make up looks smoother and better when applied and I attribute this to the new Boots products that I&#x27;m using. Thus far, I&#x27;m very happy with this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sitting here with a red, blotchy rash on my face that&#x27;s very uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve also got huge, puffy bags under my eyes. All of this happened within a couple of days of me starting to use Boots No. 7 Protect &amp; Perfect beauty serum. Apparently, I&#x27;m allergic to something in this product. My face is bumpy and discolored, and it hurts. The package says the product is hypoallergenic, but be aware that it can cause an allergic reaction. Believe me, this product has done nothing to increase my beauty - in fact, I&#x27;m embarrassed to leave the house. This was my first Boots purchase, and it will definitely be the last.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I saw it recommended on The Doctors. It is a wonderful product. It makes my skin feel very soft, and smooth. I&#x27;ve used it for almost three weeks now, and have noticed my lines softening. It makes my makeup go on smooth, and it&#x27;s not greasy. I use it alone during the day, and use it before moisturizer at night.   I have already purchased another bottle!</li>
            <li> Better than Olay deep wrinkle when added to the night cream.  I saw a reduction in wrinkles within a month.  The product absorbs but protects.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Brought it on vacation, used it to protect my face from sun</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on segment on the Dr. Oz show tauting it as \\&quot;amazing\\&quot;, \\&quot;works in just 4 weeks\\&quot; they said.  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for 8 weeks, and nothing!  No results, as promised.  I also bought their dark-spot remover cream; also with no results.  Save your money.  Don&#x27;t believe the HYPE!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 30 days and am still seeing improvement. Wrinkles were not as prominent after 14 days. I would recommend this product and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help me like it said it would. Not sure why other than I guess my skin is different than others.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used this product a few days, I have seen immediate results.  Users should keep in mind that the instructions clearly state that a moisturizer should be applied afterwords.  At age 51, I started to notice the beginnings of a \\&quot;turkey wattle\\&quot; under my chin.  I saw an immediate improvement, with application of a moisturizer afterwords (moisturizers alone have not worked in the past).  Some people with sensitive skin had a bad experience with this product, but that may be due to the retinol palmitoylate (a strong acid used to treat acne).  I have eczema, and have no reaction so far (which would probably have been immediate, since it is an allergy related disease).  For $20, it&#x27;s worth a try.  I&#x27;ll probably keep using it, just because of the quick resullts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve been using this product since my last review (over a year now).  I still love it, and stand by what I said before.  Great firming lotion.  My neck looks great.  My husband want&#x27;s to try it now.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for about 3 weeks now and to be honest, I don&#x27;t notice any difference. I will keep using it and report back if I notice any improvement wrinkle-wise then</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how long it would take to see results, but so far the product is working well. My skin feels soft, smooth and moisturized for hours. I haven&#x27;t seen a reduction in wrinkles yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks. I believe it needs more time. Overall, I like it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a big way within 3 days of the trying the Day Cream.  I have never broken out from any other skin product, don&#x27;t have a skin problem, and did not use any thing else that was different.  Boots No 7 is the ony explanation.  Caution!!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  I ordered 4 Boots No7 products, returned them all.  Broke out my face, product was expired (that&#x27;s what the bad smell is).  I would never order any of these products again.</li>
            <li> Been using Boots 7 products and I like them very much</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000E793P2 Boots No7 Restore &amp; Renew Beauty Serum - 1 oz.]]    Boots Restore &amp; Renew is a really good product. There is convincing data that it works alsmost as well as prescription tretoin. I am researching the best and worst anti-aging creams based on my and readers&#x27; experience and, where possible, trial data at truthinaging.com</li>
            <li> Within two weeks of using this product, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin from strangers and people I know. One person described it as a \\&quot;glow.\\&quot; I use it in combination with a very high PPD sunscreen, which seems to strengthen the effect. I apply it once a day after a shower so it will be more easily absorbed into the skin. My skin appears more supple, flawless, and bright, especially around the cheek and eye area. The product is a great deal. After trying many expensive products found in high end departments stores and being disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised that this drugstore serum does live up to its hype. People don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them that this and the sunscreen are my only facial products. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Was not as impressed with this as everyone else and the claims of it being so good. Maybe it is made for &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; girls.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after she saw a segment about it on Nightline.  It does what it says for a change.</li>
            <li> I have loved this product since the first time I used it. I makes my skin feel smooth and healthy. My face really does feel restored and renewed. Oh, and I&#x27;m going to be 70 years old on December 1st.</li>
            <li> Love this product. a little goes a long way so great value! Feels wonderful on skin. Helps with many skin issues.</li>
            <li> I saw this i think on the doctors and thought i&#x27;d try it out. happy with this. works good, will recommend this.</li>
            <li> This, along with [[ASIN:B0012J30LY Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, 1.7 Ounce]] are two of my beauty secrets. I don&#x27;t have uber-sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t speak to the other reviews on this product that have been less than ideal. But this has definitely worked for me to reduce the fine lines on my forehead and cheeks. While these two products have helped me maintain a youthful appearance, pay attention to a few simple rules to reap the best benefits. If you don&#x27;t drink enough water or wear SPF everyday (like in your moisturizer and/or foundation) no product is going to work miracles for you. Minimize your alcohol consumption and exposure to damaging rays, remove makeup and moisturize at night and get ample sleep so that your skin has a chance to regenerate. That said, I have experienced positive results from this and the suite of Olay products and will continue to be a long-term customer.</li>
            <li> I too saw this on TV. It may have been after The Insider. I went to Target &amp; it was sold out. Went to another Target &amp; picked it up. Used it that night &amp; to my amazement it worked! Save the Juvederm &amp; Radiesse injections AND THE $$ MONEY$$ and PICK THIS UP. You won&#x27;t be sorry! I don&#x27;t work for them or even in the beauty industry, I just like many women was looking for an alternative to injections or $100 lotions. This is it! I have laugh (marionette) lines &amp; the beginning of crows feet. The laugh lines are what bugs me the most. I also have lines between my cleveage (years of laying out &amp; swimming w/out sunblock) so I tried it there as well, and wow. I&#x27;m telling all of my girlfriends, and this is one of the only reviews I&#x27;ve felt compelled to write about something, ever. I hope they make it in a bigger bottle eventually because 1oz goes fast! The \\&quot;Intense\\&quot; works the same as the regular Protect &amp; Perfect Beauty Serum in my opinion so save the couple bucks &amp; just get the regular one. In the long run, if you end up using it as frequently &amp; in as many places as I do thoes couple $$ add up to bottles over time. BOOTS IF YOUR READING THESE REVIEWS ALL OVER THE INTERNET PLEASE MAKE THE BOTTLES OF THIS PRODUCT IN LARGER SIZES THAN 1OZ PLEASE!!!!!! love love love it</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all. I used an entire botle over 6 weeks with no results. A product either works or doesn&#x27;t. My skin is normal and i don&#x27;t see how boots works for some and not others. Marketing. It was nice feeling serum and did not cause any side effects but it did nothing to improve fine lines, tone or texture. It just felt nice.</li>
            <li> Nothing more than hyped up silicone in a bottle, this product is so full of silicones it would prevent any of it&#x27;s \\&quot;anti aging\\&quot; ingredients from penetrating at all, their \\&quot;study\\&quot; to prove this stuff \\&quot;really works\\&quot; was funded by, none other than guess who? Boots! one of the many silicones listed in this is known to build up for months and can be dangerous, this is example of how advertising can really fool people.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to expensive serums and works wonderfully, I purchased online because I did not have time to go to store. Great buy on line or at Target.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and have been using it for about 2 weeks now.  It has made my skin more even and incredibly smooth.  I can already see a difference in fine lines.  When applied before make up,  it gives you a luminous glow and your make up application is beautiful! I am extremely happy with this product and would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Like many of the products out there this one&lt;br /&gt;does not really live up to it&#x27;s hype so beware.&lt;br /&gt;OK.</li>
            <li> Serum has not a cosmetic that I really needed or used. I have heard all of the PR and reasons for using a serum. I have normal skin, not oily nor dry, and what I wanted was some assistance with lines. I am in my late sixties, and I realize that I may be looking for miracles. However, I have great skin, very few lines, some wrinkles, and pliant, elastic skin. I have always taken good care if my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I did not notice any changes while using this serum. I gave it a month, lines, wrinkles still there. My skin is smooth, as it was before I started using the serum. I shall stop spending money on useless purchases. Good, if it helps you, I am all for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 07-02-15</li>
            <li> I replaced a product I had been using for a number of years with the Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect. I always change skin care items reluctantly because my skin is so sensitive. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and there has been no irritation. I haven&#x27;t noticed that lines have diminished, but the product feels soothing, and it creates a wonderfully silky base for liquid foundation. And most important, it&#x27;s not greasy. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this product featured on ET and wanted to see what the hype is. I am an Esthetician and always look at ingredients. Anything you apply to your skin will absorb into your body. The majority of the ingredients In this product are parabens( preservatives). These do nothing to beautify the skin. they just give a long shelf life. Reasearch is showing that they also mirror hormones in the body and may contribute to breast cancer in some women. Please read what you are putting in your body. Not good!</li>
            <li> This is a great serum! I can feel and see the difference in skin texture with fewer wrinkles. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY skin care product that really does make a noticeable difference in the more youthful appearance of my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many and this keeps my face very soft without it being greasy.  I purchase this approximately every 6 weeks.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have just started to use it - hopefully it will work as expected ;-)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and swear by it as part of my daily skin care routine. No topical skin lotion will permanently alter the look and feel of your skin, so I never expected those sorts of results from Boots No 7 Restore &amp; Renew Beauty Serum. What I have noticed is how much softer and more supple my skin is and how much the appearance of my fine wrinkles is minimized when I wear the product. On days when I have had to use other skin lotions, even ones much more expensive then this, my skin has not felt or looked as good. For the best results I use Boots No7 Restore &amp; Renew Beauty Serum under a high SPF sun screen such as [[ASIN:B001E96P0A Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF-70, 3-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]] to minimize further sun damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin and Boots makes it moist and silky smooth with just a few drops.  Lasts forever.  Well worth the small price.  Better than many expensive products I have used.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Especially if you are consistent with daily use. I honestly get compliments on my skin everyday!!</li>
            <li> took this home and used it right away ... helps with the fine lines around my eyes and this is a very good thing</li>
            <li> I bought this serum  so that to get rid of  laughing line around my mouth, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months but there&#x27;s no change.&lt;br /&gt;although it did brighten my skin, but it do need to put moisturizer after using it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but unfortunately, the product did nothing for me. My bottle lasted about a month although I used it sparingly. The pump stopped working when the product ran low. Trying to get to the remaining product by removing the cap didn&#x27;t work either. It was just too thick and the opening in the bottle was too small.   There are products costing the same or less which last longer and perform considerably better. Any lotion or cream containing Alpha Hydroxy acid (or other alpha or beta acids) in a 10% to 12% concentration and a pH of around 3.0-4.0 will give your skin noticeable improvements in a matter of weeks. These products have been around for years and they continue to improve upon them. They can be purchased at just about any department or drug store and they last for months. I&#x27;m going back to my trusted Neoteric Alpha Hydrox.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. Tried different creams - nothing seemed to work. Even the most expensive brands gave me allergic reaction. This one is just perfect. I mean: there is no miracle, I do not look twenty years younger, but facial lines got much softer, my skin feels silky and soft, it is glowing(believe me I am very critical to myself!). I am using it for a few month already and will definitely continue.</li>
            <li> This serum is fantastic!  Made my skin look and fee amazing!  My skin actually glowed!  I love the way my skin feels after putting on this serum. There was no oily shine, but my skin looked moist and refershed, brighter somehow.  I would highly recommmend this serum.</li>
            <li> I love the hydrating effect from this serun, but worry about the fact that it contains parabens. I bought it because it was highly recommended by an &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; I was watching on a network talk show. It is made in the UK, and I was under the impression that in europe products are a little more advanced than in the US. The verdict is still out on this one.</li>
            <li> Saw this product on the Dr Oz show tried it and just love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Please read the list of ingredients and search even a handful of them and you will quickly see that there is very little good in this product and a whole lot of not so good.  It is made up mostly of filler, and I&#x27;m doubting that there is enough retinal in this product to make much of any difference when it comes to anti-aging needs.  To be clear, I have not used this product. I am simply appalled by the horrible list of ingredients, and being as how this product was promoted by television \\&quot;Doctors\\&quot;, I felt the need to chime in and give a \\&quot;Don&#x27;t waste your money!\\&quot; warning.  For anti-aging benefits that are real and inexpensive, go natural....try natural oils like coconut oil (my favorite), almond oil, Shea butter is great, alcohol free witch hazel is wonderful, etc .   Make your own face masks and exfoliates using honey, yogurt, strawberry, avocado,egg, etc.   These things are safe and natural, chocked full of antioxidants and very inexpensive.   After years of spending money on a plethora of useless products, I finally came to realize that if it is advertised on Television as something miraculous, it is most likely complete garbage.  And finally, if you really need retinal treatment,go to a Dermatologist. They will prescribe a retinal cream that will actually show results.</li>
            <li> I do notice that my skin feels much smoother. However, it has not helped to even the skin tone as much as I would like. I would say it&#x27;s OK. I see some positive benefits but not amazing.</li>
            <li> I am almost 60, but still have very oily skin &amp; occasional acne, AND now developing wrinkles. I used this product only in the wrinkled areas at the sides of my chin (marionette lines), above my upper lip, and on my forehead, and it made those areas feel greasy all day and then break out (although I was careful to use it sparingly, only IN the wrinkles as much as possible).  And it didn&#x27;t help my wrinkles at ALL.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 3 years ago, having heard about it from a UK magazine. When it was first released there, it was a huge hit becoming sold out really quickly all over. I was thrilled to find that Target started to stock Boots products, including this one, so I tried it. It makes a real difference when applied morning and evening before a regular moisturizer (I use the Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Day Cream). My skin is sensitive to many different creams and make up, but I have had no problems with this product. I would highly recommend this for those heading into their 40s and 50s, who would just like to go a little longer without wrinkles and lines.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this in 2008 I loved it.  It&#x27;s true that it makes your skin feel like silk instantly and at first it seems like it&#x27;s really \\&quot;working.\\&quot;  However, after about four weeks I noticed I had acne like I&#x27;ve never had before.  It was as if my pores were impacted deep under my skin and looked like my forehead and temples were bumpy.  Not pink pimples or whiteheads, just a patch of bumps. It took weeks and weeks of steaming my face and using masks to draw it all out of my pores.  About a year later I decided to try it again just in case the two were unrelated... they were not.  I watched very closely and within the first few days I noticed a couple of the same bumps so I stopped using it immediately.  I think this must work for some people but clearly not for all skin types.  I saw another review said this was just silicone in a bottle and I have to agree, initially it makes your skin feel smooth but it definitely feels like there is something \\&quot;on\\&quot; your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I still LOVE lot of other Boots products and would recommend the Boots No. 7 Glycolic Peel Kit, No. 7 Micro-dermabrasion Scrub or the Boots Original Formula Overnight Cream.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s and started to see lines that no longer go away. This product has very noticeable effects in reducing the depth of my wrinkles. For me it only takes a couple days to see the effects, although I can see those wrinkles deepening again if I skip this product for days. The ROC retinol serum I tried before had similar results with wrinkles but made my face very sensitive with just a week-long use. The Restore &amp; Renew serum only gives me the positive effects without leaving my face red and tender. The affordable price makes it even more appealing!</li>
            <li> Boots No.7 Protect &amp; Perfect serum comes in this regular formula and and in an INTENSE formula.  It is the latter that was named as a 2010 Anti-Aging Award Winner. The INTENSE is sold for $23 at Target and other stores; the regular for $19.  Amazon sells them for $28.65 and $25, respectively. Score this one for Target!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a month now and really like it. I have oily skin and over the years have noticed my face pores are much more noticeable but this cream really works at reducing pores. My skin feels less oily overall and when I wake up in the morning my face is not as oily since using this. The product is also very affordable. You can get it at Target or on Ebay for 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 4 weeks, but I don&#x27;t see any noticeable difference. Who knows... maybe I&#x27;m working to prevent further damage, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful in filling out wrinkles and aging skin, especially around the mouth.  I buy it regularly now.</li>
            <li> Moisturized my face but I didn&#x27;t notice anything extraordinary with my skin once the bottle was empty. Not sure what the fuss is about.</li>
            <li> After I started to use one of the No7 serum I had an itchy throat, after I was sneezing and my face, skin, under my eyes as well was terribly red and itchy! I had a conjunctivitis in my eyes, I had to go to an optician to check my eyes because I hardly see, after I had a herpes from the serum. After 2 weeks I have terribly painful spots in my face. I had to buy natural oils, and other stuff to heal my face from the chemicals. :(((((((</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a serum before but I&#x27;m not gettin&#x27; any younger so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I use a tiny dab and then another tiny dab of the No7 Day cream and my skin soft and supple and feels good all day. My skin tends to be papery dry which is uncomfortable. This lasts all day which is great. The scent is nice and light, barely noticeable and I have had no reaction. My skin also tends to be a little sensitive so that is important. Great price, great product!</li>
            <li> I was using Premier Dead Sea products for months and I was finding it a bit lacking until I added this product to my current skin care sessions! Wow what a difference! I haven&#x27;t tried this on its own since Premier has helped with the skin tone, but if anyone is currently using other skin care lines, this would be a beneficial part to add!</li>
            <li> After 30 days of use I&#x27;m seeing subtle improvement in facial lines--the product feels great going on and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Being a licensed hairdresser for many years, skin care is extremely important to me.  Although I was blessed with good skin time does take an effect.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on the best skin creams and seriums on the market with the leading physicians, product being my line.  Anyway. after trying Boots No7 Restore and Renew, I find it does just what it says it will.  My skin feels so soft with the deepness of wrinkles decreasing.  There is no magic potion beyond surgery or injection however this is one of the very best skin care lines on the market and price makes it even that much more valuable.  I am sold and will continue...THANKS</li>
            <li> Well, I read the reviews of this product before I bought it and I don&#x27;t know what they were using because I sure haven&#x27;t seen the great results they supposedly had. I have only been using it for two weeks so I shouldn&#x27;t be so impatient I guess. However, from the reviews I read, their results were immediate. I&#x27;m not talking about deep wrinkle remover for myself because I do not have such. Just the small ones. So I will keep using until the tube is empty and maybe I will see some results. If I do and have the opportunity, I will let you know.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over thirty days and I have seen some improvement in my skin and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price you only have to use a small amount.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, its worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face soft, and it is very easy to use.  However, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if my skin will be better looking and firmer.  You apply it to a clean dry face, before moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like it because it takes away dryness. Not sure if its the crème for me because I sometimes breakout and wonder if it&#x27;s not good for combination skin.</li>
            <li> Worked ok but not miraculous. Heard so many raving reviews. Not overly impressed. Was hoping for a more aggressive anti-aging.</li>
            <li> love this serum.  makes skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> love the tube much better than the glass container.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Feels wonderful on.  My skin tone is probably more even. But, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I could really tell a difference in how my skin looked after I used this for a week or so. Just bought it for the second time and will probably buy it again. It&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> Methylparaben, which is readily absorbed through the skin, has been found in large quantities in human breast cancer cells.  In addition, when skin care creams containing methylparaben are exposed to UVB rays, cell death occurs and there is massive stress oxidation, which can cause disease and cancer.  I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my skin and, as a skin care professional, I say not worth it.</li>
