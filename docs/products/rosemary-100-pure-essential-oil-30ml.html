            <li>Smell is wonderful - my young daughter loves it too!</li>
            <li>Great, smelled exactly like lavender, wonderful in the humidifier in the dead of winter to keep the room moist loved it.</li>
            <li>More (1478-1535)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil has many uses.</li>
            <li>Love my rosemary oil, need to get more.</li>
            <li>I will by more of this product for me and my family.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of rosemary is meaningful and heavenly, full and heady.</li>

            <li>My wife was looking for some essential oils to use around the house and in her classroom to make things more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I received my product very quickly and would definitely do business with the seller again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incredible product, pure, strong essential oil.</li>
            <li>It is 100% pure.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly after ordering even though it was not a direct shipment from Amazon and was quickly put to use.    </li>
            <li>I dont use it on my skin, as it is very drying , unless on eyebrows if you want to stimulate their growth</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasing and accomplishes what she wanted.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is large enough that it should last a few months at this rate, which, based on the price, is a very good deal.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who needs this.</li>
            <li>I bought this in order to add five or ten drops to my laundry, but I&#x27;ve discovered (doh) that a few drops sprinkled on the damp sponge you&#x27;re going to wipe down the bathroom or laundry area or whatever with conveys that same magnificent fragrance -- which I find to be an exciting idea.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchased  and i just reorder it last month and i will be reordering  again and again</li>
            <li>Use with other essential oils (i.e. sweet almond oil, peppermint, and argan)- use for scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>Hard to say much more about Rosemary Oil outside of the fact that it works as advertised!</li>
            <li>it runne all over my garden walls, not onlie because my bees love it, but because it is the herb sacred to remembrance, and, therefore, to friendship; whence a sprig of it hath a dumb language that maketh it the chosen emblem of our funeral</li>
            <li>It is, as the label says, a PURE essential oil, with a truly invigorating fragrance that lasts a very long time on a saturated cloth.</li>
            <li>A drop or two provides a few hours of aroma and is very realistic smelling.  </li>

            <li> rosemary helps to remember.  I use it while I study.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;As for Rosmarine, I lett it runne all over my garden walls, not onlie because my bees love it, but because it is the herb sacred to remembrance, and, therefore, to friendship; whence a sprig of it hath a dumb language that maketh it the chosen emblem of our funeral wakes and in our buriall grounds.\\&quot; -- Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glorious product. The fragrance of rosemary is meaningful and heavenly, full and heady. I bought this in order to add five or ten drops to my laundry, but I&#x27;ve discovered (doh) that a few drops sprinkled on the damp sponge you&#x27;re going to wipe down the bathroom or laundry area or whatever with conveys that same magnificent fragrance -- which I find to be an exciting idea. The entrance smells like rosemary. So does the living room. The bathroom smells like lavender. I have some lemon oil on order for the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredible product, pure, strong essential oil. I live not too far from the company, so I get my orders in just a day or two, they&#x27;re always neatly wrapped and usually  include a small sample of another product, which is delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended. This oil will improve the quality of your life. Seriously.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, smells amazing.    I use it in bath water, spray some on my hair, and spray my clothes with it. also spray rooms with it as an air freshener     I dont use it on my skin, as it is very drying , unless on eyebrows if you want to stimulate their growth</li>
            <li> This oil was just not what I was expecting. It says you can use it in a burner, but I simply put it in a burner without the candle and it starts to evaporate. With the candle it slightly smokes...  But it is still good... I put it next to me when I&#x27;m working and it is nice. I received my product very quickly and would definitely do business with the seller again! Great job! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Rosemary oil helps to get a hard to get rid of smell out of your home. I used it once and the oddor was gone. This is also a very good bath oil.This oil has many uses. It is 100% pure. This product can be found at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I use these oils along with 1/2 water and 1/2 white vinegar in a spray can to cleanse and help sterlize the brushes and roller on the bottom of my sweeper to prevent carrying germs from one room to another.</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff, If you need rosemary oil this is excellent quality! It is moderately effective against spider mites.Mix no more than 10ml per gallon, it can damage sensitive plants.</li>

            <li> Seems to be a quality product.  Have not purchased any other rosemary essential oils before.  Use with other essential oils (i.e. sweet almond oil, peppermint, and argan)- use for scalp and hair. Makes scalp tingle - which feels great - good for scalp massages. To soon to tell if it helps promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchased  and i just reorder it last month and i will be reordering  again and again</li>
            <li> This is the best quality rosemary oil I have ever bought. It is, as the label says, a PURE essential oil, with a truly invigorating fragrance that lasts a very long time on a saturated cloth. Great for aromatherapy!</li>
