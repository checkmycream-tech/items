            <li>Hi, I feel that this is the best devise to gently clean between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It is also, great to mantain healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>Very good toothbrush that helps clean your molars</li>
            <li>--start selling it in stores! :-)</li>

            <li>I am so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great for cleaning near the gum line.</li>
            <li>Either works fine for me cleaning at the gum line around implant/crowns and permanent bridges.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s small head works best for me in getting into the spaces between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Golden!</li>
            <li>You will feel that your teeth are perfectly clean and your gums healthy, my dental hygienist told me after I have been brushing with Sulcus: whatever you are doing at home is really working!</li>

            <li>When I   received my order, I unwrapped one right away and used it with water and no   toothpaste at all.</li>
            <li>I hope to have a better dental checkup next month, after using this toothbrush (with  the toothpaste, of course!)</li>
            <li>The brush does exactly the job intended.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find this toothbrush in drugstores for several years.  </li>
            <li>The onlyu one that is available there is a handle w/a tiny brush on each end.  </li>
            <li>I expect to have toothbrushes for a long time and the next time if this product is available I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>They are not as soft as the ones I have been using.</li>
            <li>If I had sensitive gums, I would definitely recommend the Gum brand.</li>
            <li>This is just the right brush to get down next to the gum line around my crowns.  </li>

            <li> This is just the right brush to get down next to the gum line around my crowns.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to get the sulcus all the way around the tooth, giving my gums a gentle workpout with a simple brushing.  </li>
            <li> Found after some use they started to come loose while I brushed in the back.</li>

            <li> The new toothbrushes have too hard of bristles.</li>
            <li> Use it to get to back of the mouth where it&#x27;s hard to reach with the regular size toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have used Gum brand previously and I do find that the Oral-B bristles are harder.</li>
            <li> It has half the bristles.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a good replacement of the traditional toothbrush.....</li>
            <li> This brush is recommended by our dentist and hard to find.</li>
            <li> It is, however, hard to find in retail drug stores.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth and was using youth or child toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Gets in all those difficult to find nooks and crannies, and into the gum/tooth interface.</li>
            <li> This is difficult and time consuming to use.  </li>

            <li> I have had periodontal surgery twice and never again!  I have been using this toothbrush since my last surgery (now 25 years ago) and it&#x27;s small head works best for me in getting into the spaces between my teeth.  I use this toothbrush regularly as well as flossing, etc.</li>
            <li> been uisng for years and years - recommended by dentist</li>
            <li> This brush is recommended by our dentist and hard to find. It is excellent and gets in all the hard to reach places.  Please oral-B--start selling it in stores! :-)</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth and was using youth or child toothbrushes. When I   received my order, I unwrapped one right away and used it with water and no   toothpaste at all. It&#x27;d been years since I&#x27;d bought this brush at the drug store  or the grocery store; you can&#x27;t find them anymore.  My teeth felt cleaner, especially the back teeth. The longer handle gives me a  better grip, compared to the short-handled kiddie brushes I&#x27;ve used before.  I hope to have a better dental checkup next month, after using this toothbrush (with  the toothpaste, of course!)</li>
            <li> This is not a standard tooth brush. It has half the bristles. Instead&lt;br /&gt;of four rows, there are two. The picture shows the bristles in profile&lt;br /&gt;so you can&#x27;t see the width of the head. If you want a narrower&lt;br /&gt;brush, then you may like it.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning near the gum line. I use a regular brush and then follow-up with this.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a periodontist, I have been using it for many years.  Keeps my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush as recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li> This is just the right brush to get down next to the gum line around my crowns.  Prevents decay under the crown.</li>
            <li> Use it to get to back of the mouth where it&#x27;s hard to reach with the regular size toothbrush.  Brush part is not too sturdy maybe because of it size.  Found after some use they started to come loose while I brushed in the back.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Have searched for years for these. Thank you</li>
            <li> You will feel that your teeth are perfectly clean and your gums healthy, my dental hygienist told me after I have been brushing with Sulcus: whatever you are doing at home is really working!</li>
            <li> My dentist orescribed this Sulcus brush back in 1970. I&#x27;ve used it successfully ever since. It is, however, hard to find in retail drug stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years.  The only problem the brushes seem hard, although the package indicates soft. They are not as soft as the ones I have been using. ( Same brand)</li>
            <li> The new toothbrushes have too hard of bristles. They are not like the old ones I have ordered in the past even though they are the same part number and manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The brush does exactly the job intended. Gets in all those difficult to find nooks and crannies, and into the gum/tooth interface. Golden!</li>

            <li> Perfect toothbrush as recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li> My wife uses these to clean her teeth. She finds they do a good job. She has some cracked teeth.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dentist and I find over the years it&#x27;s been the best toothbrush for me. I am so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> We like this product, order regularly.</li>
            <li> I have used Gum brand previously and I do find that the Oral-B bristles are harder. Either works fine for me cleaning at the gum line around implant/crowns and permanent bridges. If I had sensitive gums, I would definitely recommend the Gum brand. This is a P&amp;G product made in Mexico. My next purchase will be to return Gum brand which are priced similarly.</li>
            <li> Was this a book I missed.  How did it get in here.  I use this toothbrush because my dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find this toothbrush in drugstores for several years.  The onlyu one that is available there is a handle w/a tiny brush on each end.  This is difficult and time consuming to use.  i  am delighted with this brush.  It is small enough to get the sulcus all the way around the tooth, giving my gums a gentle workpout with a simple brushing.  I am very pleased.</li>

            <li> Very good toothbrush that helps clean your molars</li>
            <li> Although this one is tender to the gum but it&#x27;s not a good replacement of the traditional toothbrush.....and I definitely won&#x27;t use two different brushes everytime, twice per day!</li>
