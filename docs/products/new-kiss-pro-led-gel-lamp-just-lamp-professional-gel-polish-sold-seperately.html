            <li>Love this lamp!</li>
            <li>Safe yourself time and money and buy this lamp!</li>
            <li>I came across this one and liked the design over most that I had seen.  </li>
            <li>gel color is suitable for use with this machine (</li>
            <li>It was significantly cheaper than Gelish ($9 versus $17), and I loved the color selection.</li>
            <li>The gel does NOT come off using nail polish remover, it just cleanses the sticky gel away somehow, leaving nails shiny, unsticky and very smooth.</li>
            <li>Now I have my nail salon at home :)</li>
            <li>One push of the button that has an automatic timer (beeps after 30 seconds, then turns off after 60 seconds) which I love.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I bought this at Walgreens for $29.99.</li>
            <li>I cured my nails for 1 minute each coat just to make sure it cured well.  </li>
            <li>Stays nice and glossy and chip free.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>It would be perfect if it actually cures the nail within one minute...</li>
            <li>Cured perfectly, just have to be sure to wipe any possible excess material off of skin around nails, or it will burn you skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and it works much better.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask?</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>I was technically able to fit all 5 fingers at once, but chose to do 4 fingers and the thumb separately.</li>
            <li>But it works just fine.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions precisely, it produces an excellent at-home gel manicure for less time and money than going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All toes fit a one</li>
            <li>I guess I need an UV light lamp for the gelish soak off polish</li>
            <li>TURNING THIS LIGHT ON EVERY MINUTE FOR 2 HOURS, NOT TO MENTION THE BEEP NOISE.</li>
            <li>This LED lamp is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m glad that I listened to my gut and gave this one a try - first time&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I use a cotton ball soaked in alcohol to clean nails.</li>
            <li>What a lot of people dont realize after you cure the nails you need to clean them.</li>
            <li>Auto timer works perfectly - only used 3 times but very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Apply clear top coat.</li>
            <li>The last step is the most  important</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Lightly file the surface of the nail before application to give the gel a surface it can easily adhere to.&lt;br /&gt;-WIPE DRY NAILS WITH AN ALCOHOL SOAKED COTTON BALL AFTER MANICURE - this point is not included in the directions, but it is VERY important.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really useful product and compact enough to fit on the vanity shelf without becoming a hassle.</li>
            <li>I bought this lamp based on the two positive reviews, and for the economical price (I did find it at Walgreens at the $29.99 price point).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lamp if you&#x27;re looking for something to use for your own personal at-home gel manis and pedis.</li>
            <li>Apply primer coat ( primer and top coat are the same bottle) cure for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>and finally the top coat</li>
            <li>I purchased this lamp from Walmart about 2 years ago &amp; it has saved me SO much money!</li>
            <li>I really like this lamp!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and big enough to fit all four fingers in without worrying about scraping the sides or anything.</li>
            <li>If I was going to invest, I wanted it to be high quality!</li>
            <li>IF YOU REALLY WANT IT, GET IT FROM WAL-GREENS, it is way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from korea and it&#x27;s really reasonable price compare with here</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough and it will do the job if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t spend a little more for a better one, but I have average size hands (with a Rheumatoid Autoimmune Disease), so with all five digits awkwardly jammed in there, I had to cure longer to get my thumbs sufficient light to cure enough, more like 90 secs per coat.</li>
            <li>You really just have to clean your nails, and you can do that straight after the last step, and even with regular no name bulk nail polish</li>
            <li>I love doing the gel polish because a regular mani chips in about an hour on me, but getting it done at the salon every 10 days really adds up, and decided I could just do it at home (and hey, who doesn&#x27;t like to pamper herself a little after the kids go to bed?).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a complete misunderstanding!</li>
            <li>I went from big disappointment to great pleasure, and absolutely worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely..</li>
            <li>I will definitely be returning this and getting something with a higher wattage.</li>
            <li>Looked into it a little more and found that this particular one is sold at local drugstores.  </li>
            <li>Works just as well as the professional shop ones.  </li>
            <li>extra time and maneuvering, to me, defeats the purpose of switching from UV (which was my reason for buying it, shorter time for the whole process).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I brought this at my local Walgreens store at a much cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>If you complete all the steps of the gel manicure, it WILL work.</li>
            <li>This one is everything I hoped for and for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After following these tips you should have a good quality gel mani that lasts for at least a week - mine will usually last up to two weeks.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the base and top coat from Kiss on sale 5.49 each (regular price 10.99) and a color gel polish from sensational.</li>
            <li>is that, I did put a thick layer the first time, and ended up redoing 2 nails, but it took me only a few minutes, and now I am enyoing the really good results..</li>
            <li>I have this particular dryer and use it with several brands of gel polish.</li>
            <li>As long as you FOLLOW THR DIRECTIONS, (as I can see other customers probably did not have all supplies necessary or follow the correct procedure to cure), it works just fine.</li>
            <li>you will think your nails will not dry..</li>
            <li>Wanted to share this because instructions aren&#x27;t clear on how to get the polish to dry!</li>

            <li> Wanted to share this because instructions aren&#x27;t clear on how to get the polish to dry!</li>
            <li> It took me over an hour to dry my nails and even then it was not completely dry.  </li>
            <li> 30 secs just wasn&#x27;t cutting it either way on most coats, compared to my Vogue LED where 30 secs does</li>
            <li> Idk if maybe I had too thick of a coat of something, or if the light is just that intense, but it was quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Been to salon where they have much more expensive led lamps and performance of this one does not differ a bit!</li>
            <li> They dry immediately.</li>
            <li> I gave up and let them air dry.  </li>
            <li> FOLKS , it does dry the polish, what you are experiencing is the &#x27;tacky&#x27; after effect of ANY gel/shellac manicure!</li>
            <li> It lets off a little beep at the 30 second mark, and automatically shuts off at one minute to let you know</li>
            <li> ( your nails are still wet, do not touch them)</li>
            <li> and they never really did cure fully.</li>
            <li> whether professionally done or at home - the tacky film is always left behind.</li>
            <li> I get mad at the sound it makes and my girl never gets her nails done..</li>
            <li> I ordered this lamp due to the cheaper price.</li>
            <li> A little small for putting entire hand in but works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply not worth it to spend a fortune when you don&#x27;t have to in order to get a quality product.</li>
            <li> OR do four fingers then thumbs separately in another round of 60 sec curing each and because of fewer lights and watts,</li>
            <li> gel base coat, gel color and top coat separately before using this</li>
            <li> It will feel sticky afterwards and needs to be &amp;#34;shined&amp;#34; with alcohol or a little polish remover - this will not remove the gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of $35.</li>
            <li> I was very Skeptical at first because I purchase this item from Walgreens for about 32 bucks 😱</li>
            <li> It also makes the annoying beep sound after 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this lamp.</li>
            <li> Very eager to put this on, I cleaned my nails wilh regular nail polish remover and did the 3 steps; base coat 30 seconds, then the color 60 seconds</li>
            <li> If you skip the base coat or don&#x27;t clean your nails, it will not.</li>
            <li> old + DIRTY + missing parts.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the Kiss brand polish (too thin) but other brands work</li>
            <li> So i soaked some paper in regular nail polish remover, and was desperately trying to get it off</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I guess I&#x27;ll just have to suffer through my usual lunchtime mani!</li>
            <li> As one other reviewer stated, I finally gave up and let them finish air drying, and now they look terrible.</li>
            <li> I said, it will do the job, but for me, not worth the lack features and time saving, plus awkward positions or doubling both hands for thumbs.</li>
            <li> I have to say, definitely not impressed.</li>
            <li> as you insert your hand was tedious, as was the timer</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Please bear this in mind, when reading bad rewievs -</li>
            <li> BUT IT WAS AWFUL.</li>

            <li> This product is great and is a perfect use for the gel manicure. It does itd job.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the professional shop ones.  I have beautiful gel nails in just minutes!</li>
            <li> A little small for putting entire hand in but works well.</li>
            <li> Love this lamp! I use a cotton ball soaked in alcohol to clean nails. 1. Apply primer coat ( primer and top coat are the same bottle) cure for 30 seconds. 2. Apply polish- cure for 60 seconds. 3. I always apply a 2nd coat of gel,polish. Cure again for 60 seconds. Apply clear top coat. Cure 30 seconds. **you will think your nails will not dry.. The last step is the most  important ( your nails are still wet, do not touch them) GO OVER YOUR NAILS WITH A COTTON BALL SOAKED  IN ALCOHOL. They dry immediately. You are finished and good for 2 weeks.  Wanted to share this because instructions aren&#x27;t clear on how to get the polish to dry! THE COTTON BALL SOAKED IN ALCOHOL DRIES THE NAILS IMMEDIATELY.  No smudging, etc. Hope this helps everyone who has this lamp!</li>
            <li> Now I have my nail salon at home :)</li>
            <li> I got this LED lamp at Wallgreens for the net amount of 29.99$, I figured why not try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did. I also purchased the base and top coat from Kiss on sale 5.49 each (regular price 10.99) and a color gel polish from sensational. Very eager to put this on, I cleaned my nails wilh regular nail polish remover and did the 3 steps; base coat 30 seconds, then the color 60 seconds and finally the top coat 30 seconds. When I was done, they were still sticky, and I just wanted it off! The towel stuck to it and they were awfull. So i soaked some paper in regular nail polish remover, and was desperately trying to get it off, then I noticed THEY GOT PERFECT by doing this. The gel does NOT come off using nail polish remover, it just cleanses the sticky gel away somehow, leaving nails shiny, unsticky and very smooth. Please bear this in mind, when reading bad rewievs - it&#x27;s a complete misunderstanding! You really just have to clean your nails, and you can do that straight after the last step, and even with regular no name bulk nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also have to say is that, I did put a thick layer the first time, and ended up redoing 2 nails, but it took me only a few minutes, and now I am enyoing the really good results..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed! If you have interest in doing this at home, I will defenately recommend the LED lamp from Kiss. I went from big disappointment to great pleasure, and absolutely worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely..</li>
            <li> I just bought this lamp at Walgreens for $17.99. What a lot of people dont realize after you cure the nails you need to clean them. I personally use regular alcohol.</li>
            <li> After researching several nail lamp brands, I definitely decided I had wanted an LED. I came across this one and liked the design over most that I had seen.  Looked into it a little more and found that this particular one is sold at local drugstores.  I found mine at Walgreens for $29.99 (regular price, not a sale)!  It works amazing! One push of the button that has an automatic timer (beeps after 30 seconds, then turns off after 60 seconds) which I love. I highly recommend this lamp if you&#x27;re looking for something to use for your own personal at-home gel manis and pedis.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a month. Then lights dimmed and couldn&#x27;t cure polish anymore. Waste of $35. Should have bought from Amazon, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I love doing the gel polish because a regular mani chips in about an hour on me, but getting it done at the salon every 10 days really adds up, and decided I could just do it at home (and hey, who doesn&#x27;t like to pamper herself a little after the kids go to bed?). I bought this lamp based on the two positive reviews, and for the economical price (I did find it at Walgreens at the $29.99 price point). I have to say, definitely not impressed. I used Kiss LED gel polish with it, followed all the instructions, and it took WAY longer than 30-60 seconds to cure...and they never really did cure fully. As one other reviewer stated, I finally gave up and let them finish air drying, and now they look terrible. I will definitely be returning this and getting something with a higher wattage. In the meantime, I guess I&#x27;ll just have to suffer through my usual lunchtime mani!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap enough and it will do the job if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t spend a little more for a better one, but I have average size hands (with a Rheumatoid Autoimmune Disease), so with all five digits awkwardly jammed in there, I had to cure longer to get my thumbs sufficient light to cure enough, more like 90 secs per coat. OR do four fingers then thumbs separately in another round of 60 sec curing each and because of fewer lights and watts, 30 secs just wasn&#x27;t cutting it either way on most coats, compared to my Vogue LED where 30 secs does every coat no problem.&lt;br /&gt;This extra time and maneuvering, to me, defeats the purpose of switching from UV (which was my reason for buying it, shorter time for the whole process).&lt;br /&gt;Also no auto-on as you insert your hand was tedious, as was the timer system.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it will do the job, but for me, not worth the lack features and time saving, plus awkward positions or doubling both hands for thumbs. NOT RECOMMENDED for those with issues like RA, MS, Carpel Tunnel or finger/wrist joint problems if you want to get thumbs in with fingers.&lt;br /&gt;This one is being returned to Walgreens which was actually no cheaper than Amazon, especially with tax at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I bought this at Walgreens for $29.99. Prior to purchasing it, I researched dozens of lamps (both UV and LED) ranging from $15-$175. I went to specialty beauty supply stores and read hundreds upon hundreds of reviews. If I was going to invest, I wanted it to be high quality! Well, I&#x27;m glad that I listened to my gut and gave this one a try - first time&#x27;s a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: The lamp is a great size. I was technically able to fit all 5 fingers at once, but chose to do 4 fingers and the thumb separately. All toes fit a one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: The lamp is lightweight, but functions remarkably well. In fact, it would be great for travel! The entire interior is covered with mirrors, which not all lamps have. It lets off a little beep at the 30 second mark, and automatically shuts off at one minute to let you know you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polish: I used Gelaze base-and-color and top coat with excellent results. It was significantly cheaper than Gelish ($9 versus $17), and I loved the color selection. I had no problems with bubbling or drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opinion: I feel that this is a great lamp for gel polish application. It&#x27;s simply not worth it to spend a fortune when you don&#x27;t have to in order to get a quality product. I am recommending this LED lamp to everyone I know. Safe yourself time and money and buy this lamp!</li>
            <li> I brought this at my local Walgreens store at a much cheaper price.  I used it with gelish soak off gel polish, it did not cure my nails.  It took me over an hour to dry my nails and even then it was not completely dry.  I gave up and let them air dry.  It was very frustrating. I guess I need an UV light lamp for the gelish soak off polish</li>
            <li> I purchased this lamp from Walmart about 2 years ago &amp; it has saved me SO much money! $30 for the lamp instead of $30 for each manicure - you can&#x27;t beat that! If you complete all the steps of the gel manicure, it WILL work. If you skip the base coat or don&#x27;t clean your nails, it will not. Or if you paint over your cuticles the polish will start to peel off faster. That&#x27;s the only thing I struggle with! But the lamp is awesome. Not a fan of the Kiss brand polish (too thin) but other brands work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;If my lamp ever stops working I would totally buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens to use with the Sally  Hansen gel polish and I do like it. The gel polish instructions said to cure for 30 seconds each coat.  I cured my nails for 1 minute each coat just to make sure it cured well.  I really like this lamp!  Its a great price and does the job!  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> old + DIRTY + missing parts.</li>
            <li> I was very Skeptical at first because I purchase this item from Walgreens for about 32 bucks 😱 But it works just fine. Stays nice and glossy and chip free. I will diff recommend!!!!👌</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic! Been to salon where they have much more expensive led lamps and performance of this one does not differ a bit! Shortens the time trememndously and the fact bulbs need no change is great! Recommend</li>
            <li> Does not work on gel polish.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T EVER BUY THIS LAMP. IF YOU REALLY WANT IT, GET IT FROM WAL-GREENS, it is way cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I BOUGHT IT FOR MY GF AS SHE WANTED IT BUT IT WAS AWFUL. Her nail polish was not cured even after 2 hours and this lamp turns off every one minute. It also makes the annoying beep sound after 30 seconds. It would be perfect if it actually cures the nail within one minute...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMAGINE TURNING THIS LIGHT ON EVERY MINUTE FOR 2 HOURS, NOT TO MENTION THE BEEP NOISE. IT&#x27;S A TORTURE FOR BOTH OF US. I get mad at the sound it makes and my girl never gets her nails done..</li>
            <li> This worked great. I used thid with a mino gelish basix kit, and gelish polish in ambiance. As long as you FOLLOW THR DIRECTIONS, (as I can see other customers probably did not have all supplies necessary or follow the correct procedure to cure), it works just fine. Cured perfectly, just have to be sure to wipe any possible excess material off of skin around nails, or it will burn you skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue with this is that while curing, it burned, and it kinda hurt my nails! Idk if maybe I had too thick of a coat of something, or if the light is just that intense, but it was quite uncomfortable. I purchased this from Walgreen&#x27;s and not amazon, just figured I&#x27;d leave a review for anyone Else looking into getting this product.</li>
            <li> I have this particular dryer and use it with several brands of gel polish. FOLKS , it does dry the polish, what you are experiencing is the &#x27;tacky&#x27; after effect of ANY gel/shellac manicure! whether professionally done or at home - the tacky film is always left behind. this is why it is required to wipe your nails with rubbing alcohol after the final coat has been cured.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I&#x27;ve only used it once but it worked perfectly!  Very easy to use and big enough to fit all four fingers in without worrying about scraping the sides or anything.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - great price!  Auto timer works perfectly - only used 3 times but very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I reviewed and reviewed all types of uv and led nail lamps. This one is everything I hoped for and for such a reasonable price. I definitely definitely recommend purchasing this lamp.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and I&#x27;ve used it several times now. I LOVE IT. If you follow the directions precisely, it produces an excellent at-home gel manicure for less time and money than going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;-Purchase gel base coat, gel color and top coat separately before using this machine.&lt;br /&gt;-Any gel color is suitable for use with this machine (Sally Hansen and others make gel polishes for use with LED lamps).&lt;br /&gt;-Lightly file the surface of the nail before application to give the gel a surface it can easily adhere to.&lt;br /&gt;-WIPE DRY NAILS WITH AN ALCOHOL SOAKED COTTON BALL AFTER MANICURE - this point is not included in the directions, but it is VERY important. It will feel sticky afterwards and needs to be &amp;#34;shined&amp;#34; with alcohol or a little polish remover - this will not remove the gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After following these tips you should have a good quality gel mani that lasts for at least a week - mine will usually last up to two weeks. All the benefits of gel without the expense and ruined nails afterward!</li>
            <li> I ordered this lamp due to the cheaper price. After spending the time and money to have nails that last, they chipped the next day. I went out and bought the actual gelish LED lamp and it works much better. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this lamp.</li>
            <li> This LED lamp is fantastic. It dries my nails in about a minute. It is a good size for travel and fits in my cosmetics box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really useful product and compact enough to fit on the vanity shelf without becoming a hassle. Amazon helped me find this item when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores myself.</li>
            <li> Great price. Works great. Delivered to my door in 3 days.  What more could I ask?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from korea and it&#x27;s really reasonable price compare with here</li>
