            <li> I had stained my plastic partial with too much Indian curry and could not get the turmeric color out till I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> Use ONLY as directed by a dentist or other knowledgeable health professional.</li>
            <li> A half capful to a half glass of water does the trick, not on the first try, but within a week the partial was white again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and its getting harder to find the larger size (16oz).</li>
            <li> Also, I had a few inner cheek and gum sores last week</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;d disolve properly, which really makes or a caustic mistake when the partial is reinserted!  </li>
            <li> As listed above, this product is recommended (by \\&quot;dental professionals!\\&quot;)for canker sores, gum irritations, denture &amp; mouth sores, orthodontic irritations, mouth burns, and cheek bites (I&#x27;m not sure what the latter is).  </li>
            <li> The shipment was slower than I expected but arrived at the end of the promised time frame.</li>
            <li> This will help heal those unfortunate scraps fast.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer because it has worked on me.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend started using this everyday after he got home from teaching his classes.  </li>
            <li> Colgate Peroxyl has helped me through a very difficult period when high doses of prednisone resulted in severe mouth sores.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why you need a doctor&#x27;s care for this.  </li>
            <li> The peroxyl also helped an eleven year old child whose grandmother was desperate for something to help his mouth sores resulting from medication!  </li>
            <li> I use it if i have a cold sore, or maybe slipped with a toothbrush or flossed too hard.  </li>
            <li> Yhis is a bad way of doing business.</li>
            <li> Horribly overpriced for this volume container!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This company is horrible.</li>

            <li> Peroxyl isn&#x27;t available where I live. The shipment was slower than I expected but arrived at the end of the promised time frame. The product is excellent for gum problems and was recommended by my dentist. It shouldn&#x27;t be used without a dentist&#x27;s approval.</li>
            <li> After a friend burned some gum tissue on some overheated coffee, a dentist recommended this product, both for its healing properties and overall cleansing ability.  As listed above, this product is recommended (by \\&quot;dental professionals!\\&quot;)for canker sores, gum irritations, denture &amp; mouth sores, orthodontic irritations, mouth burns, and cheek bites (I&#x27;m not sure what the latter is).  I tried a little, and the taste was pleasant and the liquid nonirritating.  There is a mild foaming action as well.  Use ONLY as directed by a dentist or other knowledgeable health professional.</li>
            <li> Good product for cleaning your mouth.</li>
            <li> Great for irritated gums, cheeks and just sore mouth.</li>
            <li> Ain&#x27;t cheap but it works</li>
            <li> I had stained my plastic partial with too much Indian curry and could not get the turmeric color out till I bought this product.  A half capful to a half glass of water does the trick, not on the first try, but within a week the partial was white again.  I would give this product 5 stars if it came in a tablet form, however, filling the capful and dumping it in the water is a small chore for the good results.  A tip:  make sure you have a glass of water ready before dropping in the granuals instead of the other way around!  Tried that once and it didn&#x27;d disolve properly, which really makes or a caustic mistake when the partial is reinserted!  Ugh!!</li>
            <li> Not sure why you need a doctor&#x27;s care for this.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.  The taste is fine...i like it.  It foams.  It kills germs.  I use it if i have a cold sore, or maybe slipped with a toothbrush or flossed too hard.  Keeps infections away for me.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like very much. I am thinking they can be more generous with the amount in the bottle vs the cost of it. I would like to find cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> Colgate Peroxyl has helped me through a very difficult period when high doses of prednisone resulted in severe mouth sores.  The peroxyl also helped an eleven year old child whose grandmother was desperate for something to help his mouth sores resulting from medication!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hygentist to address burns from hot foods and gum issues.  Gargle and in a day or two your mouth is totally cleared up.</li>
            <li> Horribly overpriced for this volume container!!!!!!!!!! My mistake.</li>
            <li> Works great to quickly heal and slightly numb any mouth irritation or sore. Ever injure your gums while brushing your teeth? This will help heal those unfortunate scraps fast. Its refreshing and has healing effects. It is a bit foamy but that is the part that makes me feel that its doing its job.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product at my favorite drugstore but Amazon has it and it works wonders for a sore mouth. Have problems with you dentures make your gums sor..euse Peroxyl. It helps the speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and its getting harder to find the larger size (16oz). Cleans without the burn that so many mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that works on my cancor sores.  It heals my sores within 24 hours!</li>
            <li> Pleasant taste and especially good rinse.</li>
            <li> I have been using Peroxyl since I was a teenager. First started using it when I wore braces, then my retainer, now with my partials. Peroxyl really does speed healing time with mouth sores. I am a firm believer because it has worked on me. I always keep it around.</li>
            <li> This company is horrible. I purchased a certain type of Peroxyl and they substituted it with a Canker and Sore version which is not my problem. I wanted the regular mouth rince. Yhis is a bad way of doing business.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend started using this everyday after he got home from teaching his classes.  He had to lecture for hours at a time multiple times a week and began having chronic sore throats and laryngitis.  He swears this stuff kept him from having these problems this last semester.  Also, I had a few inner cheek and gum sores last week so I tried his mouth wash.  Tastes better and helped heal my sores faster than puting baking soda on it (my mom&#x27;s old remedy).</li>
