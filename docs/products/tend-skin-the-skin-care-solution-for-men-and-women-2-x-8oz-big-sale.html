            <li> Burns slightly when you first put it on, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Husband has extreme razor bump issues that he has been dealing with his whole life.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li> I have been using Magic Shave for years (30+), but got tired of the mess to shave and the time it takes to get it done.  </li>
            <li> After multiple breakouts on the chest from waxing I purchased this and it minimizes the breakouts, has a similar effect to peroxide and smells of rubbing alcohol but does not irritate unless wet.</li>
            <li> The recent purchase of the TendSkin was as expected.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and using this really helps with any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Can not live without this product.</li>
            <li> Less razor bumps, clear skin, and sooooo much less irritation.  </li>
            <li> For the head shavers, I suggest using this morning and night a few days after the initial shaving.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t require daily use unless you shave everyday</li>
            <li> This is also the only product which removes them if I&#x27;ve run out of Tend Skin and can&#x27;t pick any up in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It definitely helped, but he still is having some trouble so we are going to see a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> However the price is soo affordable compare to other sellers.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate everyday in the shower, then I apply Tend Skin all over my legs, let it dry and moisturize.</li>
            <li> African-American with thick facial hair that usually curls creating ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> but not cheap.</li>
            <li> it eliminates waste.</li>
            <li> Did not help my wife at all - waste of $</li>
            <li> Gotta use at least every other day to see results..</li>
            <li> at least you get 2 here.</li>
            <li> If other products have failed, and you haven&#x27;t tried this yet, I suggest you do.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so expensive though.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to discover that both  8 oz bottle I  purchased in January will expire  in September.</li>

            <li> This product is a miracle worker!! I have always had bikini line bumps, but this makes it simply disappear so bikini here I come!!</li>
            <li> I purchased because my daughter suggested and I must say so far so good</li>
            <li> Magic! I really loved this product. the best </li>
            <li> Amazing at getting rid of ingrown hairs! Been using for 5+ years.</li>
            <li> Always an excellent product as expected. I buy this for my brother who lives overseas and he is never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff really works</li>
            <li> It definitely gets rid of razor bumps and keeps them away.</li>
            <li> Can not live without this product. I buy 2 at a time. The best ever for ingrown hairs.....hands down.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve found to help with razor burn and breakouts around my lips and chin. Thank you!</li>
            <li> but not cheap. Can make your own with alcohol, witch hazel, and aspirin. If lazy, like me, pay more. at least you get 2 here.</li>
            <li> To date this is the only product that works for me.  I have tried so many different razor burn products before so when a worker at a spa recommended I buy this from their front desk I was skeptical. I noticed a difference the very next day.  My skin didn&#x27;t itch after shaving nor did I get razor burn.  I have been using this for 4 years now.  FYI  purchase the roll on applicator.  It really helps work the solution into your pores PLUS it eliminates waste.</li>
            <li> This is the only product which prevents my razor bumps.  This is also the only product which removes them if I&#x27;ve run out of Tend Skin and can&#x27;t pick any up in a few weeks.  Glad to see the larger bottles were available.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this product. I recommend it often to my fellow shaved head buddies.</li>
            <li> Great value. My husband can&#x27;t live without these things. Arrived on time. They work awesome.  Would buy more soon. Hopefully would find great deals like these ones.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market that works for me! I&#x27;ve tried several others of which none work for me. So I am happy to stick with it!</li>
            <li> If you get irritation form shaving in any area. You need to try this stuff. It&#x27;s good after shaving your face and if you shave your chest. I have really thick hair and using this really helps with any skin irritation. I really would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> using it four years.  never deal with in grown hairs on back of neck.</li>
            <li> This was for my son suffering from razor rash.  It definitely helped, but he still is having some trouble so we are going to see a dermatologist.  This is definitely worth trying, though.  It was recommended to his pediatrician by another doctor.</li>
            <li> The recent purchase of the TendSkin was as expected. Great product at a good value</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this product.  It helps keeps the bumps at bay when he shaves.  I would recommend to afro american men who bump after shaving.</li>
            <li> It really helps get rid of irritation after waxing and prevent ingrown hair. A good price for the size. One of the cheapest options on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d done battle with ingrown hairs on my neck and sides of my face for years until I stumbled on Tend Skin.  It worked from the very first time I applied it.  It&#x27;s very strong, and burns going on, but my face has been smooth and bump free for years. If other products have failed, and you haven&#x27;t tried this yet, I suggest you do.</li>
            <li> Did not help my wife at all - waste of $</li>
            <li> This is a great product are recommended to anybody</li>
            <li> Excellent product that does the job!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Have been using it for almost 5 years.</li>
            <li> Two bottles with an expiration date of March 2015...</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked better!</li>
            <li> A very helpful and effective product.  Loved the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 yrs now and it works great for me. I don&#x27;t see me changing from this product anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Gotta use at least every other day to see results.. Specially now, in the summer</li>
            <li> this works well after bikini wax!</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it does EXACTLY what it says it does.  Burns slightly when you first put it on, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, easy no problems</li>
            <li> product has always been great. This deal was the best I&#x27;ve seen around.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product for guys. If you have battled razor burns your whole life, this will solve it. It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> Is a great product for blk men who have those bumps that come up on the back of the neck. Use consistently and you wont have a problem</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. Best after save ever, face, head, eyebrows anywhere you remove hair.</li>
            <li> I have used tend skin for several years and this is my second purchase from amazon. I was disappointed to discover that both  8 oz bottle I  purchased in January will expire  in September.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin is a remarkable product.  Use with cotton balls to apply.  It also makes a great deodorant!</li>
            <li> Husband has extreme razor bump issues that he has been dealing with his whole life.  African-American with thick facial hair that usually curls creating ingrowns.  Since he has started using this product, he has seen an amazing difference....so have I.  Less razor bumps, clear skin, and sooooo much less irritation.  Thank goodness this product exists!!</li>
            <li> The Tend Skin does work on skin problems on my 19 year olds skin.  He gets bouts of heat related pimples and razor rash, but Tend Skin handles this as well as infected hair bumps.  worth the money to save you kids skin!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Is perfect for pimples and for pulling out trapped hair. Fully recommend tendskin, you won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Magic Shave for years (30+), but got tired of the mess to shave and the time it takes to get it done.  So I decided to switch over to a electric shaver.  Of course I&#x27;m prone to razor bumps so knew I needed something that would eliminate the razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW, what a fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tend Skin works very well and I have now been shaving with an electric shaver for 2+ months and the razor bumps are all but eliminated.  It&#x27;s a constant battle but frequent use of Tend Skin seems to be the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tend Skin works so well that I would think it would even matter which electric shaver you use this stuff will still eliminate the razor bumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a alcohol aftershave then a lotion.  Didn&#x27;t cure the ingrown hairs. Was highly recommended but didn&#x27;t work out well.</li>
            <li> This helps so much to get rid of my razor bumps.  It&#x27;s just so expensive though.  But it works for me.</li>
            <li> The best product on the market to deal with razor bumps. It stings a bit like alcohol but does the job.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - it works really well. No more razor burns and it makes the skin  nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It works.  Point blank.  Expensive for sure.</li>
            <li> Great service_  price! The Best!</li>
            <li> Have used Tend Skin many times in the past. Bottles I bought  did not seem as strong as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It really works if use as directed. I epilate my legs, which leaves me with lots of ingrown hair. I exfoliate everyday in the shower, then I apply Tend Skin all over my legs, let it dry and moisturize. When you start you should do it 2 to 3 times a day, until you start seeing results. I used to clean my legs with a damp hot towel in between uses ( before application)</li>
            <li> Great for ingrown hairs and razor bumps for both men and women!  Yes, it contains alcohol, but that&#x27;s what helps reduce inflammation and kill bacteria in the irritated follicle.  As an esthetician, I recommend this!</li>
            <li> Always works, never a bikini bump, all smooth!!! I also bought the shave gel and an even better shave. I just love knowing I won&#x27;t have the REALLY embarrassing red bumps at the beach, or pool, works so great!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for men and women.  Ingrown hairs really suck.  You will notice a big difference in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Since i,m using &#x60;&#x60;Tend Skin&#x60;&#x60;  i can shave any way i want never have to worry  about bumps  .Buy it you won,t regret it</li>
            <li> Best product out there for treatment and prevention of ingrown hairs particularly for African-American/Black skin.</li>
