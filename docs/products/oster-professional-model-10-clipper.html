            <li>it&#x27;s so great,</li>
            <li>, this is good stuff believe me.</li>
            <li>these to a superior job.</li>
            <li>I bought this unit based on the good reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that these clippers are great, but buy them from someone else.</li>
            <li>I love to cut with this clipper!  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and have done so for years now.</li>
            <li>Shave my own head every week.</li>
            <li>Make sure you own another pair of adjustible clipper before you buy these.</li>
            <li>They cut great, but do get hot.</li>
            <li>I love the look and feel of the clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered two more detachable blades.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Top of the top class.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine the 76 being any better for my purpose.</li>
            <li>My son was wanting these clippers for awhile, he was very excited when he received them.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of power and gives a nice clean cut.</li>
            <li>I loved the way the blades cut through the hair, but I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get a good enough grip on them to feel</li>
            <li>Great clipper so far.</li>
            <li>I stuck to my good old Oster 76&#x27;s!!!</li>
            <li>However, it isn&#x27;t as easy for tapering/fading because the blades don&#x27;t adjust and you&#x27;ll need to purchase a variety of blades/guards or work with clipper over comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I barbered for 17 years and tried many kind of clippers, but always returned to my Oster Fast Feeds that I bought in 1985.  </li>
            <li>One of the best clipper ever, very quiet and super light.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and maintain.  </li>
            <li>I would have easily given them 5 start if heating wasnt the problem.</li>
            <li>It also looks like the blade also disassembles easily with just two screws, making it even easier to get a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a home barber for my friends and son and this is my first rotary clipper, I currently own the Wahl Seniors and Andis T-Outliners which work well for tapering</li>
            <li>I didnt get that, but the Model 10 works fine.</li>
            <li>Was able to adjust the blades to get a super close cut.</li>
            <li>Fits comfortably in a woman&#x27;s hand and performance is smooth and effortless.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to these from a cheap pair of Wahls and you can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I just have to make sure I keep everything super clean and well oiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Oster 76 clippers for over 20 yrs and always loved them for durability and good quality, the only thing it can be high maintenance replacing parts when used for 15 to 40 haircuts a day.</li>
            <li>These were a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>They never should have messed around with the original classic....period.</li>
            <li>I started using them and liked them very much but the hot air reminded me one of the reasons why I suitch to the andis.</li>
            <li>Light and powerful, gives what I&#x27;ve come to expect from an Oster clipped.</li>
            <li>My husband needed a good pair of clippers as he keeps his head buzzed very short and does it weekly.</li>
            <li>Most highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Worth the money to me.  </li>
            <li>Definitively worth the investment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Good and powerful unit.  </li>
            <li>They slice right through hair like a butter knife through butter on a sunny day.</li>
            <li>free I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>This cuts really well, nice smooth and clean cuts and the power is really effortless at taking down the hair.</li>
            <li>So far they seem easy to maintain and fault</li>
            <li>I do 15-20 haircuts a day and the motor got hot after one haircut.</li>
            <li>The Model 10 is getting too hot after</li>
            <li>The clippers get hot after 15 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>I like these clippers, but be forewarned that they do get hot towards the end of the haircut.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this unit and brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not just the body, but also the blade, in fact, the blade gets too hot to touch</li>
            <li>I heard good things about the Oster 76 and Andis BGR with the battery pack but the small size and vintage looks kept me on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this is the true nature of this particular unit, I figure that must adjust my grip to avoid the vents, and buy a few spare blades to swap out to reduce heat, just to be able to use this unit.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the model 10 series.</li>
            <li>Much lighter then the 76ers.</li>
            <li>He says that it is much lighter, sheers are stronger and he says he can cut faster.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s not broken don&#x27;t fix it.  </li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll need to clean and oil all the different blades, lube the gears, and replace the carbon brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those who will not be satisfied with just merely average hair, these clippers need to be a mainstay in your quiver of hair care products.</li>
            <li>May be that particular piece was defective.</li>
            <li>The Wahl&#x27;s did a decent job and lasted 5 years, but they never cut like the Model 10.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Very clean looking with the black on black you will enjoy</li>
            <li>Much better than any pro clippers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The entire unit gets hot after about 10 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>Will work but not with the old cutters, must buy new ones I have both now.</li>
            <li>This setup can be very expensive, I opted for buying different blades as I heard it gives the best cut.</li>
            <li>These clippers are more powerful than any other clippers I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li>Both packages had clearly been opened, and both blades still had stubble on them.</li>
            <li>The reason I stop using them and suitch to Andis BGR&#x27;s because the hot air from the 76&#x27;s made my hands feel like I had arthritis and heard after a long day of work.</li>
            <li>The noise level is on par for any pair of professional clippers and by no means loud.</li>
            <li>Smaller than the Classic 76 which it replaced.</li>
            <li>The vent is located at the unit&#x27;s neck, where my hand would normally be, making it uncomfortable to hold with warm air blowing into my hand all the time.  </li>
            <li>recently found this smaller Model 10 and they are so much easier for me to manage.  </li>
            <li>These are such high quality, he expects them to last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still debating whether it&#x27;s worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>For me, I find it useful to take down the initial bulk of hair, switch to adjustable clippers or clipper over comb technique for fading/tapering and finish with the T-outliners.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it cuts like no other clipper around, on the other hand the build quality it need some cosmetics help for one you are paying over $100 for this thing, the switch feels kinder cheap, the housing still had casting material painted over should have been filed down and then painted...</li>
            <li>I waited to write a review on this item to get a few hair cuts in first and man these clippers exeeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Its lighter than the 76 has more power smaller in size, much less wear on you writs if you don&#x27;t have the money get a small loan</li>
            <li>There small and fit well in your hand and cut just as well as any other clipper oster has.</li>
            <li>home use, if you are just getting started with a single clipper and on a budget, I would suggest looking at the Wahl or Andis Masters to start unless you know there are specific short cuts like a crew, military, or bald that don&#x27;t require that much tapering/blending so you don&#x27;t have to buy the extra blades.</li>

            <li> They have the feeling of high end, or heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I had to returned them back because the tong that holds the blades in place got loose by the fith day and made a rattling noise and a lot of vibration.</li>
            <li> It is very noisy and her customers complained of the heat it generated.</li>
            <li> He also mentioned that the clipper is very quiet compared to the other clippers he uses.</li>
            <li> The posted listed the pn for the limited edition one.</li>
            <li> This may have been an open box item, the packaging was a little suspect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a 76 and this definitely is less noisy and minus the heft and bulk.  </li>
            <li> I was a little surprised, but since I am only cutting my husband&#x27;s hair, no big deal.  </li>
            <li> Its a little smaller than the 110 and 111 witch make it easer for small hands to use all day.</li>
            <li> At one point I had an Oster 76, but it was just too big and clumsy for me.  </li>
            <li> and I still need another 2 to round out my set.</li>
            <li> They are heavy but well balanced.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, a professional hair stylist, but she was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Prior to owning these clippers, my hair failed to get the respect I demand.</li>
            <li> It never gets bogged down, even when cutting through thick wet hair.</li>
            <li> but then I started reading the negative reviews here.  </li>
            <li> My experience was not good.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and these will cut through it no problem.</li>
            <li> Now, my hair is at its peak, or pinnacle if you will in the hair game.</li>
            <li> An exelant clipper for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> This makes it impossible to do anything</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will erase this bad review once/if NORTHEAST BEAUTY SUPPLY corrects this in a desirable manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now the bad.</li>
            <li> at least test the item before sending!!!!</li>
            <li> horrible smell.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a home barber for my friends and son and this is my first rotary clipper, I currently own the Wahl Seniors and Andis T-Outliners which work well for tapering but I heard a lot of online recommendations to add a rotary clipper to my set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I love the look and feel of the clippers.

I don&#x27;t mind the extra work but you&#x27;ll need to clean and oil all the different blades, lube the gears, and replace the carbon brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This setup can be very expensive, I opted for buying different blades as I heard it gives the best cut. I purchased 5 extra blades which cost an additional $120 and I still need another 2 to round out my set. For reference, my Seniors and Outliners were $120 for the pair. They do have a detachable outliner blade so that might save some money if you don&#x27;t buy an extra edger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For home use, if you are just getting started with a single clipper and on a budget, I would suggest looking at the Wahl or Andis Masters to start unless you know there are specific short cuts like a crew, military, or bald that don&#x27;t require that much tapering/blending so you don&#x27;t have to buy the extra blades. For me, I find it useful to take down the initial bulk of hair, switch to adjustable clippers or clipper over comb technique for fading/tapering and finish with the T-outliners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the investment with the extra blades, it&#x27;s not for everyone. I don&#x27;t mind spending the money on the tools because it cuts well, probably last forever, and it&#x27;ll pay for itself through savings from not going to the barber.</li>
            <li> Will work but not with the old cutters, must buy new ones I have both now. Wish it was same</li>
            <li> Had to return these. They could not keep up with a barber shop workload. I stuck to my good old Oster 76&#x27;s!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that these clippers are great, but buy them from someone else. USA Beauty sent me the clippers and an extra guard. Both packages had clearly been opened, and both blades still had stubble on them. The clippers had oil smeared below the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad look.</li>
            <li> Its lighter than the 76 has more power smaller in size, much less wear on you writs if you don&#x27;t have the money get a small loan</li>
            <li> I have used Oster 76 clippers for over 20 yrs and always loved them for durability and good quality, the only thing it can be high maintenance replacing parts when used for 15 to 40 haircuts a day. The reason I stop using them and suitch to Andis BGR&#x27;s because the hot air from the 76&#x27;s made my hands feel like I had arthritis and heard after a long day of work. When the model 10 came out I look forward to buy a pair because they were smaller and lighter. My surprise they where faster too. I started using them and liked them very much but the hot air reminded me one of the reasons why I suitch to the andis. I had to returned them back because the tong that holds the blades in place got loose by the fith day and made a rattling noise and a lot of vibration. Nothing I could do about it. I&#x27;ll buy the Andis VBGR&#x27;s five speed instead.</li>
            <li> An exelant clipper for cutting hair. It has plenty of power and gives a nice clean cut. Its a little smaller than the 110 and 111 witch make it easer for small hands to use all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using oster clippers for years now and I really like the model 10 series. There small and fit well in your hand and cut just as well as any other clipper oster has.</li>
            <li> Dope clippers. Work like a champ. Much lighter then the 76ers. Very clean looking with the black on black you will enjoy</li>
            <li> Great clipper so far.</li>
            <li> Run this over my head every friday. Should have bought on years ago. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the rolls royce of hair clippers.  It sounds and feels solid.  I&#x27;ve had a 76 and this definitely is less noisy and minus the heft and bulk.  Fits comfortably in a woman&#x27;s hand and performance is smooth and effortless.</li>
            <li> i opened the box and plugged them on..turned it on..and started SMOKING! horrible smell.&lt;br /&gt;i will erase this bad review once/if NORTHEAST BEAUTY SUPPLY corrects this in a desirable manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret buying these because of this experience i have had with this store/company...what a shame it is! at least test the item before sending!!!!</li>
            <li> These clippers are more powerful than any other clippers I have owned in the past. They have the feeling of high end, or heavy duty. I do have to say that my hair has never been so dominant. Prior to owning these clippers, my hair failed to get the respect I demand. Now, my hair is at its peak, or pinnacle if you will in the hair game. For those who will not be satisfied with just merely average hair, these clippers need to be a mainstay in your quiver of hair care products.</li>
            <li> I barbered for 17 years and tried many kind of clippers, but always returned to my Oster Fast Feeds that I bought in 1985.  At one point I had an Oster 76, but it was just too big and clumsy for me.  I loved the way the blades cut through the hair, but I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get a good enough grip on them to feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently found this smaller Model 10 and they are so much easier for me to manage.  I&#x27;ve already ordered two more detachable blades.  I love to cut with this clipper!  It just glides through the finest or coarsest hair with no lines.  I just have to make sure I keep everything super clean and well oiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I no longer barber, so these are home use only on the husband and kids.  I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;d do running one haircut after another, but for the occasional family haircut, they can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The posted listed the pn for the limited edition one. I didnt get that, but the Model 10 works fine.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is a barber and this was a Christmas gift to him. He says that it is much lighter, sheers are stronger and he says he can cut faster. He also mentioned that the clipper is very quiet compared to the other clippers he uses.</li>
            <li> One of the best clipper ever, very quiet and super light. I love it, this is good stuff believe me.</li>
            <li> My son was wanting these clippers for awhile, he was very excited when he received them. He is good to go now!</li>
            <li> My experience was not good. I do 15-20 haircuts a day and the motor got hot after one haircut. No doubt the clippers are lighter in weight but it shouldn&#x27;t get heated up like that. So had to return it. May be that particular piece was defective.</li>
            <li> These are superb clippers! I cut my own hair. Started with a cheaper brand of clippers initially. After 3 years I decided to upgrade the quality of clipper I use. These were a significant improvement. Most highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The clippers are built like a tank. I cut my own hair and have done so for years now. I have very thick hair and these will cut through it no problem. They are heavy but well balanced. The noise level is on par for any pair of professional clippers and by no means loud. So far they seem easy to maintain and fault free I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Everything&lt;br /&gt;promised.</li>
            <li> Top of the top class.</li>
            <li> Went from $35 WalMart Wahl&#x27;s to these. Shave my own head every week. The Wahl&#x27;s did a decent job and lasted 5 years, but they never cut like the Model 10.  Worth the money to me.  Easy to use and maintain.  Can&#x27;t imagine the 76 being any better for my purpose.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for my father, who cuts my hair. I also use these to trim body hair. Very happy with this purchase. I upgraded to these from a cheap pair of Wahls and you can tell a huge difference. This is the Rolls Royce of Clippers. It never gets bogged down, even when cutting through thick wet hair. It even sounds dramatically different, you can hear the quality in the motor, and feel it in the weight. Definitively worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Light and powerful, gives what I&#x27;ve come to expect from an Oster clipped.</li>
            <li> The Model 10 is getting too hot after 10-20 min. of used.</li>
            <li> it cuts like no other clipper around, on the other hand the build quality it need some cosmetics help for one you are paying over $100 for this thing, the switch feels kinder cheap, the housing still had casting material painted over should have been filed down and then painted... stop messing around with (qc) it an American product ...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, a professional hair stylist, but she was unable to use it. It is very noisy and her customers complained of the heat it generated. She used cooling spray which she told me is required of all clippers in this category but to no avail. This may have been an open box item, the packaging was a little suspect. I tried to return, but Amazon said the time had expired - I didn&#x27;t know there was a limit. Obviously, I cannot recommend and buyer beware when buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I waited to write a review on this item to get a few hair cuts in first and man these clippers exeeded my expectations. They slice right through hair like a butter knife through butter on a sunny day. Now the bad. The clippers get hot after 15 minutes of use. Not only. the clippers but the blades too. I would have easily given them 5 start if heating wasnt the problem. My suggestion for one who is purchasing these. Make sure you own another pair of adjustible clipper before you buy these.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s not broken don&#x27;t fix it.  They never should have messed around with the original classic....period. Buy one while you can!</li>
            <li> Excellent clipper!!! Paired with Oster&#x27;s 00000 blade makes short work when cutting my own hair (only thing i use it for). Smaller than the Classic 76 which it replaced.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers.</li>
            <li> My husband needed a good pair of clippers as he keeps his head buzzed very short and does it weekly. These are such high quality, he expects them to last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> After 11 months of use they are falling apart.</li>
            <li> Incredible set of clippers.  For years we went with department store clippers. these to a superior job.</li>
            <li> I like these clippers, but be forewarned that they do get hot towards the end of the haircut.  I was a little surprised, but since I am only cutting my husband&#x27;s hair, no big deal.  They cut great, but do get hot.</li>
            <li> Was able to adjust the blades to get a super close cut.</li>
            <li> Awesome machine! Don&#x27;t know how I did without it all these years.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit based on the good reviews on Amazon.  This is my first experience with this unit and brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good and powerful unit.  Much better than any pro clippers I have used in the past.  The removable blade is a blessing as it makes cleaning and disinfecting a breeze.  It also looks like the blade also disassembles easily with just two screws, making it even easier to get a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s so great, then why the 3 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The vent is located at the unit&#x27;s neck, where my hand would normally be, making it uncomfortable to hold with warm air blowing into my hand all the time.  I would have no issues adjusting my grip just so I can keep it, except for item 2 below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The entire unit gets hot after about 10 minutes of use.  Not just the body, but also the blade, in fact, the blade gets too hot to touch (yes, I followed the lubrication instructions as prescribed by the manufacturer).  This makes it impossible to do anything skin-tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assumed that the unit was defective and returned the unit (thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s return policy), but then I started reading the negative reviews here.  If this is the true nature of this particular unit, I figure that must adjust my grip to avoid the vents, and buy a few spare blades to swap out to reduce heat, just to be able to use this unit.  I&#x27;m still debating whether it&#x27;s worth the trouble.</li>
