            <li>I like this sweet almond oil, happy it is organic.  </li>
            <li>I figured if almonds are good for healthy eating, my skin would be glad to absorb it as well.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li>But this product is practically scentless, and is in fact identified on its bottle as being suitable for cooking.</li>
            <li>Great on my skin right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Good quality organic sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>If one is selling a product it should be transparent and the labeling should be convincing.  </li>
            <li>I love this product...  </li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>I needed it to make some chap sticks for gifts and  am sure it will work well.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s been great so far.  </li>
            <li>So far so good...:-)</li>
            <li>The quality is better than I expected and it blends beautifully into my recipes.</li>
            <li>This is great mixed in castile liquid soap for a moisturizing body wash</li>
            <li>Use for skin and body care - makes great face lotion/oil (I add essential oils and some lighter oils like Jojoba &amp; Rosehip).&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great as a carrier oil for your essential oil needs.</li>
            <li>Even when I dye my hair once a month, with this oil my hair is just as bright as when it was young and is too long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use in place of Bio-Oil or Belly Balm during pregnancy, and it&#x27;s far more cost effective.</li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect and there is very little odor.</li>
            <li>Works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>If everyone used natural products like this, the world would be a better place!</li>
            <li>Fabulous product - highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Wonderful carrier oil and a good price if you have your local source is on the expensive side of things.</li>
            <li>No irritation on his sensitive and leaves him super soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li>Not quite as effective for dry skin in the winter, so i switched to shea butter.</li>
            <li>Because of the word &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; in this product&#x27;s title, I expected this oil to have the light perfume I&#x27;m accustomed to enjoying during massages.</li>
            <li>Either way, I am still satisfied with the oil but will look for something that is organic and certified by USDA next time.</li>
            <li>This oil is my go to carrier oil for essential oil blending for most of my recipes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It was my first go at using Sweet Almond Oil as part of my new skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil, it makes my skin soft hair soft, I&#x27;ll recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>Pretty much as described.</li>
            <li>I use this all summer on my skin, and wow, does the skin damage from sun heal quickly.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>We use this on our skin love it as a moisturizer year round.</li>
            <li>skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this helps with keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have other carrier oils for more specific needs, but if no oil is recommended, I always choose this.</li>
            <li>Have used straight on my face at night, as massage oil, to dilute essential oils, and to make body butter.</li>
            <li>So far I think is</li>
            <li>I add a few drops of essential oils, like rose, lavender, jasmine, or sweet orange to get a subtle scent, and use it instead of body lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavy as oils go, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as some, but I highly recommend this oil!</li>
            <li>I love the sweet almond scent and was disappointed that this oil doesn&#x27;t have it.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like that I have to write a long narrative for such a minor product.  </li>

            <li> I have purchased in the past, so I am not convinced that it&#x27;s real almond oil.  </li>
            <li> not sure whether I received a old stock...sits in my cabinet without use.</li>
            <li> Also there is absolutely no scent to this oil, for all</li>
            <li> This order came quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> And I am certainly not convinced that it&#x27;s organic.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to mix with other oils for hair, scalp, and body.</li>
            <li> I transferred it to a dark brown bottle, it&#x27;s keep longer that way.</li>
            <li> wish is that it would have come with a warning that you need another bottle with a sprout because it spills out from the round bottle opening.  </li>
            <li> : I mix it with few drops of vitamins E</li>
            <li> It is easier and less messy that way!</li>
            <li> I hate winter because it really makes me itch.  </li>
            <li> By the way, it works just as well as Bio-Oil for a small fraction of the cost--can&#x27;t argue with that!</li>
            <li> This oil was thin and didn&#x27;t smell like almond at all.</li>
            <li> very disappointing, hope this review helps other buyers.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with it and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> , ill use it for now and hope its almond oil.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This does not smell at all like almond oil I have purchased in the past, so I am not convinced that it&#x27;s real almond oil.  And I am certainly not convinced that it&#x27;s organic.  I regret having ordered it.</li>
            <li> I use this all summer on my skin, and wow, does the skin damage from sun heal quickly.  I figured if almonds are good for healthy eating, my skin would be glad to absorb it as well.  Not quite as effective for dry skin in the winter, so i switched to shea butter. But come spring and summer and fall, this will be used daily.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry skin. I add a few drops of essential oils, like rose, lavender, jasmine, or sweet orange to get a subtle scent, and use it instead of body lotion.</li>
            <li> This oil was thin and didn&#x27;t smell like almond at all. I was not impressed with it and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in place of Bio-Oil or Belly Balm during pregnancy, and it&#x27;s far more cost effective. One bottle will last the duration of pregnancy, even being used twice per day. The cap is a regular dump-cap with no dispenser, so I pour it out into a smaller dispensing bottle and refill that periodically. It is easier and less messy that way! By the way, it works just as well as Bio-Oil for a small fraction of the cost--can&#x27;t argue with that!</li>
            <li> This almond oil is a great product but it is not verified by the USDA to be &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.  So, the organic label may just be a marketing ploy.  Either way, I am still satisfied with the oil but will look for something that is organic and certified by USDA next time.</li>
            <li> Good product. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on skin but it doesnt smell anything like almonds.  For all I know it could be canola oil.  The labeling on the bottle seems dodgy for example the fact that its &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.  If one is selling a product it should be transparent and the labeling should be convincing.  Wont be getting it next time because of the labeling however, ill use it for now and hope its almond oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in making home made shea butter and I absolutely LOVE it!  I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful carrier oil and a good price if you have your local source is on the expensive side of things.</li>
            <li> This was my mistake, when I purchased, I was unaware of the fact that the oil was not certified organic, rather it is just stated as organic in the title. Also there is absolutely no scent to this oil, for all I know it could be canola oil. I will be returning this item. very disappointing, hope this review helps other buyers.</li>
            <li> This oil is my go to carrier oil for essential oil blending for most of my recipes. I have other carrier oils for more specific needs, but if no oil is recommended, I always choose this. The consistency is perfect and there is very little odor.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like that I have to write a long narrative for such a minor product.  Anyone who is looking for this type of thing, this one is great, buy it!</li>
            <li> This is great mixed in castile liquid soap for a moisturizing body wash</li>
            <li> Good quality organic sweet almond oil. Use it to remove my make-up, to moisturize my hair and in my shea whipped body butters. Very pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product...  It was my first go at using Sweet Almond Oil as part of my new skin care routine.  So far so good...:-)</li>
            <li> Great amount for a great price! If everyone used natural products like this, the world would be a better place!</li>
            <li> Great, pure sweet almond oil. Smells great, feels great, and very good quality. Have used straight on my face at night, as massage oil, to dilute essential oils, and to make body butter. Have purchased twice and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Use it every night for baby massage. No irritation on his sensitive and leaves him super soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> Looove this almond oil. Awesome for making soaps, deodorant,  sunblock.  Works great alone for skin and hair. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it makes my skin soft hair soft, I&#x27;ll recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Use for skin and body care - makes great face lotion/oil (I add essential oils and some lighter oils like Jojoba &amp; Rosehip).&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it&#x27;s organic - more chemicals eliminated from my life!  Yeah!</li>
            <li> Great product, I purchased it after a friend recommended that I use it as a hair treatment. My hair feels and looks fantastic! This oil is lovely as a treatment!</li>
            <li> good smell and good quality</li>
            <li> Love the oil!! I purchased it to make my own body wash &amp; am very satisfied! The smell is wonderful, the results just as wonderful! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Great value for price.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish is that it would have come with a warning that you need another bottle with a sprout because it spills out from the round bottle opening.  I think it must be meant to pour out into smaller bottles for massage use.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use this product to make my homemade body butter and have been very pleased with the quality!  It&#x27;s also great as a carrier oil for your essential oil needs.</li>
            <li> Almond oil is great for after the shower, keeps my skin very soft. I transferred it to a dark brown bottle, it&#x27;s keep longer that way.</li>
            <li> So far I think is very good Almond Oil.  I use it to make Beard Wax and it has no scent which is nice,,</li>
            <li> I needed it to make some chap sticks for gifts and  am sure it will work well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. I bought this to mix with other oils for hair, scalp, and body. Nice quantity for price. Great oil for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Pretty much as described.</li>
            <li> Used this for a Wellness Mama skincare recipe - works great! skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my skin. My skin is very sensitive and this helps with keeping it moisturized. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Fabulous product - highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Use for my bagpipes. No rancid smell. Happy so far and no issues with my stand.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this oil, I was told that my skin looks radiant. It moisturizes very well.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: I mix it with few drops of vitamins E</li>
            <li> Great organic product</li>
            <li> I use it to make homemade lotion with coconut and essential oils. It absorbs quickly and smells great. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis and mix with tea tree oil.  Great on my skin right out of the shower.  Great Price - Great packaging</li>
            <li> I use this in my company&#x27;s organic salt scrubs/ bath salts and everyone says they&#x27;re the best they&#x27;ve ever used. I only wish it came in a larger size. I have purchased this several times and will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> This order came quicker than expected.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times for my homemade lotion and it&#x27;s been great so far.  No complaints here.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I use it in  DIY skin care products.</li>
            <li> I like this sweet almond oil, happy it is organic.  Use it for homemade beauty products.  Great price for product</li>
            <li> Prime has everything at your door in two days. We use this on our skin love it as a moisturizer year round.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as an ingredient for body products that I sell. The quality is better than I expected and it blends beautifully into my recipes. Absorbs well. Good price.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this great oil. All I can say that is good for hair. Even when I dye my hair once a month, with this oil my hair is just as bright as when it was young and is too long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I hate winter because it really makes me itch.  Thanks to this product, I don&#x27;t have all the itches anymore.</li>
            <li> Great Almond oil! Using to make body butter and we love it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Versatile, doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it and is excellent quality! Great after a shower - leaves skin silky smooth, is excellent for massage and gua sha treatments and as a carrier oil. It&#x27;s a little heavy as oils go, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as some, but I highly recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my organic face and body lotion. It is liquid velvet. Very nice without much scent.</li>
            <li> Because of the word &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; in this product&#x27;s title, I expected this oil to have the light perfume I&#x27;m accustomed to enjoying during massages. But this product is practically scentless, and is in fact identified on its bottle as being suitable for cooking. I can get almond oil for that a lot cheaper at the local natural-food store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller should remove the misrepresentative term &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; from this product&#x27;s title.</li>
            <li> I love the sweet almond scent and was disappointed that this oil doesn&#x27;t have it.  Works well, but will order a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I use it on my hair and skin and I am in love!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites for making sugar scrubs!  Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is not a certified organic product, the advertising was deceptive.  I would not get this again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. Great quality. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> does not have the almond smell at all. not sure whether I received a old stock...sits in my cabinet without use. no time to return...</li>
