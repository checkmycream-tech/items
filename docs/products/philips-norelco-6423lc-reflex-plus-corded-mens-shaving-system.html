            <li>This Philips Norelco 6423LC Reflex Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System is the BEST shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>The best place for this unit maybe that it can be used on a fishing line.</li>
            <li>Hubby is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After a year the unit is still running perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I think the norelco rotary shaver is the best shaver there is in the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>One of my best investments.</li>
            <li>It has an awesome trimmer, providing a very good cut without pulling.</li>
            <li>If you shave reguarly, once or even twice a day, this is a very good razor.</li>
            <li>This is a very good shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li>The shaver was very good.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a very good buy.</li>
            <li>My husband says it is a very good shaver</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco shaver with batteries in the &#x27;80 that worked very good and when traving it did its job.</li>
            <li>Its incredible how closer shave u get.</li>
            <li>As advertised, this electric shaver gives me the best results I have ever experienced over 50 years  using all types of electric razors.</li>
            <li>This product is a very good buy and it works great.  </li>
            <li>product&#x27;s design is beautiful.</li>
            <li>It does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Of course the blades have been replaced, but it still runs great.</li>
            <li>The Norelco does as great a job on the neck as on the face, and no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quality razor and a great price, get this razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I did.  </li>
            <li>so I got this one from Amazon at a great price.  </li>
            <li>There is a great trimmer as well for the side burns..  </li>
            <li>This is a great electric shaver for light-duty shaves.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Happy with this purchase.</li>

            <li>Great razor at a great price.  </li>
            <li>This one works great.</li>
            <li>For the money, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>it was really great</li>
            <li>So I decided to buy him this one for our anniversary after reading great reviews about it.</li>
            <li>It is a great value for a great product.</li>
            <li>A Great Value for the Price.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Norelco 6423LC Reflex Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System  Very nice shaver.</li>
            <li>I just give it a good cleaning once a month.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a  good value.</li>
            <li>way this thing was going to give me a good shave!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the floating heads that make it so good.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>It was an all in all good shaver, it doesn&#x27;t have the power like i thought it would, but it did good for the person I bought it for.</li>
            <li>It was a good choice.</li>
            <li>but now I get a good close shave, including under my nose.  </li>
            <li>For the price I think it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li>They loved&#x27;em</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t feel like putting in the time for a blade-shave, this shaver is a good alternative.  </li>
            <li>With that said, I think this razor was a good choice for my purpose.</li>
            <li>A good shave takes about 7 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>tip of another reviewer was good: Don&#x27;t use and wear out the power switch.</li>
            <li>this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>and I got a wonderful smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>If it lasts for another 7 years, I will consider it a good investment.</li>
            <li>Good thing after all.</li>
            <li>One good thing about it is the trimmer.</li>
            <li>think that you should consider buying this shaver that is a really good buy.</li>
            <li>a good shave at a reansonable price &lt;br</li>
            <li>This would be a good travel razor to keep in the suitcase.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>I have had good results with this shaver.</li>
            <li>bought a Braun from WalMart, but it wasn&#x27;t that good even that it didn&#x27;t shave anything.</li>
            <li>good price;</li>
            <li>It is a good buy for the money.  </li>
            <li>This one shaves almost as good as the model</li>
            <li>Made good on pricing I could have gotten this model for through AMAZON.</li>
            <li>Definately a good place to deal with.   </li>
            <li>My husband likes corded shaver and this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for over a year now, so it seems fair to review it.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really, this shaver is the best ever, no need to charge or recharge, use it for like 5 minute and you will have a full neat shave.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional shaver.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product, considering price/performance.</li>
            <li>He is very satisfied with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>so things could change,but at this point I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a lightweight and powerful shaver at an excellent price! &lt;</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get an incredibly close shave, but it doesn&#x27;t miss anything, which was important for me.</li>
            <li>I am sure he likes it, since he never says anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with how comfortable and easily it takes off my whiskers.</li>
            <li>Overall, however, this is a very good shaver and delivers very good value.</li>
            <li>, this product gives a great shave and is a fantastic value.  </li>
            <li>Nice product , gave as a gift</li>
            <li>This handy inexpensive cosmetic facilitates glide and skin smoothness.</li>
            <li>Gives nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Models at the economy end of the Norelco line are now made in China and lack carrying bags of any kind.</li>
            <li>i bought this shaver after forgetting my own at a friends house while on a visit.</li>
            <li>Investing $100+ in a better cordless model doesn&#x27;t seem a good value.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for this price : providing quality shaving and very reliable too.</li>
            <li>It fits in there nice and snug.  </li>
            <li>My husband is thrilled with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>My husband liked it but has passed away now.</li>
            <li>The price is good, and shaves close, but he has had better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quite and does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it was a corded razor.  </li>
            <li>I warmly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My husband is not fond of electric razors, but they are handy in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>Very light and nice feel.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, product is very good and service was fast.</li>
            <li>Great deal and worth the thirty-some bucks I paid for it.</li>
            <li>The cord still coils up nicely when not in use and limits counter top cable clutter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>April Rose &amp; Mike :)</li>
            <li>you just can&#x27;t fit a good blade shave in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, good for travel.</li>
            <li>the good performance and realability of the first Norelco  which is still is in good working condition.</li>
            <li>, I had a much better closer more comfortable shave than I have ever experienced before without the skin irritation and accidental nicks and cuts that come with top of the line blades.  </li>
            <li>both power and shave quality were fine)!</li>
            <li>Very light and plasticy.  </li>
            <li>so we got a better price because of her employee discount as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>Better than the Norelco it replaced and a value for the price.</li>
            <li>So pleased that I ordered another one just for a backup.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and very well made.</li>
            <li>I love this Phillips razor because it is corded</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers most of my life.</li>
            <li>Am satisfied with the product and the way the transaction was handled.hbw</li>
            <li>I decided an electric razor would be the best route to go after I used up my final Gillette blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this shaver, and for the purpose it was acquired.</li>
            <li>Very well made, works great.  </li>
            <li>Norelco has a better motor than others razors.  </li>
            <li>I have been a norelco customer for many years.  </li>
            <li>am so glad that I purchased this razor</li>
            <li>They said that it&#x27;s much better than using disposable razors.</li>
            <li>I love it a million</li>
            <li>I had many shavers were made in Holland.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with the purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li>But, I am really satisfied after trying it.  </li>
            <li>I like a 110 volt electric shaver better than the battery operated ones.</li>
            <li>When I gave him this one he was impressed that the design was the same except for the collapsable contouring head part.  </li>
            <li>Their \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; system is more like \\&quot;lift and rip out your hair\\&quot; system.   </li>
            <li>Outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>I have used battery shavers for years, but the non battery shaver gives you a quicker shaave since a plug in shaver has a better and faster motor, than a battery shaver.  </li>
            <li>Another plus to the Norelco is that it does a much better job of shaving underneath my jaw line and on my neck.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.......</li>
            <li>but, it sure does the job.</li>
            <li>This shaver is able to hold me till the evening.</li>
            <li>The blades whizzes by without making much noise, especially important when you are just off the bed.</li>
            <li>The blades are recommended to be replaced every year; but we guys can push it a bit more, I am sure :).</li>
            <li>Love the brand but not this razor.  </li>
            <li>My husband is okay with it.  </li>
            <li>, I think you are better off to save your money and buy a better electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It seems to give a better shave this way</li>
            <li>I am also satisfied with the results of this purchase.  </li>
            <li>This present model is about the best one ever.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best shaver one can get at this price.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers all my life, always been satisfied until this one.  </li>
            <li>but this shaver is ok...</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Its slower,lighter and more quieter, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It seams to have more power than the rechargeable ones on the market.</li>
            <li>Upon reflection, the 6423LC is an outstanding value, that performs admirably, and diligently.   </li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for many years.</li>
            <li>This latest model does a good job shaving and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>He really enjoyed this gift.</li>
            <li>It could sit most of the time for three or four years, you use it a handful of times, then the Ni-Cad or whatever rechargeable batteries your shaver uses die</li>
            <li>And the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Razor is not rechargable like most razors are now.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know a better value for the money.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t really need a shaver with a battery, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for over 40 years and this is my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor while on sale and it is an outstanding buy.  </li>
            <li>Reliable product, it&#x27;s still working after so many years.</li>
            <li>Had I been able to return, I would have, but they say no return.  </li>
            <li>It is also shaped to fit the hand, very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, a VERY minor issue, and I think this is the best razor you can buy for the money.</li>
            <li>I love how easy they are to use and how they don&#x27;t cut up your face.  </li>
            <li>Nice design, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This allows me to apply more pressure (which becomes more important as the heads get duller), although it compromises the ability of the heads to swivel.  </li>
            <li>i like this design better, it conforms much better to the shape of my face and gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap and simple design, yet it does its job great!  </li>
            <li>More importantly, they do not pinch, as I found non-rotary razors were more prone to do.  </li>
            <li>Have been pleased with the shaver - works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Sure it shaves fine</li>
            <li>I had my older one for more than eight years, and it was still giving me good shaves until I discarded it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bear down,but just let the razor do the work,and I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy the results.</li>
            <li>I got my chin shaved from the first use without having any irritaion or else, and I had a wonderful complete shave.</li>
            <li>Works fast, Surprising quite, Would be easier to use with a 12\\&quot; longer cord.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to feel the skin with my free hand to know which areas need more shaving.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco razors for many years, so I am familiar with them.</li>
            <li>I hope they will be available in the future as this shaver is a very good product.</li>
            <li>The floating heads make getting all the spots on my face easy.  </li>
            <li>It is easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li>so this was an easy choice.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy for me to shave, because of my motor disability.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cord pulls out from the shaver sometimes, but it&#x27;s easy to hold it in place when shaving and stretching the cord all the way.</li>
            <li>Norelco is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>It gets the easy parts, but below th chin</li>
            <li>but the cord comes out too easily and has to be reconected while shaving.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Plugging into the outlet for a couple of minutes while shaving won&#x27;t hurt anything :) The finish is clean and neat, the grip is secure.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is also just fine.</li>
            <li>Lets hope Norelco continues to make this fine item.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric razors for about 40 years and they have always been fine.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem at all, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Provides excellent shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>It should be fine at 220v,</li>
            <li>I would have preferred something more substantial, but this item for the price seems adequate though the shaves are not as close.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>This razor gave a great shave for over 6 months and a pretty good shave for another 6 months, but after a little more than a year the shave was no longer acceptable.  </li>
            <li>It trims my sideburns precisely.  </li>
            <li>low cost, great working shaver.</li>
            <li>I purchased a corded shaver primarily for home use.</li>
            <li>I like that these are still available as I&#x27;d rather just plug it in and use it rather than plug it in to charge and then use it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if they were still available, but searched Amazon and found the Philips Norelco 6423LC corded shaver.</li>
            <li>but I see that they are no longer available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Razor is a good value,  works OK, is light and quiet but a bit bulky for travel packing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and move around.</li>
            <li>Norelco deserves a lot of credit for designing, manufacturing, and selling such a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had rechargable shavers that were much more powerful.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and it shaves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li>Then the shaver works great the next day</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a more expensive razor, but this one does a great job at a great price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean too &amp; designed to fit in your hand securely while shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is amazingly quite and fast, and produces a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I chalk this up as a win for Amazon (they got my money) but shame on them for knowingly offering a definitely mis-represented product....</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>This latest model is much quieter and shaves better.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a nice close shave even though it takes a few passes to make sure one gets a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>This Norelco is a very good shaving system and it is not just the electric razor method itself because I have tried other electric shavers along with this one and they did not in anyway compare to the results that I get from the Reflex</li>
            <li>so we bought 3 more for our older grand sons for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, extremely quiet, easy to clean, and gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>1- Clean close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>and I still get a really comfortable clean shave</li>
            <li>Comfortable, clean shaven and a delight to use.  </li>
            <li>IF I wanted a really clean smooth shave I would use a razor...</li>
            <li>It performs even better than the cordless and was a great deal less money.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s is happy with this one and may be using it more often than his previous razor.</li>
            <li>This is a closer shave than my original battery version</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco products in the past and have been favorably impressed with their reliability and this one appears to continue that experience for me.    </li>
            <li>As long as he empties the hair between shaving his face and his head, it does a great job.</li>
            <li>My original norelco was made in Holland as was all Norelcos.</li>
            <li>Originally, it worked well.</li>
            <li>Definitely not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>My face feels soft, smooth, and nice.</li>
            <li>I clean the cutters and heads with rubbing alcohol every 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li>It gets close and clean.</li>
            <li>I just have to take it out of my car to clean it after 4 or 5 shaves.</li>
            <li>If I had to be clean shaven every work day, I would use a cream and razor on Monday morning, and then use this corded Norelco the rest of the work week.  </li>
            <li>yes you read that right 2006!</li>
            <li>This is a fine, quiet machine that does a great, fast job for me.  </li>
            <li>This three circular headed shaver takes much longer than my remington TCT2.I was looking for a better shaver or design.</li>
            <li>I really doubt fancier models can perform better.</li>
            <li>After using Remington Microscreen shavers for many years, I tried a Norelco 6423LC Reflux Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System and found it very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I have a full beard and used to have my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by around 3.</li>
            <li>For the moment it does a good enough job, even without a closeness control.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good value for this Philips discontinued razor.</li>
            <li>, cmon, how many times in your life have you really needed to shave without an electrical outlet within reach?</li>
            <li>Seemed to have good reviewsk,  I bought it and had it 2 days later.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good for a quick shave when you want too look decent and don&#x27;t have much time.</li>
            <li>Was happy to locate this razor for my husband; it&#x27;s like his old one that finally died and they don&#x27;t make them anymore, but luckily I was able to locate this one thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li>A case would have been nice but, big deal, it&#x27;s fine the way it is.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the kicker: When it stopped working I dug out my prior shaver from 2003, charged it overnight with what I was certain were deceased batteries, and it worked GREAT (</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a good shaver for the price, but now that I know what you get if you pay a little more</li>
            <li>A word of note is that I have a light beard; don&#x27;t know how I would like it if had heavy beard, though have no reason to think I wouldn&#x27;t be happy with it.</li>
            <li>But, it functions very well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s taking more and more shave time to get the same shaving results.</li>
            <li>When my 7 year old Norelco rechargable (inherited frm my dad) died,I used my old Trac II for a while but wasn&#x27;t happy with my shave.</li>
            <li>This particular shaver can be found at Sears but the door-to-door free shipping saves a lot of gas!      </li>
            <li>It is light, quiet, and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>I Like the item very much but wish it had a traveling case to available</li>
            <li>It didnt sound powerful enough, but i must admit, it does give a close shave, pretty good for the money.</li>
            <li>This was my first cheap, corded version.  </li>
            <li>and I would up grade every time a new and better product came out.  </li>
            <li>The new one seems to be even better.</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t even think about getting replacement blades, buy this one and you get a new motor and a much, much better shave.</li>
            <li>Never the less for the cost I for one am happy...</li>
            <li>I got this on sale for a pretty good price back in 2007.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I had tried a electric shaver!  </li>
            <li>This new one is light weight and quiet but don&#x27;t beleive it will last 10 years let alone 25, but it does and excellent job of</li>
            <li>fast shipping, cheap, works.</li>
            <li>real revelation was the sound.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting fast, close, comfortable shaves without worringing that a rechargeable battery will run out or eventually lose its ability to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>I gave this razor as a gift and have been told how much they enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Cannot beleive how fast I received this with the free</li>
            <li>I still have a battery Braun for travel, but day-to-day this has been a well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>razor is much better than my old method, I&#x27;ll just say that.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, comfortable and quiet and gives a fairly close shave, although 5 O&#x27;clock shadow appears earlier than with a blade.</li>
            <li>The machine is powerful and reliable.</li>
            <li>But overall I&#x27;ve been happy with this shaver so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Norelco 6423 Reflex Plus corded electric razor for about 2 1/2 weeks now, and so far, I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy it.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot lighter than the cordless and shaves even better than the old one.</li>
            <li>it is still well worth its price.</li>
            <li>It gives me a good shave, is easy to clean and above all, it&#x27;s QUIET.  </li>
            <li>this one so far is much better in cut and construction.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>I have used an old Norelco 750 for many years.</li>
            <li>So far, with new blades, it is shaving pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco corded shaver arrived QUICKLY and was EXACTLY what I ordered for my husband.</li>
            <li>I found that this one gives me such a clean close shave that I am able to use the electric alone.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is not as great as I expected but does a decent job.</li>
            <li>It still has the original blades and they shave very closely.</li>
            <li>Other than that a good product.</li>
            <li>I gave this Norelco Corded shaver a try after reading the other good reviews.  </li>
            <li>He says it has been giving him a superior shave and working extremely well.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see the overwhelming # of positive reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li>After all, this is a product most guys use everyday and you could easily come to regret your decision (like me!)</li>
            <li>Considering how high the price of razor blades has gotten this is a genuine bargain.</li>
            <li>However, the cost is so low that I will happily buy another every year, rather than pay far much more for a razor that MAY last longer.</li>
            <li>then it would be worthwhile buying the thing once a year instead of new replacement blades, which cost almost as much.  </li>
            <li>It takes a few passes to be 100% successful.</li>
            <li>my better half is very pleased, as I am up early in the day.</li>
            <li>Well, this fragile shaver is still going strong - of course, I&#x27;ve managed not to drop it!</li>
            <li>This basic model gives me as good a shave as any of them (and certainly a better one than other brands that I&#x27;ve used).  </li>
            <li>Have an older Norelco 550TL which is a much better shaver than this new one.  </li>
            <li>This electric razor works great, not as close as a standard razor but close enough.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it could shave better than the old model, but it really, really does.    </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin which the rotary blades are easy on - a non-rotary shaver leaves me raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>This corded razor shaves reasonably well, but takes longer and more effort than my old Quadra.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco, which still works by the way, is still running strong.</li>
            <li>Unlike its more costly predecessor, the primary difference is it requires a bit more finesse to avoid any snags or pulls, by consistently razoring against beard growth, a minor detail achieved easily enough with practice and routine.</li>
            <li>The 6423 is quiet, smooth, and light weight.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 6423LC a year ago to replace a 10-year old Braun which cost more than three times as much.  </li>
            <li>I was about to buy a replacement head but found I could buy the latest version for just a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>Spend your money wisely and get something a little better that may cost a little more.  </li>
            <li>pretty much the same quality shave, okay but not anything special.  </li>
            <li>is working fine - so far.</li>
            <li>In fact this new one just replaced my original.</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with it</li>
            <li>When I pulled this out of the packaging I first thought that it was a bit cheesey.  </li>
            <li>The rotary blades cut crisply and swiftly ...</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;After the first electric shaver, there is no other.\\</li>
            <li>The only reason I held off the 5th star: Force of habit and comfort zone for many years with manual razors, which still give the closest (and fastest) shave.</li>
            <li>For the price, the unit is OK--but it is somewhat underpowered, meaning it takes longer, and  a greater number of facial passes, to get a sufficiently close shave.</li>
            <li>It might seem like a lot of work, but you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s worthwhile, and it will help the heads last longer.   </li>
            <li>Used for exactly 3 weeks, but from day one it was pulling skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first shaving system i bought.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.    </li>
            <li>I think next time I will just buy a slightly better model instead of this one.</li>
            <li>When you first turn it on, it sounds \\&quot;weak\\&quot; and the perception is \\&quot;where&#x27;s the power?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I considered several high-end models from leading brands, but I am glad I picked this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Norelco deserves a lot of credit for designing, manufacturing, and selling such a great product.hanically efficient to have the blades moving in one direction the whole time compared to vibrating back and forth.</li>
            <li>Just used this razor for the first time.  </li>
            <li>but NOTHING like it did the first week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend getting the model slightly higher than this at $49.99, 7140</li>
            <li>When I first plugged in the shaver and turned it on</li>
            <li>The first electric shaver I ever owned was a Norelco.  </li>
            <li>but overall I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Too expensive originally $32.60!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks guys!  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of keeping the waste inside.</li>
            <li>I own this shaver and am currently in the market for a new one.  </li>
            <li>pay a little more for the cordless one, the cord is a pain and this model feels pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>This non-battery model has many advantages, including: relatively inexpensive, much lighter than battery models, more environmentally friendly without a battery, no battery to run down during use, and no battery to charge up before use.  </li>
            <li>This corded shaver gives that closeness I&#x27;m used to, but its motor is not as powerful as it used to be on my older models.</li>
            <li>It is much more mechanically efficient to have the blades moving in one direction the whole time compared to vibrating back and forth.</li>
            <li>Norelco has apparently discontinued this model along with all their corded-only shavers, so if you can find one as I did, you&#x27;re lucky!</li>
            <li>so I can get very close shave very fast by myself.</li>
            <li>After years of buying high end Norelco cordless shavers--most of which are now made in China--and rarely using them in cordless mode, I decided to try this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have been a wet and shaving cream shaver man since I was a teenager only using the best razors such as the Mach disposables blades</li>
            <li>In general, I have found that the fewer extra features in a shaver (like cordless operation), the better the shave!</li>
            <li>After replacing the blades, I was right back to being clean shaven in under five minutes.</li>
            <li>I bought my first electric razor, a cheap basic Remington 2-3 years ago, for out of town vacation trips convenience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly quieter than buzzing foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly quieter than buzzing foil shavers.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to use, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s not very powerful.</li>
            <li>My husband shaves more regularly since he has gotten this new shaver.  </li>
            <li>So you can see how surprised I am to find this year&#x27;s model is absolutely superior to previous models.  </li>
            <li>Whether the cord is too short naturally depends on the particular situation, but it was just right for mine, and I suspect it&#x27;s going to be fine for most cases where the outlet is next to the sink.  </li>
            <li>His last Norelco was purchased in 2000 and worked fine for all these 11 years.  </li>
            <li>Fine shave if you aren&#x27;t going out in public.</li>
            <li>Personally I don&#x27;t need a cordless model, and the shave is fine without any fine-tuning.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent shaver for about $30.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver much and I realize, purely from a cost point of view</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li>This is especially important for the tough areas of the chin</li>
            <li>Like many others, I checked into the prices on new blades for my older Norelco, and found this one priced about the same.</li>
            <li>only problem is its corded, but its in the description and it is why it is cheap.</li>
            <li>Fortunately my neighbor had a similar electric razor and he showed me the way to do it.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes the swivel head and quietness of the razor.</li>
            <li>Priced reasonable for the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t really affect my shaving much.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Norelco shaver!</li>
            <li>Lift and Cut blades gently pull whiskers into the cutter for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>This is a real help for those times when a mirror isn&#x27;t nearby.</li>
            <li>You could actually shave by the sound</li>
            <li>I have always shaved with a straight razor and then with an electric after that.</li>
            <li>However, I abanoned the Quadra because the battery was wearing out and the blades cost almost as much as this whole razor.  </li>
            <li>Everything about the razor and the transaction worked out very well</li>
            <li>It pulls hair and does not offer a smooth comfortable shave like more expensive models.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor as a father&#x27;s day gift for my father, and he told me that he absolutely loves this product.  </li>
            <li>He said it  shaves very well</li>
            <li>since I don&#x27;t really need a cordless, I decided on this corded model.</li>
            <li>This razor provides a much closer shave, something I did not expect.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is powerful and so far does not \\&quot;pull/bite\\&quot; like the cordless one did.  </li>
            <li>shave twice a day, morning and evening...and its really necceary for me with this shaver.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve dropped some Braun shavers which were built straight up-and-down.)  </li>
            <li>slower,(but really isn&#x27;t) and</li>
            <li>and I like the corded model, because it is ready whenever I need to use it,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in weight and quiet and just as powerful as my old razor.</li>
            <li>If this one lasts half as long I&#x27;ll be happy.  </li>
            <li>Serves me right to have purchased an item that is not sold directly by Amazon...</li>
            <li>He liked this shaving system because it is used on dry skin, which makes it easy to do everyday, a minute</li>
            <li>It has been a very pleasant surprise (from Remington), and I am not sure what the more expensive models do to justify the higher price tag.</li>
            <li>After the second shave, I found that the shave was very smooth, and the shaver is so flexible in it&#x27;s \\&quot;floating heads\\&quot; design that I barely felt as if I was shaving hair at all.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t give you a really clean shave, but with it at least you did shave, whereas if all you had was a blade you&#x27;d sometimes have to skip it and hope no one important notices!  </li>
            <li>This is my second electric shaver and it definitely performs better than my first one (a Remington rechargeable foil shaver).</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for more reliable shaver, I would suggest that you look for other Phillips models.</li>
            <li>The results are so much better than the other shaver that he had.</li>
            <li>ok, though it gives a close shave but due to sensitiveness of my skin</li>
            <li>He likes it and uses it more than any other shaver he has.</li>
            <li>but when I was trying to clean it today, it suddenly pop out all the parts</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Norelco is that it&#x27;s MUCH quieter than my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>And each model proves to be kind of the same as the previous model...</li>
            <li>In order to allow greater pressure to be applied, I put some rubber o-rings on the shafts which drive the cutter heads to prevent the cutter heads from sinking down into the housing too much.  </li>
            <li>This latest version comes from China, with questionable implications as to quality and conditions of manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;  Extremely light and quiet, it feels more like a woman&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li>The corded shaver is low priced but gives a more confortable and clean shave than my previous which was 3 times the cost.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it may not be suitable for men with heavy beards who are not accustomed to electric</li>
            <li>Relatively quiet, smooth, and so far very reliable.  </li>
            <li>I guess this is normal wear and tear, but it does seem that the shaver motor/heads are not spinning as fast as they were in Dec/Jan 2007.</li>
            <li>If today&#x27;s lower quality standards for small appliances don&#x27;t bother you, you may find this shaver perfectly acceptable but it is not built to last as long as its predecessors.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>This is my first time of using electric shavers, and from what I read that It will take some time until my skin get use to it and have a complete satasfiying shave, but when I use Norelco 6423LC</li>
            <li>sensitive, regular razor with shaving gel is far better.</li>
            <li>, I got a brand new Norelco razor!    </li>
            <li>I needed a new razor in a hurry and couldn&#x27;ts pend much as I had just finished my christmas shopping.</li>
            <li>The new one shaves like a dream and is much quieter to boot.</li>
            <li>Instead, it is like older versions, and is recommended to brush out the head housing once a week and to desassemble and brush/lubricate razor heads once every 2 months.</li>
            <li>It shaves close, quickly and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Norelco man from my first crop of peachfuzz to my current orchard of gray quills, so the first shave wasn&#x27;t a surprise for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have had 10+ years of service from my older models.  </li>
            <li>The most recent cord-only Norelco (Chinese)</li>
            <li>If it continues to provide a decent shave until 2010 I&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
            <li>Although this particular one is not cordless, it is dual voltage.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected more from a product that I paid a modest price for.  </li>
            <li>The floating head is truly a floating head,not just the blades like my older model.</li>
            <li>I do not shave in the shower nor find a line-cord problematical, and I do not see how a more expensive shaver could satisfy me more.  </li>
            <li>This being said I did not like electric razors or believed in them, nothing like a new clean sharp blade right?  </li>
            <li>The most success I had in the past was an old Norelco corded.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a receptacle by the mirror where you shave, I highly recommend this version over a battery operated version.  </li>
            <li>This new shaver is lighter than its 20 year old successor, and seems to shave somewhat, but not a whole lot, better.</li>
            <li>The razor is wisper quiet, cuts very close and just as quickly as my 10 year old Norelco that was made in Holland.</li>
            <li>Coiled cord could be a little longer, be sure your electric outlet is close to your mirror or you&#x27;ll need an extension cord.</li>
            <li>It irritated my skin but has gotten a little better.</li>
            <li>You just have to be a little more patience using this machine.</li>
            <li>Actually a little better.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old Norelco, this one is much much quieter.  </li>
            <li>(Again, who wants to wake your wife or girlfriend at an early hour?)    </li>
            <li>This one is much quieter than the old one.</li>
            <li>I probably could have gone a few more months on the old cutters, but a year seems reasonable.</li>
            <li>Even at their current price, it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally a blade shaver but will use the electric when traveling or in a rush.</li>
            <li>This shaver is somewhat underpowered when plugged-in and used normally.  </li>
            <li>It feels like I use a normal shaver after I am done.  </li>
            <li>but just ok for everyday use.</li>
            <li>This, while the speedier, much more costly  Norelco (of which I can&#x27;t recall which specifically), was merely mindless, razing of the forest.</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on it sounded so quiet that I thought it couldn&#x27;t have much power</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to select because Norelco normally has only one such model.  </li>
            <li>Much to my delight, it has kept working like new far beyond my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the norelco shaver I can get a quick quality shave with both beard stubble or long whiskers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order a new razor right now because I can&#x27;t stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary.</li>
            <li>I continued using it for a month before I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>(hey, I&#x27;m retired and live in the mountains).  </li>
            <li>I could have bought a new foil/cutter head for my Braun for $25 or this rajor for $30.  </li>
            <li>I just bought and installed new cutters, and they made a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>Some reviewers here have been unhappy with the power, but I found it adequate and got a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Replacing the entire thing was less than $3.00 more than  replacing just the head, so I really have bought it again.</li>
            <li>I really ordered this item more or less for the shears on the back rather than the razors on the front.</li>
            <li>I see the price has gone up a few dollars over what I paid a few weeks ago, but still a great deal.</li>
            <li>It does not seem as fast on multiday growth as the non-rotary  shaver I used 40 years ago, but it seems as fast when used daily.  </li>
            <li>2 yrs ago I bought a new one - the first Chinese made Norelco I ever had.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have arrived at a travel destination only to find that my battery powered razor had mysteriously \\&quot;turned on\\&quot; and run the entire time it was packed in my luggage.  </li>
            <li>I gather that a lot of guys aren&#x27;t aware of the importance of washing their face and applying shaving lotion such as Lectric Shave before shaving.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>trust me stick with your old mach 3 !</li>
            <li>This one is fine - less powerful than previous ones, but I don&#x27;t think that really matters.</li>
            <li>This was a first razor for a 14 year old boy, so we wanted basic and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>It is true that Norelco (and every other competitive company in the world) has been making things cheaper and cheaper (except houses and cars).</li>
            <li>Norelco/Philips would rather I buy a complete new shaver rather than offer replacement blades at an affordable price, say $5-$7 (versus $19-$24)which clearly defies logic or marketing sense...</li>
            <li>However my old 550TL operates at 220v as well, but still runs at nearly twice the speed of the new one.  </li>
            <li>Also this razor is very quiet, more quieter than previous models.  </li>
            <li>I was shopping for replacement cutters and combs for a Norelco Micro Action (formerly Lift &amp; Cut [formerly Rotatract]) shaver and noticed that for less than $10 more I could have a whole new  Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>even if I skip a day; the Braun really \\&quot;grabbed\\&quot; my beard after skipping a day, but the Norelco is much gentler; (3) the Norelco doesn&#x27;t seem to miss spots -- I would sometimes discover an embarrassingly long hair which the Braun had missed for a few days straight; no such problem with this unit; (4) the overall closeness and feel is every bit as good as the Braun, if not better; (5) the price was right.</li>
            <li>Will be interesting to see how it is after the blades dull a bit.  </li>
            <li>After my blades began to dull, I started using Magic Shave.</li>
            <li>easy to handle, could cut wiskers a little easier, must go over face a few times before it is clean shaven.</li>
            <li>I get a neat, clean shave in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>unit replaced a perhaps 8 or 10 year old Norelco razor that I hadn&#x27;t changed the blades on ever.   </li>
            <li>Plugging into the 110-120 mains may seem out-of-date, but this direct, full-power makes a difference.</li>
            <li>The Norelco is extremely quiet and shaves very close.</li>
            <li>Guess I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is naturally dependent on the condition of the cutter heads.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried a few friends&#x27; over the years, but none ever seemed to give a close nor comfortable shave).    </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband b/c of all the complaints about the really old shaver.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very lightweight and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li>I think with the \\&quot;Patented Reflex Action Shaving System: automatically adjusts to every curve on your face for flexible, smoother shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with a carring case, but I just use my old one.</li>
            <li>, it will be far cheaper than buy the Mach 3s for a year.</li>
            <li>My hubby had to start using his old shaver again.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Very close shave, and a very quiet motor.</li>
            <li>am 71 years old.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised at how close a shave I got with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>my old Norelco finaly died on me after 8 years just befor christmas.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if it offers closer shave.</li>
            <li>for those not interested in \\&quot;cordless\\&quot; operation or big $$ signs, this is a fine product</li>
            <li>other than that its a pretty decent shaver</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s getting harder to find a plain corded razor ( I don&#x27;t care for the cordless models they aren&#x27;t powerful enough and they weigh more with the battery ).</li>
            <li>In any case, the new heads cost as much or more than I paid for this thing in the first place, which was just shy of $30.  </li>
            <li>Considering this shaver&#x27;s apparent fragility, if you ever drop it you&#x27;ll need a new one.</li>
            <li>2- Convenient no mess shave.  </li>
            <li>I had some trouble   Learning how to clean it.  </li>
            <li>No matter, I will use the old cordless for travel and the new corded one for daily use at home.  </li>
            <li>One problem - the cord is not secure enough in the razor, so it pulls out too easily.</li>
            <li>Its amazingly small and light.</li>
            <li>Simply replacing the circular cutters was another option, but for a few dollars more I decided to buy the current model.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really cheap if it doesn&#x27;t stay sharp during the even the first few months of ownership!</li>
            <li>However, Norelco HQ55+ replacements have disappeared from local retailers shelves where I live, so I&#x27;d have to order a set from a national retailer if I wanted to do so.</li>
            <li>Had replaced the cutters perhaps 7 years ago, after obtaining the difficult to find replacements; that old shaver with the now old blades, is still a magnitude better than this new shaver.  </li>
            <li>My last cordless lasted only about 5 years when the battery and the whole motor died.  </li>
            <li>Gliding the cutters in several directions over the same area works very well.</li>
            <li>The motor is very quiet, and I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the bulk and quality feel of my old Norelco, but the shave quality is fine and the cost was much less than I had expected to pay.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this shaver is that it weighs half of the 10 year old rechargable Norelco 300SX</li>
            <li>What I do not know is if the newer model will serve as long as the older one and without even a cutter replacement in over eight years.  </li>
            <li>After a purchase gone bad at Target (might add returning the product was easy and full refund given), we were determined to find this shaver!  </li>
            <li>Use care when cleaning in getting everything lined up properly when putting the head back on the main unit of the shaver.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t press down too hard on your skin while shaving, and use your free hand to pull your skin tight while shaving your neck, as suggested in the accompanying booklet.    </li>
            <li>It takes me far too long to shave every morning, requiring multiple passes over the same areas before this anemic little machine finally clips most of the stubble away.</li>
            <li>Readers probably already know this, but, just to be clear, this is a basic, no-frills shaver.  </li>
            <li>This shaver cost the same price as replacement blades for my old shaver.</li>
            <li>After using it every day for a month,needless to say, I won&#x27;t need to pull my old one back out.</li>
            <li>This one is a giant leap over the old one.</li>
            <li>the cord&#x27;s female end does not fit on the prongs as securely as one would like, and occasionally detaches during shaving.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is only a month or so old</li>
            <li>my old norelco cordless finally died after 8 years of use</li>
            <li>The heads appear to have had a design change, although they closely resemble my last unit (5 years old).  </li>
            <li>I was a 23 year old who&#x27;d only use manual razors before that time.</li>
            <li>The cord is a bit short but an extension cord fixed that.  </li>
            <li>I used for nearly 30 years before the electric motor finally gave up.  </li>
            <li>Every few months it pulls free from the shaver enough to remove  power, but not enough to fall off.</li>
            <li>It barely shaves at all.</li>
            <li>It nevertheless served its purpose, and just as effectively, has completed this task without fail ever since --though</li>
            <li>The 6423LC does hug the contour of the face better and is quieter, but the shave quality is quite poor.  </li>
            <li>As for the complaints about the cord being too short, it is just as long as the older shaver&#x27;s cord, but I must admit that the coil is a bit stiffer.  </li>
            <li>Big advantage as far as I am concerned is that it is corded so there is no expensive rechargeable battery that will die in a few years.</li>
            <li>This razor costs only a little more (on Amazon) than typical replacement blades cost.  </li>
            <li>The only positive my husband could say about it is the blades were sharp.  </li>
            <li>When I began using it, I noticed that it made less noise than my old older Norelco corded shaver</li>
            <li>Replacing an old razor of same model; features and quality remain the same and expect to keep it until it falls apart; prefer corded for the power it provides</li>
            <li>My beefs with my old cordless shavers have always been the weight and the lack of power, especially when the batteries are low.</li>
            <li>The Norelco is a far better shaver, and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t dump the Braun years ago.  </li>
            <li>I can now see a crop of pimples and a irreguar shaved small beard as a token from my first time use! &lt;</li>
            <li>(1/13) - Unfortunately I left the original shaver behind at an hotel and sorely missed it until I found a new, unused one on the internet.</li>
            <li>The cost of replacement blades is only about $5 less than the price of a new razor, so just buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Based on that, the 6423 is definitely not underpowered - it has just as much power as my other Norelcos.  </li>
            <li>Threw it out and used the long staright cord from my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>This corded version, however, was not expensive and will never have a dead battery.  </li>
            <li>When it takes too long to get close enough, or it just can&#x27;t get close enough, it&#x27;s time for new heads.    </li>
            <li>On top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash.  </li>
            <li>The razor is lighter and much quieter than my previous model.</li>
            <li>Older Norelcos were solid, well made and came with solid cases; this model has no case at all, making careful handling essential.</li>
            <li>Why does the motor sound so weak</li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;m using 2 shavers, different locations for convenience purposes, and will use this as a secondary shaver.    </li>
            <li>It was just a little more expensive to buy this new electric shaver than it was to replace the blades in my old shaver.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old, half broken Remington did a better job.</li>
            <li>Not having a battery that could fail was nice, but being tethered to the wall at the same time my wife wanted to blow dry her hair was pain.    </li>
            <li>It just doesnt get down as close as my older shaver which was also a norelco...</li>
            <li>This shaver works very well, it shaves reasonably close, does not irritate, and has a surprisingly quiet motor (compared to other Norelcos and Remingtons that I have owned in the past).</li>
            <li>Although highly impressed with the former swift cutting rechargable, my budget at the time limited any would be heir-apparent, to this corded model, which I initially recall after plugging in, seemed  surprisingly slow by comparisen.</li>
            <li>The price is not too bad and the quality is good.  </li>

            <li> and it shaves are excellent.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> He picked it out and Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful value!</li>
            <li> best buy on market.  </li>
            <li> Its best feature is a full-sized trimmer, which works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I get an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is my best electric shaver ever!  </li>
            <li> but I hope not because it is one of their best models and designs.  </li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco 6423LC Reflex Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System is the BEST shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The best place for this unit maybe that it can be used on a fishing line.</li>
            <li> Hubby is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After a year the unit is still running perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I think the norelco rotary shaver is the best shaver there is in the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> One of my best investments.</li>
            <li> It has an awesome trimmer, providing a very good cut without pulling.</li>
            <li> If you shave reguarly, once or even twice a day, this is a very good razor.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li> The shaver was very good.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a very good buy.</li>
            <li> My husband says it is a very good shaver</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco shaver with batteries in the &#x27;80 that worked very good and when traving it did its job.</li>
            <li> Its incredible how closer shave u get.</li>
            <li> As advertised, this electric shaver gives me the best results I have ever experienced over 50 years  using all types of electric razors.</li>
            <li> This product is a very good buy and it works great.  </li>
            <li> product&#x27;s design is beautiful.</li>
            <li> It does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Of course the blades have been replaced, but it still runs great.</li>
            <li> The Norelco does as great a job on the neck as on the face, and no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quality razor and a great price, get this razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I did.  </li>
            <li> so I got this one from Amazon at a great price.  </li>
            <li> There is a great trimmer as well for the side burns..  </li>
            <li> This is a great electric shaver for light-duty shaves.  </li>
            <li> Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It looks great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The price is great.</li>
            <li> This one is great.</li>
            <li> Great razor at a great price.  </li>
            <li> This one works great.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> it was really great</li>
            <li> So I decided to buy him this one for our anniversary after reading great reviews about it.</li>
            <li> It is a great value for a great product.</li>
            <li> A Great Value for the Price.  </li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> Norelco 6423LC Reflex Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System  Very nice shaver.</li>
            <li> I just give it a good cleaning once a month.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a  good value.</li>
            <li> way this thing was going to give me a good shave!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the floating heads that make it so good.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> It was an all in all good shaver, it doesn&#x27;t have the power like i thought it would, but it did good for the person I bought it for.</li>
            <li> It was a good choice.</li>
            <li> but now I get a good close shave, including under my nose.  </li>
            <li> For the price I think it&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li> They loved&#x27;em</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t feel like putting in the time for a blade-shave, this shaver is a good alternative.  </li>
            <li> With that said, I think this razor was a good choice for my purpose.</li>
            <li> A good shave takes about 7 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tip of another reviewer was good: Don&#x27;t use and wear out the power switch.</li>
            <li> this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> and I got a wonderful smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> If it lasts for another 7 years, I will consider it a good investment.</li>
            <li> Good thing after all.</li>
            <li> One good thing about it is the trimmer.</li>
            <li> think that you should consider buying this shaver that is a really good buy.</li>
            <li> a good shave at a reansonable price &lt;br</li>
            <li> This would be a good travel razor to keep in the suitcase.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have had good results with this shaver.</li>
            <li> bought a Braun from WalMart, but it wasn&#x27;t that good even that it didn&#x27;t shave anything.</li>
            <li> good price;</li>
            <li> It is a good buy for the money.  </li>
            <li> This one shaves almost as good as the model</li>
            <li> Made good on pricing I could have gotten this model for through AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Definately a good place to deal with.   </li>
            <li> My husband likes corded shaver and this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year now, so it seems fair to review it.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really, this shaver is the best ever, no need to charge or recharge, use it for like 5 minute and you will have a full neat shave.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional shaver.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product, considering price/performance.</li>
            <li> He is very satisfied with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> so things could change,but at this point I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a lightweight and powerful shaver at an excellent price! &lt;</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get an incredibly close shave, but it doesn&#x27;t miss anything, which was important for me.</li>
            <li> I am sure he likes it, since he never says anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how comfortable and easily it takes off my whiskers.</li>
            <li> Overall, however, this is a very good shaver and delivers very good value.</li>
            <li> , this product gives a great shave and is a fantastic value.  </li>
            <li> Nice product , gave as a gift</li>
            <li> This handy inexpensive cosmetic facilitates glide and skin smoothness.</li>
            <li> Gives nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Models at the economy end of the Norelco line are now made in China and lack carrying bags of any kind.</li>
            <li> i bought this shaver after forgetting my own at a friends house while on a visit.</li>
            <li> Investing $100+ in a better cordless model doesn&#x27;t seem a good value.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product for this price : providing quality shaving and very reliable too.</li>
            <li> It fits in there nice and snug.  </li>
            <li> My husband is thrilled with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> My husband liked it but has passed away now.</li>
            <li> The price is good, and shaves close, but he has had better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quite and does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it was a corded razor.  </li>
            <li> I warmly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband is not fond of electric razors, but they are handy in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> Very light and nice feel.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, product is very good and service was fast.</li>
            <li> Great deal and worth the thirty-some bucks I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The cord still coils up nicely when not in use and limits counter top cable clutter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> April Rose &amp; Mike :)</li>
            <li> you just can&#x27;t fit a good blade shave in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, good for travel.</li>
            <li> the good performance and realability of the first Norelco  which is still is in good working condition.</li>
            <li> , I had a much better closer more comfortable shave than I have ever experienced before without the skin irritation and accidental nicks and cuts that come with top of the line blades.  </li>
            <li> both power and shave quality were fine)!</li>
            <li> Very light and plasticy.  </li>
            <li> so we got a better price because of her employee discount as a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> Better than the Norelco it replaced and a value for the price.</li>
            <li> So pleased that I ordered another one just for a backup.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very well made.</li>
            <li> I love this Phillips razor because it is corded</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers most of my life.</li>
            <li> Am satisfied with the product and the way the transaction was handled.hbw</li>
            <li> I decided an electric razor would be the best route to go after I used up my final Gillette blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this shaver, and for the purpose it was acquired.</li>
            <li> Very well made, works great.  </li>
            <li> Norelco has a better motor than others razors.  </li>
            <li> I have been a norelco customer for many years.  </li>
            <li> am so glad that I purchased this razor</li>
            <li> They said that it&#x27;s much better than using disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I love it a million</li>
            <li> I had many shavers were made in Holland.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with the purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li> But, I am really satisfied after trying it.  </li>
            <li> I like a 110 volt electric shaver better than the battery operated ones.</li>
            <li> When I gave him this one he was impressed that the design was the same except for the collapsable contouring head part.  </li>
            <li> Their \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; system is more like \\&quot;lift and rip out your hair\\&quot; system.   </li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> I have used battery shavers for years, but the non battery shaver gives you a quicker shaave since a plug in shaver has a better and faster motor, than a battery shaver.  </li>
            <li> Another plus to the Norelco is that it does a much better job of shaving underneath my jaw line and on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.......</li>
            <li> but, it sure does the job.</li>
            <li> This shaver is able to hold me till the evening.</li>
            <li> The blades whizzes by without making much noise, especially important when you are just off the bed.</li>
            <li> The blades are recommended to be replaced every year; but we guys can push it a bit more, I am sure :).</li>
            <li> Love the brand but not this razor.  </li>
            <li> My husband is okay with it.  </li>
            <li> , I think you are better off to save your money and buy a better electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It seems to give a better shave this way</li>
            <li> I am also satisfied with the results of this purchase.  </li>
            <li> This present model is about the best one ever.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the best shaver one can get at this price.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers all my life, always been satisfied until this one.  </li>
            <li> but this shaver is ok...</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Its slower,lighter and more quieter, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It seams to have more power than the rechargeable ones on the market.</li>
            <li> Upon reflection, the 6423LC is an outstanding value, that performs admirably, and diligently.   </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years.</li>
            <li> This latest model does a good job shaving and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> He really enjoyed this gift.</li>
            <li> It could sit most of the time for three or four years, you use it a handful of times, then the Ni-Cad or whatever rechargeable batteries your shaver uses die</li>
            <li> And the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Razor is not rechargable like most razors are now.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know a better value for the money.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t really need a shaver with a battery, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for over 40 years and this is my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor while on sale and it is an outstanding buy.  </li>
            <li> Reliable product, it&#x27;s still working after so many years.</li>
            <li> Had I been able to return, I would have, but they say no return.  </li>
            <li> It is also shaped to fit the hand, very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, a VERY minor issue, and I think this is the best razor you can buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I love how easy they are to use and how they don&#x27;t cut up your face.  </li>
            <li> Nice design, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This allows me to apply more pressure (which becomes more important as the heads get duller), although it compromises the ability of the heads to swivel.  </li>
            <li> i like this design better, it conforms much better to the shape of my face and gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap and simple design, yet it does its job great!  </li>
            <li> More importantly, they do not pinch, as I found non-rotary razors were more prone to do.  </li>
            <li> Have been pleased with the shaver - works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Sure it shaves fine</li>
            <li> I had my older one for more than eight years, and it was still giving me good shaves until I discarded it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bear down,but just let the razor do the work,and I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy the results.</li>
            <li> I got my chin shaved from the first use without having any irritaion or else, and I had a wonderful complete shave.</li>
            <li> Works fast, Surprising quite, Would be easier to use with a 12\\&quot; longer cord.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to feel the skin with my free hand to know which areas need more shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for many years, so I am familiar with them.</li>
            <li> I hope they will be available in the future as this shaver is a very good product.</li>
            <li> The floating heads make getting all the spots on my face easy.  </li>
            <li> It is easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li> so this was an easy choice.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy for me to shave, because of my motor disability.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cord pulls out from the shaver sometimes, but it&#x27;s easy to hold it in place when shaving and stretching the cord all the way.</li>
            <li> Norelco is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> It gets the easy parts, but below th chin</li>
            <li> but the cord comes out too easily and has to be reconected while shaving.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Plugging into the outlet for a couple of minutes while shaving won&#x27;t hurt anything :) The finish is clean and neat, the grip is secure.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is also just fine.</li>
            <li> Lets hope Norelco continues to make this fine item.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric razors for about 40 years and they have always been fine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem at all, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Provides excellent shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li> it works fine.</li>
            <li> It should be fine at 220v,</li>
            <li> I would have preferred something more substantial, but this item for the price seems adequate though the shaves are not as close.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> This razor gave a great shave for over 6 months and a pretty good shave for another 6 months, but after a little more than a year the shave was no longer acceptable.  </li>
            <li> It trims my sideburns precisely.  </li>
            <li> low cost, great working shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased a corded shaver primarily for home use.</li>
            <li> I like that these are still available as I&#x27;d rather just plug it in and use it rather than plug it in to charge and then use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if they were still available, but searched Amazon and found the Philips Norelco 6423LC corded shaver.</li>
            <li> but I see that they are no longer available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Razor is a good value,  works OK, is light and quiet but a bit bulky for travel packing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and move around.</li>
            <li> Norelco deserves a lot of credit for designing, manufacturing, and selling such a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had rechargable shavers that were much more powerful.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and it shaves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li> Then the shaver works great the next day</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a more expensive razor, but this one does a great job at a great price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean too &amp; designed to fit in your hand securely while shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is amazingly quite and fast, and produces a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I chalk this up as a win for Amazon (they got my money) but shame on them for knowingly offering a definitely mis-represented product....</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This latest model is much quieter and shaves better.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a nice close shave even though it takes a few passes to make sure one gets a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> This Norelco is a very good shaving system and it is not just the electric razor method itself because I have tried other electric shavers along with this one and they did not in anyway compare to the results that I get from the Reflex</li>
            <li> so we bought 3 more for our older grand sons for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, extremely quiet, easy to clean, and gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> 1- Clean close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> and I still get a really comfortable clean shave</li>
            <li> Comfortable, clean shaven and a delight to use.  </li>
            <li> IF I wanted a really clean smooth shave I would use a razor...</li>
            <li> It performs even better than the cordless and was a great deal less money.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s is happy with this one and may be using it more often than his previous razor.</li>
            <li> This is a closer shave than my original battery version</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco products in the past and have been favorably impressed with their reliability and this one appears to continue that experience for me.    </li>
            <li> As long as he empties the hair between shaving his face and his head, it does a great job.</li>
            <li> My original norelco was made in Holland as was all Norelcos.</li>
            <li> Originally, it worked well.</li>
            <li> Definitely not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My face feels soft, smooth, and nice.</li>
            <li> I clean the cutters and heads with rubbing alcohol every 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> It gets close and clean.</li>
            <li> I just have to take it out of my car to clean it after 4 or 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> If I had to be clean shaven every work day, I would use a cream and razor on Monday morning, and then use this corded Norelco the rest of the work week.  </li>
            <li> yes you read that right 2006!</li>
            <li> This is a fine, quiet machine that does a great, fast job for me.  </li>
            <li> This three circular headed shaver takes much longer than my remington TCT2.I was looking for a better shaver or design.</li>
            <li> I really doubt fancier models can perform better.</li>
            <li> After using Remington Microscreen shavers for many years, I tried a Norelco 6423LC Reflux Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System and found it very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and used to have my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by around 3.</li>
            <li> For the moment it does a good enough job, even without a closeness control.</li>
            <li> Overall its a good value for this Philips discontinued razor.</li>
            <li> , cmon, how many times in your life have you really needed to shave without an electrical outlet within reach?</li>
            <li> Seemed to have good reviewsk,  I bought it and had it 2 days later.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good for a quick shave when you want too look decent and don&#x27;t have much time.</li>
            <li> Was happy to locate this razor for my husband; it&#x27;s like his old one that finally died and they don&#x27;t make them anymore, but luckily I was able to locate this one thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> A case would have been nice but, big deal, it&#x27;s fine the way it is.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the kicker: When it stopped working I dug out my prior shaver from 2003, charged it overnight with what I was certain were deceased batteries, and it worked GREAT (</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a good shaver for the price, but now that I know what you get if you pay a little more</li>
            <li> A word of note is that I have a light beard; don&#x27;t know how I would like it if had heavy beard, though have no reason to think I wouldn&#x27;t be happy with it.</li>
            <li> But, it functions very well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s taking more and more shave time to get the same shaving results.</li>
            <li> When my 7 year old Norelco rechargable (inherited frm my dad) died,I used my old Trac II for a while but wasn&#x27;t happy with my shave.</li>
            <li> This particular shaver can be found at Sears but the door-to-door free shipping saves a lot of gas!      </li>
            <li> It is light, quiet, and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> I Like the item very much but wish it had a traveling case to available</li>
            <li> It didnt sound powerful enough, but i must admit, it does give a close shave, pretty good for the money.</li>
            <li> This was my first cheap, corded version.  </li>
            <li> and I would up grade every time a new and better product came out.  </li>
            <li> The new one seems to be even better.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t even think about getting replacement blades, buy this one and you get a new motor and a much, much better shave.</li>
            <li> Never the less for the cost I for one am happy...</li>
            <li> I got this on sale for a pretty good price back in 2007.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I had tried a electric shaver!  </li>
            <li> This new one is light weight and quiet but don&#x27;t beleive it will last 10 years let alone 25, but it does and excellent job of</li>
            <li> fast shipping, cheap, works.</li>
            <li> real revelation was the sound.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting fast, close, comfortable shaves without worringing that a rechargeable battery will run out or eventually lose its ability to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I gave this razor as a gift and have been told how much they enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Cannot beleive how fast I received this with the free</li>
            <li> I still have a battery Braun for travel, but day-to-day this has been a well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> razor is much better than my old method, I&#x27;ll just say that.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, comfortable and quiet and gives a fairly close shave, although 5 O&#x27;clock shadow appears earlier than with a blade.</li>
            <li> The machine is powerful and reliable.</li>
            <li> But overall I&#x27;ve been happy with this shaver so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Norelco 6423 Reflex Plus corded electric razor for about 2 1/2 weeks now, and so far, I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy it.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot lighter than the cordless and shaves even better than the old one.</li>
            <li> it is still well worth its price.</li>
            <li> It gives me a good shave, is easy to clean and above all, it&#x27;s QUIET.  </li>
            <li> this one so far is much better in cut and construction.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> I have used an old Norelco 750 for many years.</li>
            <li> So far, with new blades, it is shaving pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco corded shaver arrived QUICKLY and was EXACTLY what I ordered for my husband.</li>
            <li> I found that this one gives me such a clean close shave that I am able to use the electric alone.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is not as great as I expected but does a decent job.</li>
            <li> It still has the original blades and they shave very closely.</li>
            <li> Other than that a good product.</li>
            <li> I gave this Norelco Corded shaver a try after reading the other good reviews.  </li>
            <li> He says it has been giving him a superior shave and working extremely well.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see the overwhelming # of positive reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> After all, this is a product most guys use everyday and you could easily come to regret your decision (like me!)</li>
            <li> Considering how high the price of razor blades has gotten this is a genuine bargain.</li>
            <li> However, the cost is so low that I will happily buy another every year, rather than pay far much more for a razor that MAY last longer.</li>
            <li> then it would be worthwhile buying the thing once a year instead of new replacement blades, which cost almost as much.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few passes to be 100% successful.</li>
            <li> my better half is very pleased, as I am up early in the day.</li>
            <li> Well, this fragile shaver is still going strong - of course, I&#x27;ve managed not to drop it!</li>
            <li> This basic model gives me as good a shave as any of them (and certainly a better one than other brands that I&#x27;ve used).  </li>
            <li> Have an older Norelco 550TL which is a much better shaver than this new one.  </li>
            <li> This electric razor works great, not as close as a standard razor but close enough.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it could shave better than the old model, but it really, really does.    </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin which the rotary blades are easy on - a non-rotary shaver leaves me raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> This corded razor shaves reasonably well, but takes longer and more effort than my old Quadra.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco, which still works by the way, is still running strong.</li>
            <li> Unlike its more costly predecessor, the primary difference is it requires a bit more finesse to avoid any snags or pulls, by consistently razoring against beard growth, a minor detail achieved easily enough with practice and routine.</li>
            <li> The 6423 is quiet, smooth, and light weight.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 6423LC a year ago to replace a 10-year old Braun which cost more than three times as much.  </li>
            <li> I was about to buy a replacement head but found I could buy the latest version for just a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> Spend your money wisely and get something a little better that may cost a little more.  </li>
            <li> pretty much the same quality shave, okay but not anything special.  </li>
            <li> is working fine - so far.</li>
            <li> In fact this new one just replaced my original.</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with it</li>
            <li> When I pulled this out of the packaging I first thought that it was a bit cheesey.  </li>
            <li> The rotary blades cut crisply and swiftly ...</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;After the first electric shaver, there is no other.\\</li>
            <li> The only reason I held off the 5th star: Force of habit and comfort zone for many years with manual razors, which still give the closest (and fastest) shave.</li>
            <li> For the price, the unit is OK--but it is somewhat underpowered, meaning it takes longer, and  a greater number of facial passes, to get a sufficiently close shave.</li>
            <li> It might seem like a lot of work, but you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s worthwhile, and it will help the heads last longer.   </li>
            <li> Used for exactly 3 weeks, but from day one it was pulling skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving system i bought.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.    </li>
            <li> I think next time I will just buy a slightly better model instead of this one.</li>
            <li> When you first turn it on, it sounds \\&quot;weak\\&quot; and the perception is \\&quot;where&#x27;s the power?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I considered several high-end models from leading brands, but I am glad I picked this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco deserves a lot of credit for designing, manufacturing, and selling such a great product.hanically efficient to have the blades moving in one direction the whole time compared to vibrating back and forth.</li>
            <li> Just used this razor for the first time.  </li>
            <li> but NOTHING like it did the first week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend getting the model slightly higher than this at $49.99, 7140</li>
            <li> When I first plugged in the shaver and turned it on</li>
            <li> The first electric shaver I ever owned was a Norelco.  </li>
            <li> but overall I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Too expensive originally $32.60!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks guys!  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of keeping the waste inside.</li>
            <li> I own this shaver and am currently in the market for a new one.  </li>
            <li> pay a little more for the cordless one, the cord is a pain and this model feels pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> This non-battery model has many advantages, including: relatively inexpensive, much lighter than battery models, more environmentally friendly without a battery, no battery to run down during use, and no battery to charge up before use.  </li>
            <li> This corded shaver gives that closeness I&#x27;m used to, but its motor is not as powerful as it used to be on my older models.</li>
            <li> It is much more mechanically efficient to have the blades moving in one direction the whole time compared to vibrating back and forth.</li>
            <li> Norelco has apparently discontinued this model along with all their corded-only shavers, so if you can find one as I did, you&#x27;re lucky!</li>
            <li> so I can get very close shave very fast by myself.</li>
            <li> After years of buying high end Norelco cordless shavers--most of which are now made in China--and rarely using them in cordless mode, I decided to try this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have been a wet and shaving cream shaver man since I was a teenager only using the best razors such as the Mach disposables blades</li>
            <li> In general, I have found that the fewer extra features in a shaver (like cordless operation), the better the shave!</li>
            <li> After replacing the blades, I was right back to being clean shaven in under five minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought my first electric razor, a cheap basic Remington 2-3 years ago, for out of town vacation trips convenience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly quieter than buzzing foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly quieter than buzzing foil shavers.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easy to use, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s not very powerful.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves more regularly since he has gotten this new shaver.  </li>
            <li> So you can see how surprised I am to find this year&#x27;s model is absolutely superior to previous models.  </li>
            <li> Whether the cord is too short naturally depends on the particular situation, but it was just right for mine, and I suspect it&#x27;s going to be fine for most cases where the outlet is next to the sink.  </li>
            <li> His last Norelco was purchased in 2000 and worked fine for all these 11 years.  </li>
            <li> Fine shave if you aren&#x27;t going out in public.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t need a cordless model, and the shave is fine without any fine-tuning.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent shaver for about $30.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver much and I realize, purely from a cost point of view</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li> This is especially important for the tough areas of the chin</li>
            <li> Like many others, I checked into the prices on new blades for my older Norelco, and found this one priced about the same.</li>
            <li> only problem is its corded, but its in the description and it is why it is cheap.</li>
            <li> Fortunately my neighbor had a similar electric razor and he showed me the way to do it.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the swivel head and quietness of the razor.</li>
            <li> Priced reasonable for the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t really affect my shaving much.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Norelco shaver!</li>
            <li> Lift and Cut blades gently pull whiskers into the cutter for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> This is a real help for those times when a mirror isn&#x27;t nearby.</li>
            <li> You could actually shave by the sound</li>
            <li> I have always shaved with a straight razor and then with an electric after that.</li>
            <li> However, I abanoned the Quadra because the battery was wearing out and the blades cost almost as much as this whole razor.  </li>
            <li> Everything about the razor and the transaction worked out very well</li>
            <li> It pulls hair and does not offer a smooth comfortable shave like more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a father&#x27;s day gift for my father, and he told me that he absolutely loves this product.  </li>
            <li> He said it  shaves very well</li>
            <li> since I don&#x27;t really need a cordless, I decided on this corded model.</li>
            <li> This razor provides a much closer shave, something I did not expect.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is powerful and so far does not \\&quot;pull/bite\\&quot; like the cordless one did.  </li>
            <li> shave twice a day, morning and evening...and its really necceary for me with this shaver.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve dropped some Braun shavers which were built straight up-and-down.)  </li>
            <li> slower,(but really isn&#x27;t) and</li>
            <li> and I like the corded model, because it is ready whenever I need to use it,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light in weight and quiet and just as powerful as my old razor.</li>
            <li> If this one lasts half as long I&#x27;ll be happy.  </li>
            <li> Serves me right to have purchased an item that is not sold directly by Amazon...</li>
            <li> He liked this shaving system because it is used on dry skin, which makes it easy to do everyday, a minute</li>
            <li> It has been a very pleasant surprise (from Remington), and I am not sure what the more expensive models do to justify the higher price tag.</li>
            <li> After the second shave, I found that the shave was very smooth, and the shaver is so flexible in it&#x27;s \\&quot;floating heads\\&quot; design that I barely felt as if I was shaving hair at all.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t give you a really clean shave, but with it at least you did shave, whereas if all you had was a blade you&#x27;d sometimes have to skip it and hope no one important notices!  </li>
            <li> This is my second electric shaver and it definitely performs better than my first one (a Remington rechargeable foil shaver).</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for more reliable shaver, I would suggest that you look for other Phillips models.</li>
            <li> The results are so much better than the other shaver that he had.</li>
            <li> ok, though it gives a close shave but due to sensitiveness of my skin</li>
            <li> He likes it and uses it more than any other shaver he has.</li>
            <li> but when I was trying to clean it today, it suddenly pop out all the parts</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Norelco is that it&#x27;s MUCH quieter than my old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> And each model proves to be kind of the same as the previous model...</li>
            <li> In order to allow greater pressure to be applied, I put some rubber o-rings on the shafts which drive the cutter heads to prevent the cutter heads from sinking down into the housing too much.  </li>
            <li> This latest version comes from China, with questionable implications as to quality and conditions of manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;  Extremely light and quiet, it feels more like a woman&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> The corded shaver is low priced but gives a more confortable and clean shave than my previous which was 3 times the cost.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it may not be suitable for men with heavy beards who are not accustomed to electric</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet, smooth, and so far very reliable.  </li>
            <li> I guess this is normal wear and tear, but it does seem that the shaver motor/heads are not spinning as fast as they were in Dec/Jan 2007.</li>
            <li> If today&#x27;s lower quality standards for small appliances don&#x27;t bother you, you may find this shaver perfectly acceptable but it is not built to last as long as its predecessors.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> This is my first time of using electric shavers, and from what I read that It will take some time until my skin get use to it and have a complete satasfiying shave, but when I use Norelco 6423LC</li>
            <li> sensitive, regular razor with shaving gel is far better.</li>
            <li> , I got a brand new Norelco razor!    </li>
            <li> I needed a new razor in a hurry and couldn&#x27;ts pend much as I had just finished my christmas shopping.</li>
            <li> The new one shaves like a dream and is much quieter to boot.</li>
            <li> Instead, it is like older versions, and is recommended to brush out the head housing once a week and to desassemble and brush/lubricate razor heads once every 2 months.</li>
            <li> It shaves close, quickly and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Norelco man from my first crop of peachfuzz to my current orchard of gray quills, so the first shave wasn&#x27;t a surprise for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had 10+ years of service from my older models.  </li>
            <li> The most recent cord-only Norelco (Chinese)</li>
            <li> If it continues to provide a decent shave until 2010 I&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
            <li> Although this particular one is not cordless, it is dual voltage.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more from a product that I paid a modest price for.  </li>
            <li> The floating head is truly a floating head,not just the blades like my older model.</li>
            <li> I do not shave in the shower nor find a line-cord problematical, and I do not see how a more expensive shaver could satisfy me more.  </li>
            <li> This being said I did not like electric razors or believed in them, nothing like a new clean sharp blade right?  </li>
            <li> The most success I had in the past was an old Norelco corded.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a receptacle by the mirror where you shave, I highly recommend this version over a battery operated version.  </li>
            <li> This new shaver is lighter than its 20 year old successor, and seems to shave somewhat, but not a whole lot, better.</li>
            <li> The razor is wisper quiet, cuts very close and just as quickly as my 10 year old Norelco that was made in Holland.</li>
            <li> Coiled cord could be a little longer, be sure your electric outlet is close to your mirror or you&#x27;ll need an extension cord.</li>
            <li> It irritated my skin but has gotten a little better.</li>
            <li> You just have to be a little more patience using this machine.</li>
            <li> Actually a little better.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old Norelco, this one is much much quieter.  </li>
            <li> (Again, who wants to wake your wife or girlfriend at an early hour?)    </li>
            <li> This one is much quieter than the old one.</li>
            <li> I probably could have gone a few more months on the old cutters, but a year seems reasonable.</li>
            <li> Even at their current price, it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a blade shaver but will use the electric when traveling or in a rush.</li>
            <li> This shaver is somewhat underpowered when plugged-in and used normally.  </li>
            <li> It feels like I use a normal shaver after I am done.  </li>
            <li> but just ok for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This, while the speedier, much more costly  Norelco (of which I can&#x27;t recall which specifically), was merely mindless, razing of the forest.</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on it sounded so quiet that I thought it couldn&#x27;t have much power</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to select because Norelco normally has only one such model.  </li>
            <li> Much to my delight, it has kept working like new far beyond my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the norelco shaver I can get a quick quality shave with both beard stubble or long whiskers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order a new razor right now because I can&#x27;t stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary.</li>
            <li> I continued using it for a month before I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> (hey, I&#x27;m retired and live in the mountains).  </li>
            <li> I could have bought a new foil/cutter head for my Braun for $25 or this rajor for $30.  </li>
            <li> I just bought and installed new cutters, and they made a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers here have been unhappy with the power, but I found it adequate and got a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Replacing the entire thing was less than $3.00 more than  replacing just the head, so I really have bought it again.</li>
            <li> I really ordered this item more or less for the shears on the back rather than the razors on the front.</li>
            <li> I see the price has gone up a few dollars over what I paid a few weeks ago, but still a great deal.</li>
            <li> It does not seem as fast on multiday growth as the non-rotary  shaver I used 40 years ago, but it seems as fast when used daily.  </li>
            <li> 2 yrs ago I bought a new one - the first Chinese made Norelco I ever had.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have arrived at a travel destination only to find that my battery powered razor had mysteriously \\&quot;turned on\\&quot; and run the entire time it was packed in my luggage.  </li>
            <li> I gather that a lot of guys aren&#x27;t aware of the importance of washing their face and applying shaving lotion such as Lectric Shave before shaving.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> trust me stick with your old mach 3 !</li>
            <li> This one is fine - less powerful than previous ones, but I don&#x27;t think that really matters.</li>
            <li> This was a first razor for a 14 year old boy, so we wanted basic and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> It is true that Norelco (and every other competitive company in the world) has been making things cheaper and cheaper (except houses and cars).</li>
            <li> Norelco/Philips would rather I buy a complete new shaver rather than offer replacement blades at an affordable price, say $5-$7 (versus $19-$24)which clearly defies logic or marketing sense...</li>
            <li> However my old 550TL operates at 220v as well, but still runs at nearly twice the speed of the new one.  </li>
            <li> Also this razor is very quiet, more quieter than previous models.  </li>
            <li> I was shopping for replacement cutters and combs for a Norelco Micro Action (formerly Lift &amp; Cut [formerly Rotatract]) shaver and noticed that for less than $10 more I could have a whole new  Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> even if I skip a day; the Braun really \\&quot;grabbed\\&quot; my beard after skipping a day, but the Norelco is much gentler; (3) the Norelco doesn&#x27;t seem to miss spots -- I would sometimes discover an embarrassingly long hair which the Braun had missed for a few days straight; no such problem with this unit; (4) the overall closeness and feel is every bit as good as the Braun, if not better; (5) the price was right.</li>
            <li> Will be interesting to see how it is after the blades dull a bit.  </li>
            <li> After my blades began to dull, I started using Magic Shave.</li>
            <li> easy to handle, could cut wiskers a little easier, must go over face a few times before it is clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I get a neat, clean shave in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> unit replaced a perhaps 8 or 10 year old Norelco razor that I hadn&#x27;t changed the blades on ever.   </li>
            <li> Plugging into the 110-120 mains may seem out-of-date, but this direct, full-power makes a difference.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is extremely quiet and shaves very close.</li>
            <li> Guess I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is naturally dependent on the condition of the cutter heads.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried a few friends&#x27; over the years, but none ever seemed to give a close nor comfortable shave).    </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband b/c of all the complaints about the really old shaver.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very lightweight and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> I think with the \\&quot;Patented Reflex Action Shaving System: automatically adjusts to every curve on your face for flexible, smoother shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with a carring case, but I just use my old one.</li>
            <li> , it will be far cheaper than buy the Mach 3s for a year.</li>
            <li> My hubby had to start using his old shaver again.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, and a very quiet motor.</li>
            <li> am 71 years old.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised at how close a shave I got with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> my old Norelco finaly died on me after 8 years just befor christmas.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it offers closer shave.</li>
            <li> for those not interested in \\&quot;cordless\\&quot; operation or big $$ signs, this is a fine product</li>
            <li> other than that its a pretty decent shaver</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s getting harder to find a plain corded razor ( I don&#x27;t care for the cordless models they aren&#x27;t powerful enough and they weigh more with the battery ).</li>
            <li> In any case, the new heads cost as much or more than I paid for this thing in the first place, which was just shy of $30.  </li>
            <li> Considering this shaver&#x27;s apparent fragility, if you ever drop it you&#x27;ll need a new one.</li>
            <li> 2- Convenient no mess shave.  </li>
            <li> I had some trouble   Learning how to clean it.  </li>
            <li> No matter, I will use the old cordless for travel and the new corded one for daily use at home.  </li>
            <li> One problem - the cord is not secure enough in the razor, so it pulls out too easily.</li>
            <li> Its amazingly small and light.</li>
            <li> Simply replacing the circular cutters was another option, but for a few dollars more I decided to buy the current model.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really cheap if it doesn&#x27;t stay sharp during the even the first few months of ownership!</li>
            <li> However, Norelco HQ55+ replacements have disappeared from local retailers shelves where I live, so I&#x27;d have to order a set from a national retailer if I wanted to do so.</li>
            <li> Had replaced the cutters perhaps 7 years ago, after obtaining the difficult to find replacements; that old shaver with the now old blades, is still a magnitude better than this new shaver.  </li>
            <li> My last cordless lasted only about 5 years when the battery and the whole motor died.  </li>
            <li> Gliding the cutters in several directions over the same area works very well.</li>
            <li> The motor is very quiet, and I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the bulk and quality feel of my old Norelco, but the shave quality is fine and the cost was much less than I had expected to pay.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this shaver is that it weighs half of the 10 year old rechargable Norelco 300SX</li>
            <li> What I do not know is if the newer model will serve as long as the older one and without even a cutter replacement in over eight years.  </li>
            <li> After a purchase gone bad at Target (might add returning the product was easy and full refund given), we were determined to find this shaver!  </li>
            <li> Use care when cleaning in getting everything lined up properly when putting the head back on the main unit of the shaver.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t press down too hard on your skin while shaving, and use your free hand to pull your skin tight while shaving your neck, as suggested in the accompanying booklet.    </li>
            <li> It takes me far too long to shave every morning, requiring multiple passes over the same areas before this anemic little machine finally clips most of the stubble away.</li>
            <li> Readers probably already know this, but, just to be clear, this is a basic, no-frills shaver.  </li>
            <li> This shaver cost the same price as replacement blades for my old shaver.</li>
            <li> After using it every day for a month,needless to say, I won&#x27;t need to pull my old one back out.</li>
            <li> This one is a giant leap over the old one.</li>
            <li> the cord&#x27;s female end does not fit on the prongs as securely as one would like, and occasionally detaches during shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is only a month or so old</li>
            <li> my old norelco cordless finally died after 8 years of use</li>
            <li> The heads appear to have had a design change, although they closely resemble my last unit (5 years old).  </li>
            <li> I was a 23 year old who&#x27;d only use manual razors before that time.</li>
            <li> The cord is a bit short but an extension cord fixed that.  </li>
            <li> I used for nearly 30 years before the electric motor finally gave up.  </li>
            <li> Every few months it pulls free from the shaver enough to remove  power, but not enough to fall off.</li>
            <li> It barely shaves at all.</li>
            <li> It nevertheless served its purpose, and just as effectively, has completed this task without fail ever since --though</li>
            <li> The 6423LC does hug the contour of the face better and is quieter, but the shave quality is quite poor.  </li>
            <li> As for the complaints about the cord being too short, it is just as long as the older shaver&#x27;s cord, but I must admit that the coil is a bit stiffer.  </li>
            <li> Big advantage as far as I am concerned is that it is corded so there is no expensive rechargeable battery that will die in a few years.</li>
            <li> This razor costs only a little more (on Amazon) than typical replacement blades cost.  </li>
            <li> The only positive my husband could say about it is the blades were sharp.  </li>
            <li> When I began using it, I noticed that it made less noise than my old older Norelco corded shaver</li>
            <li> Replacing an old razor of same model; features and quality remain the same and expect to keep it until it falls apart; prefer corded for the power it provides</li>
            <li> My beefs with my old cordless shavers have always been the weight and the lack of power, especially when the batteries are low.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is a far better shaver, and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t dump the Braun years ago.  </li>
            <li> I can now see a crop of pimples and a irreguar shaved small beard as a token from my first time use! &lt;</li>
            <li> (1/13) - Unfortunately I left the original shaver behind at an hotel and sorely missed it until I found a new, unused one on the internet.</li>
            <li> The cost of replacement blades is only about $5 less than the price of a new razor, so just buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Based on that, the 6423 is definitely not underpowered - it has just as much power as my other Norelcos.  </li>
            <li> Threw it out and used the long staright cord from my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> This corded version, however, was not expensive and will never have a dead battery.  </li>
            <li> When it takes too long to get close enough, or it just can&#x27;t get close enough, it&#x27;s time for new heads.    </li>
            <li> On top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash.  </li>
            <li> The razor is lighter and much quieter than my previous model.</li>
            <li> Older Norelcos were solid, well made and came with solid cases; this model has no case at all, making careful handling essential.</li>
            <li> Why does the motor sound so weak</li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;m using 2 shavers, different locations for convenience purposes, and will use this as a secondary shaver.    </li>
            <li> It was just a little more expensive to buy this new electric shaver than it was to replace the blades in my old shaver.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old, half broken Remington did a better job.</li>
            <li> Not having a battery that could fail was nice, but being tethered to the wall at the same time my wife wanted to blow dry her hair was pain.    </li>
            <li> It just doesnt get down as close as my older shaver which was also a norelco...</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well, it shaves reasonably close, does not irritate, and has a surprisingly quiet motor (compared to other Norelcos and Remingtons that I have owned in the past).</li>
            <li> Although highly impressed with the former swift cutting rechargable, my budget at the time limited any would be heir-apparent, to this corded model, which I initially recall after plugging in, seemed  surprisingly slow by comparisen.</li>
            <li> The price is not too bad and the quality is good.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It is value for your money and gives a better shave in less time with less mess.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for years, so when it was time to finally break down and buy a new shaver, I immediately looked to Norelco again.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it I thought it didn&#x27;t have the power to give me a close shave because the motor was so quiet compared to my old Norelco, but I was wrong and surprised.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day with (so far) satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li> It shaves my whiskers cleanly every morning, year after year, without irritating my leathery hide.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for long enough to carry it on a camping trip for a week.</li>
            <li> The Philips works almost perfectly, as long as you stretch your skin back (as it says in the directions)</li>
            <li> Now the question will be, will it last as long.</li>
            <li> and I have had this little tropper for about 4 years without replacing new blades for it</li>
            <li> After washing, allow enough time to dry thoroughly, and apply plenty of lotion (I use three applications, but you should experiment).  </li>
            <li> bought this simple model because it was the cheapest and expected it to last 18 months.</li>
            <li> Also, this shaver is much quieter and is less irritating to my sensitive skin than the old shaver.</li>
            <li> Part of the appeal was that it was, loosely, &#x27;Air Force blue&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I found several other models from this company that had lots of \\&quot;extras\\&quot; and were the rechargable type but for a basic electric razor that is corded...</li>
            <li> However, be wary of two things: 1) it will have a hard time with longer beard, so you may not want to let more than 24 hours pass between shaves; 2) if you have sensitive skin, think twice: it will irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased a 6423LC shaver about 5 years ago, after a single drop of a more expensive rechargable Norelco, abruptly sealed its fate.   </li>
            <li> Moreover, many times it pulls the hair into it instead of cutting, which a kinda hurts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that this relatively low price device can give a shave comparable to 4-blade wet razors.</li>
            <li> I just stretched it out a bit.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking afor a product that will give you a close shave, with minimal physical effort</li>
            <li> I am a long time Norelco shaver since December 24, 1972.</li>
            <li> It will take that long for your skin to adjust.</li>
            <li> Takes too long to shave with it</li>
            <li> So I plan to use this for as long as it continues to work.</li>
            <li> Norelco recommends every year; I can confirm that two years  is too long.</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised, but I think I could have spent the same by buying it at Target.  </li>
            <li> The wide range of voltage versatillity of 100-240v is a big advantage for travel in Europe.</li>
            <li> I have a medium thick beard, and its Reflux Plus heads deliver a shave nearly as close as the much more expensive Norelcos.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product like so many other guys do: When your last electric absolutely just dies, and you hate the time spent shaving with a blade in the morning.</li>
            <li> 3- less expensive than disposible blades yet with a better shave.  </li>
            <li> In less then 2 yrs (half the life of my prior shavers) the batteries crapped out completely and the shaver became a paperweight.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco 6423 recently, before a trip to Italy, due to its dual voltage.</li>
            <li> The area on the neck, below the chin, gets the worst shave, but even that area is acceptable and can be made better if you are willing to spend extra time.  </li>
            <li> A very minor inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shape of the heads made shaving my sideburns (along my ear) and under my nose difficult and I always had to clean up those areas with my Mach3.  </li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m having big trouble to putting it back.</li>
            <li> The new model runs very slow, so I assumed it was due to also being directly operable at 220volt.  </li>
            <li> The motor runs less than half speed at the lowest voltage and full speed at 220v, thus the shaving head is proportionally as slow also at 120 volts, thus requiring twice the time to shave.  </li>
            <li> Not powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> Why is only this entry level corded, while all the best models come with an inferior, outdated and short lived nickel cadmium battery that pollutes the environment when it stops charging and you have to throw it away, because it won&#x27;t work even with the cord when the stupid battery goes dead?!</li>
            <li> No batteries  to wear out, no charging circuits to fail and always full power.</li>
            <li> After shaving, wash twice to get rid of the lotion, wipe down your entire face (including ears) with astringent on a cotton pad (this can sting), and apply a moisturizer.       </li>
            <li> No complaints,  and the price has gone down a third since I bought it.</li>
            <li> (I just press down hard and \\&quot;squirm\\&quot; the shaver around without scraping it across to get really close).</li>
            <li> I never had a shaver last less than two years.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed as it was so quiet that I thought it was more a toy than a electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Blades shave a bit closer, but there is the mess and the occasional nicks.</li>
            <li> It is necessary to go over the same area a few times to get a close shave, but in my experience, that is typical.  </li>
            <li> spend a little extra.  </li>
            <li> This is a quiet shaver, with little buzz or vibration.</li>
            <li> And it irritates my skin less, except when my beard is several days long: the 6423LC lacks an adjustable closeness setting that would let you set it less close to avoid irritating your skin too much on those days.  </li>
            <li> My third Norelco rotary shaver finally gave out after 13 years, and I had a hard time finding a corded, battery-less equivalent.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that some who complained about bad shaves did not give the 21 day Day Trial and Conversion Process a fair break.  </li>
            <li> : Late last year I finally noticed the shave was   not as close as it had been, and it took longer.</li>
            <li> I expected this one to be a convenient one for my trip.</li>
            <li> Besides the expense and trouble of shaving this way, I just finally decided to give an electric razor a try.  </li>
            <li> He has a really heavy beard and only shaves 1x per week.  </li>
            <li> not much power.&lt;br /&gt;Bought for my dad did not like</li>
            <li> We purchased this shaver for roughly $35.00</li>
            <li> My nly advice is to empty the hair out between every shave.  </li>
            <li> That lasted a few years until I finally thought to give my Norelco another try and replace my blade heads.</li>
            <li> not a very close shave, but</li>
            <li> No, not really.</li>
            <li> Not much value there, is there?</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am thick haired and do not have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that the shave is terrible for my face, it is rather good, but I personally have a problem with the cord contacts wearing out due to stress on them</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the head&#x27;s mechanical configuration, but found that it definitely helps to shave the chin area, and follow facial contours in general.    </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold the shavings nearly as well as past models.</li>
            <li> The other shaver he had was rough on his skin.</li>
            <li> I have a older Remington rechargable (which is broken which is why I ordered this) that is faster.  </li>
            <li> I used a Remington reciprocating shaver a long time ago, and didn&#x27;t like it because it could shave too close, taking off a little skin.  </li>
            <li> No electric shaver will beat lather and a sharp blade but these come closest for me.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Better sharp teeth can improve it.</li>
            <li> Having used many electric shavers over the years, corded and rechargeable, I have been always disappointed with their performance</li>
            <li> Looks like I am going to have to shell out more money for a replacement.  :(</li>
            <li> When I first received it one month ago I was immediatly skeptical because it said Made in China.</li>
            <li> it replaced, due to it not having batteries inside.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer than other brands.</li>
            <li> The female plug is just too small for the hole in the razor and just falls off.  </li>
            <li> This shaver a does decent job cutting the hairs on my face, but it left my skin really dry.  </li>
            <li> I would recomed to other people if they would like to buy one.</li>
            <li> Wanted to spend no more than absolutely necessary (again, what guy does?).</li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t note in the other reviews:  </li>
            <li> After using Norelco Shaver for 10 years I decided to buy  an other shaver and it had to be Norelco again because of  </li>
            <li> There are definitely times during Wing Training Assemblies, given the duties I&#x27;m usually assigned, that that&#x27;s the case.  </li>
            <li> Everything rides on a set of pivoting platforms that bulge slightly at the center of the head assembly.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is a very minor one: the cord is so tightly wound, that is sometimes pulls out fo the body of the razor while I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> The main negative is that the shaver \\&quot;blades\\&quot; became dull in no time.</li>
            <li> Still, for $34.00 and free shipping it isn&#x27;t a bad buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Times may change but at least the quality of the shave has only improved.</li>
            <li> Some people might mistake the quiet running motor for a slow running one, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco for over 30 years and was surprised that the quality of the shave is so poor from previous shavers.</li>
            <li> He had other systems before but he always managed to lose the charger somewhere!</li>
            <li> shaver may slightly irritate your skin, but again I have yet to know of a shaving device that won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The previous Lift and Cut was like shaving with a Black &amp; Decker DustBuster.</li>
            <li> Lasted less than a week.</li>
            <li> It is less than half of the price of the cordless one by Norelco.</li>
            <li> then (from previous experience) I didn&#x27;t expect it from this Norelco design.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the direct power shaver to these annoying battery -charging models.</li>
            <li> and I can highly recommend the product and say that anyone that purchases this item will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted, the cord is tightly coiled and stiff.  </li>
            <li> and I am out the door and still get a close shave without all the mess and water.  </li>
            <li> As the shaver roters are not good, i use this unit only as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not nearly good enough benefit for what I paid.  </li>
            <li> The one snag is the cord is tightly coiled, and tends to unplug from the bottom of the shaver when you are using it.</li>
            <li> While the multi voltage shaver runs a little slower than the shaver it replaced, it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get used to</li>
            <li> We have found Norelco to be extremely reliable in the past</li>
            <li> it sounds like it&#x27;s a little under powered</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic rechargeable razor didn&#x27;t seem to be holding a charge for very long anymore, plus it was time to replace the foil and cutting heads again.  </li>
            <li> I have a very hard beard and can only shave twice a week with a Gillette Nitro to get a close shave since I have to let my beard grow a bit till I can shave.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard, and the cordless did not cleanly shave the beard on a day to day basis.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few passes to shave closely, and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well as others I have used.</li>
            <li> that it was not a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using it.</li>
            <li> One of the few corded rotary shavers I had found.  </li>
            <li> It gets close around my nose and mouth,and there is no irritated skin left behind.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Shave not smooth</li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard and wonder if it could handle someone who does</li>
            <li> I do hope these improvements do not disappear after a few months use.  </li>
            <li> It does it on my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Instead of the   recommended cleaning every two weeks, I just remove the head  every weekend and tap the head and body against the sink a few  times.     </li>
            <li> This thing was just plain painful to use, right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> This is annoying, and may likely worsen as the razor gets older.</li>
            <li> While usually I have stepped up the ladder in purchases, I was disappointed with the early obsolescence of my last  razor.  </li>
            <li> It is simple, with few features to go wrong.</li>
            <li> They usually lasted 3 to 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I suppose that my opinion would be different if I could afford an expensive Braun that boasts single-pass shaves.    </li>
            <li> When I travel, I roll my shaver in an article of clothing, usually a T-shirt, so the carrying case is no biggie.</li>
            <li> I have a small one for travel, so corded one for home use does not bother me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the sideburn feature does not work as well as the one on my last shaver, and the shaver did not come with a carrying case like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this item is now discontinued from Norelco or not</li>
            <li> had 3 rechargeable razors in the past 6 years which are now made in china and they were all fell apart and did not cut well.</li>
            <li> It works as well as any I have used in the past 40 or so years.</li>
            <li> The cord is small so the power outlet needs to be close to the mirror.</li>
            <li> My previous corded shaver was a 10-year-old basic Norelco on which I&#x27;d replaced the cutting heads probably three times.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have to press hard and it shaves close.  </li>
            <li> Since I never travel with it ( disposables  on trips), I had a hard time finding a corded model as replacement.</li>
            <li> I have a rough tough beard and this razor works for me!</li>
            <li> I can shave without a mirror and anywhere there is a electrical outlet and if I am running late for work in the morning I just hurry and plug it in and mow it over my face for about 30 seconds</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing shoddy or yesterday about this razor...</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco electric razor user for at least thirty years.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers claimed that the shaver pulls whiskers, but I didn&#x27;t experience this in the least.  </li>
            <li> Before ordering, I read some of the reports here at Amazon.com, including the negative ones.  </li>
            <li> Rotary heads reduce the vibration common to reciprocating shavers.</li>
            <li> at least  &lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t need to discard the razor six months after.</li>
            <li> If you have never used an electric,give it a try for at least a couple weeks before giving up.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy but I only like corded electric razors.</li>
            <li> Aw, it&#x27;s late.</li>
            <li> slow -</li>
            <li> What do I mean?  </li>
            <li> Every other shaver I&#x27;ve owned became useless and dangerous when a single hole appeared in the foil, but I don&#x27;t think that could happen with Norelco&#x27;s well engineered heads.</li>
            <li> that, in this winter, when my skin dried up makes it look even worse!</li>
            <li> Batteries fade over time making the cordless shavers produce bad shaves long before they wear out.</li>
            <li> Complaints that the motor is too weak?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had expensive norelco&#x27;s in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have a tough beard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very slow an under powered.  </li>
            <li> Push case bottom to apply a thin layer grease-less talc which helps whirring blades glide over skin.)</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any \\&quot;lift and pull\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I am tired of paying $20.00 for razors each week.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands,but was disappointed with the quality and performance.</li>
            <li> Also, if I skipped 2 days shaving so my beard was a little longer, it would pull the hairs really badly and hurt to shave with.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco base on the average of the reviews.</li>
            <li> It is a very weak razor and does not hold charge.  </li>
            <li> I always bought the expensive, cordless models.  </li>
            <li> The bulge allows the heads to maintain contact with the contours of difficult to shave spots like the concave hollows of the neck below the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only Remington shaver I ever used gave me a terrible shave</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s sad.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need a fancy, expensive razor that cleans itself or is rechargeable, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> No need to spend alot of money on an expensive razor.  </li>
            <li> This winter, I got tired of puting that cold-to-hot water on my face in the chilly mornings.  </li>
            <li> and it does a lousy job, not to mention all the pulling of hairs.  </li>
            <li> This razor was what I was looking for: not too expensive and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Takes about 2 weeks for beard and skin to adjust to the cutting closeness.</li>
            <li> The Remington still works, but is somewhat disappointing, and one of these days will get thrown away.</li>
            <li> This shaver has been a disappointment since day 1.  </li>
            <li> this thing stinks..  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, not realizing it was not a rechargable razor, but with that aside, it stinks.  </li>
            <li> It was impossible to find and purchase a norelco shaver that wasn&#x27;t rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on the day my beard would be impossible to shave closer with a gillette</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do a bad job though.</li>
            <li> Using cordless was a bad idea for my husband as he always forgot the charger in hotels when he traveled.</li>
            <li> I hate their rechargeable razors, though.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to find anywhere but Amazon!  </li>
            <li> Too bad Philips discontinued corded shavers!  </li>
            <li> This electric razor worked well for about two years, then the shaving head frame and the trimmer broke, so it has turned out to be a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this razor</li>
            <li> I have used electric razor for 15 years and this is the worst one...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers for over 40 years, this has to be the worst of them all!!</li>
            <li> Gee whiz, the prices for blades are outrageous!  </li>
            <li> This is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice product , gave as a gift</li>
            <li> My wife got me this razor at the store that she works at so we got a better price because of her employee discount as a Christmas gift.  I have been a wet and shaving cream shaver man since I was a teenager only using the best razors such as the Mach disposables blades and I would up grade every time a new and better product came out.  This being said I did not like electric razors or believed in them, nothing like a new clean sharp blade right?  Well as you fellows know you can not hurt the wife&#x27;s feelings especially when it comes to a christmas gift.  Enter the Phillips Norelco Reflex Plus 6423 LC. I plugged him in a gave it a try and I had was in a completely different world of shaving, I had a much better closer more comfortable shave than I have ever experienced before without the skin irritation and accidental nicks and cuts that come with top of the line blades.  I can shave without a mirror and anywhere there is a electrical outlet and if I am running late for work in the morning I just hurry and plug it in and mow it over my face for about 30 seconds and I am out the door and still get a close shave without all the mess and water.  Results with this razor are excellent.  1- Clean close comfortable shave.  2- Convenient no mess shave.  3- less expensive than disposible blades yet with a better shave.  In closing after almost 30 years of using disposable blades I will never go back to them and I have had this little tropper for about 4 years without replacing new blades for it and I still get a really comfortable clean shave I just give it a good cleaning once a month.  This Norelco is a very good shaving system and it is not just the electric razor method itself because I have tried other electric shavers along with this one and they did not in anyway compare to the results that I get from the Reflex Plus.  Bravo Norelco and thank you for a excellent product.    Mike</li>
            <li> Bought the shaver for my sister.  I&#x27;ve had the same shaver for years.  It does a great job.  It&#x27;s convenient since you don&#x27;t have to wait to recharge it.  It&#x27;s also light-weight and compact.</li>
            <li> Well!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This unit replaced a perhaps 8 or 10 year old Norelco razor that I hadn&#x27;t changed the blades on ever.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old Norelco, this one is much much quieter.  It&#x27;s almost silent.  The heads can pivot, as well as be \\&quot;pushed in\\&quot;.  After the second shave, I found that the shave was very smooth, and the shaver is so flexible in it&#x27;s \\&quot;floating heads\\&quot; design that I barely felt as if I was shaving hair at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing shoddy or yesterday about this razor...I will use this candy blue Norelco for years to come.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product, considering price/performance. &lt;br /&gt;Licht weight, and does the job.</li>
            <li> Having universal voltage is a plus.  This new shaver is lighter than its 20 year old successor, and seems to shave somewhat, but not a whole lot, better.</li>
            <li> While the multi voltage shaver runs a little slower than the shaver it replaced, it still gets the job done. The floating heads make getting all the spots on my face easy.  Use care when cleaning in getting everything lined up properly when putting the head back on the main unit of the shaver. Better than the Norelco it replaced and a value for the price.</li>
            <li> This three circular headed shaver takes much longer than my remington TCT2.I was looking for a better shaver or design.I guess the foil is the best design.</li>
            <li> This is my second electric shaver and it definitely performs better than my first one (a Remington rechargeable foil shaver). Shaving with this Norelco is thorough even in hard-to-reach areas. This is probably as close as electric shaving can get. Blades shave a bit closer, but there is the mess and the occasional nicks. &lt;br /&gt;This shaver may slightly irritate your skin, but again I have yet to know of a shaving device that won&#x27;t. Overall I am satisfied with it and I don&#x27;t plan to use blades again in the future. It&#x27;s also a  good value. I really doubt fancier models can perform better.</li>
            <li> pay a little more for the cordless one, the cord is a pain and this model feels pretty cheap. doesn&#x27;t do a bad job though.</li>
            <li> When I pulled this out of the packaging I first thought that it was a bit cheesey.  Very light and plasticy.  \\&quot;No way this thing was going to give me a good shave!\\&quot;  I tried it anyway.  Very light and nice feel.  This is a closer shave than my original battery version but I was looking for replacment blades for that anyway.  Overall it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> If you shave reguarly, once or even twice a day, this is a very good razor. However, be wary of two things: 1) it will have a hard time with longer beard, so you may not want to let more than 24 hours pass between shaves; 2) if you have sensitive skin, think twice: it will irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these don&#x27;t apply to you, it&#x27;s a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> Finally, power in an electric shaver. Plugging into the 110-120 mains may seem out-of-date, but this direct, full-power makes a difference. The rotary blades cut crisply and swiftly ... never pausing even on the toughfest beard. You can hear the blades sawing the hairs as if they were inside a lawnmower. I&#x27;m amazed that this relatively low price device can give a shave comparable to 4-blade wet razors. I still have a battery Braun for travel, but day-to-day this has been a well worth the price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Takes about 2 weeks for beard and skin to adjust to the cutting closeness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(I recommend also using Remington \\&quot;FaceSaver\\&quot; pre-shave powder stick.  This handy inexpensive cosmetic facilitates glide and skin smoothness. Found it at Walmart. Comes in a plastic stick container. Push case bottom to apply a thin layer grease-less talc which helps whirring blades glide over skin.)</li>
            <li> This shaver is very quiet. It takes a few passes to shave closely, and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well as others I have used. Big advantage as far as I am concerned is that it is corded so there is no expensive rechargeable battery that will die in a few years. No holder or case provided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for over fifty years and this is the best one yet! It&#x27;s light in weight and quiet and just as powerful as my old razor. Maybe it&#x27;s the floating heads that make it so good. When I first used it I thought it didn&#x27;t have the power to give me a close shave because the motor was so quiet compared to my old Norelco, but I was wrong and surprised. So I purchased another one.</li>
            <li> This electric razor works great, not as close as a standard razor but close enough.</li>
            <li> My husband used a similar Norelco for about 10 years until it gave out. The new one seems to be even better. Good value.</li>
            <li> This product is not like newer versions. It does not have a flip-up head and you can not rinse it out with water. Instead, it is like older versions, and is recommended to brush out the head housing once a week and to desassemble and brush/lubricate razor heads once every 2 months. It is a lift-and-cut razor that does the job. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for my father in law, but I ordered it just 5 days before my flight. When I worried about the in time dilivery, I just RECIEVED it! Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> fast shipping, cheap, works. only problem is its corded, but its in the description and it is why it is cheap.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Gives nice close shave. Nice design, easy to clean. So pleased that I ordered another one just for a backup.I have tried every brand out there and always come back to Norelco.They make the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver back in July, and it&#x27;s still ticking.  Relatively quiet, smooth, and so far very reliable.  If Amazon would lower their price just a bit (I paid $28 back then in what must have been a computer pricing glitch) then it would be worthwhile buying the thing once a year instead of new replacement blades, which cost almost as much.  Even at their current price, it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very well made. I actually bought this back in Decemeber 2006, yes you read that right 2006! and it&#x27;s still going strong.Of course the blades have been replaced, but it still runs great. Alot of products made these days don&#x27;t last 4 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> I love this Phillips razor because it is corded and you do not have to chsrge any batteries as you use it.  I had some trouble   Learning how to clean it.  Fortunately my neighbor had a similar electric razor and he showed me the way to do it.</li>
            <li> It shaves my whiskers cleanly every morning, year after year, without irritating my leathery hide. It trims my sideburns precisely.  It holds a charge for long enough to carry it on a camping trip for a week. It has never needed any maintenance aside from shaking out the DNA-rich stubble. It was a gift from my wife, not for a birthday but to replace a well-beloved Braun that got dropped once too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun was lighter and shaved a micro-bristle closer, but the model is no longer made. That&#x27;s why I give this Norelco only four stars. \\&quot;After the first electric shaver, there is no other.\\&quot; I have the same feeling about cameras and dogs.</li>
            <li> Was not what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li> I have been using manual razors all my life, and will (probably) continue as such. I bought my first electric razor, a cheap basic Remington 2-3 years ago, for out of town vacation trips convenience. The Remington still works, but is somewhat disappointing, and one of these days will get thrown away. I purchased the Norelco 6423 recently, before a trip to Italy, due to its dual voltage. What a difference compared to the Remington. The Norelco is extremely quiet and shaves very close. I am thick haired and do not have a sensitive skin. The Norelco does as great a job on the neck as on the face, and no irritation whatsoever. The trimmer is also just fine. It has been a very pleasant surprise (from Remington), and I am not sure what the more expensive models do to justify the higher price tag. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to try an electric shaver, and would purchase it again. The only reason I held off the 5th star: Force of habit and comfort zone for many years with manual razors, which still give the closest (and fastest) shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for your money! It is corded, so you don&#x27;t have to remember to plug it in every night to charge. My husband really likes the swivel head and quietness of the razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco base on the average of the reviews. They must have been written by people from Norelco. This shaver (I shouldn&#x27;t use the word shaver) is like a wind up toy. My stubble almost stopped the rotary blades. What a piece of garbage. I STONGLY do not recomend this product. Do yourself a favor and get a Remington foil shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers most of my life. No electric shaver will beat lather and a sharp blade but these come closest for me.Am satisfied with the product and the way the transaction was handled.hbw</li>
            <li> Guess I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.  I was hoping, since it is a corded model, that it would have a powerfull motor.  I have a older Remington rechargable (which is broken which is why I ordered this) that is faster.  So far, with new blades, it is shaving pretty good.  I have not experienced any \\&quot;lift and pull\\&quot;.  Will be interesting to see how it is after the blades dull a bit.  Could use a longer cord as well.  Still, for $34.00 and free shipping it isn&#x27;t a bad buy.</li>
            <li> It was an all in all good shaver, it doesn&#x27;t have the power like i thought it would, but it did good for the person I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Great product. Priced reasonable for the quality of the product.  Gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> For the price, the unit is OK--but it is somewhat underpowered, meaning it takes longer, and  a greater number of facial passes, to get a sufficiently close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor costs only a little more (on Amazon) than typical replacement blades cost.  I have been a Norelco electric razor user for at least thirty years.  I always bought the expensive, cordless models.  They usually lasted 3 to 4 years.  This was my first cheap, corded version.  I have a tough beard.  This razor gave a great shave for over 6 months and a pretty good shave for another 6 months, but after a little more than a year the shave was no longer acceptable.  However, the cost is so low that I will happily buy another every year, rather than pay far much more for a razor that MAY last longer.</li>
            <li> low cost, great working shaver. Works great</li>
            <li> for those not interested in \\&quot;cordless\\&quot; operation or big $$ signs, this is a fine product</li>
            <li> It is a very weak razor and does not hold charge.  I have used electric razor for 15 years and this is the worst one...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have arrived at a travel destination only to find that my battery powered razor had mysteriously \\&quot;turned on\\&quot; and run the entire time it was packed in my luggage.  So, I purchased this corded razor for travel and it shaves me perfectly.  It doesn&#x27;t have the bulk and quality feel of my old Norelco, but the shave quality is fine and the cost was much less than I had expected to pay.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Have been pleased with the shaver - works just fine for me.  Especially like the contour feature of floating heads. A word of note is that I have a light beard; don&#x27;t know how I would like it if had heavy beard, though have no reason to think I wouldn&#x27;t be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I expected this one to be a convenient one for my trip. however, since I have to connect it to a adapter every time I use it, it is not that convenient. it does not have internal battery.</li>
            <li> I used a Remington reciprocating shaver a long time ago, and didn&#x27;t like it because it could shave too close, taking off a little skin.  It also vibrated a lot and made a lot of noise.   Since then, I&#x27;ve been using Norelcos, so that&#x27;s my frame of reference.  I suppose that my opinion would be different if I could afford an expensive Braun that boasts single-pass shaves.    Based on that, the 6423 is definitely not underpowered - it has just as much power as my other Norelcos.  Whether the cord is too short naturally depends on the particular situation, but it was just right for mine, and I suspect it&#x27;s going to be fine for most cases where the outlet is next to the sink.  I was skeptical of the head&#x27;s mechanical configuration, but found that it definitely helps to shave the chin area, and follow facial contours in general.    Some reviewers claimed that the shaver pulls whiskers, but I didn&#x27;t experience this in the least.  It is necessary to go over the same area a few times to get a close shave, but in my experience, that is typical.  This is naturally dependent on the condition of the cutter heads.  When it takes too long to get close enough, or it just can&#x27;t get close enough, it&#x27;s time for new heads.    I gather that a lot of guys aren&#x27;t aware of the importance of washing their face and applying shaving lotion such as Lectric Shave before shaving.  It makes a big difference.  It might seem like a lot of work, but you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s worthwhile, and it will help the heads last longer.   After washing, allow enough time to dry thoroughly, and apply plenty of lotion (I use three applications, but you should experiment).  After shaving, wash twice to get rid of the lotion, wipe down your entire face (including ears) with astringent on a cotton pad (this can sting), and apply a moisturizer.       In order to allow greater pressure to be applied, I put some rubber o-rings on the shafts which drive the cutter heads to prevent the cutter heads from sinking down into the housing too much.  Use the smallest possible o-rings.  This allows me to apply more pressure (which becomes more important as the heads get duller), although it compromises the ability of the heads to swivel.  This is especially important for the tough areas of the chin (I just press down hard and \\&quot;squirm\\&quot; the shaver around without scraping it across to get really close).</li>
            <li> After shaving with blades for my entire life, it seems like suddenly they don&#x27;t last but one or two shaves anymore.  Besides the expense and trouble of shaving this way, I just finally decided to give an electric razor a try.  (I&#x27;ve tried a few friends&#x27; over the years, but none ever seemed to give a close nor comfortable shave).    I am amazed at this product.  I can only second everything Mr. Ekaitis has stated.  This product is amazingly quiet, and I get a closer, smoother shave than I have ever had in my life.  If you&#x27;re looking for a quality razor and a great price, get this razor.  It is awesome.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco 6423LC Reflex Plus Corded Shaver is an excellent shaver. It shaves close, quickly and is very quiet.  The cord could be longer since it is only 2 feet.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00009RB0X Philips Norelco 6423LC Reflex Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]  My third Norelco rotary shaver finally gave out after 13 years, and I had a hard time finding a corded, battery-less equivalent.  I&#x27;m happy I did.  This is a fine, quiet machine that does a great, fast job for me.  Before ordering, I read some of the reports here at Amazon.com, including the negative ones.  I suspect that some who complained about bad shaves did not give the 21 day Day Trial and Conversion Process a fair break.  As for the complaints about the cord being too short, it is just as long as the older shaver&#x27;s cord, but I must admit that the coil is a bit stiffer.  I just stretched it out a bit.  Complaints that the motor is too weak?  Baloney!</li>
            <li> I decided an electric razor would be the best route to go after I used up my final Gillette blade. It was a good choice. The Philips works almost perfectly, as long as you stretch your skin back (as it says in the directions) so that all hairs can be cut.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would have to complain about would be the flip-up blade used for side burns. It doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close as the regular head, but I decided just to use the regular head of the shaver on all parts of my face. But I just see the flip-up as an \\&quot;option,\\&quot; not a \\&quot;must,\\&quot; so it didn&#x27;t really affect my shaving much.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is much better than my old method, I&#x27;ll just say that.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco products in the past and have been favorably impressed with their reliability and this one appears to continue that experience for me.    Jerry</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband.  He is very satisfied with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My previous corded shaver was a 10-year-old basic Norelco on which I&#x27;d replaced the cutting heads probably three times.  It served me well until it bit the dust.  I wouldn&#x27;t have anything but a Norelco so I got this one from Amazon at a great price.  I didn&#x27;t think it could shave better than the old model, but it really, really does.    I can&#x27;t see the added cost of getting a rechargable model.  Corded works for me (and I suppose the vast majority of people.) I highly recommend this Norelco shaver!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 remington microscreen shavers and neither did the job that this norelco does. i like this design better, it conforms much better to the shape of my face and gives a smooth shave. Great deal and worth the thirty-some bucks I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I was shopping for replacement cutters and combs for a Norelco Micro Action (formerly Lift &amp; Cut [formerly Rotatract]) shaver and noticed that for less than $10 more I could have a whole new  Norelco shaver. I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco Reflex Plus shavers combine 4 features pioneered by Norelco and improved over time. Rotary heads reduce the vibration common to reciprocating shavers. Floating heads individually hug the skin. Lift and Cut blades gently pull whiskers into the cutter for a closer shave. Everything rides on a set of pivoting platforms that bulge slightly at the center of the head assembly.  The bulge allows the heads to maintain contact with the contours of difficult to shave spots like the concave hollows of the neck below the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Norelco man from my first crop of peachfuzz to my current orchard of gray quills, so the first shave wasn&#x27;t a surprise for my skin. It was as close and comfy as I&#x27;d expect from a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real revelation was the sound. The previous Lift and Cut was like shaving with a Black &amp; Decker DustBuster. The Reflex Plus is so quiet, you can actually hear the cutters slice off the whiskers and then fall silent on the next pass over the same area. This is a real help for those times when a mirror isn&#x27;t nearby. You could actually shave by the sound alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A somewhat poignant note: Models at the economy end of the Norelco line are now made in China and lack carrying bags of any kind. When I travel, I roll my shaver in an article of clothing, usually a T-shirt, so the carrying case is no biggie. Still, I miss seeing the words \\&quot;MADE IN HOLLAND\\&quot; on the bottom of every Norelco I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Times may change but at least the quality of the shave has only improved.</li>
            <li> After using Remington Microscreen shavers for many years, I tried a Norelco 6423LC Reflux Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System and found it very satisfactory.  It takes a little practice to get used to but now I get a good close shave, including under my nose.  I am very happy with it.  It is simple, with few features to go wrong.</li>
            <li> i bought this shaver after forgetting my own at a friends house while on a visit. i like this  one so much that i told my friend not to waste money shipping me  the forgotten one.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband b/c of all the complaints about the really old shaver.  He has a really heavy beard and only shaves 1x per week.  Also shaves his head.  He just loves it.  Doesn&#x27;t have to press hard and it shaves close.  As long as he empties the hair between shaving his face and his head, it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin which the rotary blades are easy on - a non-rotary shaver leaves me raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had several of these or similar model shavers over the years.  The cost of replacement blades is only about $5 less than the price of a new razor, so just buy a new one.</li>
            <li> This item performed just as advertised. I am very pleased with it. &lt;br /&gt;All went as indicated.</li>
            <li> not much power.&lt;br /&gt;Bought for my dad did not like that it was not a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a corded shaver primarily for home use. There was no need to obtain a more expensive rechargeable unit.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this shaver, and for the purpose it was acquired.</li>
            <li> Use it several times a day and keep well shaven all the time.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for many years, so I am familiar with them. This one is fine - less powerful than previous ones, but I don&#x27;t think that really matters. One problem - the cord is not secure enough in the razor, so it pulls out too easily. This is annoying, and may likely worsen as the razor gets older.</li>
            <li> Used for exactly 3 weeks, but from day one it was pulling skin. and till the last day it was doing same stuff. Had to return after three weeks</li>
            <li> Would prefer the cordless re-chargable. But does the work anyway.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving system i bought. Its amazingly small and light. There is a great trimmer as well for the side burns..  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Its a definite buy for the price and features. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I like that these are still available as I&#x27;d rather just plug it in and use it rather than plug it in to charge and then use it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking afor a product that will give you a close shave, with minimal physical effort then this is it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.  Very well made, works great.  An excellent piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.    The price is not too bad and the quality is good.  It is easily cleaned.  I have been using it about a year now.  No problem happens at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco products for 50 years.  As a child I was fascinated by the floating head technology showing Santa in the TV commercial sledding on the terrain in a floating razor. I have had 10+ years of service from my older models.  My last cordless lasted only about 5 years when the battery and the whole motor died.  While usually I have stepped up the ladder in purchases, I was disappointed with the early obsolescence of my last  razor.  Since I never travel with it ( disposables  on trips), I had a hard time finding a corded model as replacement. I would have preferred something more substantial, but this item for the price seems adequate though the shaves are not as close.  Investing $100+ in a better cordless model doesn&#x27;t seem a good value.  We&#x27;ll see if this model has any staying power.</li>
            <li> Notice that this is a \\&quot;corded\\&quot; shaver. I have it for about an year now but when I was trying to clean it today, it suddenly pop out all the parts and now I&#x27;m having big trouble to putting it back. I think next time I will just buy a slightly better model instead of this one. It is made in China and the build quality is just so so. For the price I think it&#x27;s a good buy but if you are looking for more reliable shaver, I would suggest that you look for other Phillips models.</li>
            <li> Norelco has a better motor than others razors.  &lt;br /&gt;Better sharp teeth can improve it. I dislike Norelco &lt;br /&gt;recomendation to replace them once a year, at least  &lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t need to discard the razor six months after.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and have sensitive skin. I am tired of paying $20.00 for razors each week. I bought this hoping it would do wonders on my face and head, it did. This thing is great!! If you shave your head you will need this.</li>
            <li> Having used many electric shavers over the years, corded and rechargeable, I have been always disappointed with their performance so I returned to using soap and blade. Since I have been had to take coumadin I have been reluctant to continue shaving with soap and razor so out of necessity I had to return to using an electric shaver. I tried a foil rechargeable, but returned it when it wouldn&#x27;t recharge. The most success I had in the past was an old Norelco corded. I didn&#x27;t know if they were still available, but searched Amazon and found the Philips Norelco 6423LC corded shaver.I ordered one and couldn&#x27;t be happier. This shaver gives me shaves that are closer than using soap and blade! I was going to order another but I see that they are no longer available at Amazon. I hope they will be available in the future as this shaver is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for years.  This basic model gives me as good a shave as any of them (and certainly a better one than other brands that I&#x27;ve used).  Some people might mistake the quiet running motor for a slow running one, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.  I&#x27;ve been getting fast, close, comfortable shaves without worringing that a rechargeable battery will run out or eventually lose its ability to hold a charge.  Considering how high the price of razor blades has gotten this is a genuine bargain.</li>
            <li> I have been a norelco customer for many years.  I have always shaved with a straight razor and then with an electric after that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once I purchased this razor I found that this one gives me such a clean close shave that I am able to use the electric alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I purchased this razor and I can highly recommend the product and say that anyone that purchases this item will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> One of the few corded rotary shavers I had found.  I did not want a rechargeable one; the battery does not last.</li>
            <li> This shaver cost the same price as replacement blades for my old shaver.</li>
            <li> Got two of these for my sons. They loved&#x27;em</li>
            <li> This was a first razor for a 14 year old boy, so we wanted basic and inexpensive.  We have found Norelco to be extremely reliable in the past so this was an easy choice.  The only big difference between this model and more expensive ones is that this can only be used with a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/2012. My son stopped using it years ago because it just doesn&#x27;t cut.  Not powerful enough.  We even replaced the head etc.  spend a little extra.  My husband has had his norelco for 1o years.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to find and purchase a norelco shaver that wasn&#x27;t rechargeable.  Norelco&#x27;s product you offered is perfect!</li>
            <li> I gave this razor as a gift and have been told how much they enjoy it. Thank you. I also got the package on time. They said that it&#x27;s much better than using disposable razors.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric shaver for light-duty shaves.  If you don&#x27;t feel like putting in the time for a blade-shave, this shaver is a good alternative.  I use it on weekends.  When you first turn it on, it sounds \\&quot;weak\\&quot; and the perception is \\&quot;where&#x27;s the power?\\&quot;  But, it functions very well and is easy to clean.  Overall, a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I was born with moderate athetoid cerebral palsy. I love it a million so I can get very close shave very fast by myself. It is so easy for me to shave, because of my motor disability. I am a long time Norelco shaver since December 24, 1972. I had many shavers were made in Holland. I have it now is made in China so well it is cheaper and it is the best one!</li>
            <li> Razor is a good value,  works OK, is light and quiet but a bit bulky for travel packing.</li>
            <li> The item I bought meet my expectations in regards to quality and delivery time. I&#x27;m very happy shaving myself with this machine.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap and simple design, yet it does its job great!  I considered several high-end models from leading brands, but I am glad I picked this one.  I have a small one for travel, so corded one for home use does not bother me.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with the purchase of this product.  Since it was priced so low, I had my doubts about the quality.  But, I am really satisfied after trying it.  Also it works in all voltages, so you can take it when you travel internationally.  It is not cordless, but I knew it and it does not bother me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for several weeks and used it about a dozen times. I&#x27;m normally a blade shaver but will use the electric when traveling or in a rush. I have not given the Norelco the recommended 3 week trial period (and probably never will). With that said, I think this razor was a good choice for my purpose. It&#x27;s light, comfortable and quiet and gives a fairly close shave, although 5 O&#x27;clock shadow appears earlier than with a blade. Coiled cord could be a little longer, be sure your electric outlet is close to your mirror or you&#x27;ll need an extension cord.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco&#x27;s for decades. Decades! Each battery/cord shaver had lasted several years of regular 5-day per week usage. 2 yrs ago I bought a new one - the first Chinese made Norelco I ever had. In less then 2 yrs (half the life of my prior shavers) the batteries crapped out completely and the shaver became a paperweight. Also, the rotary blades dulled faster then ever before. Here&#x27;s the kicker: When it stopped working I dug out my prior shaver from 2003, charged it overnight with what I was certain were deceased batteries, and it worked GREAT (both power and shave quality were fine)! I continued using it for a month before I ordered a new one. Wow! THAT shaver was made in Holland - not China. The Holland-made shavers ROCK! Norelco quality has gone south since they switched mfg from Holland to China. The only Remington shaver I ever used gave me a terrible shave so I insist on using Norelco. The most recent cord-only Norelco (Chinese) I bought in December 2007 is working fine - so far. If it continues to provide a decent shave until 2010 I&#x27;ll be amazed. I will never buy a battery-operated Norelco again!    Update 5/11/08: This corded shaver is still working but it&#x27;s taking more and more shave time to get the same shaving results. I guess this is normal wear and tear, but it does seem that the shaver motor/heads are not spinning as fast as they were in Dec/Jan 2007. Nevertheless, I still recommend the 6423LC over any battery-operated Norelco.</li>
            <li> Cannot beleive how fast I received this with the free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy with the product. Had a Norelco razor for 25 years, it was the best. This new one is light weight and quiet but don&#x27;t beleive it will last 10 years let alone 25, but it does and excellent job of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Price was low...I&#x27;m Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that the shave is terrible for my face, it is rather good, but I personally have a problem with the cord contacts wearing out due to stress on them (I have already gone through 2 different ones), and without the cord, this is just a paperweight.</li>
            <li> I like a 110 volt electric shaver better than the battery operated ones. The Norelco 6423LC fills this bill for me.</li>
            <li> This corded razor shaves reasonably well, but takes longer and more effort than my old Quadra. However, I abanoned the Quadra because the battery was wearing out and the blades cost almost as much as this whole razor.  I like the corded feature because there is no battery to wear out over time. Of course, the razor is lighter than the Quadra because there is no battery, and it tends to make a bit of a shrill sound from time to time.  Overall, though I like it and would likely buy another when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my husband&#x27;s last norelco.  His last Norelco was purchased in 2000 and worked fine for all these 11 years.  When I gave him this one he was impressed that the design was the same except for the collapsable contouring head part.  I told him to go into the bathroom and try it...well!  I heard it turn on and thought \\&quot;Geez!  Why does the motor sound so weak-it sounded like a dying battery!\\&quot; (And since there are no batteries in this we both were taken aback!)  The only positive my husband could say about it is the blades were sharp.  That&#x27;s sad.  Looks like I am going to have to shell out more money for a replacement.  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco shavers for over 40 years, this has to be the worst of them all!! I would never buy this shaver again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one for two years. It still has the original blades and they shave very closely. My face feels soft, smooth, and nice. It looks great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to take my time. It&#x27;s easy to feel the skin with my free hand to know which areas need more shaving. Gliding the cutters in several directions over the same area works very well. A good shave takes about 7 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s design is beautiful. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and move around. It&#x27;s a lot lighter than a rechargeable model so there&#x27;s no chance of it tiring my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tap out the stubble every 3 or 4 days. I disassemble the head and brush out the stubble every 2 weeks. I clean the cutters and heads with rubbing alcohol every 2 or 3 months. They show no signs of dulling. I bought replacement cutters a year ago, but haven&#x27;t had any reason to discard the originals. They still work well even if I let the stubble build up inside the shaver for 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip of another reviewer was good: Don&#x27;t use and wear out the power switch. Just leave it on and plug and unplug the cord. I followed the advice with no problems. The machine is powerful and reliable. The coiled cord is short, but stretches out with use. I use the shaver 4 feet from the outlet. The cord still coils up nicely when not in use and limits counter top cable clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord pulls out from the shaver sometimes, but it&#x27;s easy to hold it in place when shaving and stretching the cord all the way. A very minor inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this simple model because it was the cheapest and expected it to last 18 months. It was also the only corded shaver I could find. Much to my delight, it has kept working like new far beyond my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be a rotary shaver user for the rest of my life. Every other shaver I&#x27;ve owned became useless and dangerous when a single hole appeared in the foil, but I don&#x27;t think that could happen with Norelco&#x27;s well engineered heads. The metal is stronger and thicker than foils. It is much more mechanically efficient to have the blades moving in one direction the whole time compared to vibrating back and forth. It probably saves electricity too. It&#x27;s certainly quieter than buzzing foil shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco deserves a lot of credit for designing, manufacturing, and selling such a great product.hanically efficient to have the blades moving in one direction the whole time compared to vibrating back and forth.

            <li> The 6423LC shaves closer than my 10-year-old Norelco/Philishave, (also corded -- I find the cordless models have insufficient power) even when both have brand-new heads.  And it irritates my skin less, except when my beard is several days long: the 6423LC lacks an adjustable closeness setting that would let you set it less close to avoid irritating your skin too much on those days.  But for those of you who shave every day or two this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent electric shaver at a bargain price.  It is compact, lightweight and works well.  The only detraction is that there is no carrying case.</li>
            <li> A hunk of junk. Lasted less than a week.I never had a shaver last less than two years.Last norelco I would buy.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard beard and can only shave twice a week with a Gillette Nitro to get a close shave since I have to let my beard grow a bit till I can shave. I tried this product based on the reviews I saw and this is an excellent shaver. I tried it on the day my beard would be impossible to shave closer with a gillette and I got a wonderful smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my son for Christmas. He is very happy with the shave that he gets. It gets close and clean. The results are so much better than the other shaver that he had. The other shaver he had was rough on his skin. I would recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s AWESOME for the price.</li>
            <li> This shaver is somewhat underpowered when plugged-in and used normally.  Spend your money wisely and get something a little better that may cost a little more.  After all, this is a product most guys use everyday and you could easily come to regret your decision (like me!)</li>
            <li> When my 7 year old Norelco rechargable (inherited frm my dad) died,I used my old Trac II for a while but wasn&#x27;t happy with my shave. I decided to get another Norelco, but did not want to spend money on the more expensive models. I received the razor before the estimated date (even though I chose super-saver shipping), tried it and am very happy with it. It is true that Norelco (and every other competitive company in the world) has been making things cheaper and cheaper (except houses and cars). Some reviewers here have been unhappy with the power, but I found it adequate and got a smooth, comfortable shave. The razor is lighter and much quieter than my previous model. So far, so good. If it lasts for another 7 years, I will consider it a good investment.</li>
            <li> Everything about the razor and the transaction worked out very well</li>
            <li> Their \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; system is more like \\&quot;lift and rip out your hair\\&quot; system.   This thing was just plain painful to use, right out of the box.  It&#x27;s also very slow an under powered.  I&#x27;ve had rechargable shavers that were much more powerful.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for this price : providing quality shaving and very reliable too.</li>
            <li> I really ordered this item more or less for the shears on the back rather than the razors on the front. Good thing after all. It takes a few passes to be 100% successful. Never the less for the cost I for one am happy...</li>
            <li> Just used this razor for the first time.  Could not get a close shave out of it at all.  The trimmer will cut hair but not stubble.  On top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this razor but I guess I got what I paid for.  I&#x27;m going to order a new razor right now because I can&#x27;t stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary.</li>
            <li> Norelco makes the best electric shaver.Although this particular one is not cordless, it is dual voltage. You can use it any where in the world. It is less than half of the price of the cordless one by Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product and been using it almost since 2 months. It does&#x27;nt cut the hair closely. Moreover, many times it pulls the hair into it instead of cutting, which a kinda hurts. One good thing about it is the trimmer. As the shaver roters are not good, i use this unit only as a trimmer. I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more from a product that I paid a modest price for.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The Norelco corded shaver arrived QUICKLY and was EXACTLY what I ordered for my husband. He has been using this shaver for over a decade. The main negative is that the shaver \\&quot;blades\\&quot; became dull in no time. Sure it shaves fine but NOTHING like it did the first week. Don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s providing the rotary blade mechanism but it&#x27;s really cheap if it doesn&#x27;t stay sharp during the even the first few months of ownership!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my husband.  I have to be in the room next to the bathroom with both doors open to hear the motor.  It is very quiet.  My husband shaves more regularly since he has gotten this new shaver.  I am sure he likes it, since he never says anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco Electric Razor user for about fifteen years. In fact this new one just replaced my original. When I first received it one month ago I was immediatly skeptical because it said Made in China. My original norelco was made in Holland as was all Norelcos. After using it every day for a month,needless to say, I won&#x27;t need to pull my old one back out. I&#x27;m impressed with how comfortable and easily it takes off my whiskers. The floating head is truly a floating head,not just the blades like my older model. It gets close around my nose and mouth,and there is no irritated skin left behind. If you have never used an electric,give it a try for at least a couple weeks before giving up. It will take that long for your skin to adjust. Don&#x27;t bear down,but just let the razor do the work,and I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy the results. Norelco is easy on the skin. JB</li>
            <li> This shaver is very lightweight and fairly quiet. I chose a corded shaver because the rechargeable ones seem to wear out within two or three years. Unfortunately the sideburn feature does not work as well as the one on my last shaver, and the shaver did not come with a carrying case like it was supposed to. But overall I&#x27;ve been happy with this shaver so far. This is a pretty decent shaver for about $30.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  No need to ever worry about finding replacement batteries.  Just plug it in and shave.  Lets hope Norelco continues to make this fine item.  It was impossible to find anywhere but Amazon!  I&#x27;m buying another as a spare.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver for the money.  I have used battery shavers for years, but the non battery shaver gives you a quicker shaave since a plug in shaver has a better and faster motor, than a battery shaver.  The motor is very quiet, and I was very surprised. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think that you should consider buying this shaver that is a really good buy.</li>
            <li> I own this shaver and am currently in the market for a new one.  I was very surprised to see the overwhelming # of positive reviews for this product.  This shaver has been a disappointment since day 1.  It pulls hair and does not offer a smooth comfortable shave like more expensive models.  Save your $30 and invest it in a nicer shaver.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros:  &lt;br /&gt;Price &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;Corded &lt;br /&gt;Flimsy hinge &lt;br /&gt;Pulls hair &lt;br /&gt;Uncomfortable on neck area &lt;br /&gt;Shave not smooth &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> (1) Short,coiled cord is a a pain. Threw it out and used the long staright cord from my old Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(2) Fine shave if you aren&#x27;t going out in public. It gets the easy parts, but below th chin I might just as well not have shaved. Thank God I&#x27;m retired. This wouldn&#x27;t do if I had to make a business call.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I checked into the prices on new blades for my older Norelco, and found this one priced about the same. I see the price has gone up a few dollars over what I paid a few weeks ago, but still a great deal. This one is a giant leap over the old one. It&#x27;s smoother, quieter, and shaves closer. The one snag is the cord is tightly coiled, and tends to unplug from the bottom of the shaver when you are using it. However, don&#x27;t even think about getting replacement blades, buy this one and you get a new motor and a much, much better shave.</li>
            <li> I have had a number of Norelco shavers over the years,  to me the quality continues to worsen. this thing stinks..  I will not buy another Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> What a great deal !! I have had the cordless version of this razor for years. I bought this one because the cordless was wearing out. It performs even better than the cordless and was a great deal less money. I would definitely reccommend this razor to anyone. It has a design that works on the curves of your jawline and cuts/trims the hair, does not pull, pluck or yank the hair.</li>
            <li> Had the shaver for a couple of weeks now.     It is cheap and it shaves. Not the greatest, but gets me by work.    It irritated my skin but has gotten a little better. I&#x27;m just going to keep it instead of wasting my time sending it back. Luckily, I&#x27;m using 2 shavers, different locations for convenience purposes, and will use this as a secondary shaver.    I&#x27;d recommend getting the model slightly higher than this at $49.99, 7140 I think with the \\&quot;Patented Reflex Action Shaving System: automatically adjusts to every curve on your face for flexible, smoother shaving\\&quot;. This is for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I currently have the cordless model in the same type and brand.  I wanted a replacement but ordered the corded one.  No matter, I will use the old cordless for travel and the new corded one for daily use at home.  I like both models well enough to recommend them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Norelco 6423 Reflex Plus corded electric razor for about 2 1/2 weeks now, and so far, I&#x27;m glad I decided to buy it.    My old Panasonic rechargeable razor didn&#x27;t seem to be holding a charge for very long anymore, plus it was time to replace the foil and cutting heads again.  For about the same amount I would have spent to replace the worn parts on my old razor (not even including the cost of replacing the battery), I got a brand new Norelco razor!    The first thing I noticed about the Norelco is that it&#x27;s MUCH quieter than my old Panasonic.  My Panasonic sounded like a Dustbuster when it was on.  Another plus to the Norelco is that it does a much better job of shaving underneath my jaw line and on my neck.  I have not had any problem with the cord coming out of the razor while shaving.  It fits in there nice and snug.  I also have had no problem with the razor grabbing my skin.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t press down too hard on your skin while shaving, and use your free hand to pull your skin tight while shaving your neck, as suggested in the accompanying booklet.    If you don&#x27;t need a fancy, expensive razor that cleans itself or is rechargeable, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> After years of buying high end Norelco cordless shavers--most of which are now made in China--and rarely using them in cordless mode, I decided to try this shaver.  I have a medium thick beard, and its Reflux Plus heads deliver a shave nearly as close as the much more expensive Norelcos.  Manual cleaning on a weekly basis is sufficient, and simple to perform.      One quality issue:  the cord&#x27;s female end does not fit on the prongs as securely as one would like, and occasionally detaches during shaving.  Overall, however, this is a very good shaver and delivers very good value.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this shaver is that it weighs half of the 10 year old rechargable Norelco 300SX it replaced, due to it not having batteries inside. Also, this shaver is much quieter and is less irritating to my sensitive skin than the old shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a father&#x27;s day gift for my father, and he told me that he absolutely loves this product.  He said it  shaves very well and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The corded shaver is low priced but gives a more confortable and clean shave than my previous which was 3 times the cost. &lt;br /&gt;It is only a month or so old so things could change,but at this point I am very satisfied. &lt;br /&gt;Gordon Gerard</li>
            <li> I love this razor.......it&#x27;s getting harder to find a plain corded razor ( I don&#x27;t care for the cordless models they aren&#x27;t powerful enough and they weigh more with the battery ). &lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price, the quality or the power I highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> my old norelco cordless finally died after 8 years of use so I had to decide on a replacement. since I don&#x27;t really need a cordless, I decided on this corded model. it&#x27;s a lot lighter than the cordless and shaves even better than the old one. it sounds like it&#x27;s a little under powered but, it sure does the job. I have a full beard and used to have my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by around 3. This shaver is able to hold me till the evening. It doesn&#x27;t come with a carring case, but I just use my old one. Just as well.</li>
            <li> Ever think you need to shell out $$ to get the best electric shaver? Well, you can try this and find out like I did. I get a neat, clean shave in less than 2 minutes. The blades whizzes by without making much noise, especially important when you are just off the bed. The price is great. I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver much and I realize, purely from a cost point of view, it will be far cheaper than buy the Mach 3s for a year. The blades are recommended to be replaced every year; but we guys can push it a bit more, I am sure :). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is not a wet/dry shaver. Frankly, I haven&#x27;t felt a need for it. It doesn&#x27;t have a rechargeable battery, but so what? Plugging into the outlet for a couple of minutes while shaving won&#x27;t hurt anything :) The finish is clean and neat, the grip is secure. If you are still used to feel that foam on the face, take a break and give this a try.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is value for your money and gives a better shave in less time with less mess. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been using the 6423LC shaver only a couple of weeks.  When I began using it, I noticed that it made less noise than my old older Norelco corded shaver (3405LC ?).  That concerned me because I wondered if the newer one would shave as well.  It does! I had my older one for more than eight years, and it was still giving me good shaves until I discarded it.  Simply replacing the circular cutters was another option, but for a few dollars more I decided to buy the current model.  I do not shave in the shower nor find a line-cord problematical, and I do not see how a more expensive shaver could satisfy me more.  What I do not know is if the newer model will serve as long as the older one and without even a cutter replacement in over eight years.  Time will tell!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I had tried a electric shaver!  &lt;br /&gt;And trust me stick with your old mach 3 ! I can now see a crop of pimples and a irreguar shaved small beard as a token from my first time use! &lt;br /&gt;And that, in this winter, when my skin dried up makes it look even worse!</li>
            <li> a good shave at a reansonable price &lt;br /&gt;    corded i wouldnt buy it if it wasnt corded &lt;br /&gt;however its too short  needs a longer cord</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, not realizing it was not a rechargable razor, but with that aside, it stinks.  Has barely enough power to operate.  Love the brand but not this razor.  My hubby had to start using his old shaver again.  Merry christmas.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item as a gift for my husband. He hates shaving so he puts it off for a week before he shaves again. He liked this shaving system because it is used on dry skin, which makes it easy to do everyday, a minute and he is done. It shaves closer than other brands. Plus, because it is corded, it is always at the same power. He had other systems before but he always managed to lose the charger somewhere!</li>
            <li> Perfect Christmas gift! In spite of the December rush the shaver arrived in plenty of time for the holidays. My husband is thrilled with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy but I only like corded electric razors. Batteries fade over time making the cordless shavers produce bad shaves long before they wear out. This one is great. It&#x27;s light. It travels well. It shaves well. And it feels like it&#x27;ll last me 5 or 10 years.</li>
            <li> This is a quiet shaver, with little buzz or vibration. It&#x27;s light and easy to use, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s not very powerful. It takes me far too long to shave every morning, requiring multiple passes over the same areas before this anemic little machine finally clips most of the stubble away. My 5 year old, half broken Remington did a better job.</li>
            <li> Norelco 6423LC Reflex Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System  Very nice shaver. My husband liked it but has passed away now. I gave it to my son and he likes it also.</li>
            <li> My husband is okay with it.  The price is good, and shaves close, but he has had better.  This would be a good travel razor to keep in the suitcase.</li>
            <li> This product is a very good buy and it works great.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had this unit for about 6 months and it broke on me.  If it hadn&#x27;t broke, I&#x27;ll give if 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Although this razor is not cordless and has no car adapter (to my knowledge) it is still well worth its price. I just placed a 12volt-120volt converter in my car outlet and I can use this on the road almost as if it were cordless. Seems to do a nice close shave even though it takes a few passes to make sure one gets a good clean shave. I just have to take it out of my car to clean it after 4 or 5 shaves. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> When my husband&#x27;s current shaver lost its ability to shave, we decided to try and purchase the blade replacements!  Gee whiz, the prices for blades are outrageous!  Eventually, we decided just to purchase another shaver!  What a mistake!  Today, all shaver&#x27;s are cordless and work using battery charge!  This was a \\&quot;no-no\\&quot; for my husband who wanted a corded shaver!      After a purchase gone bad at Target (might add returning the product was easy and full refund given), we were determined to find this shaver!  Thank goodness for Amazon who came to our rescue!  We purchased this shaver for roughly $35.00 and it arrived within record time!  This particular shaver can be found at Sears but the door-to-door free shipping saves a lot of gas!      Way to go Amazon!    God Bless,    April Rose &amp; Mike :)</li>
            <li> When I first plugged in the shaver and turned it on I was disappointed as it was so quiet that I thought it was more a toy than a electric shaver.  Boy was I wrong.  Comfortable, clean shaven and a delight to use.  I do not have a heavy beard and wonder if it could handle someone who does but I think it is my best Norelco and I have been using them since they only had two heads back in the middle 50s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric razors for about 40 years and they have always been fine. This electric razor worked well for about two years, then the shaving head frame and the trimmer broke, so it has turned out to be a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00009RB0X Philips Norelco 6423LC Reflex Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]Received shaver as a christmas present. Am using it now and it shaves are excellent. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the Norelco corded shaver for years.  It&#x27;s easy to select because Norelco normally has only one such model.  And each model proves to be kind of the same as the previous model...pretty much the same quality shave, okay but not anything special.  So you can see how surprised I am to find this year&#x27;s model is absolutely superior to previous models.  The heads appear to have had a design change, although they closely resemble my last unit (5 years old).  The difference is in the shave! This razor provides a much closer shave, something I did not expect.  Also this razor is very quiet, more quieter than previous models.  I do hope these improvements do not disappear after a few months use.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> The razor is just \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.  It seems to lack power.  My old Norelco, which still works by the way, is still running strong.</li>
            <li> I agree with a prior reviewer, It won&#x27;t keep running unless you cement the plug to the razor with silicon rubber.  The female plug is just too small for the hole in the razor and just falls off.  The coiled wire provided is too short.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver for 2 years and it was inexpensive and reliable.  Not having a battery that could fail was nice, but being tethered to the wall at the same time my wife wanted to blow dry her hair was pain.    This shaver a does decent job cutting the hairs on my face, but it left my skin really dry.  Also, if I skipped 2 days shaving so my beard was a little longer, it would pull the hairs really badly and hurt to shave with. The shape of the heads made shaving my sideburns (along my ear) and under my nose difficult and I always had to clean up those areas with my Mach3.  Last, it left lots of hairs on my neck that had to be cleaned up (like almost all electric shavers).    I recently bought a Braun 8975 foil shaver to replace my Norelco and could not be happier.  I always thought Norelco&#x27;s Lift and Cut technology gave the closest shave of all the electric shavers, but I found that not to be the case.  Additionally, I found that the foil shaver doesn&#x27;t pull on my beard when I skip a couple days.    All in all, this is a good shaver for the price, but now that I know what you get if you pay a little more, I think you are better off to save your money and buy a better electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had good results with this shaver. &lt;br /&gt; I would recomed to other people if they would like to buy one.</li>
            <li> Norelco has always given the closest shave of the electrics. This corded shaver gives that closeness I&#x27;m used to, but its motor is not as powerful as it used to be on my older models. I hate their rechargeable razors, though. Is there anybody in America who doesn&#x27;t have an outlet in their bathroom? Should shaving while driving be encouraged?  Why is only this entry level corded, while all the best models come with an inferior, outdated and short lived nickel cadmium battery that pollutes the environment when it stops charging and you have to throw it away, because it won&#x27;t work even with the cord when the stupid battery goes dead?! Aw, it&#x27;s late. Maybe I&#x27;m just cranky.</li>
            <li> It didnt sound powerful enough, but i must admit, it does give a close shave, pretty good for the money.</li>
            <li> The shaver was very good.  It gives a very close shave.  Not only do I shave my face but I also shave my head.  It feels like I use a normal shaver after I am done.  My nly advice is to empty the hair out between every shave.  It seems to give a better shave this way</li>
            <li> My husband received this as a gift.  He traded it for a waterproof model.  Too time consuming he said.  Other than that a good product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my nephew. He picked it out and Amazon had the best price. Wonderful value!</li>
            <li> Great razor at a great price.  No need to spend alot of money on an expensive razor.  This one works great.</li>
            <li> I have always used shaving cream and razor to shave.  This winter, I got tired of puting that cold-to-hot water on my face in the chilly mornings.  I decided to buy a cordless-shaver.  I have a heavy beard, and the cordless did not cleanly shave the beard on a day to day basis.  I had to use cream and razor after each attempt.  I gave this Norelco Corded shaver a try after reading the other good reviews.  I am also satisfied with the results of this purchase.  This shaver is powerful and so far does not \\&quot;pull/bite\\&quot; like the cordless one did.  This one will NOT shave my beard if I do not shave for over four days (hey, I&#x27;m retired and live in the mountains).  I have to use razor and cream.  Then the shaver works great the next day and so on.  If I had to be clean shaven every work day, I would use a cream and razor on Monday morning, and then use this corded Norelco the rest of the work week.  It does it on my heavy beard.  I recommend it, using it in this way.</li>
            <li> The first electric shaver I ever owned was a Norelco.  Over the years I&#x27;ve had several different brands including later model Norelcos.  This present model is about the best one ever.  It gives me a good shave, is easy to clean and above all, it&#x27;s QUIET.  It is also shaped to fit the hand, very easy to hold.  A case would have been nice but, big deal, it&#x27;s fine the way it is.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product like so many other guys do: When your last electric absolutely just dies, and you hate the time spent shaving with a blade in the morning. Wanted to spend no more than absolutely necessary (again, what guy does?). I was very pleasantly surprised. Very close shave, and a very quiet motor. (Again, who wants to wake your wife or girlfriend at an early hour?)    For the money, this is a great buy. My only complaint is a very minor one: the cord is so tightly wound, that is sometimes pulls out fo the body of the razor while I&#x27;m shaving. Like I said, a VERY minor issue, and I think this is the best razor you can buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington and Norelco rotary razors for over 30 years.  They always seem to do an acceptable job.  More importantly, they do not pinch, as I found non-rotary razors were more prone to do.  This non-battery model has many advantages, including: relatively inexpensive, much lighter than battery models, more environmentally friendly without a battery, no battery to run down during use, and no battery to charge up before use.  The area on the neck, below the chin, gets the worst shave, but even that area is acceptable and can be made better if you are willing to spend extra time.  One thing I didn&#x27;t note in the other reviews:  It has an awesome trimmer, providing a very good cut without pulling.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a more expensive razor, but this one does a great job at a great price.  My last Norelco lasted 20 years.</li>
            <li> I got this for my father for Christmas. He had requested a Norelco with a power cord, but no battery. He says it has been giving him a superior shave and working extremely well.</li>
            <li> best buy on market.  I&#x27;ve had expensive norelco&#x27;s in the past.  This ones all you need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for over 30 years. This latest version comes from China, with questionable implications as to quality and conditions of manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;  Extremely light and quiet, it feels more like a woman&#x27;s shaver. Therefore, it may not be suitable for men with heavy beards who are not accustomed to electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;  Older Norelcos were solid, well made and came with solid cases; this model has no case at all, making careful handling essential. Considering this shaver&#x27;s apparent fragility, if you ever drop it you&#x27;ll need a new one. Norelco switches have always been erratic, so leave the switch turned on and unplug the shaver to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;  For the moment it does a good enough job, even without a closeness control. Its best feature is a full-sized trimmer, which works well.&lt;br /&gt;  If today&#x27;s lower quality standards for small appliances don&#x27;t bother you, you may find this shaver perfectly acceptable but it is not built to last as long as its predecessors.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (11/07) - Well, this fragile shaver is still going strong - of course, I&#x27;ve managed not to drop it! No complaints,  and the price has gone down a third since I bought it. Definitely the best shaver one can get at this price.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (1/13) - Unfortunately I left the original shaver behind at an hotel and sorely missed it until I found a new, unused one on the internet. Norelco has apparently discontinued this model along with all their corded-only shavers, so if you can find one as I did, you&#x27;re lucky!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers all my life, always been satisfied until this one.  This is a piece of junk.  Takes too long to shave with it and it does a lousy job, not to mention all the pulling of hairs.  Seems drastically underpowered.</li>
            <li> I no longer need to worry about damaging the battery; shortening its life. The battery operated Norelco I had (prior to this corded version) died in about a year.  Not nearly good enough benefit for what I paid.  This corded version, however, was not expensive and will never have a dead battery.  If you&#x27;ve got a receptacle by the mirror where you shave, I highly recommend this version over a battery operated version.  And I get an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Works fast, Surprising quite, Would be easier to use with a 12\\&quot; longer cord. For the price, it&#x27;s a very good buy.</li>
            <li> This is my first time of using electric shavers, and from what I read that It will take some time until my skin get use to it and have a complete satasfiying shave, but when I use Norelco 6423LC it was really great I got my chin shaved from the first use without having any irritaion or else, and I had a wonderful complete shave. &lt;br /&gt;I bought a Braun from WalMart, but it wasn&#x27;t that good even that it didn&#x27;t shave anything. I return it in the same day... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Really, this shaver is the best ever, no need to charge or recharge, use it for like 5 minute and you will have a full neat shave. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> THIS IS A CORDED SHAVER . I made the mistake of assuming that all shavers come with a Battery . other than that its a pretty decent shaver</li>
            <li> IF I wanted a really clean smooth shave I would use a razor...but this shaver is ok...but just ok for everyday use. &lt;br /&gt;I shave twice a day, morning and evening...and its really necceary for me with this shaver. It just doesnt get down as close as my older shaver which was also a norelco...but overall I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Norelco/Philips would rather I buy a complete new shaver rather than offer replacement blades at an affordable price, say $5-$7 (versus $19-$24)which clearly defies logic or marketing sense...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am 71 years old. I have been shaving with a Norelco razor since I was 17 &lt;br /&gt;an this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. I am totally satisfied. \\&quot;Vive Norelco!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco electric shaver for 30 years now. I love how easy they are to use and how they don&#x27;t cut up your face.  This latest model is much quieter and shaves better. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold the shavings nearly as well as past models. They tend to fall out on the counter which then needs to be wiped up.</li>
            <li> This is my best electric shaver ever!  (And I&#x27;ve been shaving for 48 years!)  The motor purrs like a kittten &amp; leaves my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind, without tearing or roughness &amp; with a minimum of effort.  No pre-shave lotion required.  It&#x27;s easy to clean too &amp; designed to fit in your hand securely while shaving.  (I&#x27;ve dropped some Braun shavers which were built straight up-and-down.)  In general, I have found that the fewer extra features in a shaver (like cordless operation), the better the shave!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor around this time in 2007. Originally, it worked well. I was actually surprised at how close a shave I got with an electric razor. I was a 23 year old who&#x27;d only use manual razors before that time. After my blades began to dull, I started using Magic Shave. That lasted a few years until I finally thought to give my Norelco another try and replace my blade heads. After replacing the blades, I was right back to being clean shaven in under five minutes. So I plan to use this for as long as it continues to work.</li>
            <li> Too expensive originally $32.60!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I Like the item very much but wish it had a traveling case to available and it was included.</li>
            <li> My husband says it is a very good shaver but the cord comes out too easily and has to be reconected while shaving.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional shaver.  It is not rechargable but that was not a factor in choosing it.  It&#x27;s very quite and does a wonderful job.  I&#x27;m not sure if this item is now discontinued from Norelco or not but I hope not because it is one of their best models and designs.  I found several other models from this company that had lots of \\&quot;extras\\&quot; and were the rechargable type but for a basic electric razor that is corded...this the one!!!</li>
            <li> Its slower,lighter and more quieter, but gets the job done. You just have to be a little more patience using this machine. I find using electric-shave (pre-shave)  helps the cutters cut closer on my face. Overall its a good value for this Philips discontinued razor.</li>
            <li> I liked that it was a corded razor.  It seams to have more power than the rechargeable ones on the market.</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco 6423LC Reflex Plus Corded Men&#x27;s Shaving System is the BEST shaver I have ever owned. I have a rough tough beard and this razor works for me!</li>
            <li> I purchased a 6423LC shaver about 5 years ago, after a single drop of a more expensive rechargable Norelco, abruptly sealed its fate.   Although highly impressed with the former swift cutting rechargable, my budget at the time limited any would be heir-apparent, to this corded model, which I initially recall after plugging in, seemed  surprisingly slow by comparisen. It nevertheless served its purpose, and just as effectively, has completed this task without fail ever since --though it should be noted, I have yet to drop this one.     Upon reflection, the 6423LC is an outstanding value, that performs admirably, and diligently.   Unlike its more costly predecessor, the primary difference is it requires a bit more finesse to avoid any snags or pulls, by consistently razoring against beard growth, a minor detail achieved easily enough with practice and routine. This, while the speedier, much more costly  Norelco (of which I can&#x27;t recall which specifically), was merely mindless, razing of the forest.</li>
            <li> had 3 rechargeable razors in the past 6 years which are now made in china and they were all fell apart and did not cut well. this one so far is much better in cut and construction.</li>
            <li> Replacing an old razor of same model; features and quality remain the same and expect to keep it until it falls apart; prefer corded for the power it provides</li>
            <li> My beefs with my old cordless shavers have always been the weight and the lack of power, especially when the batteries are low. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a lightweight and powerful shaver at an excellent price! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plus, cmon, how many times in your life have you really needed to shave without an electrical outlet within reach?</li>
            <li> Delivers basically what it promises - shaves a face (some razors don&#x27;t deliver on their promises). &lt;br /&gt;Good points:  &lt;br /&gt;[1] good price; &lt;br /&gt;[2] no battery to have to keep charging. &lt;br /&gt;Bad points:  &lt;br /&gt;[1] slow - I anticipated faster-revolving cutters, but it gets there if you keep at it; &lt;br /&gt;[2] not a very close shave, but then (from previous experience) I didn&#x27;t expect it from this Norelco design.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco shaver with batteries in the &#x27;80 that worked very good and when traving it did its job. Now I do not need a battery power shaver and so I ordered this unit. I do not know where the motor came from but it is so under powered that it can not do the job. The best place for this unit maybe that it can be used on a fishing line. &lt;br /&gt;MG</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years. This latest model does a good job shaving and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I could have bought a new foil/cutter head for my Braun for $25 or this rajor for $30.  It is a good buy for the money.  It is light, quiet, and does a nice job.  The cord is a bit short but an extension cord fixed that.  I don&#x27;t understand the rush to make everything cordless.  I like a corded shaver.  No batteries  to wear out, no charging circuits to fail and always full power.</li>
            <li> easy to handle, could cut wiskers a little easier, must go over face a few times before it is clean shaven.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little shaver for the money.  I do not need a fancy rechargeable more expensive razor.  This one shaves almost as good as the model HP1602 I used for nearly 30 years before the electric motor finally gave up.  If this one lasts half as long I&#x27;ll be happy.  I&#x27;ll stick with Norelco.</li>
            <li> my old Norelco finaly died on me after 8 years just befor christmas. I needed a new razor in a hurry and couldn&#x27;ts pend much as I had just finished my christmas shopping. Well I came across this Norelco here on amazon. Seemed to have good reviewsk,  I bought it and had it 2 days later. I haven&#x27;t had a problem at all, it works just fine. I&#x27;ve been an electric razor user for years so didn&#x27;t need to adjust to anything. This one is much quieter than the old one. If you&#x27;re looking for a low priced electric, don&#x27;t hesitate to put this one in your shopping cart.</li>
            <li> and buy this inexpensive Norelco -- if you like Norelco shavers.  It works as well as any I have used in the past 40 or so years. Bonus: it is amazingly quiet.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for only 4weeks and I just love it. Its incredible how closer shave u get. Extremely low noise with no vibrations.The trimmer is not as great as I expected but does a decent job. The cord is small so the power outlet needs to be close to the mirror. Provides excellent shave with less irritation. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> it works fine. takes some time to get used to. not close enough to my point of view.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well, it shaves reasonably close, does not irritate, and has a surprisingly quiet motor (compared to other Norelcos and Remingtons that I have owned in the past).</li>
            <li> This was for my husband.  He doesn&#x27;t like electric shavers but then he tried this one, he was surprized.  He really enjoyed this gift.</li>
            <li> After using Norelco Shaver for 10 years I decided to buy  an other shaver and it had to be Norelco again because of  the good performance and realability of the first Norelco  which is still is in good working condition.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco for over 30 years and was surprised that the quality of the shave is so poor from previous shavers. Perhaps they should rethink making them in China. This will be the last Norelco that I ever purchase.</li>
            <li> Some of us want a straightforward electric shaver that doesn&#x27;t have a heavy battery pack &amp; charger to mess with.  Just plug it in and shave. The 6423 is quiet, smooth, and light weight.  Too bad Philips discontinued corded shavers!  There are still some stocks of them left on the market. GET ONE WHILE YOU CAN.</li>
            <li> I got this on sale for a pretty good price back in 2007.  Part of the appeal was that it was, loosely, &#x27;Air Force blue&#x27;. I&#x27;m a blade guy, when I can help it, but sometimes that isn&#x27;t an option. Like those times when you&#x27;re truly pinched for time in the morning or your schedule is so hectic you just can&#x27;t fit a good blade shave in. There are definitely times during Wing Training Assemblies, given the duties I&#x27;m usually assigned, that that&#x27;s the case.  Is this a substitute for a blade? No, not really. It&#x27;s a substitute for not having shaved at all. That&#x27;s considered unacceptable in uniform. This won&#x27;t give you a really clean shave, but with it at least you did shave, whereas if all you had was a blade you&#x27;d sometimes have to skip it and hope no one important notices!  I&#x27;ve never replaced the cutter heads. Part of it is that I just never used this enough to worry about the prescribed interval. Thus, four years later, they&#x27;re not worn out yet. However, Norelco HQ55+ replacements have disappeared from local retailers shelves where I live, so I&#x27;d have to order a set from a national retailer if I wanted to do so. In any case, the new heads cost as much or more than I paid for this thing in the first place, which was just shy of $30.  The trimmer works well enough. The cord stays put. The batteries haven&#x27;t died yet - no batteries, no problem! This is a concern if you&#x27;re getting it as a backup instead of regular use. It could sit most of the time for three or four years, you use it a handful of times, then the Ni-Cad or whatever rechargeable batteries your shaver uses die and you get to trashcan it just as if you&#x27;d used it daily. Not much value there, is there? This isn&#x27;t exactly silent, but the noise level is tolerable.  You get what you pay for, friends!</li>
            <li> Was happy to locate this razor for my husband; it&#x27;s like his old one that finally died and they don&#x27;t make them anymore, but luckily I was able to locate this one thru Amazon.  Thanks guys!  Hubby is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The company ran out of the shaver shown and I recieved a 6940LC. Made good on pricing I could have gotten this model for through AMAZON. Actually a little better. Definately a good place to deal with.   The razor is wisper quiet, cuts very close and just as quickly as my 10 year old Norelco that was made in Holland. It \\&quot;sounds\\&quot; slower,(but really isn&#x27;t) and my better half is very pleased, as I am up early in the day. Now the question will be, will it last as long. Will let you know in 10 years!! Love it so far.</li>
            <li> My husband likes corded shaver and this is a good deal. I would give it 5 stars if it offers closer shave.</li>
            <li> This razor was what I was looking for: not too expensive and gets the job done. It doesn&#x27;t get an incredibly close shave, but it doesn&#x27;t miss anything, which was important for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for a quick shave when you want too look decent and don&#x27;t have much time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year now, so it seems fair to review it.    It does not shave as close as a blade, but no one expects it to.  It does not seem as fast on multiday growth as the non-rotary  shaver I used 40 years ago, but it seems as fast when used daily.  (Memories of 40 years ago are not reliable.)    It does a good job of keeping the waste inside. Instead of the   recommended cleaning every two weeks, I just remove the head  every weekend and tap the head and body against the sink a few  times.     As other reviewers noted, the cord is tightly coiled and stiff.  Every few months it pulls free from the shaver enough to remove  power, but not enough to fall off. This inconvenience adds several  seconds to my shave time.    If it was lost, I&#x27;d probably replace it with the same model.    Added, January 2008: Late last year I finally noticed the shave was   not as close as it had been, and it took longer. Time to replace   the head. Norelco recommends every year; I can confirm that two years  is too long. Replacing the entire thing was less than $3.00 more than  replacing just the head, so I really have bought it again.</li>
            <li> this was given to me by my wife on our anniversary, overall i rate this product ok, though it gives a close shave but due to sensitiveness of my skin i feel itchy entire day. i would not recommend this if your skin is thinny and sensitive, regular razor with shaving gel is far better.</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised, but I think I could have spent the same by buying it at Target.  Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I bought the 6423LC a year ago to replace a 10-year old Braun which cost more than three times as much.  The Norelco is a far better shaver, and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t dump the Braun years ago.  My favorite features are: (1) it&#x27;s extremely quiet, no more waking my wife up on mornings when I have to get to work early (the Braun was like a chainsaw); (2) it gives a close, comfortable shave even if I skip a day; the Braun really \\&quot;grabbed\\&quot; my beard after skipping a day, but the Norelco is much gentler; (3) the Norelco doesn&#x27;t seem to miss spots -- I would sometimes discover an embarrassingly long hair which the Braun had missed for a few days straight; no such problem with this unit; (4) the overall closeness and feel is every bit as good as the Braun, if not better; (5) the price was right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a year the unit is still running perfectly.  I just bought and installed new cutters, and they made a noticeable difference.  I probably could have gone a few more months on the old cutters, but a year seems reasonable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Negatives?  Readers probably already know this, but, just to be clear, this is a basic, no-frills shaver.  It&#x27;s not cordless, and it doesn&#x27;t have closeness settings.  Personally I don&#x27;t need a cordless model, and the shave is fine without any fine-tuning.  The unit also doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying case.  If I travel I put it in a sock.  It does have a plastic guard for the head. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product gives a great shave and is a fantastic value.  I warmly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for years, so when it was time to finally break down and buy a new shaver, I immediately looked to Norelco again.  Definitely not disappointed.  It is amazingly quite and fast, and produces a close shave.  Cleaning is a snap and I like the corded model, because it is ready whenever I need to use it, and I don&#x27;t have to fumble around with a charger.  And the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is terrible. It barely shaves at all. Not at all what I expected. Hit the trash can in just three months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to keep my head shaved since I am bald anyway.  I use it every other day with (so far) satisfactory results.  If the cord were 10\\&quot; longer I would have given it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Razor is not rechargable like most razors are now.  Otherwise, product is very good and service was fast.</li>
            <li> As advertised, this electric shaver gives me the best results I have ever experienced over 50 years  using all types of electric razors. The wide range of voltage versatillity of 100-240v is a big advantage for travel in Europe. I much prefer the direct power shaver to these annoying battery -charging models. The quietness is also a plus when others are asleep.</li>
            <li> Using cordless was a bad idea for my husband as he always forgot the charger in hotels when he traveled. So I decided to buy him this one for our anniversary after reading great reviews about it. He likes it and uses it more than any other shaver he has. It is a great value for a great product.</li>
            <li> A Great Value for the Price.  It was just a little more expensive to buy this new electric shaver than it was to replace the blades in my old shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used an old Norelco 750 for many years. I was about to buy a replacement head but found I could buy the latest version for just a few bucks more. No brainer! The new one shaves like a dream and is much quieter to boot. I don&#x27;t know a better value for the money.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t really need a shaver with a battery, this is a great buy. It&#x27;s very light, extremely quiet, easy to clean, and gives a nice close shave. I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for over 40 years and this is my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor while on sale and it is an outstanding buy.  Very low price.  When I first turned it on it sounded so quiet that I thought it couldn&#x27;t have much power but I was wrong.  Works great so we bought 3 more for our older grand sons for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I think the norelco rotary shaver is the best shaver there is in the market.I tried other brands,but was disappointed with the quality and performance.With the norelco shaver I can get a quick quality shave with both beard stubble or long whiskers.It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> My husband is not fond of electric razors, but they are handy in a pinch.  He&#x27;s is happy with this one and may be using it more often than his previous razor.</li>
            <li> Reliable product, it&#x27;s still working after so many years. It&#x27;s light, good for travel.</li>
            <li> Have an older Norelco 550TL which is a much better shaver than this new one.  Had replaced the cutters perhaps 7 years ago, after obtaining the difficult to find replacements; that old shaver with the now old blades, is still a magnitude better than this new shaver.  The new model runs very slow, so I assumed it was due to also being directly operable at 220volt.  However my old 550TL operates at 220v as well, but still runs at nearly twice the speed of the new one.  The 6423LC does hug the contour of the face better and is quieter, but the shave quality is quite poor.  Requires covering the same area time after time after time...again and again.  If would not have purchased this shaver if I could have found the correct replacement blades again.  Finally realized what is going on.  This shaver is designed to run from the lowest noted to the highest noted voltage, only because it will operate on 220 maximum.  What do I mean?  The motor runs less than half speed at the lowest voltage and full speed at 220v, thus the shaving head is proportionally as slow also at 120 volts, thus requiring twice the time to shave.  It should be fine at 220v, so if I even get to Europe, I am set.  Otherwise I am screwed.   Buy it if you want, but you have been told.  Had I been able to return, I would have, but they say no return.  I chalk this up as a win for Amazon (they got my money) but shame on them for knowingly offering a definitely mis-represented product....this is not like them at all.    1 Amazon&#x27;s description states that this shaver has a 60 day warranty, but the packaging states it cannot be returned if opened!!!  Serves me right to have purchased an item that is not sold directly by Amazon...probably will not happen again.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about 10 years and I just changed the blade today. One of my best investments.</li>
