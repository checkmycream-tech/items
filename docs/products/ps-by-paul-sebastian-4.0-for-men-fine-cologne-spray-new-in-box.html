            <li>I kept my old bottle.</li>
            <li>A bit too mature for me--</li>
            <li>mature meaning, a man in his seventies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve began giving this as gifts, bought 3 so far.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I smelled this on a guy and wanted to follow him around.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it as a gift for a co-worker just to smell it daily.</li>
            <li> Love the Cologne bought a few of them also bough a few of the after shave bomb and got rip off it was something else with no smell not the bomb</li>
            <li> my son loved it, and his wife went crazy!!</li>
            <li> I have bought PS in the past, But what I received was not PS!      It smells so bad I&#x27;m unable to wear it.   This review is not from Tom, But I would be very proud to be Tom Watson...</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent packaging for this breakable item</li>
            <li> This was not Paul Sabastian. I kept my old bottle. The fragrance was not even close to the original. I was very disappointed. This was one of the few times I didn&#x27;t read the reviews first. Hopefully others will read my review before buying the ones that sent this to me.</li>
            <li> have used for 20 plus years - and pleased still available. Females in my life attest to the consistent fragrance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Wore this for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Paul Sebastian cologne for years, and women always compliment me on how good it smells. It kind of drives my wife crazy with all the attention I get.</li>
            <li> WELL WHAT CAN I SAY, AMAZON HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THIS PRODUCT HAS ALL THE LADIES ALL OVER ME AND I JUST LOVE IT. THE PRICE I PAID FOR THIS GAVE ME ENOUGH MONEY LEFT OVER TO GO BUY 2 PIZZAS. LOL.</li>
            <li> A bit too mature for me--mature meaning, a man in his seventies. Smells like a hit of days gone by.</li>
            <li> This cologne reacts differently on different people. My Lady loves it and when I perspire a little it gives off a scent she just loves even more. Others that have tried it were happy until they perspired and then it did not smell at all like cologne. Try it</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. I have been using this stuff for many years and have never yet met anyone who did not find the scent delightful.</li>
            <li> Really like this cologne. It smells fabulous! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne!Love, love,love this cologne. You must order this!</li>
            <li> PS smells so good, I hugged a male friend at a party and had to ask him what Cologne he had on and it was PS. The next week I bought it for my husband and love it when he has it on. I know the smell that I like and this is it and my husband benefits by me finding him so enticing when he has it on. The first time I bought it was at a Department Store and payed 70% more for it then what I paid thru the Amazon site. I will always buy it thru Amazon from now on!</li>
            <li> Best Cologne. Been using it for 20 years</li>
            <li> Smells authentic. I have been using this brand for many years now and am very familiar with it.  If it is a knock-off, I certainly can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Great price for this size cologne of PS. It arrived without a cap.  since it was a gift for my husband, I was able to steal the cap from the almost empty bottle he had for the new one--however it does not fit snugly. Otherwise, pleased with quality of cologne and price.</li>
            <li> Just like it should be. The right color and smell. In the past I have ordered colognes and the just weren&#x27;t right, this one is.</li>
            <li> Great product ! Great price</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and holds up pretty good.I&#x27;m getting so much compliments I&#x27;ve began giving this as gifts, bought 3 so far.</li>
            <li> My only negative is the fragrance does not last long.</li>
            <li> this is the real deal!!! The other Paul Sebastian may be fake but this is the real stuff!! I love the smell and so does the ladies:)</li>
            <li> Oldie but goodie.  Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and again</li>
            <li> This product was the real deal. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  When my husband wears it he get so many complements on how good he smell.  And it smells better the longer you wear it.</li>
            <li> Many of my wife&#x27;s friends have purchased PS for husbands and boyfriends BD and Xmas gifts after they had caught the aroma off of me.  Yes, they asked me what I was wearing.</li>
            <li> Always smelling good!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been using Paul Sebastian for many years now.  People are always telling me how great I smell.  Oh - and I am a woman!</li>
            <li> Always have bought this and will continue to. It is the correct scent for my chemical makeup. At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m told.</li>
            <li> For the money it could have been a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought the cologne hoping that my husband would like it and he did, he is very picky when it comes to men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li> Nice everyday office scent..not overwhelming but just enough appeal to catch the attention of my female coworkers on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Women love this colone been use for years and continue to get the same result from women in elevators &amp;#34;Mmm you smell good&amp;#34; never fails.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with cost of this but worried it wasn&#x27;t the real deal.  I had just purchased it in a Dept. store for exactly twice the cost.  It is the REAL DEAL and was able to take the other back.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping, what else can you ask for</li>
            <li> I have used this for years...It last all day and everyone comments on it The price is so much better then any store..</li>
            <li> We were looking for another cologne for my husband.  I bought a sampler last year and my husband likes the smell of this cologne.</li>
