            <li>And it doesnt hurt to smell good naturally if going on a date or</li>
            <li>I am ordering some more right now.</li>

            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>The soap is great for use everywhere a few times a week for better-looking skin.</li>
            <li>It says right on the packaging that it help with acne, psoriasis and excema.</li>
            <li>After many over the counter purchases of soaps that \\&quot;claim\\&quot; to soothe and calm irritated skin, she finally has something that works.  </li>
            <li>My psoriasis is flattening ( the first step of the healing process)</li>
            <li>This soap has really helped my skin be clearer!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend so much on a bar of soap but the results to my face have made it worth it.</li>
            <li>Skin is less red and rash is greatly improved.</li>
            <li>I know how great the dead sea is for skin, however, there isn&#x27;t enough salt in this soap.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t dissolve as much.</li>
            <li>I have very resistant acne</li>
            <li>Very Plesant</li>
            <li>This did not help much...</li>
            <li>My psoriasis is getting better everyday, my face is free of pimples and my skin is soft all over.</li>
            <li>I use it occasionally on my scalp as shampoo with no effect on my hair but clean, no itch.</li>
            <li>I also purchased and like the Dead Sea Black Mud Soap, good for light exfoliating and breakouts.</li>
            <li>Not only does my two-year old granddaugher look better, but, my 20-year old granddaughter has started using it as well.  </li>
            <li>I have used other soaps for much cheaper and more natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the main ingredients in Proactive.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t create more breakouts but at the same time doesn&#x27;t prevent my breakouts or help my breakouts when I actually get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know the price is a bit high for soap.  </li>
            <li>This has been by far the kind of soap that I was looking for, a total package of ingredients that can help clear acne and keep eczema under control at the same time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to use (but only a little) when my face is really oily, since it gets rid of all the oil...</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t say this soap has gotten rid of all my acne since I have pretty moderate to severe acne for about 8 years.</li>
            <li>I like to use it in the afternoon just for a quick wash, and my skin does feel a lot cleaner, but also just very dry.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the sulphur soap to clear my rosacea and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>She was plagued with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have Psoriasis, and have been struggling to find a natural remedy.</li>
            <li>That is why I had such confidence in purchasing more of the dead sea sulphur soap.</li>
            <li>I used this soap bar religiously for a few weeks and my eczema got better...</li>
            <li>It is not to harsh for daily use and keeps my face in top form.</li>
            <li>gentle product for mild skin conditions such as my current case of mild, plaque psoriasis; however, it does not effectively wash away &amp;#34;man funk&amp;#34; or body odor.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Sulphur Soap leaves my pores clean and tight and my skin moisturized, feeling clean, no itching.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Sulphur Soap has also improved my mild adult acne and roseacea.</li>
            <li>It had taken two weeks for a simple mosquito bite to clear.  </li>
            <li>Only through the kindness of a friend did we find sulphur soap for my two-year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>I first ordered dead sea sulphur soap in decemeber of 2010 and has gradually help treat my acne and kept my eczema under control as well, since I have both skin conditions.</li>
            <li>The first bar I tried was the Jericho dead sea sulfur soap.</li>

            <li> The first bar I tried was the Jericho dead sea sulfur soap.</li>
            <li> The soap lasts a long time, and I am reordering because after using it about 6 months, the bar is starting to get smaller.</li>
            <li> The soap is made with the mud from the dead sea, but the salt content isn&#x27;t high.</li>
            <li> Finally I ordered a few different bars of soap to try them and see if any helped my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had dry and red splotches all over where acne was healing.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and I feel that it cleans my face without being too drying.</li>
            <li> but then it leaves my face really really dry.</li>
            <li> Two, it seems to dry out my acne over a span of a couple of days.</li>
            <li> A lifetime of trying skin care products on my pale, sensitive, allergic skin (one soap put me in the emergency room), Finally, no skin reaction at all to Dead Sea Sulphur Soap, no itch, no sweat, no odor, no hives, nothing.</li>
            <li> And alot less chemicals than regular store brand soap...  </li>
            <li> Since I use so little of it, I cut the soap into smaller pieces</li>
            <li> /&gt;But one day I was breaking out really really bad and I was thinking that I need a soap to do a little more than what a soap does.</li>
            <li> It was not worth my investment.</li>
            <li> So this sulfur soap definitely does something at least.</li>
            <li> (just an occasional small one) and fab looking skin!</li>
            <li> When my skin breaks out for whatever reason I soap the Black Mud on and leave it for a moment before rinsing, the mud draws the poisons out and has a drying and soothing effect.</li>
            <li> I had to throw half the bar away.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the sweetest smelling, but it has done wonders for my skin and slight case of rosacea, which benefits from the sulphur.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight smell of sulfur when you are lathering up but soon dissipates afterwards.</li>
            <li> It does help the skin recover and also reduces redness slightly.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Sulphur Soap and Black Mud Soap has improved my skin from head to toe and cured the heebie jeebies.</li>
            <li> Perhaps his skin was too bad for this product, but it wasn&#x27;t any different than using any old soap.</li>
            <li> We found the soap at the Dead Sea site.  </li>
            <li> I now have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I was going for sulphur soap to help with acne breakouts and uneven skin tones.  </li>
            <li> Even though its sulphur its not a strong smell...</li>
            <li> This product seems to not do that and make my pores feel tight and small!</li>
            <li> so whatever I have tried in the past, it takes weeks or months to see results or nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Another negative was that I tried to cut this bar into sections for use and it crumbled all over the place.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the soap dried out my face really bad.  </li>
            <li> Soooo if you are struggling with psoriasis I suggest trying the dead sea sulfur soap!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells awful, just not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, but it&#x27;s sulphur soap.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the bar of soap I have been looking for all of my life. I was looking at sulphur products, as I&#x27;ve had good success with a sulphur mud facial. At my age I am concerned with drying and moisturizing. Dead Sea Sulphur Soap leaves my pores clean and tight and my skin moisturized, feeling clean, no itching. A lifetime of trying skin care products on my pale, sensitive, allergic skin (one soap put me in the emergency room), Finally, no skin reaction at all to Dead Sea Sulphur Soap, no itch, no sweat, no odor, no hives, nothing. Dead Sea Sulphur Soap has also improved my mild adult acne and roseacea. I use it occasionally on my scalp as shampoo with no effect on my hair but clean, no itch. I also purchased and like the Dead Sea Black Mud Soap, good for light exfoliating and breakouts. When my skin breaks out for whatever reason I soap the Black Mud on and leave it for a moment before rinsing, the mud draws the poisons out and has a drying and soothing effect. Great products. Dead Sea Sulphur Soap and Black Mud Soap has improved my skin from head to toe and cured the heebie jeebies. What more can I ask for. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Only through the kindness of a friend did we find sulphur soap for my two-year old granddaughter.  She was plagued with sensitive skin.  It had taken two weeks for a simple mosquito bite to clear.  We had a steroid salve. We had tried everything until a friend at work brought me a bar of sulphur soap.  We had looked everywhere locally to find the soap.  I finally gave up and went on line.  We found the soap at the Dead Sea site.  Not only does my two-year old granddaugher look better, but, my 20-year old granddaughter has started using it as well.  It is one of the main ingredients in Proactive.  Go figure.   All I know is it just works.  Thank the Lord.</li>

            <li> I have Psoriasis, and have been struggling to find a natural remedy. Finally I ordered a few different bars of soap to try them and see if any helped my sensitive skin. The first bar I tried was the Jericho dead sea sulfur soap. I felt a difference after just one time. I now have been using it for a few weeks and I am loving it. My psoriasis is flattening ( the first step of the healing process) I am loving it. A matter of fact I am ordering some more right now. It says right on the packaging that it help with acne, psoriasis and excema. My psoriasis is getting better everyday, my face is free of pimples and my skin is soft all over. I feel like I have baby skin again. Soooo if you are struggling with psoriasis I suggest trying the dead sea sulfur soap!!!!</li>
            <li> I know how great the dead sea is for skin, however, there isn&#x27;t enough salt in this soap. I saw no results from this bar of soap. The soap is made with the mud from the dead sea, but the salt content isn&#x27;t high.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap for my mom who has a skin condition, she loves it!  After many over the counter purchases of soaps that \\&quot;claim\\&quot; to soothe and calm irritated skin, she finally has something that works.  The only drawback is that it does not smell the greatest, but it works wonders and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This soap has really helped my skin be clearer! I was hesitant to spend so much on a bar of soap but the results to my face have made it worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used many products on my skin, searching for a better look to my skin! This one is great! I just wash it in the am with with bar, and my pores look smaller, breakouts are to a minimum. (just an occasional small one) and fab looking skin! thanks!! Won&#x27;t be without this!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. So, may be it will work for you but def did not work for me. It was not worth my investment.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful this soap would help my son&#x27;s acne. Perhaps his skin was too bad for this product, but it wasn&#x27;t any different than using any old soap. Smells terrible, but it&#x27;s sulphur soap.</li>
            <li> gentle product for mild skin conditions such as my current case of mild, plaque psoriasis; however, it does not effectively wash away &amp;#34;man funk&amp;#34; or body odor.</li>
            <li> my baby has a red rush since month 3, we try so many way to make her skin better, one day we try this product, and it does make the red rush skin getting better and better. if it work on a baby,I will not care how much it cost to get a good soap.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because of the good reviews and ingredients.  Unfortunately, the soap dried out my face really bad.  I had dry and red splotches all over where acne was healing.  This may be a good product for someone with oily skin but not for dry/combo skin.  The smell was neutral which I liked.  Another negative was that I tried to cut this bar into sections for use and it crumbled all over the place. I had to throw half the bar away.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Skin never looked so good.</li>
            <li> My daily cleanser is Purity by Philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one day I was breaking out really really bad and I was thinking that I need a soap to do a little more than what a soap does. Purity is great for my sensitive and acne prone skin by not irritating it but that&#x27;s all it does. It doesn&#x27;t create more breakouts but at the same time doesn&#x27;t prevent my breakouts or help my breakouts when I actually get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sulfur soap is a great cleanser - MY FACE SQUEAKS! One, it cleans my face effortlessly so I don&#x27;t have a trace of eyeliner or mascara around my eyes. Two, it seems to dry out my acne over a span of a couple of days. I have very resistant acne so whatever I have tried in the past, it takes weeks or months to see results or nothing at all. So this sulfur soap definitely does something at least. The great thing is, it has not caused any breakouts for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say this soap has gotten rid of all my acne since I have pretty moderate to severe acne for about 8 years. It&#x27;s not life changing but I have gone through so many products which have only harmed my face more. This product seems to not do that and make my pores feel tight and small!</li>
            <li> All of these Products are incredible... I know the price is a bit high for soap.  But it makes your whole body feel awesome...  And alot less chemicals than regular store brand soap...  And it doesnt hurt to smell good naturally if going on a date or whatever the case... I think these products are amazing... Even though its sulphur its not a strong smell... Very Plesant</li>
            <li> It smells awful, just not what I expected at all. Stinky and just doesn&#x27;t look like much, I found better products for cheaper</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the sweetest smelling, but it has done wonders for my skin and slight case of rosacea, which benefits from the sulphur.  The soap lasts a long time, and I am reordering because after using it about 6 months, the bar is starting to get smaller.</li>
            <li> I have psorasis and have tried different products. This is another product that didn&#x27;t help my psoarsis after a months usage.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep that face acne under control.  Have tried tons of stuff including prescriptions and nothing has worked as well as this soap.  It is not to harsh for daily use and keeps my face in top form.</li>
            <li> The soap fell apart when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and sometimes break out. I have been using this soap for a few months now. It lasts a long time and I feel that it cleans my face without being too drying.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the sulphur soap to clear my rosacea and it seems to be working. Skin is less red and rash is greatly improved. Use it in conjunction with sun block and some dietary changes. Hope it continues to work. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> This soap makes my face break out and makes my skin itchy.  I have used other soaps for much cheaper and more natural ingredients.  I was going for sulphur soap to help with acne breakouts and uneven skin tones.  This did not help much...however, I use this soap in the steam room sometimes and I do like how it feels when using the soap and immediately steaming...</li>
            <li> This is great soap. It cleans well without over drying. It has a slight smell of sulfur when you are lathering up but soon dissipates afterwards. It lasts quite some time as well. A good value. Made In Israel.</li>
            <li> Like I said in the headline, this is not a cure for psoriasis. It does help the skin recover and also reduces redness slightly. The soap is great for use everywhere a few times a week for better-looking skin.</li>
