            <li>This is the best, i bought it in hawaii</li>
            <li>Pikake is the best!!</li>

            <li>Perfect scent for spring and summer, preferably outdoors.  </li>

            <li>Terranova has created a delicious scent with this lovely Pikake</li>

            <li>Love this scent, it&#x27;s like going on a tropical vacation every time I put it on!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS BRAND!  </li>
            <li>love the scent, although it should keep the scent a bit longer, it does NOT!  </li>
            <li>Everyone love it when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>I do love this product scent.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love their Plumeria, but the Pikake smells like chemicals.  </li>
            <li>However, after a while that mothball smell goes away and you are left with a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>Terranova Pikake perfume or the cologne spray has always been my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more out of this.</li>
            <li>Terranova&#x27;s Pikake smells better than the flower itself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tropical, floral, sweet, and lasts 12 hours!</li>
            <li>Smells heavenly and not too strong.</li>
            <li>Too sweet and strong floral.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is growing on me, however, and I&#x27;m excited to find out how it changes throughout the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I liked it at first as it reminds me very much like gardenia.</li>
            <li>This is such a great fragrance and smells exactly like the Pikake flower from Hawaii.</li>
            <li>IS EXACTLY THE SAME SCENT BUT BETTER!!  </li>
            <li>About 10 years ago I worked with a woman who would occasionally wear Pikake oil perfume and I would rave to her about the amazing scent each time.</li>
            <li>Like being in a garden of fresh flowers.  </li>
            <li>When I wear it, I always get a complimentary comment.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted and it arrive quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the real flower and it lasts almost all day!</li>
            <li>I love the scent on a gardenia flower but not necessarily on my skin.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has a little bit of an off smell when you first fut it on; kind of like mothballs.</li>
            <li>Pure heavenly scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a very relaxing scent, IMO</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward 10 years</li>
            <li>Great price, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It arrived practically the next day and much to the delight of my olfactory sense, the Terranova Pikake Perfume Essence was exactly what I had hoped for!</li>
            <li>let my 5 year old boys smell it and their comment was, &amp;#34;Ooh!</li>
            <li>The icing on this cake is that my husband is wild about the scent on me</li>
            <li>The truest to the actual live flower I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I have 1/4 of that spritz bottle left, plus the remaining half in the original Terranova bottle after 4 months in my daily rotation of perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells different from my old Pikake essence purchased in Honolulu.</li>
            <li>My secret exotic weapon for over a decade.</li>
            <li>The bottle is not large, but believe me you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>Pretty little bottle with an embossed lid.</li>

            <li> Pretty little bottle with an embossed lid.</li>
            <li> While I love my other Terranova essential oils (gardenia and China lily), this one smells very synthetic to me: has an unpleasant tang/smell.</li>
            <li> Only downside is bottle has screw top and makes it rather difficult to apply product with anything other than finger.</li>
            <li> This perfume essence smells like the beach or the ocean and the scent lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> I carefully read the reviews, comparing options and took the leap of faith that the Terranova brand would bring me back to the scent from years ago.</li>
            <li> The only isse would be that once the bottle is opened, it leaks during transport no matter how tight you screw the cap back on.</li>
            <li> Determined, I went in search of this perfume in my local shops around the Pacific Northwest city I live in, but alas I was unsuccessful and gave up.</li>
            <li> A harsh smelling oil that only tangentially resembles Pikake.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops for a fragrance that lasts all day and night.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No muddy or sharp smelling fillers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Susan D Child makes this little perfume oil called CHILD and it sells for $98  </li>
            <li> Was hoping for something a little crisper.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I bought a small spritz bottle (a travel sized one) and poured half of the Pikake oil into it so that I could use it as a spray.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to learn it had been a gift from her sister who had returned from Hawaii several months prior.</li>
            <li> I dab the oil behind my knees, ears  and pulse points.</li>

            <li> I do love this product scent.  Pikake reminds me of home in Hawaii.  The only isse would be that once the bottle is opened, it leaks during transport no matter how tight you screw the cap back on.</li>
            <li> Been using Terranova perfumes for over ten years. I always get compliments! Great price, a little goes a long way. The pikake always reminds me of home, Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Love it. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A harsh smelling oil that only tangentially resembles Pikake.</li>
            <li> I love their Plumeria, but the Pikake smells like chemicals.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells wonderful. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has a little bit of an off smell when you first fut it on; kind of like mothballs. However, after a while that mothball smell goes away and you are left with a wonderful smell.</li>

            <li> the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan D Child makes this little perfume oil called CHILD and it sells for $98  it is ALL THE RAGE in Hollywood and sold only at Fred Segal Stores in Beverly Hills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TERRANOVA IS EXACTLY THE SAME SCENT BUT BETTER!!  at a fraction of the cost!  I LOVE THIS BRAND!  THIS SCENT IS AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tropical, floral, sweet, and lasts 12 hours!</li>
            <li> Pretty little bottle with an embossed lid. I didn&#x27;t know if I liked it at first as it reminds me very much like gardenia. I love the scent on a gardenia flower but not necessarily on my skin. The aroma is growing on me, however, and I&#x27;m excited to find out how it changes throughout the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my 5 year old boys smell it and their comment was, &amp;#34;Ooh! What is that smell?! I like that!!&amp;#34; I plan to come back to report what happens when I wear it around the city and then later what my husband thinks.</li>
            <li> Too sweet and strong floral.  Was hoping for something a little crisper.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Terranova has created a delicious scent with this lovely Pikake</li>
            <li> This is the best, i bought it in hawaii and I always get compliments on it. Pikake is the best!! alot like tubarose.</li>
            <li> While I love my other Terranova essential oils (gardenia and China lily), this one smells very synthetic to me: has an unpleasant tang/smell.</li>
            <li> My secret exotic weapon for over a decade. The truest to the actual live flower I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Beautiful.  Like being in a garden of fresh flowers.  No muddy or sharp smelling fillers.  Pure heavenly scent.  I think this product could bring peace to the world if everyone could smell this wonderful.</li>
            <li> This perfume essence smells like the beach or the ocean and the scent lasts a long time.  When I wear it, I always get a complimentary comment.  It reminds me of being on a sea shore vacation. It is a very relaxing scent, IMO</li>
            <li> Product packaged well and arrived in good condition via UPS.  Scent is definitely an acquired smell, so to speak.  Doesn&#x27;t take much.  Perfect scent for spring and summer, preferably outdoors.  Only downside is bottle has screw top and makes it rather difficult to apply product with anything other than finger.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and not too strong. Stays on for a long time. Got compliments while wearing it. Will definitely try again.</li>
            <li> love the scent, although it should keep the scent a bit longer, it does NOT!  I was expecting more out of this.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops for a fragrance that lasts all day and night.  Terranova&#x27;s Pikake smells better than the flower itself.  Anytime you want to relive the Hawai&#x27;i experience just dab a drop on your pulse points and go back to the white powder sands of Lani Kai.</li>
            <li> Always Great  -  She has loved it for years and years!</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago I worked with a woman who would occasionally wear Pikake oil perfume and I would rave to her about the amazing scent each time. When I asked where she bought it I was disappointed to learn it had been a gift from her sister who had returned from Hawaii several months prior. Determined, I went in search of this perfume in my local shops around the Pacific Northwest city I live in, but alas I was unsuccessful and gave up. Fast forward 10 years and I happened to catch a similar scent on the air as I walked through a local boutique. I inquired if they sold the perfume and was told they didn&#x27;t, but this time I was undeterred. So I went home to log on to my friend Amazon.com and found Terranova Pikake Perfume Essence. I carefully read the reviews, comparing options and took the leap of faith that the Terranova brand would bring me back to the scent from years ago. It arrived practically the next day and much to the delight of my olfactory sense, the Terranova Pikake Perfume Essence was exactly what I had hoped for! It is truly the essence of Pikake and smells heavenly. The bottle is not large, but believe me you don&#x27;t need to use much. In fact, I bought a small spritz bottle (a travel sized one) and poured half of the Pikake oil into it so that I could use it as a spray. I have 1/4 of that spritz bottle left, plus the remaining half in the original Terranova bottle after 4 months in my daily rotation of perfume. The icing on this cake is that my husband is wild about the scent on me so it&#x27;s a win-win-win all the way around!</li>
