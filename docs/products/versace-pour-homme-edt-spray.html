            <li>He has many lines of perfume and cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has great prices and shipping is always fast.</li>
            <li>My #1 favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I just love the smell it keeps on me, this has now become my &#x27;scent&#x27; when it comes to colognes.</li>
            <li>The reason I am making a statement is that I get more compliments with Versace than I ever got in my life.</li>
            <li>After a time I ran out and wondered if Amazon had a better price.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>What more needs to be said?</li>
            <li>Rugged, woodsy, sexy.  </li>
            <li>Smells manly and sexy.</li>
            <li>Chanel may top this one as you can also smell it on you.</li>
            <li>Chanel&#x27;s 50ml bottle costs more than Versace&#x27;s 100ml bottle...</li>
            <li>I thought I would like this scent more than I do.  </li>
            <li>It is okay.  </li>
            <li>All I have to say is: If you love Acqua di Gio, you will love this.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this</li>
            <li>Not one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve collected so many colognes.</li>
            <li>authentic :)</li>
            <li>I love it when he wears it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was more than ecstatic when I got it.</li>
            <li>Women love the top notes of citrus which project a mile and stay on my skin forever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many fragrances before and this product seems to not be a fake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/my gf&#x27;s favorite scent on me.</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 different fragrances off of amazon, and the Pour Homme seems to be of the best quality.</li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll like it, ladies will love it.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon</li>
            <li>While I had plenty of compliments given to me when I wore Agua Digio, I have had even more when wearing Versace&#x27;s Pour Homme.</li>
            <li>I have to say this one is more cheaper and better smell than Aqua Di Gio, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I though it would be and more.  </li>
            <li>But that was okay.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t take it better</li>
            <li>You know whose complement is better from than a woman?  </li>

            <li>I, like most, are hesitant on buying cologne online.</li>
            <li>But it arrived today and I must say it is way, way more stronger of a scent than the one I tried at Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Love This Scent.</li>
            <li>I have my doubts as to whether this is authentic Versace...</li>

            <li>This is my husband and son favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my dad as a Father&#x27;s Day gift and he enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;versace+pour+homme+for+men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After making sure this Ships from and is sold by Amazon.com</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>the scent is refreshing</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m extra happy with this!</li>
            <li>I love versace and I look forward to making more purchases from this brand of cologne.</li>
            <li>My husband was gifted this, and when it ran out, I ran to the mall, to find that it cost WAY more than I hoped.</li>
            <li>Many compliments wearing Pour Homme.</li>
            <li>If not, someone will be glad to get it a resale shop.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and so does my husband.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the quality of the products.</li>
            <li>The ladies will love it.</li>
            <li>The purchase price was much better thru Amazon versus an instore purchase.  </li>
            <li>Nice aroma that does not linger like cheap colognes.</li>
            <li>I love love this.</li>
            <li>It will stand out and is very unique.</li>
            <li>It resembles Acqua Di Gio, but is unique its own way.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the best cologne for the spring&amp;summer ,so I usually use the acqua di gio but it lasts good</li>
            <li>Great high Quality Scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells very clean and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean smell and he almost always gets complimented when we&#x27;re out if he&#x27;s wearing it.</li>
            <li>it smells great, my normal day to day fragrance.</li>
            <li>great present for the one you love!</li>
            <li>It is pretty good</li>
            <li>This cologne is one of the best, its stay long,</li>
            <li>Has a nice sweet muskiness to it.</li>
            <li>The most important, It is very cheap~</li>
            <li>First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, its hard not be want to be under him all day he smells so good</li>
            <li>So Fresh and So Clean&amp;#34;.!!</li>
            <li>Came on time, looked great, great price, but I did not care for the smell of it after I wore it a few times.</li>
            <li>smell itself also seems to not be as potent and strong.</li>
            <li>Makes him strong and sexy smelling.  </li>
            <li>so thought I would just see if it was any cheaper through Amazon and was thrilled to find such a great deal as this is my husbands favourite.</li>
            <li>The best men&#x27;s cologne that I have used so far, great smell, stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>Versace Pour Homme is my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance - elegant and clean.  </li>
            <li>I have a very good nose and this smells the same as the one I bought from the Versace store.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this product to smell good as the reviewers say, but IMO the scent notes stay very high in the citrus level.</li>
            <li>but the sense of security is even more important.</li>
            <li>so smooth and sexy.</li>
            <li>really like this scent good job Versace..</li>
            <li>Good scent, but fades away like a much cheaper cologne.</li>
            <li>and I loved the product so much</li>
            <li>Its a must have if you really want a good perfume.</li>
            <li>Lasts long, smells good, looks good.</li>
            <li>My new favorite smell good.</li>
            <li>Super fast arrival and this scent smells great.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments from coworkers who say that the scent has a level tone but not too light or strong.  </li>
            <li>Versace is a beautiful smell--very crisp, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>Excellent cologne for someone who is not interested in an extremely strong smelling cologne...  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not too strong for work, so</li>
            <li>Didnt smell as strong as i hoped</li>
            <li>Try some on myself, not to strong  </li>
            <li>Its not too strong or overpowering, yet the scent stays on you all day.</li>
            <li>Its strong in that others can smell it but not from across the room.</li>
            <li>This cologne is very aquatic with a dry-down that is very appealing.</li>
            <li>This was the first cologne I&#x27;ve bought, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear it anymore as it reminds me of my first girl friend who I bought it to please, but its an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>The price on Amaxzon was great and this was a good value for a designer perfume which is typically very expenise at local retailers.</li>
            <li>have rated it one star less than perfect because, along with purchasing this scent, I did a lot of research on many colognes and purchased 2 others, which from the ratings of women whom have smelled all 3, rate this as a very very nice 2nd -</li>
            <li>Product was fine.</li>
            <li>Every time, Everywhere, combine all experiences, never have I had so many compliments, from women, real women, hot gorgeous beautiful women, and the regular ones too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light yet refreshing and sweet smell.</li>
            <li>The best part is Amazon had it for half the price that Macy&#x27;s had it and</li>
            <li>smells super sexy and it doesnt fade like the reviews say.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely quick as well!</li>
            <li>Love the clean fresh scent!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite cologne fresh scent everyone loves this scent , always get compliments</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few EDTs, and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>Price is also great , I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>Versace Pour Homme By Versace Eau-de-toilette Spray has such a great smell to it.</li>
            <li>but I really do enjoy this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells comfortable and doesn&#x27;t make me dizzy.</li>
            <li>Simply put, the scent is great.</li>
            <li>transaction was smooth...</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and has a very versatile wear.</li>
            <li>what a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>product is genuine, and I recomend for another constumers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A bit costly bot worth it for sure.  </li>
            <li>Smells great,  last about 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>but it is surely fabulous</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>A lady killer, light yummy scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It has sort of a clean, citrus yet somewhat strong scent.  </li>
            <li>I own around 60 fragrances and this is by far the most complimented.  </li>
            <li>Feel so freaking sexy and so good overall wearing this.</li>
            <li>this scent is incredible, i have a few colognes and this on is one of the top 3.</li>
            <li>When my husband first started using it the scent was strong and euphoric, you could smell it from across the room and it lasted most of the day.  </li>
            <li>even the body wash has a pretty strong smell :)</li>
            <li>This is a very cool and mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>I own a whole shelf full of fine cologne, and Versace uses the highest quality ingredients, no question about it.</li>
            <li>very fresh.</li>
            <li>I have very rarely gotten compliments on my colognes.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, and ladies love it.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance going on, but after a couple of hours I was left with a really sweet, perfumey, powdery smell and had to wash it off.</li>
            <li>Very fresh , clean and sensual scent.  </li>
            <li>Roger and Gallet Extra Vieille - wonderful scent - very masculine with woody undertones.</li>
            <li>Product was unopened and in original packing.</li>
            <li>My original bottle bought at Macy&#x27;s broke</li>
            <li>The original product does not do this.  </li>
            <li>I have decided not to buy perfume on Internet as the is no guarantee that it is original.</li>
            <li>I like to be unique.</li>
            <li>Original stands 1-2 days</li>
            <li>4 girls crowded around me in first period asking what I was wearing, I&#x27;m talking two of them even sprayed some on them because it apparently \\&quot;is sexy as hell\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but anyways this stuff smells top dollar, and for 40 bucks online after paying 70 in the store for my first bottle, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li>es un producto 100% original</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell cheap like those overly sweet perfumes tend to smell.</li>
            <li>I love it as much as he does!</li>
            <li>Visit the Body Shop for Animal Friendly Products or end up in the dog house.</li>
            <li>My original one lasted almost all day with 2 sprays.</li>
            <li>I have decided not to buy perfume on Internet as the is no guarantee that it is original</li>
            <li>and it seemed familiar ,I sprayed once on my arm and then after work I went to play soccer and after that I took a shower and guess what the smell was still there and drydown was even more beautiful ,so as usual I ordered from Amazon(directly sold by Amazon )because it&#x27;s always cheaper  </li>
            <li>More mature scent than like Acqua Di Gio.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, love this cologne.</li>
            <li>If you love the opening, you&#x27;ll love this for nearly 4 hours.</li>
            <li>A clean citrus smell.</li>
            <li>clean scent that doesn&#x27;t over-power</li>
            <li>super cheap.</li>
            <li>The Bottle i ordered was what i received promptly, after so many positive comments.</li>
            <li>This is a smart buy that is sure to tantalize senses with a pleasurable smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about my versace for my hubby but this product is true quality for an amazing steal, highly recommend !!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough words in the human dictionary to describe how amazing and great this cologne smells all I can say</li>
            <li>But not as great as i expected it to be from its reviews.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on, maybe cool water?</li>
            <li>It might be a good buy for others with different body chemistry--but for me it did not work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh.</li>
            <li>is when you&#x27;re walking in an office full of women and you noticed they stop turn around and see who is smelling that freaking</li>
            <li>&#x27;s good to mention that I only buy products that sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li>This cologne can be added to your collection but after buying this scent, you really don&#x27;t need much more.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a musky scent, but a slightly sweet (not too sweet though) aroma.</li>
            <li>I love colognes, but I am very selective.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and got a full refund.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH THE SMELL IS NOT BAD</li>
            <li>This is an amazing smelling and lasting cologne, and believe me I have tried them all, and this is by far the best overall!!</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I wanted but still a great product.</li>
            <li>It is clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Priced well below retail and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Ordered on amazon, saved and got it quick.</li>
            <li>Men and women both love it, but women in particular may be unexplainably attracted to you.</li>
            <li>As for the fragrance, I love this one, personal favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and think it&#x27;s very well worth it for a guy.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume as a gift for a friend and he loved it :) he said it&#x27;s refreshing, and last for a long time</li>
            <li>A true and rare find of a scent for men.</li>
            <li>but still, it lasts just as long as the cheaper adidas knock offs, that smell just as good.</li>
            <li>I own over a dozen higher end colognes, and so far, this is my #1 pick.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what the recipient wanted, so I did well to find it here!  </li>
            <li>I love Versace cologne, I love the smell, it lasts for a long time in my opinion!</li>
            <li>To my surprise it was very subtle, fresh and clean but it smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li>Clean crisp fresh scent that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW !!!!!</li>
            <li>This cologne has a very bold distinct refined and enticing smell that exudes confidence and grabs attention, it is also very masculine and not to sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>fresh and distinct i use Versace Pour Homme</li>
            <li>Fresh Scent.</li>
            <li>Fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>it is deff worth the price i paid compared to stores.</li>
            <li>but then changes its aromatic notes and say something citric, if you likes perfumes with soft citrus notes this is your choice , as seen spending time going to like me more essence.</li>
            <li>Fresh and citrusy.</li>
            <li>to tell you the truth i had more than  complement for just using this cologne even though it an old product from versace.</li>
            <li>I have many top name colognes, and know that only a few sprays is all it takes for a good scent.</li>
            <li>I just made sure I was buying direct from amazon and had no problems at all.</li>
            <li>Beautiful smell and the cologne came with the small shampoo bottle.  </li>
            <li>This was the only one that I liked.</li>
            <li>Makes the girls smile.</li>
            <li>Extreme quality for the price: presentation, sillage, longevity, overall scent is arguably the best in its class.</li>
            <li>It really has it&#x27;s on unique scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this Scent is a Strong Masculine Scent Very Crisp and to the Point.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right -</li>
            <li>and I know right away when I smell a cologne scent whether it will work for me or not.</li>
            <li>This cologne (Pour Homme) smells wonderful (at first even better than Eau Fraiche) but doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough for a cologne of this quality/price.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it since it had a similar scent to another cologne I own, the first phase of the smell faded in ~10mins, and the after scent lasted for ~3 hours.</li>
            <li>In my opinion I would recommend this to any guy who wants that clean smelling, summer/spring cologne.  </li>
            <li>Its a very subtle but very nice scent and all the girls really do love it.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh slightly citrus quality that lasts fairly well on me, slightly strong at first but settles down quite nicely in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>but this is the one that has that special element that really yells who i am..</li>
            <li>I was aware that Versace is a very well known company and held very high by many, including my father, so I had very high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>I have been using many major brands, but this Versace Pour Homme By Versace Eau-de-toilette Spray is my first try.</li>
            <li>has a nice sweet light smell that last all day even till the next day.</li>
            <li>The initial scent is strong flooding you with a regal ritzy blast of beautiful high notes of cedar wood and the bitter orange leaves followed by sage and amber notes.</li>
            <li>Fast and professional. :)</li>
            <li>I usually and almost exclusively use the CH 212 pop and though i love it and it is for me the best perfume i ever used, i wanted another fragrance to change a little bit.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much because the scent carries well.</li>
            <li>I got the large bottle, and it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>the recipient enjoyed it with such satisfaction, as did i...</li>
            <li>The Amazon (and seller) service was first class.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to love the Versace line as I also use their Eau Fraiche and</li>
            <li>It is my current favorite fragrance and my wife loves it.  </li>
            <li>That is the short story, but you want more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay now, I saw some reviews saying that this perfume doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Secondly, It&#x27;s LEGIT and authentic Versace, It even came sealed like a legit cologne should.</li>
            <li>i get so many girls asking me what are you wearing and can not get enough.</li>
            <li>Hahahaha!</li>
            <li>Then i decided to look online, hopefully, i can get a better price but same quality.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what this cologne is; good for everyday use by professionals.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped fast!  </li>
            <li>this is a excellent blind buy.</li>
            <li>First let say that from now on....</li>
            <li>Always my favorite fragrance tho I&#x27;m a female!!</li>
            <li>Try it in a store somewhere first, then purchase on line.</li>
            <li>One or two sprays is more than enough</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>love the smell, but fragrance doesn&#x27;t last too long…seems non existent after just a couple of hours...</li>
            <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>he loves it, the scent is light but masculine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
            <li>And among all of the various colognes I have ever owned, this is probably one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>It never fails.</li>
            <li>I have read in many reviews, people come back to a cologne and give it a second try, and love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought it for the first time at Macy&#x27;s for $80.  </li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s a gift pack, which includes a body shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I did not know what to expect.</li>
            <li>Write to me if you have any comments or question, thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>This was my first cologne purchase from amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>usually stay away from powdery colognes, but this has an essence of spice to it which smells pretty awesome (try it out if you don&#x27;t know what i am talking about) and do agree with the rest that it actually does reminds you of Acqua Di Gio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for shipping it fast!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for Christmas and as it&#x27;s now May, I can definitely say that we both still love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying fragrances from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because I had read some reviews regarding people receiving inauthentic fragrance or having fragrances diluted with alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Bought this from Amazon not from some third party seller and I&#x27;m 100% sure</li>
            <li>Used for the first time today</li>
            <li>it is to good for just everyday wear.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was oddly low for a new Versace cologne, which honestly should have been my first clue.  </li>
            <li>Super product, a branD new hot item I got fir more than 45% off regular retail price</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t one where you need to wait for a half hour or so after spraying before you interact with others - the opening is very safe, and non-offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty darn positive</li>
            <li>I give this cologne a slight edge over Givenchy (another wonderful cologne), due to cost effectiveness</li>
            <li>The smell is a soft and clean scent that can be worn for any occasion.  </li>
            <li>I initially received this as a present and didn&#x27;t touch it for a good 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying it locally from a department store to make sure its real this time.</li>
            <li>It warrants a lot of positive feedback once applied.  </li>
            <li>faint, but very pleasant.</li>
            <li>The other great thing is the spray works well, it puts out just enough</li>
            <li>First of, this product shipped so fast.</li>
            <li>First night I went out with it, lasted me the whole evening.</li>
            <li>The real deal; not fake</li>
            <li>Nice scent that does not project as much as some of my other colognes.</li>
            <li>I tend to avoid colognes with powerful scents because I prefer more of a subtle, and summery smell rather than a strong scent that makes a statement when your in a crowd.</li>
            <li>will recommend to anyone interested, and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It is sweet yet masculine.  </li>
            <li>I priced this exact bottle at a fine department store and it was double the price.</li>
            <li>Plus, the shipping was s fast and the price was half of what you would normally pay for good cologne.</li>
            <li>This is a very basic scent like that, and that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so subtle you don&#x27;t notice it though, just enough where it leaves you wanting more, which to me is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It is good and last long i like</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing last the entire day got a couple compliments about the smell.</li>
            <li>It could be used for the office or as a signature scent, as it isn&#x27;t too imposing, and is very safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the scent is really Sweeeet.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this Cologne.</li>
            <li>It seems like it could be a duller version of Aqua de gio which to me was a lil too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very picky when it comes to them.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The whole set is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Great as a Xmas gift</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very versatile, non-offensive fragrance; you can where it anytime and anywhere..</li>
            <li>pour so much.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, but I like it so much that I&#x27;ve worn it too.</li>
            <li>the only problem I encountered was the bottle cap, it didn&#x27;t fit on the bottle correctly.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;ve never used the real cologne.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this perfume to any man!</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>the smell starts to become to much</li>
            <li>Bvlgari man, dolce &amp; gabbana light blue, and Armani diamonds; this is my go to scent.</li>
            <li>I am very picky, so when something pleases me, it has to be one of the finest.</li>
            <li>I choose this rate because I received the item very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They ran up to me and started smelling me hahaha.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of it a lot.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all real.</li>
            <li>Yes an Eau-du is lighter than straight cologone.</li>
            <li>Much appreciated.</li>
            <li>The scent is great, but the poor sprayer makes me wonder.</li>
            <li>I do like to keep the individual boxes though to keep my cologne out of light.</li>
            <li>A Top Quality Scent for a Wide Variety of Men.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend Purchasing a Bottle!</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like what I received.</li>
            <li>not only did i receive genuine versace pour homme</li>
            <li>I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future.</li>
            <li>but this is too much.</li>
            <li>you smell good&amp;#34; when i hug them and every one wants to know what i am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They could be a real winner</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look at the bottle very closely and just went with it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this again smell good when this bottle goes empty, thank you.</li>
            <li>I have 212, Aqua Di Gio, Burberry, And many other name brands.</li>
            <li>It has a unique smell which will be different than many other designers.</li>
            <li>it last me a little over a year and is easily the one of the colognes I wear most often.</li>
            <li>like im an old person but lasts long and smells okay</li>
            <li>I like the *real* Versace, and this fragrance in particular; but this product is so-so.</li>
            <li>The scent is long lasting and kind of reminds me of the Nautica Voyage cologne.</li>
            <li>But the thing is, that this is nothing like it , very different and unique longevity is decent with 4-5 hour if applied correctly.</li>
            <li>My father worked in the perfume/cologne business his whole life and he informed me that this cologne is made from high quality materials.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have EVER heard about Versace is the cost (which can be greatly mitigated by shopping online).</li>
            <li>My two fav colognes for years have been the classic Hugo Boss and Armani code.</li>
            <li>Many colognes are guilt of fading throughout the day, but Versace actually lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more cologne from amazon in the future.</li>
            <li>but since I like variation and alternate between scents on different days, this is and will continue to be up there as a favorite which I will purchase again when this bottle is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>the next time i buy one, as it is twice the size for only 10 buck more.</li>
            <li>This one works particularly well with summer weather during the daytime.  </li>
            <li>The scent is unremarkable and generic, and it dissipates really quickly.  </li>
            <li>It may be a little strong when first put on</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this fragrance, works well with anyday</li>
            <li>Will be using it from now on, Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>But trust me guys, you need to break down and open your wallets for this stuff, it lasts for hours upon hours, the smell will make girls melt, and the fact that they use real plant extracts (as opposed to using cheap synthetic ingredients made in a lab), which eliminates the risk of giving a migraine to that cute blonde you&#x27;re chatting up.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to certain types of colognes that cause me stuffiness, but this one gives me no adverse effects.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell it makes me feel a little bit better than everyone else</li>
            <li>My Father who is very old Fashioned with his choices of Scents, Typically store bought scents nothing more then $15 is what he looks for.</li>
            <li>i would recommend it to anyone who wants to smell classy</li>
            <li>Clean and crisp with a slight hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>I actually get tons of compliments from women and pretty much everyone around.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me smelling fresh daily.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, long lasting.</li>
            <li>But after several weeks it lost its potency in the bottle and when he sprayed it on himself the scent was nowhere near as strong and barely lasted an hour.</li>
            <li>But Strong enough to get you noticed from several Feet Away!</li>
            <li>I started to get colognes in the mail the other day and most smell very powerful and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I have been through a lot of different scents trying to find the right one for my style and personality</li>
            <li>Ok, first off girls can&#x27;t stay off me when I put this stuff on, seriously.</li>
            <li>The spray is not a fine mist, it&#x27;s more like a crooked jet stream, and does not deliver very much product.</li>
            <li>So as long as you purchase DIRECTLY from Amazon and not a third party seller you will be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It is my new fav now.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m someone who always likes new stuff</li>
            <li>This is a very pleasant, complex scent with a very subtle presence, long lasting, which releases very nice notes at different levels throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s masculine, it&#x27;s the total package.  </li>
            <li>Nice subtle fragrance for around 8 hours.</li>
            <li>I got a free trial sample and am definitely buying a big bottle of it</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty nice, I must admit, but it fades away so fast it makes me think I got a fake knockoff bottle or an old bottle.</li>
            <li>Very masculine scent.</li>
            <li>exactly the same as the one at retail price.</li>
            <li>It could be that I got a counterfeit bottle, but I&#x27;m not sure as the quality of the packaging and bottle appear to be authentic.</li>
            <li>There are some other colognes that I personally prefer, but I have never received more compliments and inquiries about the Versace.  </li>
            <li>In addition, once i suspected something wrong i looked more closely at the reviews and noticed many postings indicating the same thing.  </li>
            <li>also thought that it didn&#x27;t last when I first tried it on me.</li>
            <li>it last pretty well on me (5-7 hours)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>But this is what stores sell and this smelled the exact same as it did in the store.</li>
            <li>I can put on two sprays worth in the morning, and it will last throughout he whole day, and on to the next.</li>
            <li>My son loved the smell of this cologne, unfortunately the sprayer leaked so most of the cologne leaked out and was wasted.  </li>
            <li>It was a little to strong for me.</li>
            <li>I can barely keep my hands off my husband whenever he wears this cologne!!!!</li>
            <li>This is genuine, last for a long time.</li>
            <li>If you like colognes such as Nautica Voyage, Cool Water, or Polo Blue then you will like this one.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this on my husband, only down said is</li>
            <li>I thought that I had already left positive feedback.</li>
            <li>It has a sharp, sweet, tangy, soapy aqua nature to it</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and was a bigger bottle than expected.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to get a larger size for less money.</li>
            <li>you care about the bottle, and I really don&#x27;t understand why such emphasis is placed on the casing that no-one else sees, but if you do, it is very classy.</li>
            <li>The scent is certainly a cut above.</li>
            <li>Pour L&#x27; Homme - Versace - clean and somewhat flowery - subtle - long lasting with very nice releases of other notes throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Smells good but very weak projection and longevity.</li>
            <li>This product arrived in its original box, factory sealed, in typical Amazon packaging to protect the turbulence of shipping.</li>
            <li>You simply can not go wrong with the purchase of this great item.</li>
            <li>Have tried it for nearly a week and it looks like I&#x27;ll be either be shelving or selling this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for classy evening wear.</li>
            <li>and you have to move closer to see what they&#x27;re saying, unlike the loud people you want to get away from.</li>
            <li>After unwrapping the protective film, I tell you not, my room was ENGULFED with the fragrance - completely validating the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and the same quality as the one at Macy.</li>
            <li>The only reason not to buy this is if you absolutely HAVE TO have it now.</li>
            <li>While I was surprised to find a body was in the box with this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s technically a summer-ish scent, but it&#x27;s been my go-to for over a year straight now</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>It is masculine without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I buy it often and use it quite frequently.</li>
            <li>This specific item is really misleading</li>
            <li>Thanks, I will be back.</li>
            <li>far I am 3 for 3 on colonges</li>
            <li>My girlfriend absolutely adores it when I wear this cologne, and I have received multiple compliments while wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li>My husband and son both really like this, and that&#x27;s saying a lot since their generations and professions couldn&#x27;t be further apart.  </li>
            <li>; Wow, you smell good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll go to the department store and buy the cologne at the counter and spend a few more bucks.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying a few more off here in the future.</li>
            <li>Well recommend perfume is somewhat complicated, but in my opinion not bad in principle has a peculiar odor strong something</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, it&#x27;s still worn less frequently than Acqua di Gio, so considering all the variables I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worthy of a purchase.</li>
            <li>So as long as you use it in a reasonable time frame and keep the fragrance in a cool, dark environment, it will have the longevity and maintain the pungency one is looking for.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quicker than expect, the cologne smells exactly like my last bottle and the bottle itself didn&#x27;t have any problems like my last one.  </li>
            <li>Had some unique qualities to it, but also a little on the more common side of scents such as aquatics.</li>
            <li>It stays on for long and is appreciated by all my friends.</li>
            <li>First time I ordered light blue from dolce gabbana for me and my girlfriend, her is real and mine came fake.</li>
            <li>The dry down in Allure Homme Sport takes it off in a very different, interesting direction.</li>
            <li>and it smells incredible and has lasted so far...not bad for a cologne I ordered online after only having smelled it once.</li>
            <li>All I have to say is wow, smells very similiar to Chanel Allure Homme Sport with the exception that this doesn&#x27;t have the bitter citrus scent that I dislike.  </li>
            <li>I have looked these up in the store and all 3 are stated as Eau-De-Toilette which is a less powerful mixture.</li>
            <li>no other like it, impossible not to notice, it smells great</li>
            <li>When it arrived I put a small spray of it on me and probably within 10 minutes you could not smell it before which was not the case with the original bottle that I had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that it was not stored properly and this particular bottle was ruined.</li>
            <li>this cologne smell great and wasn&#x27;t badly priced.</li>
            <li>it generally lasts all day</li>
            <li>After a couple hours it&#x27;s barely there.</li>
            <li>This Versace stuff was the only one that I ordered through Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>I tried out this Versace stuff and could barely smell it.</li>
            <li>though I might got used on smell, asked my girlfriend that arrived home in meantime, and she barely could smell it of my wrist .</li>
            <li>This is the exact same thing (minus aftershave)</li>
            <li>Highly suspect this was a knockoff, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, maybe any hour or two.</li>
            <li>I use Versace pour Homme regularly, and this one has a similar fragrance but lasts about 5 minutes before completely disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was sketch a little from buying it on amazon, but it came on time and was exactly as it is in the store.</li>
            <li>Nuit del Homme - YSL - long lasting, complex, and fragrant - which have brought many amorous/favorable comments from members of the opposite</li>
            <li>Like some people have said it is not a very long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s so light, and doesn&#x27;t transform in the dry down, the mids and bass notes are all but lost.</li>
            <li>Giving it 2 stars because the scent does last long and 1 spray to the neck doesn&#x27;t project too much compared to other colognes.</li>
            <li>Versace pour homme,all what I can say its little expensive but it makes you smell good for about 10 hours I guess.</li>
            <li>There are not very many scents I really like a lot</li>
            <li>The only complaint is the fragrance is light (soft) and does not last as long as other colognes.  </li>

            <li> Excellent price and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I considered returning it, and found \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Always liked this scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice for someone that likes a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very good product, the best mark in the vendor announced, 100 percent patched, ESPECIALLY THAT Nara seeking something useful and good</li>
            <li> Superb, high quality cologne/scent.</li>
            <li> Want to try more of their colognes very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Came fast great price smells good.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best cologne i have used..</li>
            <li> This spray by far is the best.</li>
            <li> I own many colognes, and I would recommend a lot of others before this one.</li>
            <li> worth every penny great price too.</li>
            <li> This ranks up there as one of the most complimented fragrances I own.  </li>
            <li> bought this for my son because I smelled it in Ulta and most of the women/ladies/girls all liked it when I took it around and asked them to smell it.  </li>
            <li> good , cheap, attracts people and it is a fragance i have never found before.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t like the cologne and most probably I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice perfume to wear anywhere :)</li>
            <li> by far one of the best colognes I have.</li>
            <li> a fresh cool scent perfect for summer or spring</li>
            <li> a Very Enjoyable Scent, Not to Strong to the point its going to give you a headache.</li>
            <li> All Versace fragrances are top-notch and made with pure ingredients and are therefore headache free.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a clean, subtile scent at a fair price give this a try.</li>
            <li> Anyway, for the first time I decided to buy this product from Perfumes4us, the seller,and it was great.</li>
            <li> Damn i knew $40 was too good to be true for a 4.3 ounce ...</li>
            <li> Go get it and see yourself linking up with very fine, cute women of substance.</li>
            <li> This smell is so amazing on my husband, it is a bit strong</li>
            <li> This smells great and is certainly the advertised product</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes I own, I generally wear this cologne on special occasions</li>
            <li> This cologne is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and mine</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this cologne</li>
            <li> Quite a captivating smell with this one.  </li>
            <li> My wife and kids love the smell-</li>
            <li> I get many comments on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am known to wear many perfumes.</li>
            <li> He has many lines of perfume and cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has great prices and shipping is always fast.</li>
            <li> My #1 favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell it keeps on me, this has now become my &#x27;scent&#x27; when it comes to colognes.</li>
            <li> The reason I am making a statement is that I get more compliments with Versace than I ever got in my life.</li>
            <li> After a time I ran out and wondered if Amazon had a better price.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> What more needs to be said?</li>
            <li> Rugged, woodsy, sexy.  </li>
            <li> Smells manly and sexy.</li>
            <li> Chanel may top this one as you can also smell it on you.</li>
            <li> Chanel&#x27;s 50ml bottle costs more than Versace&#x27;s 100ml bottle...</li>
            <li> I thought I would like this scent more than I do.  </li>
            <li> It is okay.  </li>
            <li> All I have to say is: If you love Acqua di Gio, you will love this.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this</li>
            <li> Not one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve collected so many colognes.</li>

            <li> I was more than ecstatic when I got it.</li>
            <li> Women love the top notes of citrus which project a mile and stay on my skin forever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many fragrances before and this product seems to not be a fake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /my gf&#x27;s favorite scent on me.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 different fragrances off of amazon, and the Pour Homme seems to be of the best quality.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll like it, ladies will love it.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon</li>
            <li> While I had plenty of compliments given to me when I wore Agua Digio, I have had even more when wearing Versace&#x27;s Pour Homme.</li>
            <li> I have to say this one is more cheaper and better smell than Aqua Di Gio, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I though it would be and more.  </li>
            <li> But that was okay.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t take it better</li>
            <li> You know whose complement is better from than a woman?  </li>

            <li> , just suck it up and go to the store where you know that you will be getting an authentic product.</li>

            <li> I, like most, are hesitant on buying cologne online.</li>
            <li> But it arrived today and I must say it is way, way more stronger of a scent than the one I tried at Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Love This Scent.</li>
            <li> I have my doubts as to whether this is authentic Versace...</li>

            <li> This is my husband and son favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my dad as a Father&#x27;s Day gift and he enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;versace+pour+homme+for+men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After making sure this Ships from and is sold by Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> the scent is refreshing</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m extra happy with this!</li>
            <li> I love versace and I look forward to making more purchases from this brand of cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband was gifted this, and when it ran out, I ran to the mall, to find that it cost WAY more than I hoped.</li>
            <li> Many compliments wearing Pour Homme.</li>
            <li> If not, someone will be glad to get it a resale shop.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and so does my husband.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the quality of the products.</li>
            <li> The ladies will love it.</li>
            <li> The purchase price was much better thru Amazon versus an instore purchase.  </li>
            <li> Nice aroma that does not linger like cheap colognes.</li>
            <li> I love love this.</li>
            <li> It will stand out and is very unique.</li>
            <li> It resembles Acqua Di Gio, but is unique its own way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the best cologne for the spring&amp;summer ,so I usually use the acqua di gio but it lasts good</li>
            <li> Great high Quality Scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells very clean and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very clean smell and he almost always gets complimented when we&#x27;re out if he&#x27;s wearing it.</li>
            <li> it smells great, my normal day to day fragrance.</li>
            <li> great present for the one you love!</li>
            <li> It is pretty good</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of the best, its stay long,</li>
            <li> Has a nice sweet muskiness to it.</li>
            <li> The most important, It is very cheap~</li>
            <li> First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, its hard not be want to be under him all day he smells so good</li>
            <li> So Fresh and So Clean&amp;#34;.!!</li>
            <li> Came on time, looked great, great price, but I did not care for the smell of it after I wore it a few times.</li>
            <li> smell itself also seems to not be as potent and strong.</li>
            <li> Makes him strong and sexy smelling.  </li>
            <li> so thought I would just see if it was any cheaper through Amazon and was thrilled to find such a great deal as this is my husbands favourite.</li>
            <li> The best men&#x27;s cologne that I have used so far, great smell, stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Versace Pour Homme is my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance - elegant and clean.  </li>
            <li> I have a very good nose and this smells the same as the one I bought from the Versace store.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this product to smell good as the reviewers say, but IMO the scent notes stay very high in the citrus level.</li>
            <li> but the sense of security is even more important.</li>
            <li> so smooth and sexy.</li>
            <li> really like this scent good job Versace..</li>
            <li> Good scent, but fades away like a much cheaper cologne.</li>
            <li> and I loved the product so much</li>
            <li> Its a must have if you really want a good perfume.</li>
            <li> Lasts long, smells good, looks good.</li>
            <li> My new favorite smell good.</li>
            <li> Super fast arrival and this scent smells great.</li>
            <li> I received many compliments from coworkers who say that the scent has a level tone but not too light or strong.  </li>
            <li> Versace is a beautiful smell--very crisp, clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li> Sweet!</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne for someone who is not interested in an extremely strong smelling cologne...  </li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and not too strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not too strong for work, so</li>
            <li> Didnt smell as strong as i hoped</li>
            <li> Try some on myself, not to strong  </li>
            <li> Its not too strong or overpowering, yet the scent stays on you all day.</li>
            <li> Its strong in that others can smell it but not from across the room.</li>
            <li> This cologne is very aquatic with a dry-down that is very appealing.</li>
            <li> This was the first cologne I&#x27;ve bought, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it anymore as it reminds me of my first girl friend who I bought it to please, but its an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> The price on Amaxzon was great and this was a good value for a designer perfume which is typically very expenise at local retailers.</li>
            <li> have rated it one star less than perfect because, along with purchasing this scent, I did a lot of research on many colognes and purchased 2 others, which from the ratings of women whom have smelled all 3, rate this as a very very nice 2nd -</li>
            <li> Product was fine.</li>
            <li> Every time, Everywhere, combine all experiences, never have I had so many compliments, from women, real women, hot gorgeous beautiful women, and the regular ones too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light yet refreshing and sweet smell.</li>
            <li> The best part is Amazon had it for half the price that Macy&#x27;s had it and</li>
            <li> smells super sexy and it doesnt fade like the reviews say.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely quick as well!</li>
            <li> Love the clean fresh scent!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite cologne fresh scent everyone loves this scent , always get compliments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few EDTs, and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> Price is also great , I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Versace Pour Homme By Versace Eau-de-toilette Spray has such a great smell to it.</li>
            <li> but I really do enjoy this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells comfortable and doesn&#x27;t make me dizzy.</li>
            <li> Simply put, the scent is great.</li>
            <li> transaction was smooth...</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and has a very versatile wear.</li>
            <li> what a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> product is genuine, and I recomend for another constumers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A bit costly bot worth it for sure.  </li>
            <li> Smells great,  last about 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> but it is surely fabulous</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> A lady killer, light yummy scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It has sort of a clean, citrus yet somewhat strong scent.  </li>
            <li> I own around 60 fragrances and this is by far the most complimented.  </li>
            <li> Feel so freaking sexy and so good overall wearing this.</li>
            <li> this scent is incredible, i have a few colognes and this on is one of the top 3.</li>
            <li> When my husband first started using it the scent was strong and euphoric, you could smell it from across the room and it lasted most of the day.  </li>
            <li> even the body wash has a pretty strong smell :)</li>
            <li> This is a very cool and mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> I own a whole shelf full of fine cologne, and Versace uses the highest quality ingredients, no question about it.</li>
            <li> very fresh.</li>
            <li> I have very rarely gotten compliments on my colognes.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh, and ladies love it.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance going on, but after a couple of hours I was left with a really sweet, perfumey, powdery smell and had to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Very fresh , clean and sensual scent.  </li>
            <li> Roger and Gallet Extra Vieille - wonderful scent - very masculine with woody undertones.</li>
            <li> Product was unopened and in original packing.</li>
            <li> My original bottle bought at Macy&#x27;s broke</li>
            <li> The original product does not do this.  </li>
            <li> I have decided not to buy perfume on Internet as the is no guarantee that it is original.</li>
            <li> I like to be unique.</li>
            <li> Original stands 1-2 days</li>
            <li> 4 girls crowded around me in first period asking what I was wearing, I&#x27;m talking two of them even sprayed some on them because it apparently \\&quot;is sexy as hell\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but anyways this stuff smells top dollar, and for 40 bucks online after paying 70 in the store for my first bottle, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> es un producto 100% original</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell cheap like those overly sweet perfumes tend to smell.</li>
            <li> I love it as much as he does!</li>
            <li> Visit the Body Shop for Animal Friendly Products or end up in the dog house.</li>
            <li> My original one lasted almost all day with 2 sprays.</li>
            <li> I have decided not to buy perfume on Internet as the is no guarantee that it is original</li>
            <li> and it seemed familiar ,I sprayed once on my arm and then after work I went to play soccer and after that I took a shower and guess what the smell was still there and drydown was even more beautiful ,so as usual I ordered from Amazon(directly sold by Amazon )because it&#x27;s always cheaper  </li>
            <li> More mature scent than like Acqua Di Gio.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, love this cologne.</li>
            <li> If you love the opening, you&#x27;ll love this for nearly 4 hours.</li>
            <li> A clean citrus smell.</li>
            <li> clean scent that doesn&#x27;t over-power</li>
            <li> super cheap.</li>
            <li> The Bottle i ordered was what i received promptly, after so many positive comments.</li>
            <li> This is a smart buy that is sure to tantalize senses with a pleasurable smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my versace for my hubby but this product is true quality for an amazing steal, highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough words in the human dictionary to describe how amazing and great this cologne smells all I can say</li>
            <li> But not as great as i expected it to be from its reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on, maybe cool water?</li>
            <li> It might be a good buy for others with different body chemistry--but for me it did not work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and fresh.</li>
            <li> is when you&#x27;re walking in an office full of women and you noticed they stop turn around and see who is smelling that freaking</li>
            <li> &#x27;s good to mention that I only buy products that sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> This cologne can be added to your collection but after buying this scent, you really don&#x27;t need much more.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a musky scent, but a slightly sweet (not too sweet though) aroma.</li>
            <li> I love colognes, but I am very selective.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and got a full refund.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH THE SMELL IS NOT BAD</li>
            <li> This is an amazing smelling and lasting cologne, and believe me I have tried them all, and this is by far the best overall!!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted but still a great product.</li>
            <li> It is clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Priced well below retail and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Ordered on amazon, saved and got it quick.</li>
            <li> Men and women both love it, but women in particular may be unexplainably attracted to you.</li>
            <li> As for the fragrance, I love this one, personal favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and think it&#x27;s very well worth it for a guy.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a gift for a friend and he loved it :) he said it&#x27;s refreshing, and last for a long time</li>
            <li> A true and rare find of a scent for men.</li>
            <li> but still, it lasts just as long as the cheaper adidas knock offs, that smell just as good.</li>
            <li> I own over a dozen higher end colognes, and so far, this is my #1 pick.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what the recipient wanted, so I did well to find it here!  </li>
            <li> I love Versace cologne, I love the smell, it lasts for a long time in my opinion!</li>
            <li> To my surprise it was very subtle, fresh and clean but it smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li> Clean crisp fresh scent that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW !!!!!</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very bold distinct refined and enticing smell that exudes confidence and grabs attention, it is also very masculine and not to sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> fresh and distinct i use Versace Pour Homme</li>
            <li> Fresh Scent.</li>
            <li> Fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> it is deff worth the price i paid compared to stores.</li>
            <li> but then changes its aromatic notes and say something citric, if you likes perfumes with soft citrus notes this is your choice , as seen spending time going to like me more essence.</li>
            <li> Fresh and citrusy.</li>
            <li> to tell you the truth i had more than  complement for just using this cologne even though it an old product from versace.</li>
            <li> I have many top name colognes, and know that only a few sprays is all it takes for a good scent.</li>
            <li> I just made sure I was buying direct from amazon and had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell and the cologne came with the small shampoo bottle.  </li>
            <li> This was the only one that I liked.</li>
            <li> Makes the girls smile.</li>
            <li> Extreme quality for the price: presentation, sillage, longevity, overall scent is arguably the best in its class.</li>
            <li> It really has it&#x27;s on unique scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this Scent is a Strong Masculine Scent Very Crisp and to the Point.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right -</li>
            <li> and I know right away when I smell a cologne scent whether it will work for me or not.</li>
            <li> This cologne (Pour Homme) smells wonderful (at first even better than Eau Fraiche) but doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough for a cologne of this quality/price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it since it had a similar scent to another cologne I own, the first phase of the smell faded in ~10mins, and the after scent lasted for ~3 hours.</li>
            <li> In my opinion I would recommend this to any guy who wants that clean smelling, summer/spring cologne.  </li>
            <li> Its a very subtle but very nice scent and all the girls really do love it.  </li>
            <li> It has a fresh slightly citrus quality that lasts fairly well on me, slightly strong at first but settles down quite nicely in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> but this is the one that has that special element that really yells who i am..</li>
            <li> I was aware that Versace is a very well known company and held very high by many, including my father, so I had very high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> I have been using many major brands, but this Versace Pour Homme By Versace Eau-de-toilette Spray is my first try.</li>
            <li> has a nice sweet light smell that last all day even till the next day.</li>
            <li> The initial scent is strong flooding you with a regal ritzy blast of beautiful high notes of cedar wood and the bitter orange leaves followed by sage and amber notes.</li>
            <li> Fast and professional. :)</li>
            <li> I usually and almost exclusively use the CH 212 pop and though i love it and it is for me the best perfume i ever used, i wanted another fragrance to change a little bit.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much because the scent carries well.</li>
            <li> I got the large bottle, and it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> the recipient enjoyed it with such satisfaction, as did i...</li>
            <li> The Amazon (and seller) service was first class.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to love the Versace line as I also use their Eau Fraiche and</li>
            <li> It is my current favorite fragrance and my wife loves it.  </li>
            <li> That is the short story, but you want more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay now, I saw some reviews saying that this perfume doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Secondly, It&#x27;s LEGIT and authentic Versace, It even came sealed like a legit cologne should.</li>
            <li> i get so many girls asking me what are you wearing and can not get enough.</li>
            <li> Hahahaha!</li>
            <li> Then i decided to look online, hopefully, i can get a better price but same quality.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what this cologne is; good for everyday use by professionals.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast!  </li>
            <li> this is a excellent blind buy.</li>
            <li> First let say that from now on....</li>
            <li> Always my favorite fragrance tho I&#x27;m a female!!</li>
            <li> Try it in a store somewhere first, then purchase on line.</li>
            <li> One or two sprays is more than enough</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> love the smell, but fragrance doesn&#x27;t last too long…seems non existent after just a couple of hours...</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> he loves it, the scent is light but masculine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
            <li> And among all of the various colognes I have ever owned, this is probably one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> It never fails.</li>
            <li> I have read in many reviews, people come back to a cologne and give it a second try, and love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought it for the first time at Macy&#x27;s for $80.  </li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s a gift pack, which includes a body shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I did not know what to expect.</li>
            <li> Write to me if you have any comments or question, thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> This was my first cologne purchase from amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> usually stay away from powdery colognes, but this has an essence of spice to it which smells pretty awesome (try it out if you don&#x27;t know what i am talking about) and do agree with the rest that it actually does reminds you of Acqua Di Gio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you for shipping it fast!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and as it&#x27;s now May, I can definitely say that we both still love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying fragrances from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because I had read some reviews regarding people receiving inauthentic fragrance or having fragrances diluted with alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Bought this from Amazon not from some third party seller and I&#x27;m 100% sure</li>
            <li> Used for the first time today</li>
            <li> it is to good for just everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was oddly low for a new Versace cologne, which honestly should have been my first clue.  </li>
            <li> Super product, a branD new hot item I got fir more than 45% off regular retail price</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t one where you need to wait for a half hour or so after spraying before you interact with others - the opening is very safe, and non-offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty darn positive</li>
            <li> I give this cologne a slight edge over Givenchy (another wonderful cologne), due to cost effectiveness</li>
            <li> The smell is a soft and clean scent that can be worn for any occasion.  </li>
            <li> I initially received this as a present and didn&#x27;t touch it for a good 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying it locally from a department store to make sure its real this time.</li>
            <li> It warrants a lot of positive feedback once applied.  </li>
            <li> faint, but very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The other great thing is the spray works well, it puts out just enough</li>
            <li> First of, this product shipped so fast.</li>
            <li> First night I went out with it, lasted me the whole evening.</li>
            <li> The real deal; not fake</li>
            <li> Nice scent that does not project as much as some of my other colognes.</li>
            <li> I tend to avoid colognes with powerful scents because I prefer more of a subtle, and summery smell rather than a strong scent that makes a statement when your in a crowd.</li>
            <li> will recommend to anyone interested, and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is sweet yet masculine.  </li>
            <li> I priced this exact bottle at a fine department store and it was double the price.</li>
            <li> Plus, the shipping was s fast and the price was half of what you would normally pay for good cologne.</li>
            <li> This is a very basic scent like that, and that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so subtle you don&#x27;t notice it though, just enough where it leaves you wanting more, which to me is a good thing.</li>
            <li> It is good and last long i like</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing last the entire day got a couple compliments about the smell.</li>
            <li> It could be used for the office or as a signature scent, as it isn&#x27;t too imposing, and is very safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the scent is really Sweeeet.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this Cologne.</li>
            <li> It seems like it could be a duller version of Aqua de gio which to me was a lil too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very picky when it comes to them.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The whole set is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Great as a Xmas gift</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very versatile, non-offensive fragrance; you can where it anytime and anywhere..</li>
            <li> pour so much.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, but I like it so much that I&#x27;ve worn it too.</li>
            <li> the only problem I encountered was the bottle cap, it didn&#x27;t fit on the bottle correctly.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;ve never used the real cologne.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this perfume to any man!</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> the smell starts to become to much</li>
            <li> Bvlgari man, dolce &amp; gabbana light blue, and Armani diamonds; this is my go to scent.</li>
            <li> I am very picky, so when something pleases me, it has to be one of the finest.</li>
            <li> I choose this rate because I received the item very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They ran up to me and started smelling me hahaha.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of it a lot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all real.</li>
            <li> Yes an Eau-du is lighter than straight cologone.</li>
            <li> Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, but the poor sprayer makes me wonder.</li>
            <li> I do like to keep the individual boxes though to keep my cologne out of light.</li>
            <li> A Top Quality Scent for a Wide Variety of Men.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend Purchasing a Bottle!</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like what I received.</li>
            <li> not only did i receive genuine versace pour homme</li>
            <li> I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future.</li>
            <li> but this is too much.</li>
            <li> you smell good&amp;#34; when i hug them and every one wants to know what i am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They could be a real winner</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look at the bottle very closely and just went with it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the real thing.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again smell good when this bottle goes empty, thank you.</li>
            <li> I have 212, Aqua Di Gio, Burberry, And many other name brands.</li>
            <li> It has a unique smell which will be different than many other designers.</li>
            <li> it last me a little over a year and is easily the one of the colognes I wear most often.</li>
            <li> like im an old person but lasts long and smells okay</li>
            <li> I like the *real* Versace, and this fragrance in particular; but this product is so-so.</li>
            <li> The scent is long lasting and kind of reminds me of the Nautica Voyage cologne.</li>
            <li> But the thing is, that this is nothing like it , very different and unique longevity is decent with 4-5 hour if applied correctly.</li>
            <li> My father worked in the perfume/cologne business his whole life and he informed me that this cologne is made from high quality materials.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have EVER heard about Versace is the cost (which can be greatly mitigated by shopping online).</li>
            <li> My two fav colognes for years have been the classic Hugo Boss and Armani code.</li>
            <li> Many colognes are guilt of fading throughout the day, but Versace actually lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more cologne from amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> but since I like variation and alternate between scents on different days, this is and will continue to be up there as a favorite which I will purchase again when this bottle is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> the next time i buy one, as it is twice the size for only 10 buck more.</li>
            <li> This one works particularly well with summer weather during the daytime.  </li>
            <li> The scent is unremarkable and generic, and it dissipates really quickly.  </li>
            <li> It may be a little strong when first put on</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this fragrance, works well with anyday</li>
            <li> Will be using it from now on, Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> But trust me guys, you need to break down and open your wallets for this stuff, it lasts for hours upon hours, the smell will make girls melt, and the fact that they use real plant extracts (as opposed to using cheap synthetic ingredients made in a lab), which eliminates the risk of giving a migraine to that cute blonde you&#x27;re chatting up.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to certain types of colognes that cause me stuffiness, but this one gives me no adverse effects.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell it makes me feel a little bit better than everyone else</li>
            <li> My Father who is very old Fashioned with his choices of Scents, Typically store bought scents nothing more then $15 is what he looks for.</li>
            <li> i would recommend it to anyone who wants to smell classy</li>
            <li> Clean and crisp with a slight hint of citrus.</li>
            <li> I actually get tons of compliments from women and pretty much everyone around.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling fresh daily.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, long lasting.</li>
            <li> But after several weeks it lost its potency in the bottle and when he sprayed it on himself the scent was nowhere near as strong and barely lasted an hour.</li>
            <li> But Strong enough to get you noticed from several Feet Away!</li>
            <li> I started to get colognes in the mail the other day and most smell very powerful and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have been through a lot of different scents trying to find the right one for my style and personality</li>
            <li> Ok, first off girls can&#x27;t stay off me when I put this stuff on, seriously.</li>
            <li> The spray is not a fine mist, it&#x27;s more like a crooked jet stream, and does not deliver very much product.</li>
            <li> So as long as you purchase DIRECTLY from Amazon and not a third party seller you will be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It is my new fav now.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m someone who always likes new stuff</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant, complex scent with a very subtle presence, long lasting, which releases very nice notes at different levels throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s masculine, it&#x27;s the total package.  </li>
            <li> Nice subtle fragrance for around 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I got a free trial sample and am definitely buying a big bottle of it</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty nice, I must admit, but it fades away so fast it makes me think I got a fake knockoff bottle or an old bottle.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> exactly the same as the one at retail price.</li>
            <li> It could be that I got a counterfeit bottle, but I&#x27;m not sure as the quality of the packaging and bottle appear to be authentic.</li>
            <li> There are some other colognes that I personally prefer, but I have never received more compliments and inquiries about the Versace.  </li>
            <li> In addition, once i suspected something wrong i looked more closely at the reviews and noticed many postings indicating the same thing.  </li>
            <li> also thought that it didn&#x27;t last when I first tried it on me.</li>
            <li> it last pretty well on me (5-7 hours)</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> But this is what stores sell and this smelled the exact same as it did in the store.</li>
            <li> I can put on two sprays worth in the morning, and it will last throughout he whole day, and on to the next.</li>
            <li> My son loved the smell of this cologne, unfortunately the sprayer leaked so most of the cologne leaked out and was wasted.  </li>
            <li> It was a little to strong for me.</li>
            <li> I can barely keep my hands off my husband whenever he wears this cologne!!!!</li>
            <li> This is genuine, last for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you like colognes such as Nautica Voyage, Cool Water, or Polo Blue then you will like this one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this on my husband, only down said is</li>
            <li> I thought that I had already left positive feedback.</li>
            <li> It has a sharp, sweet, tangy, soapy aqua nature to it</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and was a bigger bottle than expected.  </li>
            <li> but I was able to get a larger size for less money.</li>
            <li> you care about the bottle, and I really don&#x27;t understand why such emphasis is placed on the casing that no-one else sees, but if you do, it is very classy.</li>
            <li> The scent is certainly a cut above.</li>
            <li> Pour L&#x27; Homme - Versace - clean and somewhat flowery - subtle - long lasting with very nice releases of other notes throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Smells good but very weak projection and longevity.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in its original box, factory sealed, in typical Amazon packaging to protect the turbulence of shipping.</li>
            <li> You simply can not go wrong with the purchase of this great item.</li>
            <li> Have tried it for nearly a week and it looks like I&#x27;ll be either be shelving or selling this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended for classy evening wear.</li>
            <li> and you have to move closer to see what they&#x27;re saying, unlike the loud people you want to get away from.</li>
            <li> After unwrapping the protective film, I tell you not, my room was ENGULFED with the fragrance - completely validating the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and the same quality as the one at Macy.</li>
            <li> The only reason not to buy this is if you absolutely HAVE TO have it now.</li>
            <li> While I was surprised to find a body was in the box with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s technically a summer-ish scent, but it&#x27;s been my go-to for over a year straight now</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> It is masculine without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I buy it often and use it quite frequently.</li>
            <li> This specific item is really misleading</li>
            <li> Thanks, I will be back.</li>
            <li> far I am 3 for 3 on colonges</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely adores it when I wear this cologne, and I have received multiple compliments while wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband and son both really like this, and that&#x27;s saying a lot since their generations and professions couldn&#x27;t be further apart.  </li>
            <li> ; Wow, you smell good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll go to the department store and buy the cologne at the counter and spend a few more bucks.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying a few more off here in the future.</li>
            <li> Well recommend perfume is somewhat complicated, but in my opinion not bad in principle has a peculiar odor strong something</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, it&#x27;s still worn less frequently than Acqua di Gio, so considering all the variables I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worthy of a purchase.</li>
            <li> So as long as you use it in a reasonable time frame and keep the fragrance in a cool, dark environment, it will have the longevity and maintain the pungency one is looking for.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quicker than expect, the cologne smells exactly like my last bottle and the bottle itself didn&#x27;t have any problems like my last one.  </li>
            <li> Had some unique qualities to it, but also a little on the more common side of scents such as aquatics.</li>
            <li> It stays on for long and is appreciated by all my friends.</li>
            <li> First time I ordered light blue from dolce gabbana for me and my girlfriend, her is real and mine came fake.</li>
            <li> The dry down in Allure Homme Sport takes it off in a very different, interesting direction.</li>
            <li> and it smells incredible and has lasted so far...not bad for a cologne I ordered online after only having smelled it once.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is wow, smells very similiar to Chanel Allure Homme Sport with the exception that this doesn&#x27;t have the bitter citrus scent that I dislike.  </li>
            <li> I have looked these up in the store and all 3 are stated as Eau-De-Toilette which is a less powerful mixture.</li>
            <li> no other like it, impossible not to notice, it smells great</li>
            <li> When it arrived I put a small spray of it on me and probably within 10 minutes you could not smell it before which was not the case with the original bottle that I had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that it was not stored properly and this particular bottle was ruined.</li>
            <li> this cologne smell great and wasn&#x27;t badly priced.</li>
            <li> it generally lasts all day</li>
            <li> After a couple hours it&#x27;s barely there.</li>
            <li> This Versace stuff was the only one that I ordered through Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> I tried out this Versace stuff and could barely smell it.</li>
            <li> though I might got used on smell, asked my girlfriend that arrived home in meantime, and she barely could smell it of my wrist .</li>
            <li> This is the exact same thing (minus aftershave)</li>
            <li> Highly suspect this was a knockoff, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, maybe any hour or two.</li>
            <li> I use Versace pour Homme regularly, and this one has a similar fragrance but lasts about 5 minutes before completely disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was sketch a little from buying it on amazon, but it came on time and was exactly as it is in the store.</li>
            <li> Nuit del Homme - YSL - long lasting, complex, and fragrant - which have brought many amorous/favorable comments from members of the opposite</li>
            <li> Like some people have said it is not a very long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s so light, and doesn&#x27;t transform in the dry down, the mids and bass notes are all but lost.</li>
            <li> Giving it 2 stars because the scent does last long and 1 spray to the neck doesn&#x27;t project too much compared to other colognes.</li>
            <li> Versace pour homme,all what I can say its little expensive but it makes you smell good for about 10 hours I guess.</li>
            <li> There are not very many scents I really like a lot</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the fragrance is light (soft) and does not last as long as other colognes.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this a scent to wear to the club, it&#x27;s more of a casual work scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24, and am active, and wanted something that people near you know is there, and draws them in.</li>
            <li> Soft and experience smell that you can wear going out in black tie or blue jeans...</li>
            <li> that guy other guys want to be, be epic, change your life today, put on your big boy pants, and prepare to never live life</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent, but not great enough to warrant a blind buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Projection</li>
            <li> My boyfriend usually uses Acqua Di Gio By Giorgio Armani, but he really likes this one too~</li>
            <li> is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Go into Macy&#x27;s and try it on and see how long it last.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different scents through the years, and I got to tell ya, this stuff lasts ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last too long but long enough for me...</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last too long, maybe 2 or 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I would give this a 5/5 however, as some people noted, the smell doesn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> It seems like the smell wont last long.</li>
            <li> Last LONG!</li>
            <li> I put some in a portable sprayer to add a single spray later in the day if I needed to.</li>
            <li> the scent is the same, however it barely lasts even half an hour.</li>
            <li> I really like Bang...but hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> i am crude but honest.</li>
            <li> All the girls at work go crazy for me because they love the smell.</li>
            <li> Stays for a long long time.</li>
            <li> It lingers on the skin for around an hour and on clothes for maybe three times that long</li>
            <li> Definitely not what I expected for a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; cologne like Versace.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> will officially never buy another cologne again as long as this is still in production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can wear this all year long.</li>
            <li> I like smell of this product and it lasts for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to worry about that.</li>
            <li> Not professional at all.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel like you are on vacation all day long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It stays for long.</li>
            <li> Also the smell stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Even though this perfume is not that for long</li>
            <li> I recently ordered 9 colognes, All but 1 were through individual vendors who I thought I could trust to send me the real thing and not some outdated stuff.</li>
            <li> :Just received it and it&#x27;s the same smell as it was in the department store only half price</li>
            <li> stop smelling it after only half an hour and in one hour its almost totally gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> barely a scent in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> I received the UPS package in 2 business days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to some other reviews this actually lasts long</li>
            <li> This is fake because smell is not staying long as original.</li>
            <li> In my experience, it definitely lasts longer than the 1 hour other folks are claiming, although it does stay closer to the skin after about 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same as the other bottle I purchased at a store,</li>
            <li> And after owing 14 other bottles of various colognes..this takes the cake ladies and gents.</li>
            <li> the smell stays on for freaking long time!</li>
            <li> i get alot of compliments when im out in public and in close proximity to other people..</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you very long.  </li>
            <li> AHS however does deliver Tonka after the dry down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottle is heavy duty and supplies enough spray for only one time, which will keep you smelling &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Unfortunate but true.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle that was half the amount and double the $ and a dept. store</li>
            <li> I sprayed a little spritz on the back of my hand and could still smell it this morning.  </li>
            <li> Bought this cologne as a little present for my fianc&amp;eacute;!</li>
            <li> However, I just get compliments upon compliments, mostly from fat or ugly chicks, but that&#x27;s beside the point.</li>
            <li> I had a Girl, she was drunk as all just turn around , look at me and straight press her face up to my chest and just take a big inhale.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as Versace i have bought from my usual retailers.</li>
            <li> I swear it makes people wet.....</li>
            <li> The smell lasts longer than i have expected.</li>
            <li> EMPTY</li>
            <li> The product was received as expected, in a timely manner and well protected by packaging.</li>
            <li> I was a bit curious purchasing cologne from Amazon.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to get a few extra bottles!</li>
            <li> If you can wait a few days, order this now and you&#x27;ll have it soon enough at a lower price.</li>
            <li> The item arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Plain and simple don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> A poor imitation for the real 6.7oz product that I baught&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> would agree with others when they say that once AHS has dried down, they are two very different fragrances, but I also don&#x27;t see the point in owning both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i use other brands like Gucci and YSL and Vera Wang.</li>
            <li> He used it up but will not be ordering it online again as he was informed that sometimes websites obtain colognes that have been taken out of retail stores due to shelf life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like scents other people have.</li>
            <li> the scent on the other product lasted what seemed to be all day.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON OR ANY OTHER PLACE</li>
            <li> + hours) compared to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It happened to me at k-mart just the other day.  </li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s if my wife and other women like it.</li>
            <li> I had purchased other products from Amazon before</li>
            <li> I went to Macy&#x27;s the other day to sample some of the colognes i had gotten and will be receiving.</li>
            <li> My signifcant other loves it and strangers</li>
            <li> It might be a little on the expensive side, but at the end of the day this product is worth</li>
            <li> I only wear it as a changeup smell when I&#x27;ve gotten tired of my current scent.</li>
            <li> Its an average strength cologne that wont choke people as they approach you but makes its presence well known, it also lasts longer then</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviews because clearly this is a bootleg product that Amazon is selling.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get Tonka bean from this, as the bass notes had be expecting.</li>
            <li> No, don&#x27;t wear it with flannel, and chop down trees, but it&#x27;s also not a perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cologne, and the price on amazon beats any in-store price hands down.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;eau de toilet\\&quot; has the same fragrance but is weak, weak, weak; i.e., markedly less \\&quot;intense\\&quot; than the cologne and wears off quickly.  </li>
            <li> Everything on Amazon is cheaper than retail, but my guess is the fragrances are overstock from the previous year, hence the surplus and knock down of price per ounce.</li>
            <li> Once you spay, the smeel disappears within 10 minutes or less.  </li>
            <li> is my second batch of fake Versace from different sources -</li>
            <li> often!He loves Kenneth Cole Black.</li>
            <li> Was elated to find it online for less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sweet.</li>
            <li> Givenchy Pour Homme (purple bottle).&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that it is a geat scent but not unique, as it smells almost exactely like Allure Homme Sport by Chanel.</li>
            <li> But all you need is a little refillable spray bottle which is being sold online and at shops.</li>
            <li> I have been on a cologne buying a cologne buying binge for a little while now.  </li>
            <li> I was a little Leary from some reviewers</li>
            <li> I doubt it is not original perfume or it is diluted.</li>
            <li> The emblem in the bottle is crooked and poorly replicated, not the same bottle, weak smell etc.</li>
            <li> Despite my horrible description of the scent, I can assure you that the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> This cologne will be your everyday goto signature scent.  </li>
            <li> believe this product is not genuine.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> but i will wear this all year round.</li>
            <li> this is going to be my everyday cologne.</li>
            <li> Everybody ask me everyday</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays on my chest before I dress does the trick.</li>
            <li> Wasted money because they don&#x27;t accept returns for this type of items and</li>
            <li> I will wear it for a few days and see if it grows on me.  </li>
            <li> The scent was not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of all the negative reviews about it being fake, but this is definitely the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Its fake, Waste of Money, Useless good for nothing, this is a bad Cologne.</li>
            <li> and if I do it is usually on a camera or a gadget.</li>
            <li> So he must have gotten a bottle that was past its expiration date.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this cologne, especially given the hype in all the reviews I read before buying it.</li>
            <li> WRONG, since these people only sampled it.</li>
            <li> Usually whenever I am switching colognes I would go to a store check it out</li>
            <li> I also have used Georgio Armani Aqua Digio in the past.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s almost useless.</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> This is second time I got FAKE item from them.</li>
            <li> I usually tell them its my &amp;#34;natural body scent&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I tried on a ton of different colognes at the shop, ranging from all the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I have never done a review for a fragrance, in fact I do very few reviews</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the actual sprayer is very poor.</li>
            <li> I use four sprays, I get roughly 6 hours which isn&#x27;t too bad actually.  </li>
            <li> Easily the worst sprayer of any cologne I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The price of vanity, but at least I&#x27;ll get what I&#x27;m paying for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was actually afraid to open it.</li>
            <li> But Versace Pour Homme is way less expensive.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day on me and is subtle.</li>
            <li> my preference is a subtle cologne, not over powering.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend to weak</li>
            <li> The newer review dates reflect this product as being a fake, fraud or not authentic.</li>
            <li> Im disappointed that amazon actually does this.</li>
            <li> Not a very impressive scent.</li>
            <li> Its a statement to all that you choose to give a crap about personal grooming.</li>
            <li> The base smell of this is the same as Acqua</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m tired of it</li>
            <li> I ordered this as mine had fallen and broken</li>
            <li> Needles to say we&#x27;re both disappointed especially where it&#x27;s on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just living this review base on my previous experience with the versace brand.</li>
            <li> Did a blind buy with this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend because he saw it at a retail store and it was really expensive.</li>
            <li> would not advise a blind buy on this one.</li>
            <li> And even though I don&#x27;t wear cologne all of the time, without fail over a compliment when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Was worried about a fake but checked and all is well.</li>
            <li> This is fake</li>
            <li> ONLINE IS FAKE...</li>
            <li> THE MEDUSA LOGO ON THE AMAZON LOOK SO FAKE.</li>
            <li> idk why ppl think this versace colognes r fake..</li>
            <li> completely fake DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I also use gucci guilty,</li>
            <li> This is so expensive in the shops</li>
            <li> , you cannot go wrong with this one.  </li>
            <li> saying that a lot of the sellers of cologne like to ship fake product.</li>
            <li> Its shame that AMAZON sells fake stuff.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Versace, you can tell it was crafted with quality.</li>
            <li> Works as a club cologne pick, or a casual encounter fragrance.</li>
            <li> Unless I got a fake this is a bad Cologne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It just misses out on the 5th star, as the longevity is disappointing, as is the sillage after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I never shop cologne on Amazon because I&#x27;m afraid about the quality.</li>
            <li> and she went crazy</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, or what.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not accusing anyone of anything, but I&#x27;ve read that a bad sprayer can be the sign of a counterfeit.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this cologne, you will not be disappointed..</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite cologne fresh scent everyone loves this scent , always get compliments</li>
            <li> this fragrance makes me feel like im an old person but lasts long and smells okay but to each their own</li>
            <li> This cologne is my favorite. Smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Fast and professional. :)</li>
            <li> Do not recommend to weak</li>
            <li> whenever i finish working out and hop out of the shower and would like to smell fresh and distinct i use Versace Pour Homme</li>
            <li> Did a blind buy with this one. I was expecting this product to smell good as the reviewers say, but IMO the scent notes stay very high in the citrus level. So if you&#x27;re looking for a citrus type of frag, I say sample this one at a store before buying. The product does last awhile and I have worn it all day, but the smell hasn&#x27;t changed at all. Have tried it for nearly a week and it looks like I&#x27;ll be either be shelving or selling this one. Giving it 2 stars because the scent does last long and 1 spray to the neck doesn&#x27;t project too much compared to other colognes.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Love it !!!</li>
            <li> Literally can&#x27;t get the girls to stop smelling me, so happy I added it to the arsenal... really good stuff</li>
            <li> Just received yesterday.  I was skeptical because of all the negative reviews about it being fake, but this is definitely the real deal.  I love the smell and mine is long lasting.  I sprayed a little spritz on the back of my hand and could still smell it this morning.  Very happy with this purchase from Amazon!</li>
            <li> the product is AMAZING....the recipient enjoyed it with such satisfaction, as did i...thank you thank you thank you</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  It&#x27;s affordable and not too strong.  If you&#x27;re unsure, try a sample at your local department store.  I was very pleased with my purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious ... Great price &amp; lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Second time I&#x27;ve purchased it. I was sketch a little from buying it on amazon, but it came on time and was exactly as it is in the store.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best cologne i have used.. this is actually my third bottle. i use other brands like Gucci and YSL and Vera Wang. I have been through a lot of different scents trying to find the right one for my style and personality but this is the one that has that special element that really yells who i am.. really like this scent good job Versace..</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend because he saw it at a retail store and it was really expensive. I wanted to see if I could find it online cheaper, and I did. Great! exactly the same as the one at retail price.</li>
            <li> This is by farthest the best cologne i have ever purchased. I have 212, Aqua Di Gio, Burberry, And many other name brands. This beats them all. Stays for a long long time.</li>
            <li> Im a snob. I initially received this as a present and didn&#x27;t touch it for a good 6 months.  Who wears Versace anymore. Well I tried it and loved it. I actually get tons of compliments from women and pretty much everyone around.  This cologne will be your everyday goto signature scent.  Sometimes you can&#x27;t judge a cologne by its designer.</li>
            <li> Everytime I have worn (used) this cologne I have received compliments from women.  The smell is a soft and clean scent that can be worn for any occasion.  The scent is very similar to Aqui Di (Armani) and Thallium Sport of which I recommend also.  The only complaint is the fragrance is light (soft) and does not last as long as other colognes.  The Amazon (and seller) service was first class.  Definitely add to your collection.</li>
            <li> Smells good but very weak projection and longevity.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this cologne it is great and lasts as hell i would recommend it to anyone who wants to smell classy</li>
            <li> Quite a captivating smell with this one.  I&#x27;ve used quite a few EDTs, and this is one of the best.  It&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s masculine, it&#x27;s the total package.  I own over a dozen higher end colognes, and so far, this is my #1 pick.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing value and a great fragrence.  My wife and kids love the smell- That&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
            <li> Great product and price!</li>
            <li> Excellent .Authentic . Came in full size and perfect condition . Price is also great , I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Versace Pour Homme By Versace Eau-de-toilette Spray has such a great smell to it. It also lasts all day. I get many comments on it. People also tend to ask \\&quot;what am I wearing?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am known to wear many perfumes. This spray by far is the best. I suggest all men to try #21 Micheal Jordan perfume. He has many lines of perfume and cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has great prices and shipping is always fast.</li>
            <li> My #1 favorite cologne. I switch between this and Issey Miyake. More mature scent than like Acqua Di Gio.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, love this cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Versace cologne, having worn Eau Fraiche for years. This cologne (Pour Homme) smells wonderful (at first even better than Eau Fraiche) but doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough for a cologne of this quality/price. It lingers on the skin for around an hour and on clothes for maybe three times that long but the scent degrades and changes in that three hour time.  It could be that I got a counterfeit bottle, but I&#x27;m not sure as the quality of the packaging and bottle appear to be authentic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to love the Versace line as I also use their Eau Fraiche and now the pour Homme. Its an average strength cologne that wont choke people as they approach you but makes its presence well known, it also lasts longer then my Eau Fraiche and from both beginning to end I just love the smell it keeps on me, this has now become my &#x27;scent&#x27; when it comes to colognes.</li>
            <li> I have never done a review for a fragrance, in fact I do very few reviews and if I do it is usually on a camera or a gadget. The reason I am making a statement is that I get more compliments with Versace than I ever got in my life. I am not a connoisseur of fragrances but one day I went to Macy&#x27;s and tried everything they wanted to throw at me and this is the one I liked. After a time I ran out and wondered if Amazon had a better price. They did, I ordered and got a bottle twice the size for the same price. What more can I say.</li>
            <li> My son-in-law got me started on this.  It is my current favorite fragrance and my wife loves it.  What more needs to be said?</li>
            <li> I am getting a lot of good comments about the smell of this product, And it truly smells great and I will reorder</li>
            <li> This cologne has a wonderful scent.  Rugged, woodsy, sexy.  When my husband first started using it the scent was strong and euphoric, you could smell it from across the room and it lasted most of the day.  But after several weeks it lost its potency in the bottle and when he sprayed it on himself the scent was nowhere near as strong and barely lasted an hour. Needles to say we&#x27;re both disappointed especially where it&#x27;s on the expensive side. He used it up but will not be ordering it online again as he was informed that sometimes websites obtain colognes that have been taken out of retail stores due to shelf life. So he must have gotten a bottle that was past its expiration date.</li>
            <li> Great quality and smell I recommend it</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this cologne, especially given the hype in all the reviews I read before buying it. The scent is pretty nice, I must admit, but it fades away so fast it makes me think I got a fake knockoff bottle or an old bottle. Definitely not what I expected for a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; cologne like Versace. I own many colognes, and I would recommend a lot of others before this one. Gucci, BLV, Bleu de Chanel, Prada Infusion; just to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise a blind buy on this one. Go into Macy&#x27;s and try it on and see how long it last. Good scent, but fades away like a much cheaper cologne.</li>
            <li> Hey the ladies really love how this smells on me ! 👍👍</li>
            <li> I bought Versace for a gift after reading the reviews and liked it so well I ended up buying another one for myself.  I am sensitive to certain types of colognes that cause me stuffiness, but this one gives me no adverse effects.  There are some other colognes that I personally prefer, but I have never received more compliments and inquiries about the Versace.  It&#x27;s also not too strong for work, so I&#x27;ve bumped this one to my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; choice.  Very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Product was fine. Came on time, looked great, great price, but I did not care for the smell of it after I wore it a few times. It was a little to strong for me. The vendor was great though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CM</li>
            <li> This fragrance is beautiful. That is the short story, but you want more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you spray it on, it opens with a citrusy/floral blast that is both fresh and delicate at once. This isn&#x27;t one where you need to wait for a half hour or so after spraying before you interact with others - the opening is very safe, and non-offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care about the bottle, and I really don&#x27;t understand why such emphasis is placed on the casing that no-one else sees, but if you do, it is very classy. A good looking bottle on your smell self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perhaps the best opening I have sniffed in a summer fragrance. It is very similar to Chanel&#x27;s Allure Homme Sport, but only at the start (the opening). The dry down in Allure Homme Sport takes it off in a very different, interesting direction. Versace does not. What you get at the opening is what you get all the way through. This is a very basic scent like that, and that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing! If you love the opening, you&#x27;ll love this for nearly 4 hours. That&#x27;s right - That&#x27;s all I get out of this fragrance. As it&#x27;s so light, and doesn&#x27;t transform in the dry down, the mids and bass notes are all but lost. I don&#x27;t get Tonka bean from this, as the bass notes had be expecting. AHS however does deliver Tonka after the dry down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would agree with others when they say that once AHS has dried down, they are two very different fragrances, but I also don&#x27;t see the point in owning both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent cloud for the first two hours is good, and gives off an exquisite, summery but sophisticated smell. It could be used for the office or as a signature scent, as it isn&#x27;t too imposing, and is very safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just misses out on the 5th star, as the longevity is disappointing, as is the sillage after a couple of hours. but I really do enjoy this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, comment or message me for any further details.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne for my husband, and I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and price.</li>
            <li> This cologne was the best one of my girl friends could find. It will stand out and is very unique.</li>
            <li> I own a whole shelf full of fine cologne, and Versace uses the highest quality ingredients, no question about it. The only complaint I have EVER heard about Versace is the cost (which can be greatly mitigated by shopping online). But trust me guys, you need to break down and open your wallets for this stuff, it lasts for hours upon hours, the smell will make girls melt, and the fact that they use real plant extracts (as opposed to using cheap synthetic ingredients made in a lab), which eliminates the risk of giving a migraine to that cute blonde you&#x27;re chatting up.</li>
            <li> Smells great and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Superb, high quality cologne/scent. Smells manly and sexy. Lasts all day on my husband; that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s the good stuff!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my Versace pour homme. Priced well below retail and arrived quickly. Product was unopened and in original packing.</li>
            <li> My original bottle bought at Macy&#x27;s broke so i decided to buy off Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this product is not genuine.  Once you spay, the smeel disappears within 10 minutes or less.  The original product does not do this.  In addition, once i suspected something wrong i looked more closely at the reviews and noticed many postings indicating the same thing.  Do NOT BUY this cologne,</li>
            <li> This cologne is the best ever.  I have tried lots of different scents through the years, and I got to tell ya, this stuff lasts ALL DAY LONG.  Two pumps and the women come runnin&#x27;. Do yourself a favor and buy a bottle, you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect summer fragrance!</li>
            <li> Best mens cologne on the market. Never go a day without one spray. Lasts a long time. Versace is the best.</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of my all time favorites. The scent is long lasting and kind of reminds me of the Nautica Voyage cologne. It is good for all day wear and perfect for warm weather. You don&#x27;t need to use very much because the scent carries well. I received many compliments from coworkers who say that the scent has a level tone but not too light or strong.  If you like colognes such as Nautica Voyage, Cool Water, or Polo Blue then you will like this one.</li>
            <li> smells great the wife loves it. has a nice sweet light smell that last all day even till the next day. worth every penny great price too.</li>
            <li> Have used the cologne for a couple yesrs. Great product for the price, and plenty of compliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Okay now, I saw some reviews saying that this perfume doesn&#x27;t last. WRONG, since these people only sampled it. This is a long-lasting perfume that YOU will not smell on you all the while.&lt;br /&gt;I also thought that it didn&#x27;t last when I first tried it on me. After 30 minutes, I couldnt smell it on me. But then I went out and EVERYBODY was telling me that I smelled GREAT. I got women just hanging on to me just to bury their faces into my chest or try to bite me on the neck. I only got similar reactions from Acqua di Gio and  Givenchy Pour Homme (purple bottle).&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that it is a geat scent but not unique, as it smells almost exactely like Allure Homme Sport by Chanel. Chanel may top this one as you can also smell it on you. But Versace Pour Homme is way less expensive. Chanel&#x27;s 50ml bottle costs more than Versace&#x27;s 100ml bottle... So you make your choice.</li>
            <li> this is just another great cologne by Versace...it last pretty well on me (5-7 hours) the scent is really Sweeeet. so if you are a Fragrance lovers, collectors this is a must have.</li>
            <li> Its fake, Waste of Money, Useless good for nothing, this is a bad Cologne.I have decided not to buy perfume on Internet as the is no guarantee that it is original.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I am very appreciative of the customer service and quality of the product.</li>
            <li> this is a very pleasant cologne and light, very good for the summer, which it lasts longer though. I would recommend it for people who use colognes and take them to work, keep them on your desk or something so that you can use them multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> I thought I would like this scent more than I do.  It is okay.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy again.  Just one of those things.  I really like Bang...but hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is: If you love Acqua di Gio, you will love this.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this Cologne. It seems like it could be a duller version of Aqua de gio which to me was a lil too much. It also has a hint of another cologne I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on, maybe cool water? It really has it&#x27;s on unique scent. I remember looking for cologne and I stumbled upon this and I know right away when I smell a cologne scent whether it will work for me or not. This cologne has what it takes for me. It was between this and chanel blue. However, I am not spending $100 dollars on cologne. This smells just as good and you will save yourself over $50 bucks. The other great thing is the spray works well, it puts out just enough so you&#x27;re not over doing it and it makes the bottle last longer. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Had some unique qualities to it, but also a little on the more common side of scents such as aquatics. Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance going on, but after a couple of hours I was left with a really sweet, perfumey, powdery smell and had to wash it off. Not one of my favorite colognes. It might be a good buy for others with different body chemistry--but for me it did not work.</li>
            <li> This ranks up there as one of the most complimented fragrances I own.  It has a sharp, sweet, tangy, soapy aqua nature to it thats simply an aphrodisiac to women.  Women have told me that I&#x27;m \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; when I wear this stuff... and when I ask how I&#x27;m \\&quot;toxic\\&quot;.... I am told.. \\&quot;in a good way, a verrrry good way\\&quot;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use four sprays, I get roughly 6 hours which isn&#x27;t too bad actually.  In my experience, it definitely lasts longer than the 1 hour other folks are claiming, although it does stay closer to the skin after about 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it&#x27;s still worn less frequently than Acqua di Gio, so considering all the variables I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worthy of a purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend. I love it! smells super sexy and it doesnt fade like the reviews say. Its not too stong ITs perfect!</li>
            <li> I consider myself a Cologne freak. You can say I have a collection. Over the years, I&#x27;ve collected so many colognes. I&#x27;m also very picky when it comes to them. First of, this product shipped so fast. Secondly, It&#x27;s LEGIT and authentic Versace, It even came sealed like a legit cologne should. Guys, if you&#x27;re thinking of getting this STOP thinking and just BUY it! You will not regret it! Fresh Scent. The ladies will love it! lots of compliments on it already.</li>
            <li> This smell is so amazing on my husband, it is a bit strong so you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! i get so many girls asking me what are you wearing and can not get enough. I had a Girl, she was drunk as all just turn around , look at me and straight press her face up to my chest and just take a big inhale. I swear it makes people wet.....i am crude but honest.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves it! it last all day!!! authentic :)</li>
            <li> I love this product!! The only reason why I would not recommend would be so I can still being the only person I know that wears it. Hahahaha!</li>
            <li> This smells great on my bf.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it. I love it when he wears it.&lt;br /&gt;The whole set is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Great as a Xmas gift</li>
            <li> Super product, a branD new hot item I got fir more than 45% off regular retail price but you gotta look for it!! Overall this is awesomeness</li>
            <li> My two fav colognes for years have been the classic Hugo Boss and Armani code. This time I was looking for a change and came across this one. Usually whenever I am switching colognes I would go to a store check it out and then order online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews for this product and trusted Versace. I was more than ecstatic when I got it. It is my new fav now. The seller was awesome as well - no hassels and arrived a day before their estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for classy evening wear.</li>
            <li> smells great, plus price is matched fairly..  bottle is heavy duty and supplies enough spray for only one time, which will keep you smelling &amp;#34; So Fresh and So Clean&amp;#34;.!!</li>
            <li> All I have to say is wow, smells very similiar to Chanel Allure Homme Sport with the exception that this doesn&#x27;t have the bitter citrus scent that I dislike.  I own around 60 fragrances and this is by far the most complimented.  Women love the top notes of citrus which project a mile and stay on my skin forever.  This has become my signature scent and I invested (wisely) in the 200ml bottle.  I cannot leave the house without getting asked what I&#x27;m wearing or being told I smell great.  And I think this is a bit synthetic smelling....but to each there own.  This is going to be a keeper in my collection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ok aroma not overpowering like others it do the jop  , can&#x27;t go wrong with this i recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many fragrances before and this product seems to not be a fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, unparalleled scent. I have a very good nose and this smells the same as the one I bought from the Versace store. Also checked the legitimacy of packaging/labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My/my gf&#x27;s favorite scent on me. Feel so freaking sexy and so good overall wearing this.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Versace Pour Homme on Monday and received it on the following Friday... The product came fully packaged and sealed.. It smells great and my fianc&amp;eacute; loves it!.. It&#x27;s a very versatile, non-offensive fragrance; you can where it anytime and anywhere.. If you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this cologne, you will not be disappointed..</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 different fragrances off of amazon, and the Pour Homme seems to be of the best quality. It lasts all day on me and is subtle. It&#x27;s not so subtle you don&#x27;t notice it though, just enough where it leaves you wanting more, which to me is a good thing. I&#x27;m 24, and am active, and wanted something that people near you know is there, and draws them in. Not draws them away. It&#x27;s like an interesting person at a party and you have to move closer to see what they&#x27;re saying, unlike the loud people you want to get away from. It is a perfect blend of sophistication and masculinity. No, don&#x27;t wear it with flannel, and chop down trees, but it&#x27;s also not a perfume. You&#x27;ll like it, ladies will love it.</li>
            <li> Authentic great smelling cologne! I love Amazon</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne and had it shipped home and when i got home and attempted to use it, the bottle would not spray...no matter what I tried the bottle would not spray, Highly disappointed</li>
            <li> It is pretty good and I like this pour so much. It smells comfortable and doesn&#x27;t make me dizzy. The most important, It is very cheap~</li>
            <li> Wonderful cologne and tremendous value!  Arrived on time and unbroken. 😀</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, but I like it so much that I&#x27;ve worn it too. Fresh fragrance. Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Everyone I encounter comments on it.  They want to know what it is and tell me that is the perfect scent for me.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Best scan ever!! I don&#x27;t like scents other people have. I like to be unique. And even though I don&#x27;t wear cologne all of the time, without fail over a compliment when I wear this.</li>
            <li> This is the cleanest smelling cologne I have found. I also have used Georgio Armani Aqua Digio in the past.  While I had plenty of compliments given to me when I wore Agua Digio, I have had even more when wearing Versace&#x27;s Pour Homme.</li>
            <li> As i was opening the box, to my surprise it was a much larger box than advertised, and I was like wait a minute. Then after opening, I actually received a GIFT SET, containing both the 3.4 ounce cologne as advertised AND Versace body and hair shampoo! Sweet! After unwrapping the protective film, I tell you not, my room was ENGULFED with the fragrance - completely validating the authenticity of the product. First night I went out with it, lasted me the whole evening. One of my favorites for a more fancy kind of scent...highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Didnt smell as strong as i hoped</li>
            <li> I have been using many major brands, but this Versace Pour Homme By Versace Eau-de-toilette Spray is my first try. I saw this product at Macy and cost $74 for 3.4oz or 100ml, and when i tried it, it smelled just like Aqua Di Gio, Giorgio Armani. Then i decided to look online, hopefully, i can get a better price but same quality. I never shop cologne on Amazon because I&#x27;m afraid about the quality. Anyway, for the first time I decided to buy this product from Perfumes4us, the seller,and it was great. Fast delivery and the same quality as the one at Macy. The smell lasts longer than i have expected. I have to say this one is more cheaper and better smell than Aqua Di Gio, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Greatness of colognes</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my cologne. Was worried about a fake but checked and all is well. I like the smell it makes me feel a little bit better than everyone else when I put this on. Its a statement to all that you choose to give a crap about personal grooming. The initial scent is strong flooding you with a regal ritzy blast of beautiful high notes of cedar wood and the bitter orange leaves followed by sage and amber notes. Want to try more of their colognes very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Versace Pour Homme wad everything I though it would be and more.  excellent fragrance.  the only problem I encountered was the bottle cap, it didn&#x27;t fit on the bottle correctly.  But that was okay.  I difinetly recommend this.product it is well worth it.  I might buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> Simply put, the scent is great. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same as the other bottle I purchased at a store, the scent on the other product lasted what seemed to be all day. This will last around 3-4 hours max before wearing off, which may explain the price of the product.</li>
            <li> This is fake because smell is not staying long as original. Original stands 1-2 days but this one was gone in 40 minutes! This is fake don&#x27;t take it better go to the store and buy there!!!!! I wasn&#x27;t buy in store because 60$ for 1.7 oz but now I see why! Better buy in store original!!! DON&#x27;T waste YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> Not one to brag, but I find myself to be a Cologne Aficionado.  Sampled and tested these in the field in every way possible.  I travel and go places.  Every time, Everywhere, combine all experiences, never have I had so many compliments, from women, real women, hot gorgeous beautiful women, and the regular ones too.  You know whose complement is better from than a woman?  If its from a beautiful woman.  At my work, gym, grocery store, club, mall, parties, sporting events, airports, bars, school.. doesnt matter, I would get a compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will officially never buy another cologne again as long as this is still in production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what you should do.&lt;br /&gt;1.  Buy this cologne&lt;br /&gt;2.  Buy Condoms&lt;br /&gt;3. Ware the cologne at your own risk&lt;br /&gt;4. Rage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be that guy other guys want to be, be epic, change your life today, put on your big boy pants, and prepare to never live life the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Welcome.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON OR ANY OTHER PLACE ONLINE IS FAKE...I GOT MINE FROM AMAZON LLC ABOUT A YEAR AGO ALTHOUGH THE SMELL IS NOT BAD I ALWAYS WAS SUSPICIOUS ABOUT IT...SO I GOT ONE FROM A VERSACE ITALY STORE AND WHAT A DIFFERENT..EVERY LOGO IS DIFFERENT..THE MEDUSA LOGO ON THE AMAZON LOOK SO FAKE. ATTACH ARE SOME PICTURE EMPTY ONE IS FROM AMAZON</li>
            <li> Nice cologne.....my preference is a subtle cologne, not over powering. This is exactly what this cologne is; good for everyday use by professionals.</li>
            <li> Ok, first off girls can&#x27;t stay off me when I put this stuff on, seriously. 4 girls crowded around me in first period asking what I was wearing, I&#x27;m talking two of them even sprayed some on them because it apparently \\&quot;is sexy as hell\\&quot;. One of them described that it made them wanna rip my clothes off, but I had a girlfriend so you know..but anyways this stuff smells top dollar, and for 40 bucks online after paying 70 in the store for my first bottle, it&#x27;s a steal. And after owing 14 other bottles of various colognes..this takes the cake ladies and gents.</li>
            <li> Love the clean fresh scent!  Not at all over powering.  While grocery shopping someone stopped me and said I hope you don&#x27;t mind I just had to know what fragrance I was wearing, she loved it</li>
            <li> The packaging was amazing and honestly it was the best price (I even checked in-stores including outlets and online). Smells great and I get plenty compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume. It has a unique smell which will be different than many other designers. The price on Amaxzon was great and this was a good value for a designer perfume which is typically very expenise at local retailers.</li>
            <li> I like the *real* Versace, and this fragrance in particular; but this product is so-so. Actually, it&#x27;s almost useless. I&#x27;m used to the cologne product.  This \\&quot;eau de toilet\\&quot; has the same fragrance but is weak, weak, weak; i.e., markedly less \\&quot;intense\\&quot; than the cologne and wears off quickly.  I need 10 sprays to even come close to the effect I get with 3 of the cologne.  Then it wears off like I never used it.  Next time, I&#x27;ll go to the department store and buy the cologne at the counter and spend a few more bucks.  The price of vanity, but at least I&#x27;ll get what I&#x27;m paying for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people giving 5 stars for this are either shills or they&#x27;ve never used the real cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband and I equally love this product. It&#x27;s light and fresh. A clean citrus smell. Plus, the shipping was s fast and the price was half of what you would normally pay for good cologne. Super impressed!</li>
            <li> Many compliments on the fragrance! I would highly recommend this perfume to any man! It is not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome! My new favorite smell good. I will definitely buy this again smell good when this bottle goes empty, thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my guy&#x27;s favorite smell-good and he loves it.  Great price and we always shop here for it! Stay stocked up as we get it twice a year.</li>
            <li> Fast service, great quality! I bought this for my husband and we both love it. Item was as described and even came with a bonus!</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. Clean crisp fresh scent that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modern smell; not overpowering and musky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received many compliments on it</li>
            <li> My goodness! I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough words in the human dictionary to describe how amazing and great this cologne smells all I can say is when you&#x27;re walking in an office full of women and you noticed they stop turn around and see who is smelling that freaking amazing you know that you&#x27;re getting the job done!</li>
            <li> idk why ppl think this versace colognes r fake..i wear versace my choice for colognes n everythng here is legit so happy about it..im goin to buy more from this ppl</li>
            <li> Great scent that can be applied during all four seasons. Clean and crisp with a slight hint of citrus. A true and rare find of a scent for men.</li>
            <li> The product was received as expected, in a timely manner and well protected by packaging. Definitively, I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Just got this today argggggh! Damn i knew $40 was too good to be true for a 4.3 ounce ...completely fake DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing last the entire day got a couple compliments about the smell. Just don&#x27;t spray alot or the smell starts to become to much</li>
            <li> Ladies &amp; nGentlemen, this stuff gets compliments everytime I where it.  The gilrs love to give hugs when&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got this stuff on.  Buy it now!!!!</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast!  I got the large bottle, and it was worth it.  I get a lot of complements because it smells amazing!  I purchased it after some of my friends and I had a conversation about it for almost an hour.  This is some of the best clone that I have owned for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I usually and almost exclusively use the CH 212 pop and though i love it and it is for me the best perfume i ever used, i wanted another fragrance to change a little bit. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time...transaction was smooth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who like Acqua Di Gio would like this. I am a big fan of Acqua so wanted to try this out. The base smell of this is the same as Acqua but i find this to have more color to it. Been receiving compliments all the time i have it on. Another thing...the smell stays on for freaking long time! im not even kidding!...i would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heaven in a bottle! I bury my face in my boyfriends chest just to smell it! Shoot I use it sometimes!</li>
            <li> I own couple colognes. Fierce by A&amp;F,Armani sport code ,blue by Chanel, acqua di gio and Versace the dreamer .I am a college student and Fierce has been my favorite for school days ,because I keep it in my bag and before class I just spray it and get great compliments as soon as I walk into the class room I see the smelling expression on people&#x27;s  noses with satisfaction and one girl that sits to me one time told me that I smell amazing really amazing and she went crazy my face turned red.So for me fierce always will be my school cologne because college girls tends to love it .At work I use the dreamer by Versace because I really love this smell .However it&#x27;s not the best cologne for the spring&amp;summer ,so I usually use the acqua di gio but it lasts good but I&#x27;m tired of it and this cologne is so mainstream almost all guy uses it so I&#x27;m someone who always likes new stuff .I smelled Versace pour homme in Macy&#x27;s and it seemed familiar ,I sprayed once on my arm and then after work I went to play soccer and after that I took a shower and guess what the smell was still there and drydown was even more beautiful ,so as usual I ordered from Amazon(directly sold by Amazon )because it&#x27;s always cheaper  and I&#x27;ll receive in couple days and I hope it will last the same amount of time .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit :Just received it and it&#x27;s the same smell as it was in the department store only half price ,I&#x27;m in love with this smell ,will be my signature in summer .It&#x27;s good to mention that I only buy products that sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Purchase this for my husband, he love the smell so do I.  Try some on myself, not to strong  a women could wear it.</li>
            <li> my man loves it.  It is not overpowering.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it for him.</li>
            <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve had in years!!</li>
            <li> Love this. It smells GREAT. Lasts all day(10+ hours) compared to the other reviews. Spray twice on shirt around nipples, once on neck/chest and once in the back of your neck and you&#x27;ll be good to go! This is authentic as well. Great packaging and the bottle is very well crafted. Yet to see how the females react to it but I have only had it for around a week or so.</li>
            <li> bought this for my son because I smelled it in Ulta and most of the women/ladies/girls all liked it when I took it around and asked them to smell it.  There are not very many scents I really like a lot but I finally found one after several years!</li>
            <li> Shipped in 3 business days.  No problem</li>
            <li> Was impressed with how much I got for the price and that it came with shampoo as we&#x27;ll, my boyfriend was very happy and so was I :)</li>
            <li> Versace pour homme,all what I can say its little expensive but it makes you smell good for about 10 hours I guess.</li>
            <li> This cologne is up there with a great scent (and price)!  It&#x27;s well worth it. I remembered I wore this cologne the next day I bought it and my wife could not stay away from me.  She said I smelled so good.  This cologne can be added to your collection but after buying this scent, you really don&#x27;t need much more.</li>
            <li> Versace Pour Homme is my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance - elegant and clean.  Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It is the best one!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so good that everyone ask me what is the perfume I&#x27;m using.&lt;br /&gt;I liked to buy with this seller, my package arrived before they expect.&lt;br /&gt;It was a great deal.</li>
            <li> lets start of by saying that...man this scent is incredible, i have a few colognes and this on is one of the top 3. so many compliments. a fresh cool scent perfect for summer or spring but i will wear this all year round. this is a excellent blind buy. doesn&#x27;t last too long but long enough for me...</li>
            <li> Very nice smell . One of my favorites . I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon twice with no problems . Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> First let say that from now on....this is going to be my everyday cologne. I was a bit curious purchasing cologne from Amazon.....but after I read some of the comments on here about how good this cologne is, I gave it a try....man oh man.....it smells so good and fresh I&#x27;m speechless..... I&#x27;m planning to get a few extra bottles! I definitely recommended this without any doubt. Go get yours!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cologne, and the price on amazon beats any in-store price hands down. If you can wait a few days, order this now and you&#x27;ll have it soon enough at a lower price. The only reason not to buy this is if you absolutely HAVE TO have it now.</li>
            <li> Great smell, love this brand.</li>
            <li> clean scent that doesn&#x27;t over-power</li>
            <li> Wow! Great scent. Love all the Versace colognes.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume for me is the best one.  Everybody ask me everyday what kind perfume I go on it.  I love Versace Pour Homme</li>
            <li> The aroma from this cologne is a cross of masculinity and sensuality.  It warrants a lot of positive feedback once applied.  I personally felt that the scent doesn&#x27;t wear off too soon.  A little goes a long ways.  A couple of sprays a day works wonders.  I give this cologne a slight edge over Givenchy (another wonderful cologne), due to cost effectiveness and I think that the scent from Versace&#x27;s line lasts longer.  This is a smart buy that is sure to tantalize senses with a pleasurable smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling cologne I could try. And I was going to pay $50 for a smaller quantity then I saw the price on here! It also came with a sample size of the body/hair wash.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very clean and is not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t have a musky scent, but a slightly sweet (not too sweet though) aroma. It may be a little strong when first put on but I can&#x27;t complain because after that it is the perfect strength. It lasts a good 6 hours. I found me smelling myself throughout the day like: &amp;#34;Damn, who smells that good? Oh that&#x27;s me!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love it and at a good price</li>
            <li> You can wear this all year long. Great fragrance to wear to the office. I wouldn&#x27;t call this a scent to wear to the club, it&#x27;s more of a casual work scent. I can guarantee that you will not offend anyone while wearing this fragrance. I&#x27;d still recommend smelling this fragrance before you buy it. It&#x27;s a great scent, but not great enough to warrant a blind buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 7/10&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 6/10&lt;br /&gt;Smell: 7/10&lt;br /&gt;Buy/Try/Pass: Try</li>
            <li> I like this cologne alot it is deff worth the price i paid compared to stores. i highly recommend this fragrance, works well with anyday</li>
            <li> Ladies love it, girls adore it. Even the ones who never saw it like the way that I rhyme out control...</li>
            <li> I get nothing but compliments when I wear this cologne.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> it smells great, my normal day to day fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smelled like alcohol. Plain and simple don&#x27;t buy. I promise</li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling fresh daily.  Just a few sprays on my chest before I dress does the trick.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time. The scent is certainly a cut above. It is sweet yet masculine.  And not overpowering.  I also use gucci guilty, Bvlgari man, dolce &amp; gabbana light blue, and Armani diamonds; this is my go to scent.</li>
            <li> Great experience,  satisfied as always</li>
            <li> This is an amazing smelling and lasting cologne, and believe me I have tried them all, and this is by far the best overall!!</li>
            <li> great price, authentic</li>
            <li> lo probe y aparte que huele muy rico,solo con una rociadita el olor permanece en mi casi todo el dia ..es un producto 100% original</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne for someone who is not interested in an extremely strong smelling cologne...  great product.  Great price as well.</li>
            <li> While I was surprised to find a body was in the box with this it doesn&#x27;t makeup for the lack of staying power. Yes I know, it&#x27;s and Eau de toilette but still, it lasts just as long as the cheaper adidas knock offs, that smell just as good.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and has a very versatile wear. It&#x27;s technically a summer-ish scent, but it&#x27;s been my go-to for over a year straight now</li>
            <li> WOW !!!!! what a fantastic deal. This is so expensive in the shops so thought I would just see if it was any cheaper through Amazon and was thrilled to find such a great deal as this is my husbands favourite. Arrived very quickly and was well packaged. Very very happy</li>
            <li> I like smell of this product and it lasts for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to worry about that.</li>
            <li> I spend 30% of my income on the finest colognes, and I can assure you that this cologne is one of the finest. I am very picky, so when something pleases me, it has to be one of the finest. And this includes women, I only sleep with the finest, and I only wear the finest colognes. This cologne is great. Go get it and see yourself linking up with very fine, cute women of substance.</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes I own, I generally wear this cologne on special occasions it is to good for just everyday wear. This cologne has a very bold distinct refined and enticing smell that exudes confidence and grabs attention, it is also very masculine and not to sweet smelling. This cologne also lingers and stays with you all day it doesn&#x27;t fade or wear off it is definitely a must have for any cologne collection.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, it appeared to be a used Christmas wine box hastily taped together with bits of wrapping paper still on it under used tape. I was actually afraid to open it. Not professional at all. When I finally gathered my courage to open it (I still was not sure exactly what it was or who it was from) to my horror, the product was not only NOT the size specified but had also been used. I picked the tattered box and it&#x27;s used contents, chucked it in the garbage cans outside and sterilized the counter upon which I had opened it. I would have been better off opening up my car window and throwing the money out onto the highway.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, not overpowering or repulsive like some colognes can be. It also doesn&#x27;t smell cheap like those overly sweet perfumes tend to smell.</li>
            <li> Well recommend perfume is somewhat complicated, but in my opinion not bad in principle has a peculiar odor strong something but then changes its aromatic notes and say something citric, if you likes perfumes with soft citrus notes this is your choice , as seen spending time going to like me more essence.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite fragrance tho I&#x27;m a female!!</li>
            <li> Fianc&amp;eacute; and I love this scent!</li>
            <li> Soft and experience smell that you can wear going out in black tie or blue jeans...</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents ever. Fresh and citrusy. It does mix differently with various body chemistries. Try it in a store somewhere first, then purchase on line.</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of the best, its stay long,</li>
            <li> Had this cologne years ago and it literally got me dates and hit on all the time!! I&#x27;d have girls in stores going wow you smell great! what is that!?!&lt;br /&gt;great size bottle it&#x27;s gonna take me quite awhile to use it, just make sure you don&#x27;t over do it. One or two sprays is more than enough it generally lasts all day I put some in a portable sprayer to add a single spray later in the day if I needed to.</li>
            <li> I choose this rate because I received the item very well.&lt;br /&gt;The product is genuine, and I recomend for another constumers.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Fl&amp;aacute;vio</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. All the girls at work go crazy for me because they love the smell. They ran up to me and started smelling me hahaha.</li>
            <li> i tried it and i get alot of complement at work. to tell you the truth i had more than  complement for just using this cologne even though it an old product from versace. i still get some complements till date.</li>
            <li> I find this to be one of the most manliest smelling fragrances I&#x27;ve bought. I don&#x27;t even like wearing it too often. I only wear it as a changeup smell when I&#x27;ve gotten tired of my current scent.</li>
            <li> Smell does not really last.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; excellent product!</li>
            <li> What up playas, add this to your arsenal of pick up tricks.  Gets the ladies attention by scent alone, I&#x27;m not kidding you broseph. It happened to me at k-mart just the other day.  Also great for covering up smoke and stripper scents.  Comp this!</li>
            <li> Great price and smells amazing. Wonderful gift!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, long lasting.</li>
            <li> The real deal; not fake</li>
            <li> ...but if you&#x27;re on a trip and forgot, just stop by a Sephora and ask for a sample of this/anything.  Pro tip.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Verscace is my cologne of choice. If you are looking for a clean, subtile scent at a fair price give this a try.</li>
            <li> Awesome price, fast delivery, smells great, looks really good, i am extremely satisfied with this product and all the ladies love it! ;)</li>
            <li> love the smell, but fragrance doesn&#x27;t last too long…seems non existent after just a couple of hours...</li>
            <li> A bit costly bot worth it for sure.  Its a very subtle but very nice scent and all the girls really do love it.  This bottle tends to last me almost a year.</li>
            <li> Loved it!  The price was unbeatable!  Cannot find this in stores and it is the only cologne my husband will wear.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle that was half the amount and double the $ and a dept. store and when I walked out I was like, I&#x27;ll check amazon. Guess what? Better $ and more. 3.2 oz instead of 1.7. I turned around and returned it. Ordered on amazon, saved and got it quick. Smells great. You don&#x27;t need to look anymore!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne ever! Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Perfect item. I got the bonus bottle of hair &amp; shampoo with the perfume. I really like the smell of it a lot. THX</li>
            <li> My husband loves the citrusy scent</li>
            <li> This is Versace&#x27;s quintessential summer cologne.  It is never offensive but always alluring.  It is masculine without being overpowering.  Frankly, the best way to describe it is to say that wearing it is like going to the beach.  It is like a brisk ocean breeze.  It makes you feel like you are on vacation all day long.  Of course, with Versace you always get great longevity.</li>
            <li> Really good smelling cologne and pretty darn positive it&#x27;s all real. Like some people have said it is not a very long lasting cologne. After a couple hours it&#x27;s barely there. But all you need is a little refillable spray bottle which is being sold online and at shops. Carry it around and you are all good to go.</li>
            <li> He loves this cologne  but it was so expensive everywhere else ! So happy you had it and at such a great price !</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever.  so glad i purchased this, you cannot go wrong with this one.  ladies can&#x27;t resist it, trust me</li>
            <li> good , cheap, attracts people and it is a fragance i have never found before. good for every mn with a callenge for himself</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t. The newer review dates reflect this product as being a fake, fraud or not authentic. Owe how I wish I read the dates. The emblem in the bottle is crooked and poorly replicated, not the same bottle, weak smell etc. if you got money to burn then buy this, take it to a store to compare, then come back and one star this seller. Unfortunate but true. Suggest that if you&#x27;re a Pour Homme fan, or want to be, go buy it in person. You&#x27;re not saving anything here. Yes an Eau-du is lighter than straight cologone. But this is no Versace Eau-du</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it since it had a similar scent to another cologne I own, the first phase of the smell faded in ~10mins, and the after scent lasted for ~3 hours.</li>
            <li> Basically what I said in the title. Go to any ripoff department store and you will pay 2x for 75% of the size. This is genuine, last for a long time. Ive been using it for 2 months now every day and I used up maybe 5%.</li>
            <li> A friend wears this at work and it last all day so i loved it since.  i decided to surprise my husband and buy it for him. he loves it, the scent is light but masculine. very fresh.</li>
            <li> The best men&#x27;s cologne that I have used so far, great smell, stays on for a long time. Will be using it from now on, Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use Versace pour Homme regularly, and this one has a similar fragrance but lasts about 5 minutes before completely disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second batch of fake Versace from different sources - I will never buy it on line again.</li>
            <li> I am one hundred percent satisfied with this cologne. I get so many complements when I wear it. Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this to a family event or at work they always ask me what im wearing, I recommend this to all men</li>
            <li> Authentic Versace Perfume. Very good seller. Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> BoughT this for my Grandson. It was on his wish list. He was very happy with it. Good price, too.</li>
            <li> The item arrived sooner than expected and it&#x27;s a great deal for the price! it made for the perfect gift.</li>
            <li> How does a guy rate a cologne? For me, it&#x27;s if my wife and other women like it. Well, it&#x27;s mostly if my wife likes it, and she does indeed, but i do get a lot of compliments from women. It has a fresh slightly citrus quality that lasts fairly well on me, slightly strong at first but settles down quite nicely in a matter of minutes. I travel a lot for business and, while I have a choice of nice colognes to take with me, I always grab the Versace. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Best cologne I have ever smelled for a man! It&#x27;s a light yet refreshing and sweet smell. My man doesn&#x27;t go a day without wearing it. I love it as much as he does!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as mine had fallen and broken and I loved the product so much, I thought that I would purchase it again(original received as present).  I had purchased other products from Amazon before so I did not hesitate this time in which I should have.  When it arrived I put a small spray of it on me and probably within 10 minutes you could not smell it before which was not the case with the original bottle that I had.  I should have listened to the reviews because clearly this is a bootleg product that Amazon is selling.  Please do not order from here, just suck it up and go to the store where you know that you will be getting an authentic product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent of this perfume.  It is clean and fresh.  What I don&#x27;t like is I have to reapply often.  The scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you very long.  But I truly love the perfume</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m very particular about my versace for my hubby but this product is true quality for an amazing steal, highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> This cologne is very aquatic with a dry-down that is very appealing. The bottle it self is very gorgeous , Many people want to compare this to aqua di gio . But the thing is, that this is nothing like it , very different and unique longevity is decent with 4-5 hour if applied correctly.</li>
            <li> If the wife loves it, that&#x27;s all I need to know...&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the actual sprayer is very poor. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, or what. The spray is not a fine mist, it&#x27;s more like a crooked jet stream, and does not deliver very much product. Easily the worst sprayer of any cologne I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m not accusing anyone of anything, but I&#x27;ve read that a bad sprayer can be the sign of a counterfeit. I hope it&#x27;s not. The scent is great, but the poor sprayer makes me wonder.</li>
            <li> I love cologne. I buy it often and use it quite frequently. And among all of the various colognes I have ever owned, this is probably one of my favorite. Versace is a beautiful smell--very crisp, clean, and fresh. It resembles Acqua Di Gio, but is unique its own way. I get many compliments on this each time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing (probably one of the more important things) is that it lasts a while. Many colognes are guilt of fading throughout the day, but Versace actually lasts the entire day. I would recommend this for the most discerning lad looking to smell great.</li>
            <li> The Bottle i ordered was what i received promptly, after so many positive comments. It does work well,stays on for 2 or 3 hours. But not as great as i expected it to be from its reviews.I probably imagined its smell different.I had got it for my husband as a gift and he doesn&#x27;t seem to wear it often!He loves Kenneth Cole Black.This is my perception probably.</li>
            <li> My totally favorite cologne for my man! Awesome! Strangers every where stop him and ask what he is wearing. I will always buy this until they quit selling. Kudos Versace!</li>
            <li> Great Deal but I was informed by my girlfriend that Versace tests it&#x27;s products on animals. Visit the Body Shop for Animal Friendly Products or end up in the dog house.</li>
            <li> I, like most, are hesitant on buying cologne online. Never have I done it before. I recently ordered 9 colognes, All but 1 were through individual vendors who I thought I could trust to send me the real thing and not some outdated stuff. This Versace stuff was the only one that I ordered through Amazon directly. I started to get colognes in the mail the other day and most smell very powerful and long lasting. 2 smelled like nothing. I went to Macy&#x27;s the other day to sample some of the colognes i had gotten and will be receiving. I tried out this Versace stuff and could barely smell it. But it arrived today and I must say it is way, way more stronger of a scent than the one I tried at Macy&#x27;s...no joke. And it came as a gift set. Bonus! Awesome! I do like to keep the individual boxes though to keep my cologne out of light. And this came as the bonus box but oh well. still nice!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband and it smells absolutely amazing.  Very fresh , clean and sensual scent.  Very many compiments on the smell.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I thought I was ordering a 3.4oz bottle of cologne but instead it was a 3.4oz bottle of cologne and a travel size body wash.  Not exactly what I wanted but still a great product.</li>
            <li> It is a good buy. It never fails. It stays on for long and is appreciated by all my friends.</li>
            <li> Yes, People tend to ask me when i am wearing this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;It stays for long. Its a must have if you really want a good perfume. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> spells wonderful and love it on my husband. great present for the one you love! valentines day is coming up!</li>
            <li> I Purchased this Scent Based on Opinions and Reviews of Others. So i would like to commend those Who Reviewed and add to that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this Scent is a Strong Masculine Scent Very Crisp and to the Point. It has been a Wonderful Addition to my Collection and a Favorite! Females Love! and i do me Love This Scent. Its a very good Scent to Be Noticed and make a statement. Versace will definitely get you some compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a Very Enjoyable Scent, Not to Strong to the point its going to give you a headache. But Strong enough to get you noticed from several Feet Away! Does leave a bit of a Scent Trail which.. is definitely good for those ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versace Pour Homme Lasts.. and Lasts. A Top Quality Scent for a Wide Variety of Men. My Father who is very old Fashioned with his choices of Scents, Typically store bought scents nothing more then $15 is what he looks for. When he Smelled Versace Pour Homme he Immediately asked where i purchased it and what it was Called. He now has his own Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need is 2 - 3 Squirts Neck/chest, Back of head/neck. And your Good For Many Hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a Top Scent! Great high Quality Scent. Highly Recommend Purchasing a Bottle!</li>
            <li> This was the first cologne I&#x27;ve bought, it smells amazing. It lasts all day with 1 spray, and isn&#x27;t overpowering in the slightest. I don&#x27;t wear it anymore as it reminds me of my first girl friend who I bought it to please, but its an amazing scent. The bottle is also very nice.</li>
            <li> Smells great,  last about 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t like the cologne and most probably I won&#x27;t be buying it again. However, I just get compliments upon compliments, mostly from fat or ugly chicks, but that&#x27;s beside the point. I have very rarely gotten compliments on my colognes. When I started wearing this cologne, it was like everybody was asking me for the name of the cologne.</li>
            <li> Not a very impressive scent. Not a fan at all. Unless I got a fake this is a bad Cologne.</li>
            <li> I used it and it is great. Nice subtle fragrance for around 8 hours.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my dad and he liked it. So I am happy.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. It was a good price and I have had a lot of compliments by using this product. I recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I have many top name colognes, and know that only a few sprays is all it takes for a good scent. I literally sprayed 4 times on each arm, and 5 on my upperbody/neck...barely a scent in less than an hour. I have my doubts as to whether this is authentic Versace...Amazon should not be selling this product as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;As I have read in many reviews, people come back to a cologne and give it a second try, and love it. I had to wear this several times before I came to appreciate its subtleness. Nice scent that does not project as much as some of my other colognes. Still, I continue to get compliments on this scent from women 20-40&#x27;s. It is still there on my skin after work...faint, but very pleasant. This is the antithesis to the 80&#x27;s power fragrances. You will smell great without offending.</li>
            <li> I like it , ITS A GOOD FRAGRANCE, ITS FRESH,,  I LOVE THE SMELL ;  GOD BLESS YOU, THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...and so does the wife :O)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for the first time at Macy&#x27;s for $80.  It was a gift set, so it came with aftershave, but who uses that stuff these days?? This is the exact same thing (minus aftershave) and I paid 1/2 that price - and it comes with shampoo, which do use (great for gym bag).  Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I compared this cologne to one my roommate had from dillard&#x27;s and this is absolutely fake!!!!! The smell does not last at all! Do not buy this, I have purchases cologne online before. This is a bad buy!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne as a little present for my fianc&amp;eacute;! he absolutely loved it! smells amazing &amp; bottle as described. Also the smell stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne I ever came across... makes you go mmmmmmm when you sniff it. I got a free trial sample and am definitely buying a big bottle of it</li>
            <li> this smells amazing. my wife love the way it smells on me. i get alot of compliments when im out in public and in close proximity to other people.. i love it.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh, and ladies love it.</li>
            <li> I have been on a cologne buying a cologne buying binge for a little while now.  Of the ones that I have purchased, I must say that this one has the best scent of them all.  Its not too strong or overpowering, yet the scent stays on you all day.</li>
            <li> This specific item is really misleading and I really don&#x27;t like what I received. First, it&#x27;s a gift pack, which includes a body shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;(2) The Eau-de-toilette fragrance is non existant for a Versace product.A poor imitation for the real 6.7oz product that I baught&lt;br /&gt;3 months earlier. I would not buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a choice for those that do not like overpowering , yet want to smell WONDERFUL. I LOVE this on my husband, only down said is so do all the ladies he works with :). He always get compliments when he wears this, can&#x60;t say the same for his others. Two of our kids also have sensitivities and this does not bother them at all. We just love it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!...not only did i receive genuine versace pour homme but it also came with hair and body shampoo too! That was a great surprise!....I cannot express how awesome this product is...</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a gift for a friend and he loved it :) he said it&#x27;s refreshing, and last for a long time</li>
            <li> Came fast great price smells good.</li>
            <li> My son loves this cologne, however my pockets don&#x27;t :-). I priced this exact bottle at a fine department store and it was double the price. Was elated to find it online for less. This cologne smells great and is not too overbearing. Thanks, I will be back.</li>
            <li> I thought that I had already left positive feedback. No problem with the product at all. No problem with the shipper. I will by the same product again. I will attempt to use the same seller!!</li>
            <li> This has to be his favorite. If your wondering if it&#x27;s good I suggest you try it. You will come back and review it with 5 stars!!!! God Bless :)</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice for summer but it doesn&#x27;t last too long, maybe 2 or 3 hours. Its good for all ages</li>
            <li> Shipped quicker than expect, the cologne smells exactly like my last bottle and the bottle itself didn&#x27;t have any problems like my last one.  Def recommend this to anyone else.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what the recipient wanted, so I did well to find it here!  All-in-all, an excellent size and a great scent for a young businessman.</li>
            <li> I can barely keep my hands off my husband whenever he wears this cologne!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite for sure!!  Great scent - trust me it makes the ladies swoon ... I wear it all the time</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and was a bigger bottle than expected.  LOVE this fragrance.. Everyone wanted a spray of it.. Great price as well. :)</li>
            <li> Extreme quality for the price: presentation, sillage, longevity, overall scent is arguably the best in its class. If you ask 100 people how they like it while you&#x27;re wearing it, you MIGHT find ONE that isn&#x27;t in love with it. Men and women both love it, but women in particular may be unexplainably attracted to you. Just a warning.</li>
            <li> First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail. If all those are a yes for me then I will give it 5 stars. I am not just rating it 5 stars cause its the best product of its class, that is for each person to decide. I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am 3 for 3 on colonges I have bought off Amazon, I get the real items and they have all smelled great. I have looked these up in the store and all 3 are stated as Eau-De-Toilette which is a less powerful mixture. If you dont understand it than you need to look it up. But this is what stores sell and this smelled the exact same as it did in the store. Last for around 6-8 hours but can still be smelled up close. I plan on buying a few more off here in the future.</li>
            <li> I love colognes, but I am very selective. I tend to avoid colognes with powerful scents because I prefer more of a subtle, and summery smell rather than a strong scent that makes a statement when your in a crowd. I actually got this item as a gift, and did not know what to expect. I was aware that Versace is a very well known company and held very high by many, including my father, so I had very high hopes for it. My father worked in the perfume/cologne business his whole life and he informed me that this cologne is made from high quality materials. When I first used it, I did not know what to expect. To my surprise it was very subtle, fresh and clean but it smelled wonderful. It has a very unique smell, kind of fruity but perfect for men. Despite my horrible description of the scent, I can assure you that the smell is amazing. The duration of the cologne is amazing. I can put on two sprays worth in the morning, and it will last throughout he whole day, and on to the next. My girlfriend absolutely adores it when I wear this cologne, and I have received multiple compliments while wearing this cologne. It might be a little on the expensive side, but at the end of the day this product is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I helped make your decision easier! Write to me if you have any comments or question, thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> This was my first cologne purchase from amazon. I was a little Leary from some reviewers saying that a lot of the sellers of cologne like to ship fake product. I just made sure I was buying direct from amazon and had no problems at all. Super fast arrival and this scent smells great. If your worried about smell than just go to a store and smell it than come home and buy it from amazon super cheap. I will definitely buy more cologne from amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> this cologne smell great and wasn&#x27;t badly priced. got this for my boyfriend for valentines day and he loved it ! even the body wash has a pretty strong smell :)</li>
            <li> Even though this perfume is not that for long but it is surely fabulous and i love it. This is my 8th bottle</li>
            <li> My husband and son both really like this, and that&#x27;s saying a lot since their generations and professions couldn&#x27;t be further apart.  Best thing is I love it, too.</li>
            <li> I tried this in a department store and loved it. Wen we received the cologne my husband has tried it several times,but I can never smell it on him.  The scent was not strong at all.</li>
            <li> Good seller!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it. Lasts long, smells good, looks good. That&#x27;s what  I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal! Nice</li>
            <li> Very good product, the best mark in the vendor announced, 100 percent patched, ESPECIALLY THAT Nara seeking something useful and good</li>
            <li> My boyfriend usually uses Acqua Di Gio By Giorgio Armani, but he really likes this one too~ It&#x27;s a nice perfume to wear anywhere :)</li>
            <li> Just received it today, tried it immediately, 15 minutes later couldn&#x27;t smell anything. I though I might got used on smell, asked my girlfriend that arrived home in meantime, and she barely could smell it of my wrist . Its shame that AMAZON sells fake stuff. This is second time I got FAKE item from them. First time I ordered light blue from dolce gabbana for me and my girlfriend, her is real and mine came fake. I didn&#x27;t say anything but this is too much. Wasted money because they don&#x27;t accept returns for this type of items and there is no even a link for customer service. Im disappointed that amazon actually does this. I&#x27;ve been ordering from amazon store purposely so this kind of thing doesn&#x27;t  happen... Shame on you amazon</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant, complex scent with a very subtle presence, long lasting, which releases very nice notes at different levels throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rated it one star less than perfect because, along with purchasing this scent, I did a lot of research on many colognes and purchased 2 others, which from the ratings of women whom have smelled all 3, rate this as a very very nice 2nd - but since I like variation and alternate between scents on different days, this is and will continue to be up there as a favorite which I will purchase again when this bottle is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your interest, those colognes in order of ranking - are (also see my ratings of those products):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Nuit del Homme - YSL - long lasting, complex, and fragrant - which have brought many amorous/favorable comments from members of the opposite sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Pour L&#x27; Homme - Versace - clean and somewhat flowery - subtle - long lasting with very nice releases of other notes throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Roger and Gallet Extra Vieille - wonderful scent - very masculine with woody undertones.</li>
            <li> by far one of the best colognes I have. it last me a little over a year and is easily the one of the colognes I wear most often. Its strong in that others can smell it but not from across the room. My signifcant other loves it and strangers have complemented me on it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell and the cologne came with the small shampoo bottle.  I would give this a 5/5 however, as some people noted, the smell doesn&#x27;t last that long.  I have a bottle I bought from the mall and the smell lasts all day.  However, this bottle is a lot different in that it lasts only about 1-2 hours before it fades. Their is a BIG difference.  Beautiful bottle, great smell, and overall a GREAT deal.  3/5 stars.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for tis size.  This is my husband and son favorite cologne.  You must buy it</li>
            <li> Bought it for my dad as a Father&#x27;s Day gift and he enjoyed it. The best part is Amazon had it for half the price that Macy&#x27;s had it and this item came with a gift set! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is good and last long i like</li>
            <li> i am very pleased with this purchase! The item is just as described, and smells great. This was a great transaction</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing. The smell captures those whom you walk by, and it gets their attention focused on you. The shipping was extremely quick as well!</li>
            <li> will recommend to anyone interested, and fast delivery. The price is always a concern when you shop online but the sense of security is even more important.</li>
            <li> More comps than any I wear,so they can&#x27;t all be wrong and I have twenty bottles of smell good,try this one.</li>
            <li> I had actually ordered just the cologne but received the Travel Set which also included a Hair and Body Shampoo. If you want to know what i am talking about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Versace-Homme-Toilette-Spray-Shampoo/dp/B004QD47L0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1358560147&amp;sr&#x3D;1-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;versace+pour+homme+for+men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After making sure this Ships from and is sold by Amazon.com I placed my order at 8pm and this was shipped at 7 am the following morning!!! I received the UPS package in 2 business days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to some other reviews this actually lasts long and i use 5 sprays (2 Under arms, 2 on the Wrists and 1 on the chest) that actually lasts me all day till i get back from work and get into the shower again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually stay away from powdery colognes, but this has an essence of spice to it which smells pretty awesome (try it out if you don&#x27;t know what i am talking about) and do agree with the rest that it actually does reminds you of Acqua Di Gio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing and makes girls go &amp;#34;Hmmmmmmm.....you smell good&amp;#34; when i hug them and every one wants to know what i am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying the 6.7 Oz (200 ml) the next time i buy one, as it is twice the size for only 10 buck more.</li>
            <li> I loved the sent but please some one tell me where is the longevity.&lt;br /&gt;I stop smelling it after only half an hour and in one hour its almost totally gone.&lt;br /&gt;They could be a real winner but they have to fix  the longevity issue.</li>
            <li> My husband is so happy with his Versace cologne!! It&#x27;s his favorite cologne to wear every day and the smell is so great! Thank you for shipping it fast!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff. My lady friend thinks it gives her organisms in her nose when she smells it.</li>
            <li> It seems like the smell wont last long.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and as it&#x27;s now May, I can definitely say that we both still love this fragrance. It&#x27;s a very clean smell and he almost always gets complimented when we&#x27;re out if he&#x27;s wearing it. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a total fan of this product. You simply can not go wrong with the purchase of this great item.</li>
            <li> Very good no complaints</li>
            <li> The best scent  I have discovered.  I&#x27;m always getting compliments from both men and women.  I usually tell them its my &amp;#34;natural body scent&amp;#34;.  Very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Authentic product, smells good</li>
            <li> the scent is refreshing</li>
            <li> My son loved the smell of this cologne, unfortunately the sprayer leaked so most of the cologne leaked out and was wasted.  It also stained his dresser from the leaking bottle.  Would buy the cologne again but not from this seller.</li>
            <li> I wear it every day and everyone compliments me on how good I smell! And it shipped to my house within 3-4 days!</li>
            <li> Husband loves this product</li>
            <li> I got this for my boy friend for valentines day! The smell is wonderful, its hard not be want to be under him all day he smells so good and I got it at a good price so I&#x27;m extra happy with this!</li>
            <li> girlfriend loves when i wear it women get close smell me and complement me. gets attention with out a doubt</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying fragrances from Amazon.  And with that being said, buy the fragrances FROM Amazon LLC. I was hesitant at first because I had read some reviews regarding people receiving inauthentic fragrance or having fragrances diluted with alcohol.  This product arrived in its original box, factory sealed, in typical Amazon packaging to protect the turbulence of shipping. So as long as you purchase DIRECTLY from Amazon and not a third party seller you will be satisfied.  In some reviews I read some have speculated and cried product fraud because they are cheaper than department stores.  Everything on Amazon is cheaper than retail, but my guess is the fragrances are overstock from the previous year, hence the surplus and knock down of price per ounce. However fragrance, especially EDT, has a self life of 3-5 years.  So as long as you use it in a reasonable time frame and keep the fragrance in a cool, dark environment, it will have the longevity and maintain the pungency one is looking for.  As for the fragrance, I love this one, personal favorite.  All Versace fragrances are top-notch and made with pure ingredients and are therefore headache free. This one works particularly well with summer weather during the daytime.  Buy with confidence, from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband. It smells so good that I could just float around him! Great value!  When this is gone will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this item for someone else, and I didn&#x27;t get to use it. I&#x27;m just living this review base on my previous experience with the versace brand. I love versace and I look forward to making more purchases from this brand of cologne.</li>
            <li> Great quality and price on product. Same product as sold in the mall, but I was able to get a larger size for less money.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cologne. Smells fantastic. I bought after having used the sample for a while, then I bought a bottle of it a couple years ago because it would get complimented often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though with the bottle I ordered through Amazon the scent is the same, however it barely lasts even half an hour. Nobody notices it and I can&#x27;t even smell it myself after I initially spray it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell itself also seems to not be as potent and strong. It&#x27;s possible that it was not stored properly and this particular bottle was ruined.</li>
            <li> so smooth and sexy. A lady killer, light yummy scent lasts all day. no other like it, impossible not to notice, it smells great</li>
            <li> SOOO happy with it. My husband was gifted this, and when it ran out, I ran to the mall, to find that it cost WAY more than I hoped. I was thrilled to find it here, with a price tag I could afford!</li>
            <li> Excellent price and shipping was fast. Many compliments wearing Pour Homme. I don&#x27;t know about you but, I never tire of hearing, &amp;#34; Wow, you smell good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I found my way to this product by entering \\&quot;Versace Eros\\&quot; into Amazon&#x27;s search engine.  I thought the price was oddly low for a new Versace cologne, which honestly should have been my first clue.  I didn&#x27;t look at the bottle very closely and just went with it.  After I got it out of the box, I thought the bottle looked fishy and after a second look at some Eros bottles, I know it&#x27;s definitely not Eros.  The scent is unremarkable and generic, and it dissipates really quickly.  As I was searching for Eros and spotting Versace cologne counterfeits, I noticed that there were A LOT of Versace Pour Homme counterfeit hits on Google.  This may or may not have be one. I considered returning it, and found \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.\\&quot;  I will wear it for a few days and see if it grows on me.  If not, someone will be glad to get it a resale shop.  Caveat emptor.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Got this shipped from Amazon and it looks identical to the one i got from a department store but only lasts for about 30 mins or so, even after spraying 5-6 times. My original one lasted almost all day with 2 sprays. I contacted Amazon and got a full refund. I will be buying it locally from a department store to make sure its real this time. Not Amamzon&#x27;s fault, there are a lot of replicas out there, be carefull.</li>
            <li> Smells real good &amp; I like it cause you just need one spray I&#x27;m not a fan of showering in cologne so its good for me lol</li>
            <li> I love Versace cologne, I love the smell, it lasts for a long time in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Bought this from Amazon not from some third party seller and I&#x27;m 100% sure it&#x27;s not the real thing. I used to spray once and my wife would notice it all day, now i use 5 or 6 sprays and my wife and others  can&#x27;t even notice it. Last time I buy cologne online.</li>
            <li> I tried on a ton of different colognes at the shop, ranging from all the expensive ones. This was the only one that I liked. Everyone&#x27;s noses are different but I would purchase it again. I love the smell and think it&#x27;s very well worth it for a guy.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as Versace i have bought from my usual retailers. ....spend the extra 10 dollars and buy from the mall!</li>
            <li> I like the smell as do others but the pump button sticks.  Defective Spray Bottle.  But product smells good so I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Received a gift set with 3.4 ounce spray and a 3.4 ounce hair and body shampoo.</li>
            <li> Highly suspect this was a knockoff, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, maybe any hour or two. This should last all day.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband. Love the way it smells on him. You can just catch a whiff of it and it is never over powering.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and so does my husband.  He uses it daily.  It has sort of a clean, citrus yet somewhat strong scent.  Makes him strong and sexy smelling.  LOOOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Versace Pour Homme is one of luxury perfumes has amazing sense and suggested for men over 40 y and business man.</li>
            <li> This smells great and is certainly the advertised product</li>
            <li> Damn my husband smells good!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the quality of the products.</li>
            <li> This smells really good guys. The ladies will love it.</li>
            <li> Ordered on Saturday, arrived on Tuesday -- three days before estimated delivery date.  Came unopened, sealed within box.  Used for the first time today and it smells incredible and has lasted so far...not bad for a cologne I ordered online after only having smelled it once.</li>
            <li> Smells sooooo good! Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he LOVES it. Came in good/protective packaging and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband after smelling this fragrance at a department store.  The purchase price was much better thru Amazon versus an instore purchase.  Happy with the scent and all over appearance of this item.</li>
            <li> I loved this item ordered this for my boyfriend! Smells wonderful! Last LONG! Only 1 spray required! One of my FAVS!!</li>
            <li> Always liked this scent. Now i have it and i have no complaints. Nice aroma that does not linger like cheap colognes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Versace, you can tell it was crafted with quality. Got compliments everywhere I wore this. Great for office wear. Has a nice sweet muskiness to it. My girlfriend sneaks some on her sweaters before I travel.</li>
            <li> I like being different and this smells different from the others. It&#x27;s not a bad thing because its very good of a smell! Makes the girls smile.</li>
            <li> This is a very cool and mild fragrance. It&#x27;s not sweet. It has a floral with a touch of spice in it. Very nice for someone that likes a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Omg! I love love this. Smells so good.</li>
            <li> It does not last.I doubt it is not original perfume or it is diluted.I have decided not to buy perfume on Internet as the is no guarantee that it is original</li>
            <li> In my opinion I would recommend this to any guy who wants that clean smelling, summer/spring cologne.  Works as a club cologne pick, or a casual encounter fragrance.</li>
