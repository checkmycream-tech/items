            <li>Looks beautiful!</li>
            <li>But it sounds beautiful gift if it didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>Very nice for money I paid.</li>
            <li>It took forever to arrived but their really beautiful accesories my daugther love it!</li>
            <li>Fit perfect around her bun.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Hold hair nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product : very pretty, great craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and also clings lightly into the hair and looks great with a bun.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful and the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>I love this piece.</li>
            <li>Simple beautiful!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering some different colors of this beautiful comb!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Arrived and looked exactly like the photo and was very cute, but before my daughter could even use it, a petal fell off, then another.</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>Cheap, flimsy.</li>
            <li>But for me was easy fix, just super glue  </li>
            <li>The clip itself is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Beautiful product at an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li>Was a pretty addition to my hair &amp; headpiece when my husband and I renewed our vows.</li>
            <li>The only con is that the comb can slide out of your hair easily if you turn your head quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller : I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li>, only they are larger and hold up your hair much better.</li>
            <li>Though it looked smooth, it is actually rough that it could pull your hair and hurt you.</li>
            <li>Well worth the incredibly low price!</li>
            <li>It seems to be well made, with colorful crystals and long comb teeth.</li>
            <li>Only thing stone fell out first day</li>
            <li>Packaged a little cheaply in just a plastic</li>
            <li>anyway I fixed it myself.so I like it</li>
            <li>Looks just like the picture and the metal is very sturdy; when it arrived one small rhinestone and one petal were loose in the package but were easily glued back on.</li>
            <li>I think someone with fine hair would find this hard to wear because of its weight and larger size.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, but somewhat heavy hair comb.  </li>
            <li>If you have super thick hair they might work.</li>

            <li> This hair clip not only looked cheap and flawed but also made my head ached.</li>
            <li> It came in a bubble wrap envelope and arrived with two loose stones.</li>
            <li> Must have hair that is on the thick side to hold product in place because it is quite large and heavy.</li>
            <li> Pink was my jewelry accent color.</li>
            <li> One must position it carefully on the head so it does not slip down.  </li>
            <li> However, they are so heavy they won&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> After you put yourhair up, put this in slowly, it will break.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s broken during shipping</li>
            <li> still disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Some decorations fell off, had to glue back on.</li>
            <li> The clip itself is very pretty. It came in a bubble wrap envelope and arrived with two loose stones. I glued them back on and kept the item.</li>
            <li> Was delivered in peices in the bag......I had to glue it back together. Cheap, flimsy. After you put yourhair up, put this in slowly, it will break.</li>
            <li> I love this piece. It&#x27;s light and also clings lightly into the hair and looks great with a bun. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This hair clip not only looked cheap and flawed but also made my head ached. Though it looked smooth, it is actually rough that it could pull your hair and hurt you. You will get for what you pay, I guess.</li>
            <li> Parts broke off as soon as I took it out</li>
            <li> Simple beautiful! Sturdily made, not flimsy at all. Well worth the incredibly low price! I will be ordering some different colors of this beautiful comb!</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture and the metal is very sturdy; when it arrived one small rhinestone and one petal were loose in the package but were easily glued back on.</li>
            <li> Shipping/packaging : Arrived on time. Packaged a little cheaply in just a plastic envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product : very pretty, great craftsmanship. I receive compliments every time I wear it. Must have hair that is on the thick side to hold product in place because it is quite large and heavy. The only con is that the comb can slide out of your hair easily if you turn your head quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller : I would order from this seller again. Beautiful product at an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> I love it. easy to use</li>

            <li> the petals fell off before i recieved it</li>
            <li> These are vert beautiful!  Only thing stone fell out first day I received them.  But for me was easy fix, just super glue  it back on.  Very nice for money I paid. Hold hair nicely. Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> It took forever to arrived but their really beautiful accesories my daugther love it!</li>
            <li> this is waaay smaller than it is made to look in the picture. crystalmood&#x27;s has the same hair combs, only they are larger and hold up your hair much better. but for the price, it&#x27;s alright. still disappointed.</li>
            <li> These arrived in pieces. I purchased them for gifts. I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and the price is so reasonable. However, they are so heavy they won&#x27;t stay in my hair. If you have super thick hair they might work.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful! My daughter wore in her hair for homecoming dance. Fit perfect around her bun. Sturdy and held in place all night!</li>
            <li> The only thing I did after opened the mailing package was to throw that hair clip into the trash can.  The reason is beacuse the poor quality with cheap looking and two plastic parts went off righ taway.</li>
            <li> Arrived and looked exactly like the photo and was very cute, but before my daughter could even use it, a petal fell off, then another. It&#x27;s not like she dropped it or anything, she just tried to put it on and it snapped in her fingers.</li>
