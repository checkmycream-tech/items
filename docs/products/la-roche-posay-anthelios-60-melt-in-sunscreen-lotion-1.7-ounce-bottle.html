            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very important for EVERYONE concerned about skin protection to check out EWG&#x27;s website</li>
            <li>I think it works, my skin looks better and under control.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The best sunscreen is \\&quot;ANESSA by Shiseido\\&quot; (Japanese).</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>

            <li>I checked, and more than one site has reviews that note the staining problem with this product.</li>

            <li>I really recomend it!!!</li>
            <li>It stains clothes a bright yellow.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery; item as described.</li>
            <li>(they also have an app I kno it&#x27;s available for iPhone - check to see if it&#x27;s available for Android), &amp; find a sunscreen that&#x27;s high rated - &amp; works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>amazing, I have a very white girl and with this protector under the sun for hours</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens give me zits, so at 60 years old, insult to injury.</li>
            <li>It will make you shiney, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Goes on very light but definitely protects.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is rather greasy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive but very good!!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>The cream seems to melt into the face and body and does not leave a white film on your skin, and of course it provides full protection for your skin so you can stay young looking for ever :-)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve use tested this product under the scorching caribbean sun on really really white-freckly kids, and we could not be happier.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen really bothers my face.</li>
            <li>I now use the L-R-P primer with 50 spf and it is much nicer and has a matte finish.</li>
            <li>It protects against the sun very well.</li>
            <li>recommended it to my dad who&#x27;s arm is very burned, and with a month of use already you can see him arm lighter color from the sun no longer burning him.</li>
            <li>For some reason, my most recent tube leaves yellow staining on my running shirts after workouts.  </li>
            <li>but, the main reason I stopped using it on my face is that it is not compatible with my moisturizer (Bobbi Brown).  </li>
            <li>First I used the creme, but it is pasty and too white.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my skin natural with no perfumes.</li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin that likes to hyperpigment too.</li>
            <li>EWG (Environmental Working Group - the organisation which a halt rates the best - and worst - sunscreens) give this - &amp; most other La Roche sunscreens - the LOWEST scores (it gets a 7 - 0-2 being highest) 7, &#x27;avoid&#x27;  on the 2013 list of sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t mean that I can be laying in the sun, I still have to avoid being in direct sun as much as possible, but for everyday protection, this is the best; and I&#x27;ve used a few different sunscreens.</li>
            <li>To be honest, this sunscreen is not good like other&#x27;s reviews for me.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of kinds of sunscreens (American, Japanese and French stuffs) and usually sunscreen stains on fabric can be removed easily.</li>

            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t give you a &#x27;white&#x27; mask on your face like some other products do.</li>
            <li> I have dry to combination skin</li>
            <li> A little white when it goes on</li>
            <li> So, not wanting to waste it, I started using it on the back of my hands</li>
            <li> I will still use this sunscreen for other applications, but will need to use another product for sweaty workouts.</li>
            <li> and I suppose it protects as well as some of the other sunscreens</li>
            <li> but that melts in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasted my money, and also my polo shirt and towel by the stains.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> It has very little sun screen scent and no perfume scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I say ths because we&#x27;re heading into August - usually the hottest - &amp; sunniest - month of summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers with sunscreen that either didn&#x27;t work, felt heavy,smelled awful or clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> Not the correct one- too thick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also a pricey item, and a VERY small amount for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a good look.  </li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;ve never had a break out experience with any product, but I can&#x27;t imagine this sunscreen can cause break outs on any skin types, because it&#x27;s so thin and non greasy.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very thin and it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have a layer of grease on my face.</li>
            <li> This is really bad.</li>
            <li> it appears like she didn&#x27;t go out, I still I can not believe how it repellent the sun, this item never leaves marks from the swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!!    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yes everyone knows this product is amazing. It has very little sun screen scent and no perfume scent. It is virtually unscented as advertised which is very important to me. I like to keep my skin natural with no perfumes. Especially on my face. The cream seems to melt into the face and body and does not leave a white film on your skin, and of course it provides full protection for your skin so you can stay young looking for ever :-)</li>
            <li> I have that \\&quot;northern European\\&quot; skin.  I go out in the sun unprotected and get fried. Most sunscreens give me zits, so at 60 years old, insult to injury. This stuff actually protects without the zits.  A little white when it goes on but that melts in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend a couple of months in the Caribbean, Mexico or Hawaii each year (writing this from Grenada). Since finding this stuff, I&#x27;ve had no hassle with the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1.7 oz can go in the carry on luggage.  I wish they would come out with a 3 oz though.</li>
            <li> I like the sun protection of this sunscreen and have been using it for years, ordering it from Canada.  For some reason, my most recent tube leaves yellow staining on my running shirts after workouts.  I will still use this sunscreen for other applications, but will need to use another product for sweaty workouts.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends. It has a great price in amazon. All la Roche-possay products are great</li>
            <li> My dermatologist turned me to La Roch Posey because of a sever case of hyper pigmentation in my skin. First I used the creme, but it is pasty and too white. But this lotion is great. I put it on before I go out and don&#x27;t need to use moisturizer. I think it works, my skin looks better and under control. That doesn&#x27;t mean that I can be laying in the sun, I still have to avoid being in direct sun as much as possible, but for everyday protection, this is the best; and I&#x27;ve used a few different sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen/moisturizer. Goes on very light but definitely protects. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores at all and is not greasy. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> To be honest, this sunscreen is not good like other&#x27;s reviews for me. First of all, this is rather greasy. And this dyes fabrics yellow!! I didn&#x27;t notice at first but after laundry I found where the yellow stains came from. This is really bad. I have used a lot of kinds of sunscreens (American, Japanese and French stuffs) and usually sunscreen stains on fabric can be removed easily. I must throw this away. I wasted my money, and also my polo shirt and towel by the stains. Very disappointing!!    PS. The best sunscreen is \\&quot;ANESSA by Shiseido\\&quot; (Japanese). It&#x27;s expensive but very good!!</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  It does a great job of protecting my skin.  I always get compliments because my skin looks dewy.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended this product. I ordered this thinking it was sunscreen for my face. Not the correct one- too thick.  But using it on my kids and rest of body.</li>
            <li> Finally, an excellent sunscreen that goes on sheer like a lotion (without making your face whitish), smells nice and protects you for a good long time.  We&#x27;ve use tested this product under the scorching caribbean sun on really really white-freckly kids, and we could not be happier. NO sun burns and NO problem!      Hurray to La Roche-Posay!</li>
            <li> EWG (Environmental Working Group - the organisation which a halt rates the best - and worst - sunscreens) give this - &amp; most other La Roche sunscreens - the LOWEST scores (it gets a 7 - 0-2 being highest) 7, &#x27;avoid&#x27;  on the 2013 list of sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a pricey item, and a VERY small amount for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say ths because we&#x27;re heading into August - usually the hottest - &amp; sunniest - month of summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very important for EVERYONE concerned about skin protection to check out EWG&#x27;s website (they also have an app I kno it&#x27;s available for iPhone - check to see if it&#x27;s available for Android), &amp; find a sunscreen that&#x27;s high rated - &amp; works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that choice, there are many to choose from - which fit your needs.</li>
            <li> non greasy fragrance free. Moisturizing. Does exactly what it says. Easy dispenser tube. High spf means no sunburn even for fair skinned people</li>
            <li> I would have given a five star rating if it had been cheaper. Nevertheless, it is a good product. Not greasy. Like the fact it is &#x27;anthelios&#x27;</li>
            <li> This sunscreen really bothers my face. I now use the L-R-P primer with 50 spf and it is much nicer and has a matte finish.</li>
            <li> This absorbs into the skin fairly well and I suppose it protects as well as some of the other sunscreens but, the main reason I stopped using it on my face is that it is not compatible with my moisturizer (Bobbi Brown).  When I applied it over the moisturizer, it flaked off.  Not a good look.  So, not wanting to waste it, I started using it on the back of my hands but I soon discovered that it will ruin your nail polish if it comes into contact with it!  Now I don&#x27;t want to use it at all because if it will eat through your nail polish, I figure it is too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> Did it protect my skin from the sun? Yes. Was it easy to apply? Yes. Did it sting my eyes to the point of tears? Yes! Do not wear this if there is even the slightest chance you might break out in a sweat. You&#x27;ll regret it if you do.</li>
            <li> If you care about your skin, this is the go-to product to protect you from the sun. I use it only on my face and neck because of the price. It will make you shiney, but it&#x27;s worth it. I am a cosmetics junkie and I research what I use. Every review site ranks Anthelios as the top sunscreen -- has Mexoryl in it that the US FDA just  approved in recent years. I used to buy this via Canadian websites.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product. Do not buy. It stains clothes a bright yellow. I have ruined the necklines of three white tops. This should be removed from the market and reformulated. I checked, and more than one site has reviews that note the staining problem with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers with sunscreen that either didn&#x27;t work, felt heavy,smelled awful or clogged my pores. This sunscreen feels no different than a light/medium daily moisturizer. It protects against the sun very well. I used it the entire Summer and never got sun on my face. I wear it every day under my tinted moisturizer. I will never switch to another product. This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> BEST sunscreen ever. I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin that likes to hyperpigment too. Didnt leave my skin oily, didn&#x27;t sting my eyes when it got too close and maintained all day. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery; item as described.</li>
            <li> It is a great sunscreen! I really recomend it!!!</li>
            <li> Um... $26 for 1.7 oz is $15.29/oz not $9.xx/oz as stated&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t understand the mistake.  is the package truly 1.7 oz?</li>
            <li> Excellent, nothing else compares.&lt;br /&gt;is amazing, I have a very white girl and with this protector under the sun for hours it appears like she didn&#x27;t go out, I still I can not believe how it repellent the sun, this item never leaves marks from the swimsuit.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my dad who&#x27;s arm is very burned, and with a month of use already you can see him arm lighter color from the sun no longer burning him. Is amazing!</li>
            <li> If you want your face to have a freakish, white color than this is for you...It does not Melt it...No matter how long I rubbed this in...the white cast did not go away.. I had to wash it off and start over..Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been between this melt in lotion and the anthelios 50 sunscreen fluid. The consistency is very thin and it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have a layer of grease on my face. Also it doesn&#x27;t give you a &#x27;white&#x27; mask on your face like some other products do. I have dry to combination skin, so I&#x27;ve never had a break out experience with any product, but I can&#x27;t imagine this sunscreen can cause break outs on any skin types, because it&#x27;s so thin and non greasy.</li>
