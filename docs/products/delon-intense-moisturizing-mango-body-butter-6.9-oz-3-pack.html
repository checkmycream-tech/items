            <li> If you like the scent of mango, you will truly love this butter. I use to wear lotion, switched to cream, and now I love body butter, especially in the winter when my skin gets drier. I don&#x27;t wear too much in the summer or I will go with body cream. Bath and Body Works discontinued selling body butter. I was so disappointed as I feel my skin needs a deep moisturizer. I rub it on the top and bottom of my feet too. Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>

            <li> lovely! great smell and smoothing textures</li>
            <li> I find the Mango Body Butter to be an excellent hydrating product.  I only use it to moisturze my feet immediately after showering or bathing. There is no need for a pedicure to remove dry skin because the mango butter keeps my feet smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Makes my dry aging skin soft &amp; smooth.  Moisturizes and absorbed by my skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily or greasy. Wanted the green olive oil body butter, but couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
