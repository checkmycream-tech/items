            <li>Excellent product, makes mynhave so soomth &amp; tangle free.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Nice transaction.  </li>
            <li>Matrix never fails; I used their Biolage for years but this is better for me at this time, I would recommend it to anyone and they have products for colored hair that are excellent.</li>
            <li>Good stuff well worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this Shampoo/Conditioner combo.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I wish there was a pump on top instead of a cap.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is OK.</li>
            <li>Smells so good, absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner, makes me hair so soft.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is an effective gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair nice, soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>I have seen a drastic improvement in my hair and it feels so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>The cost was almost the same as drugstore stuff and the quality is definitely better.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the duo does a good job on my dry hair and leaves it less frizzy and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I really like the products</li>
            <li>I have thinner straight hair (colored).</li>
            <li>I was skeptical on using this shampoo because I was nervous about my roots becoming too oily or having too much moisture, but I&#x27;m glad I took the risk!</li>
            <li>this one will be a new one of my to buy products.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other Matrix products in smaller sizes and love it</li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which is really important to me.</li>
            <li>Arrived early too.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft</li>
            <li>The only real difference is the wording.</li>
            <li>It smooths it and makes it look shiny and feel soft without going too far and making it look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is the real Matrix Total Results Moisture</li>
            <li>and if it is (highly doubt it) I feel sorry for people who pay full price in the store.</li>

            <li> I love this Shampoo/Conditioner combo. Seller was A+++ to deal with. Product delivered on time, as promised, and in great condition!</li>
            <li> Smells so good, absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner, makes me hair so soft. :) Arrived early too. Love it.</li>
            <li> Nice transaction.  These containers are larger than I thought.  Good Deal.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo and conditioner. Hair feels soft</li>
            <li> Great seller. Good price, prompt shipping. Will use again.</li>
            <li> My hair has been rather dry lately, and I use heat every 2 days or so, and I cant find myself to stop as much as I try lol. I was skeptical on using this shampoo because I was nervous about my roots becoming too oily or having too much moisture, but I&#x27;m glad I took the risk! I have seen a drastic improvement in my hair and it feels so healthy and soft. Not the least bit oily, and my hair is on track to feeling healthier, thicker and shiner! I will forever use this shampoo and conditioner duo.</li>
            <li> Matrix never fails; I used their Biolage for years but this is better for me at this time, I would recommend it to anyone and they have products for colored hair that are excellent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, makes mynhave so soomth &amp; tangle free. I only use salon products &amp; this one will be a new one of my to buy products.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like the products but I wish there was a pump on top instead of a cap.</li>
            <li> Great price for liters. I wish the bottles were slightly different looking so I could tell which was shampoo and which was conditioner when in the shower. The only real difference is the wording. Otherwise, the duo does a good job on my dry hair and leaves it less frizzy and more manageable.The cost was almost the same as drugstore stuff and the quality is definitely better. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which is really important to me. It smooths it and makes it look shiny and feel soft without going too far and making it look and feel greasy. The shampoo is an effective gentle cleanser. I see a big difference in my hair now as opposed to when I was using Dove products.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> This combo works great on my hair. I have thinner straight hair (colored). Leaves hair nice, soft and shinny. Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a very odd smell to it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s expired or what but it almost smells like the cream you add to hair color. It doesn&#x27;t help my hair in any way but to stink. I have purchased other Matrix products in smaller sizes and love it but I have learned you get what you pay for when you purchase big bottles on Amazon. I don&#x27;t believe this is the real Matrix Total Results Moisture and if it is (highly doubt it) I feel sorry for people who pay full price in the store. I just can&#x27;t get over the smell. Yuck!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, My wife &amp; daughter have longy hair (past there butt, They have been using it for the past 3 months, and there hair looks &amp; feel much better.</li>
            <li> Order arrived promptly and as described. Only problem is shampoo knots my fairly thick hair immediately. Conditioner is OK. I agree with others on the awful smell.</li>
            <li> Good stuff well worth it!</li>
