            <li>Clean feel on face.</li>
            <li>Finally, I&#x27;m 59 and for me I needed more than consistent sunscreen to diminish hyper-pigmentation from my fair skin.</li>

            <li>Give this a shot if you&#x27;re looking for a good facial sunscreen.</li>

            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It really feels like a great facial moisturizer that protects you from the harmful rays of the sun.  </li>
            <li>For someone with a darker color skin like me, that is a major selling point and the reason why I chose to buy this one rather than the popular brands of sunscreen you find at CVS or Duane Reade.</li>
            <li>My new favorite sunscreen</li>
            <li>If I gently dab it on my face, then it is fine.</li>
            <li>It feels light on the skin and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy and well absorbed.</li>
            <li>My complexion stays clear and soft and I feel good</li>
            <li>It is very effective and does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li>It will ball up, or peels as I do not have the right word to describe it.</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily and does not leave your skin with a white layer of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Super light and doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Awesome everyday facial cream!</li>
            <li>Dissapears every time, causes some redness at first</li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with that white fog look.</li>
            <li>BE AWARE:  </li>
            <li>I purchased two of these, my first one lasted May 2015-beginning of Aug 2015.</li>
            <li>the product you get will not be consistent.</li>
            <li>Now i don&#x27;t even know if the first bottle was &amp;#34;legit.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Wish it came in a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30, have fair and oily skin, and large pores that are hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>and I do not go in the sun without this product and a large brim hat.  </li>
            <li>I have never broken out from using it.  </li>
            <li>It works very well as a sunscreen also.  </li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>I use creams very seldom, to grease for me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is a very god product for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>If I tried to rub it in gently like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but now I really know it&#x27;s luck of the draw and</li>
            <li>Most facial sunscreens clog my pores (even if it&#x27;s marked noncomedogenic) or cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>No scent, no white pasty film like other sunscreens and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Elta MD UV Clear for a little over a year now and have been very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>the pump doesn&#x27;t work and I end up having to pump it upside down or pull the top off and scoop out sunscreen with my finger.</li>
            <li>Lightweight with high SPF coverage.  </li>
            <li>I really like the clear, non-greasy formula</li>
            <li>thinking about using a sledge hammer and finding a new place to buy this.</li>
            <li>Very clear and absorbs with no stickiness.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not sure I would depend on it for the beach, but certainly great for a long day outside.  </li>
            <li>Mid-day I like to apply another light brushing of the SPF powder and a little blush to continue the protection and perk up my natural looking glow without breaking the sunscreen bond.</li>
            <li>People are surprised when they learn my age.</li>
            <li>First facial sunscreen that I can wear multiple days in a row without getting clogged pores and zits.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a completely different color (the first bottle lotion was white cream</li>
            <li>Goes very smoothly...does give a little shine but has never broken me out.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it so far</li>
            <li>and it apparently provides needed sun protection.  </li>

            <li> Mid-day I like to apply another light brushing of the SPF powder and a little blush to continue the protection and perk up my natural looking glow without breaking the sunscreen bond.</li>
            <li> People are surprised when they learn my age.</li>
            <li> First facial sunscreen that I can wear multiple days in a row without getting clogged pores and zits.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a completely different color (the first bottle lotion was white cream</li>
            <li> Goes very smoothly...does give a little shine but has never broken me out.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it so far</li>
            <li> and it apparently provides needed sun protection.  </li>
            <li> Smooth on face, not too heavy or thick</li>
            <li> If you wait to long before layers the eltaMD starts to peel.</li>
            <li> I just bought two of the same size at AskDerm.com and it came down to $48 total with a 20% off coupon.</li>
            <li> and then I need to push the inside bottle thru the small hole on the bottom of the bottle which required a long and strong thin wire.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my last purchase was a 2 pack and when I opened the 2nd package I found that the pump mechanics didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Let set for 3-4 minutes then apply foundation (I followup with an SPF loose powder).</li>
            <li> Leaves a slight white cast and pills and you can roll it off.</li>

            <li> FINALLY, I keep a tube of this on my desk at work and apply it a few times to the tops of my hands and any exposed parts of my arms to keep those dreaded hand &amp;#34;age-spots&amp;#34; to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Caked on my face, would not soak in as expected.</li>
            <li> You may think the bottle is empty but its just the design of the pump.   </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t attract dirt and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this several times before and hope it isn&#x27;t discontinued (which is why I usually buy two at a time).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years from other sources and have never had this issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been told by professionals (my brother is a dermatologist resident, and I&#x27;ve been told by other professionals as well, etc.)</li>
            <li> to be wary or don&#x27;t buy health products from Amazon at all because a seller (not AMAZON) often packages from another name that isn&#x27;t even the real product</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin and aged my face 10 years.</li>
            <li> Slightly matte,</li>
            <li> That has not been a problem where I live however; because there has been NO SUN for months unfortunately.</li>
            <li> If you were to see my face during the day you would think I wear little to no foundation.</li>
            <li> This one is a little pricy though.</li>
            <li> all year round.</li>
            <li> In the comments I see complaints from just a few, that it peels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that even though it&#x27;s been a few months since my purchase I can exchange the product.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just wish it came in a larger container &amp; weren&#x27;t quite so expensive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s past the return window.</li>
            <li> I like the sunscreen because it does not leave my face white which my wife says looks bad  </li>
            <li> The second one doesn&#x27;t smell bad (the expiration on the bottom isn&#x27;t until 2017)</li>
            <li> but it is past the return date, which I think is unrealistic as how can a company establish a date by which a consumer will go through 2 bottles.  </li>
            <li> Not great at all for me.</li>
            <li> (:-(</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I tried to use my blush brush to brush it off, but it is making it worst.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very clear and absorbs with no stickiness. It is easy to reapply through the day and causes no irritation.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Very light and goes on under makeup flawlessly.  I have never broken out from using it.  it does not change the color or consistency of your makeup.  Slightly matte, so even used alone it looks great.  It works very well as a sunscreen also.  Not sure I would depend on it for the beach, but certainly great for a long day outside.  I would probably reapply if sweating.</li>
            <li> Awesome everyday facial cream! Nice and light but covers well. Doesn&#x27;t give you a caked on feeling and clog your pores. And of course the sunscreen is a must!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Definitely a better deal than buying from the dermatologists!</li>
            <li> Not greasy easy to apply but using as a face mosturizer under make-up, the lotion becomes &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34;  Will continue to use everywhere except under make-up.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get any better than this product for summer face coverage.  Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted. I would order more.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Absorbs quickly. Great coverage.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is great, I love it. My beef is that with about 1/3 of the bottles that I get from Amazon the pump doesn&#x27;t work and I end up having to pump it upside down or pull the top off and scoop out sunscreen with my finger. I don&#x27;t know if this is an issue with the manufacturer&#x27;s pumps or the ones that end up going through Amazon. When the pumps do work, they&#x27;re great---they will fully empty out the container.</li>
            <li> Love this goes on so light</li>
            <li> Best facial sunscreen that I have found.</li>
            <li> Love this, doesn&#x27;t feel like putting &#x27;sunscreen&#x27; on. All sunscreens should be like this....people would wear it more, I do.... all year round.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products I found after trying so many that didn&#x27;t work. Have purchased this several times before and hope it isn&#x27;t discontinued (which is why I usually buy two at a time). I&#x27;m 30, have fair and oily skin, and large pores that are hard to keep clean. Most facial sunscreens clog my pores (even if it&#x27;s marked noncomedogenic) or cause me to break out. This is perfect, with just the right amount of liquid to moisturize my skin, even though it&#x27;s not to be used as a moisturizer. Give this a shot if you&#x27;re looking for a good facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for a long time. I have very sensitive skin and it works without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for approx 3 years after seeing the recommendations. My hyper-pigmentation has reduced/not increased*  I wear makeup daily and find this to be excellent under my foundation BUT you need to apply with purpose and good timing. Some tips: once your skin washed and toner applied, apply standard face serum and moisturizer all over. Apply eye cream last so face treatment has a moment to settle on skin. Within a minute apply eltaMD so it blends in with moisturizer. Let set for 3-4 minutes then apply foundation (I followup with an SPF loose powder). If you wait to long before layers the eltaMD starts to peel. The sunscreen is SUPPOSED to attach to skin and protect us during the day. In the comments I see complaints from just a few, that it peels. Check how you apply it then avoid touching your skin during the day. Mid-day I like to apply another light brushing of the SPF powder and a little blush to continue the protection and perk up my natural looking glow without breaking the sunscreen bond. If you were to see my face during the day you would think I wear little to no foundation. I use a light hand. Finally, I&#x27;m 59 and for me I needed more than consistent sunscreen to diminish hyper-pigmentation from my fair skin. I found IPL from a plastic surgeon the most effective but then you must guard your skin so it does not return. FINALLY, I keep a tube of this on my desk at work and apply it a few times to the tops of my hands and any exposed parts of my arms to keep those dreaded hand &amp;#34;age-spots&amp;#34; to a minimum. And, yes, IPL can help with those, too. People are surprised when they learn my age.</li>
            <li> Dissapears every time, causes some redness at first but that goes away within 30 minutes</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this also has chemical sunscreen. Elta has another formula that is all physical sunscreen. I&#x27;ll get that next time.</li>
            <li> Smooth on face, not too heavy or thick</li>
            <li> Love it. My skin is quite oily but this sunscreen helps to balance it out.</li>
            <li> Go-to moisturizer that is light and smooth.  Like the fact that it is mostly cosmetic-conscious.</li>
            <li> I love EltaMD UV clear face lotion with sunscreen and was very excited to get this two pack. The first bottle was just great. Then I got to the second bottle and tried to use it and nothing came out. No matter what I do I cannot get the product to come out of the package. Talked with thw seller and they said said since it was fulfilled by Amazon they couldn&#x27;t replace it. Harumph....thinking about using a sledge hammer and finding a new place to buy this. Seller and Amazon only get 3 stars on this one because if I could get the lotion out of the bottle it would be 5. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended this and I absolutely love it! Non-greasy and well absorbed.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for acne-prone skin.  Lightweight with high SPF coverage.  Recommended by my dermatologist but sold here for about 70% of what the dermatologist&#x27;s office charges.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this for my face not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout like others and found it cheaper on Amazon,</li>
            <li> Have not used many similar products so a comparison is difficult..otherwise I would give t full 5 stars.  It is easy to use, goes on smoothly and is not greasy..and it apparently provides needed sun protection.  Rec by by dermo</li>
            <li> I started using this product after my dermatologist recommended a stronger sunscreen while I am being treated for Melasma and acne. I love how it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with that white fog look. For someone with a darker color skin like me, that is a major selling point and the reason why I chose to buy this one rather than the popular brands of sunscreen you find at CVS or Duane Reade. This one is a little pricy though. I&#x27;d suggest that you google the item to see if there&#x27;s a better deal out there. I just bought two of the same size at AskDerm.com and it came down to $48 total with a 20% off coupon.</li>
            <li> The pumps did not work so I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful sunscreen to use!  It feels light on the skin and very moisturizing.  I love that it does not sting my eyes or cause my skin to break out in blemishes.  It goes on very easily and does not leave your skin with a white layer of sunscreen.  It really feels like a great facial moisturizer that protects you from the harmful rays of the sun.  What more can you ask for!!!  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I prefer the Eltamd SPF 42 as it has moisturizer.  This one is a bit drying, but a great sunscreen</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. Just wish it came in a larger container &amp; weren&#x27;t quite so expensive.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen was very effective on the beach for two weeks. It is the first liquid sunscreen that I have been able to use in years. It is very light and did not make my face break out. Love it!</li>
            <li> Fabulous.  Very light weight so you can wear under make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Elta MD UV Clear for a little over a year now and have been very pleased with the product.  My only complaint is that my last purchase was a 2 pack and when I opened the 2nd package I found that the pump mechanics didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m hoping that even though it&#x27;s been a few months since my purchase I can exchange the product.</li>
            <li> First facial sunscreen that I can wear multiple days in a row without getting clogged pores and zits.&lt;br /&gt;Can put on and then put on makeup a minute or two later.&lt;br /&gt;It is made in USA.  Pricey but does perform.</li>
            <li> Leaves a slight white cast and pills and you can roll it off. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts though but I don&#x27;t consider it my holy grail sunscreen yet.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. Dermatologist recommended I try it.</li>
            <li> Non greasy. Clean feel on face.</li>
            <li> Helps with Melesma! I put it on every morning before applying my makeup. It&#x27;s not greasy and makeup goes on smoothly over it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great sun block product one of the best and it &#x27;s recommended by my dermatologist!&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and I will recommend it</li>
            <li> I like the product itself. However, I&#x27;ve encountered two bottles already with defective pumps.</li>
            <li> Caked on my face, would not soak in as expected. Not great at all for me.</li>
            <li> I use creams very seldom, to grease for me but this one is not so so I like it.</li>
            <li> the undisputed most effective sunscreen!</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended this sunscreen and it is a great match for oily skin. Super light and doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin and aged my face 10 years.</li>
            <li> The pump did not work on 2 of the four bottles that I purchased. I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years from other sources and have never had this issue.</li>
            <li> Love the product and have used for years. I used to break out from ALL sunscreens but once I found this I haven&#x27;t used anything else.  BE AWARE:  You may think the bottle is empty but its just the design of the pump.   Every now and then I need to push the inside bottle thru the small hole on the bottom of the bottle which required a long and strong thin wire.  Once I figured this out I was able to get all of the product out of the bottle.  I really like the clear, non-greasy formula</li>
            <li> No problem with container #1.  Product is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  Goes on nicely, did not sting my eyes, my tinted moisturizer went on smoothly.  So far so good.  Then I went to use container #2.  The pump will not work.  I&#x27;ve searched the web, gone to YouTube, and my next move may be to take a handsaw to the jar.  It will not pump.  I tried to return the product but it is past the return date, which I think is unrealistic as how can a company establish a date by which a consumer will go through 2 bottles.  I tried to contact the seller, but Amazon is the seller.</li>
            <li> Love this lightweight sunscreen.  No scent, no white pasty film like other sunscreens and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great texture, not greasy at all. My new favorite sunscreen</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff!!!  I have extremely oily, rosacea-prone skin and this sunscreen works great.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like many others, it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a ghostly white face and provides some nice anti-aging benefits in addition to the protection ones! I&#x27;ve had melanoma so using sunscreen daily is paramount and after trying dozens this is by far my favorite!!!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> suggested by my derm dr</li>
            <li> This is a very god product for acne prone skin. Goes very smoothly...does give a little shine but has never broken me out. My dermatologist recommended...been using it for 5 years and I have never looked back.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen ever! It doesn&#x27;t run and get oily like evrything else. I use it daily while fighting wildfires. It doesn&#x27;t attract dirt and a little goes a long way. I just wish there was more of it than just 2oz. Great Stuff!</li>
            <li> I found this to be best facial sunscreen; very light and not sticky.. was recommended by my skin doctor.  Especially good for anyone who needs to wear sunscreen daily!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and it works well for facial protection.  Not greasy.  Amazon pricing was better than my Dr.&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I have rosecea and this is the only product I have found that does not irritate or burn my complexion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion; saved a trip to dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great moisturizer and sun block!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than a year.  It really is a good light sunscreen which covers well and does not interfere with makeup application.  It is very effective and does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I like the sunscreen because it does not leave my face white which my wife says looks bad  and I agree . This sunscreen , no white face . A little pricey but worth it so far</li>
            <li> If I gently dab it on my face, then it is fine. If I tried to rub it in gently like a moisturizer. It will ball up, or peels as I do not have the right word to describe it. I tried to use my blush brush to brush it off, but it is making it worst.  I had the same problem with LaRoche-Posay sunscreen.  The only different is this does not turned my face neon/pale greenish/yellowish after a couple hours of using this product.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen.  Goes on very smooth and creamy and does the job!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these, my first one lasted May 2015-beginning of Aug 2015. I just opened my second one and it&#x27;s a completely different color (the first bottle lotion was white cream and this one is off white) and they smell completely different, indicating they are different products. The second one doesn&#x27;t smell bad (the expiration on the bottom isn&#x27;t until 2017) so I know it isn&#x27;t expired, they&#x27;re just completely different products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been told by professionals (my brother is a dermatologist resident, and I&#x27;ve been told by other professionals as well, etc.) to be wary or don&#x27;t buy health products from Amazon at all because a seller (not AMAZON) often packages from another name that isn&#x27;t even the real product but now I really know it&#x27;s luck of the draw and the product you get will not be consistent. I wish i could return this but it&#x27;s past the return window. What a waste of money. Now i don&#x27;t even know if the first bottle was &amp;#34;legit.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin loves this stuff!  My complexion stays clear and soft and I feel good knowing I&#x27;m protecting my skin from the sun. Wears well under make up, too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for acne-prone skin - will not make you break out! Wish it came in a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my doctor and I do not go in the sun without this product and a large brim hat.  That has not been a problem where I live however; because there has been NO SUN for months unfortunately. (:-(</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for acne prone skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin white</li>
