            <li>Colors are good for my complexion.</li>
            <li>Recommend theses shades for someone who is fair skinned.</li>
            <li>Fantastic color palate, perfect for summer.</li>
            <li>While it may not be fair to compare a $12 palette to a $50 palette, I am going to do so</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the colors included in this palette are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I then blend all the colors to create a gorgeous sultry look.</li>
            <li>and it still didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>Superior product.</li>
            <li>Good value in terms of shades.  </li>
            <li>Revive my today and I&#x27;m in love with this palette is yes beautiful and suthe colors for any age.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this collection.</li>
            <li>Maybelline&#x27;s pallet is a great option if you love UD&#x27;s pallets.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with colors of the pallets.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do love the colors, which are some great neutral shades.</li>
            <li>The number of shades made this the perfect collection to experiment and find just the right combination for me.</li>
            <li>Love this palette!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love the colors!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Pinks and rose gold shades are on trend for the Spring of 2015 and this palette can be used for versatile purposes.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a nice effect, and the colors blend well together.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be one of my favorites, but it&#x27;s still a nice set.</li>
            <li>, it would be nice if the darker shades were matte rather than shimmer.</li>
            <li>I liked these colors</li>
            <li>I found the lighter colors to be very beautiful and great for highlighting the brow bone and the inner part of the eyes.</li>
            <li>Even if you have some wrinkling on your eyelids, you can achieve a nice dewy look if you don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Colors are pinks, maybes, rose gold/</li>
            <li>Nice to have many good ones to design my eye accent with.</li>
            <li>The case is sturdy with a nice applicator.</li>
            <li>Nice colors for summer</li>
            <li>Really nicely pigmented for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice quality for the price too.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set at twice the price.</li>
            <li>A nice quality set.</li>
            <li>colors are nice and go on evenly-ish.  </li>
            <li>The colors blend nicely and wear well.</li>
            <li>You should probably get your own applicators or brushes though to prevent mixing and muddying the colors in the palette.</li>
            <li>If you like more &amp;#34;natural tones&amp;#34; this a good pallet for you.</li>
            <li>; all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>A nice variety of shades allowing me to toss out all my others over this one now.</li>
            <li>The bottom right color is ideal for lining my eyes.</li>
            <li>Adding more shadow will add pigment, and these shades, as well as the first three on the bottom row, blend wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Really pretty colors perfect on a blonde really great for summer!</li>
            <li>but these are still suitable.</li>
            <li>those tend to be more rose golds</li>
            <li>Love love love this!  </li>
            <li>A lovely palate of nude shades, perfect for enhancing a natural look.</li>
            <li>I love the colors, they are soft and attractive and I feel good wearing the blushed nudes.</li>
            <li>However, once applied they go on very, very light.</li>
            <li>this maybeline one goes on very smooth and you dont have to dig into it to get color on the eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li>The rose colors are pretty and fairly subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too many of these shades are shimmery.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how shimmery most of these colors are.</li>
            <li>And the trick to making it look like a deeper color and have more staying power?  </li>
            <li>shadow is a bit shimmery, more so in the case than on your face.  </li>
            <li>I found myself so pleased with both the colors and the quality of an eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Simply the best collection of colors I&#x27;ve picked up in ages!</li>
            <li>you are a more &amp;#34;natural gal&amp;#34</li>
            <li>(and I do absolutely love Maybelline)</li>
            <li>has that and more.</li>
            <li>The UD shadow is creamier and more luxurious.  </li>
            <li>and I feel that it would have been best for Maybelline to have just left them out of the packaging all together!</li>
            <li>As with most eye shadows, it helps to use an eyelid primer to bring out the best colors in the shadow and help it to last all day</li>
            <li>I would have preferred more matte colors.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re OK</li>
            <li>Some of the pinks didn&#x27;t show well on my skin (medium brown); it&#x27;s probably better for lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Lovely colors.</li>
            <li>Both for better quality and better color choices.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that so many of the colors were shimmer.</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>and they bring out more redness in my eyes, which is unflattering.</li>
            <li>and it is stunning.</li>
            <li>I love how flexible this is...</li>
            <li>With a palette you do have more options.</li>
            <li>The colors In this set of eye shadows is in the fighter shades I love, and the price was outstanding.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love eyeshadow, and I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years.</li>
            <li>Those products are better in many ways, but, for the price, Maybelline does the job.</li>
            <li>Love the ways the colors mesh.n</li>
            <li>I should have gone with a better brand.  </li>
            <li>There are both slightly warm and slightly cool shades, so you can have a nude palette that goes with any outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are on the warm to cool side so buy accordingly based on your skin</li>
            <li>I love it way more than the original nudes palette, as I&#x27;m more into pinks than browns.</li>
            <li>The colors are SUPER pigmented and nice.</li>
            <li>I know blush colors are all the rage right now, but I have to say I liked the Loreal Nudes palette much more than this.</li>
            <li>What surprised me the most was bits of sparkle in most of the colors making this a good collection for evening wear as well.</li>
            <li>It can easily fit into any purse, even most wrist-lets or clutches, for on the go touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybelline: add a better applicator or leave the cheap one&#x27;s out and</li>
            <li>I had better results with W7&#x27;s dupes (In the Nude, In the Buff, In the Buff Lightly Toasted, etc.)</li>
            <li>Again, this is expected, and the product is perfectly serviceable.</li>
            <li>When make up is applied the right way, these shades will look amazing.</li>
            <li>What I like about this:  The colors are excellent because there is a good range from very light vanilla to very dark charcoal, and there are some very useful medium- dark taupes that are great for every day.  </li>
            <li>It arrived intact, with no breakage and the TWELVE colors provided a perfect compliment to each other.</li>
            <li>But overall, it&#x27;s a good value!</li>
            <li>It was easy to put on and take off -</li>
            <li>, these can easily carry the wearer from night to day with ease.  </li>
            <li>The colors are visible and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow also wiped away easily with a makeup remover cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, the selection is good, however, they could provide a larger selection of colors 2 or more in light and medium shades would make this a staple go-to for those that prefer to wear  nude eye shadows.  </li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t worth more than the asking price.  </li>
            <li>I used with the matte brown shades to fill in my eyebrows, and it worked fantastic.  </li>
            <li>They flow on smoothly, and stay on for hours; I would reapply every 8 hours or so.</li>
            <li>I also like the lightness of the powder that goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I have brown eyes, brown hair and light to med skin tone.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this product was available for review, I leapt at the chance.</li>
            <li>coppery to deeper plums and a light and medium gray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The colors go on smoothly and evenly, and feel like quality eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>which are also available on Amazon and (at the time I purchased them) cheaper than Maybelline&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>Genuine Maybelline product.</li>
            <li>also want to mention the cheap applicators included in this set.</li>
            <li>I wear light eye-shadow and find that if I apply these using the tips I know to make the colors stay on longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors in this palette fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I am more of a natural kind of person, use lots of bronzer.</li>
            <li>As far as price goes, $9.98 is a good price for a set of 12 shades, which combine 4 3-shade Maybelline pallets, 3 4-shade and 6</li>
            <li>have a light shimmer that appears halfway between a matte and a true shimmer.</li>
            <li>These shadows are between a creamy and cakey consistency and you may experience more fallout than higher end</li>
            <li>However, with a primer, it can be worn alone or layered with other shades to create a beautiful nude look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it three stars because there&#x27;s nothing special about it</li>
            <li>After really packing on the color, the blending brush removes most of it</li>
            <li>Eyeshadow is my absolute favorite beauty product and I apply it often.</li>
            <li>Urban Decay is my absolute favorite and for a good reason.</li>
            <li>Not bad...</li>
            <li>and I mean all the colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li>The original The Nudes palette has much better pigmentation, in my opinion, which is a shame because I like the actual colors in this palette better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, overall this is a very good palette for those embracing the natural look this year.</li>
            <li>I would classify this as a younger palette, and I know my teen would be very happy with these colors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the brushes that come in these compacts, so I do use my own and it applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Maybelline takes its best shot at mirroring the Urban Decay line of make-up products and the result is.... solid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky I have quality brushes to apply it with.  </li>
            <li>favorite colors out of this palette are the light gold and dark gold -  #3 and #5 on the top.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blend, and contains bright pink sparkles.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it for convenience.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors were darker than I had expected and some were lighter but all in all they do make a good combination if you like pinks and greens.</li>
            <li>eye shadows looks more natural on me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this -- and so does my 14 year old.</li>
            <li>rose to sultry deep tones that enhance the bone structure.</li>
            <li>I own all three UD Naked Palettes and use them often.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $12 price.</li>
            <li>That rarely happens to me with eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I tried to get a deal again because I got lucky the first time but not this time.</li>
            <li>The gold shades looks good when I wear black.  </li>
            <li>I love the warm bronze/gold tones throughout and although I would not do \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; on my entire lid, I adore the accents I create with this very lovely set when I&#x27;m in the mood for something a little extra.</li>
            <li>The price of about a dollar a shade was very reasonable given the verity provided.</li>
            <li>The top 4 starting from the left are very light.</li>
            <li>This set has sultry range of mostly earth tones,that certainly rival more expensive lines.the range goes from warm to cool-tones and really do work to enhance the structure of your face giving shimmering</li>
            <li>Overall a nice compact and although the price initially seemed a bit high in my opinion, when you think about how many colors you receive</li>
            <li>I wanted to see how they would hold up when I wore them out, on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>I applied the shadow first thing in the morning, before 8am and was at an outdoor festival all day.  </li>
            <li>Love these colors and I use it several times a week, very neutral, they go with just about everything, they stay on for me all work day!</li>
            <li>All of the top row are sea shell shades, shimmery, but low on pigment.  </li>
            <li>Great colors and long lasting color.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors</li>
            <li>The browns in this palette bring out the color in my eyes much more than the Urban Debay 3 palette -</li>
            <li>The colors look exactly like they do on the pictures.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them, or going to a higher price point and picking up Coastal Scent&#x27;s Revealed palettes.</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty, but the formula is chalky.</li>
            <li>They have a bit more variety on the color spectrum than the Naked Palettes do.</li>
            <li>and I recommend you do the same for better results.</li>
            <li>However, trust me when I say that you would be better off saving up for a Naked Palette and splurging.</li>
            <li>The application brushes included with this product might as well be thrown away, which is exactly what I have always done.</li>
            <li>Perfect for daytime or a casual evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a nice range of shades, but that hardly matters when the shadows are chalky and break up easily.  </li>
            <li>Love the soft natural colors!</li>
            <li>My favorite shade is the matte dusty rose, which is the basis of many different looks.  </li>
            <li>The deep rose shade can make the eyes look tired, and is best used for the crease only.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t need any other eye shadow for the 12 days I&#x27;ll be traveling, just my own makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice if you are wanting to save some money from the other name brand palettes.</li>
            <li>Love the color selection, easy to take several different colors with you.</li>
            <li>The color palette is made up of 12 different shades that are different enough to make the set very useful while also really giving the user a great option of colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to have a palette and much more affordable here than some of the other brands.</li>
            <li>quality, however, I am not sure it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>go on smoothly and offer really nice, subtle color and shading.</li>
            <li>While expectations were definitely kept at a minimum due to the overall brand image of Maybelline among most higher end make-up users, the product is actually a nice step in the right direction for the brand.</li>
            <li>The box containing the palette is a nice quality solid plastic that will keep the shadows safe, and it is quite small -- about the size of an iPhone 6.</li>
            <li>These are fine especially at this price point.  </li>
            <li>may be misunderstanding the concept of this particular pallet, and this may be just what you want exactly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to say I like it better than the expensive brands.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not kidding about the nudes being blushed: most of the colors, even the brownish ones, have a pink or reddish tint.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot a of make-up, but what I do wear tends to be very neutral and</li>
            <li>really put them to the test, though.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So - four stars - because the powder is clearly a lot cheaper than the UD formula - but SO worth a try.  </li>
            <li>This pallet competes VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with a pink and yellow undertone and they all work really well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Anyone who buys a lot of eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t expect much from these brushes, so no surprise there.</li>
            <li>I would have to get it wet to be able to blend it, and that probably won&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>The pink shades looks good on me when I wear white.</li>
            <li>Nice colors but a bit crumbly making some waste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say their medium to high pigmentation depending on shade and some of the liter shades are more sheer, but provide a soft wash of shimmering color.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, as I&#x27;ve noted, the shimmer is subtle on most of the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers that have commented that the colors are a bit more glittery than they need to be, which is the biggest drawback I could find as well with this set.</li>
            <li>I use Urban Decay original formula eye primer.  </li>
            <li>Although I have an authentic urban decay eye shadow primer which gets me the exact results of the real urban decay palette</li>
            <li>I am a gal who has never worn &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; makeup or &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; colors, especially now in my middle 40&#x27;s,  so I chose Maybelline&#x27;s  new Blushed Nudes Eyeshadow to see how I liked them.  </li>
            <li>There are many on the market (I prefer Bare Minerals and Urban Decay) that work well.  </li>
            <li>The coloring goes well with my &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; coloring (dark blond hair, blue eyes, fair skin with pink/blue undertones).</li>
            <li>It offers a mix of both matte and sparkly colors, and it&#x27;s easy to create a bunch of different looks.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super pigmented, but at the same time, you don&#x27;t have to apply a whole lot to see it.</li>
            <li>I prefer more single professional make up brushes for eye color</li>
            <li>I normally apply first thing in the morning and by late afternoon it&#x27;s still showing nicely.</li>
            <li>I actually loved it so much, that I purchased one for myself a few weeks later.</li>
            <li>and I want my eyes to look pretty natural.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a bad thing, but it is different.  </li>
            <li>These shadows are better than the Maybelline Nude Palette, so maybe the company rethought its formulation, improving it slightly.  </li>
            <li>On my 40-something face, I need to be careful not to overdo the shimmer, so I&#x27;d go easy on this palette.</li>
            <li>The applicator that comes with this has a traditional eyeshadow eand, but also has a more blunt side on the opposite end.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like particularly clingy shadows - and lasted all throughout my work day.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant in the palette.</li>
            <li>I have a urban decay naked 2 palette knock off that cost me 10 dollars and it works better than this one.</li>
            <li>The main reason I gave this product 4 stars is because it met the expectations that I had.</li>
            <li>But if, like me, a $54 price tag is too high, then this palette is an acceptable substitute.  </li>
            <li>I have to assume that this palette is competing with the Urban Decay Naked palette in terms of coloring; I have the Naked palette and that&#x27;s why I was interested in how this, with fewer colors but a MUCH more reasonable price point, would</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a solid mid-tier makeup set that won&#x27;t break the bank, this set is worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>and I used the two shades on the upper right for a medium tone.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try the next 4 to the right</li>
            <li>This set from Maybelline New York</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York The Blushed Nudes eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the urban decay naked pallets, but my budget won&#x27;t allow me to have them all.</li>
            <li>This is such an innovative knock off of the Urban Decay (UD) line&#x27;s NAKEDS #3 - FANTASTIC for green eyes!  </li>
            <li>I am really surprised at how accurate the tone, shade, ​​and arrangement mimic the much more expensive brand!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the texture is different, and the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t go onto my applicator as easy as a more expensive brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The eye shadow does take a little more to apply, but will last all day even in heat and humidity.</li>
            <li>I love all the shades, the only thing I would change is the applicators are kind of thin, I like them to be a little wider.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be too shimmery, too young for me</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who uses natural eye shadow shades.</li>
            <li>these are soft, semi-transparent shades, they are flattering for any complexion.  </li>
            <li>They really are tiny and sheI would have appreciated a larger set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So you can create looks for natural day-time, all the way to glamorous night-time.</li>
            <li>As far as Maybelline goes, it is on the cheaper side in the makeup world.</li>
            <li>but if you compare to Urban Decay, the difference is pretty apparent.  </li>
            <li>The gray is a beautiful shade that is very difficult to blend.  </li>
            <li>Good for beginners as it isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li>Four are very sparkly and probably will not be very useful, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>Right away I noticed that the 2 applicator brushes that come with this set are not very practical</li>
            <li>The small size makes it convenient for portability, or just easy handling while transforming yourself to face the world.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to hold in your hand (comparable to the size of the latest smartphones-</li>
            <li>The colors last pretty well all day, though occasionally I will touch up if I have something in the evening.</li>
            <li>Really pretty, mostly sparkly shadows, varying from very pale to dark.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t begin to compare with UD Naked 3 palette, whose shadows are creamy and highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>You can certainly buy a similar product from Urban Decay, Stila, or any other high end brand, and you can pay twice as much.</li>
            <li>the colors are pretty and light but still have a dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>The matte shades are chalky and not very pigmented and the shimmery shades have far too much fallout.  </li>
            <li>The pale shades to the left and most of the top row were a subtle blush of pink</li>
            <li>in all this is a decent low to mid range palette for a drugstore price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a decent palette if you can not afford the Urban Decay Naked Palettes.</li>
            <li>I am definitely drawn to using natural shades of browns for eye shadow to sculpt and highlight.</li>
            <li>I am a Bare Minerals fan</li>
            <li>I purchased this palette for my 14 year old daughter this summer at a local store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Urban Decay and other expensive brands and been happy with them.</li>
            <li>No matter how many layers of these eye shadows you apply, it is very hard to achieve any deep colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not a high end palette by any means but it could be decent for those starting out with makeup or those who don&#x27;t want to break the bank on eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>If this was supposed to compete with the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette, it has fallen far short of the mark.  </li>
            <li>As far as longevity, this eyeshadow lasted as long as any others.</li>
            <li>It all comes down to how much you want to spend on makeup, and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that these shades are very &amp;#34;shimmer-y.&amp;#34; There was a little too much shimmer.</li>
            <li>The pale colors have so much glitter in them that there is little room for real pigment.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A good value for what you get.</li>
            <li> Colors are good for my complexion.</li>
            <li> Recommend theses shades for someone who is fair skinned.</li>
            <li> Fantastic color palate, perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> While it may not be fair to compare a $12 palette to a $50 palette, I am going to do so</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the colors included in this palette are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I then blend all the colors to create a gorgeous sultry look.</li>
            <li> and it still didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li> Superior product.</li>
            <li> Good value in terms of shades.  </li>
            <li> Revive my today and I&#x27;m in love with this palette is yes beautiful and suthe colors for any age.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this collection.</li>
            <li> Maybelline&#x27;s pallet is a great option if you love UD&#x27;s pallets.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with colors of the pallets.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I do love the colors, which are some great neutral shades.</li>
            <li> The number of shades made this the perfect collection to experiment and find just the right combination for me.</li>
            <li> Love this palette!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the colors!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Pinks and rose gold shades are on trend for the Spring of 2015 and this palette can be used for versatile purposes.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a nice effect, and the colors blend well together.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be one of my favorites, but it&#x27;s still a nice set.</li>
            <li> , it would be nice if the darker shades were matte rather than shimmer.</li>
            <li> I liked these colors</li>
            <li> I found the lighter colors to be very beautiful and great for highlighting the brow bone and the inner part of the eyes.</li>
            <li> Even if you have some wrinkling on your eyelids, you can achieve a nice dewy look if you don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Colors are pinks, maybes, rose gold/</li>
            <li> Nice to have many good ones to design my eye accent with.</li>
            <li> The case is sturdy with a nice applicator.</li>
            <li> Nice colors for summer</li>
            <li> Really nicely pigmented for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice quality for the price too.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set at twice the price.</li>
            <li> A nice quality set.</li>
            <li> colors are nice and go on evenly-ish.  </li>
            <li> The colors blend nicely and wear well.</li>
            <li> You should probably get your own applicators or brushes though to prevent mixing and muddying the colors in the palette.</li>
            <li> If you like more &amp;#34;natural tones&amp;#34; this a good pallet for you.</li>
            <li> ; all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> A nice variety of shades allowing me to toss out all my others over this one now.</li>
            <li> The bottom right color is ideal for lining my eyes.</li>
            <li> Adding more shadow will add pigment, and these shades, as well as the first three on the bottom row, blend wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Really pretty colors perfect on a blonde really great for summer!</li>
            <li> but these are still suitable.</li>
            <li> those tend to be more rose golds</li>
            <li> Love love love this!  </li>
            <li> A lovely palate of nude shades, perfect for enhancing a natural look.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, they are soft and attractive and I feel good wearing the blushed nudes.</li>
            <li> However, once applied they go on very, very light.</li>
            <li> this maybeline one goes on very smooth and you dont have to dig into it to get color on the eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li> The rose colors are pretty and fairly subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too many of these shades are shimmery.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how shimmery most of these colors are.</li>
            <li> And the trick to making it look like a deeper color and have more staying power?  </li>
            <li> shadow is a bit shimmery, more so in the case than on your face.  </li>
            <li> I found myself so pleased with both the colors and the quality of an eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Simply the best collection of colors I&#x27;ve picked up in ages!</li>
            <li> you are a more &amp;#34;natural gal&amp;#34</li>
            <li> (and I do absolutely love Maybelline)</li>
            <li> has that and more.</li>
            <li> The UD shadow is creamier and more luxurious.  </li>
            <li> and I feel that it would have been best for Maybelline to have just left them out of the packaging all together!</li>
            <li> As with most eye shadows, it helps to use an eyelid primer to bring out the best colors in the shadow and help it to last all day</li>
            <li> I would have preferred more matte colors.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re OK</li>
            <li> Some of the pinks didn&#x27;t show well on my skin (medium brown); it&#x27;s probably better for lighter skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Lovely colors.</li>
            <li> Both for better quality and better color choices.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that so many of the colors were shimmer.</li>
            <li> Love the colors.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> and they bring out more redness in my eyes, which is unflattering.</li>
            <li> and it is stunning.</li>
            <li> I love how flexible this is...</li>
            <li> With a palette you do have more options.</li>
            <li> The colors In this set of eye shadows is in the fighter shades I love, and the price was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love eyeshadow, and I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years.</li>
            <li> Those products are better in many ways, but, for the price, Maybelline does the job.</li>
            <li> Love the ways the colors mesh.n</li>
            <li> I should have gone with a better brand.  </li>
            <li> There are both slightly warm and slightly cool shades, so you can have a nude palette that goes with any outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are on the warm to cool side so buy accordingly based on your skin</li>
            <li> I love it way more than the original nudes palette, as I&#x27;m more into pinks than browns.</li>
            <li> The colors are SUPER pigmented and nice.</li>
            <li> I know blush colors are all the rage right now, but I have to say I liked the Loreal Nudes palette much more than this.</li>
            <li> What surprised me the most was bits of sparkle in most of the colors making this a good collection for evening wear as well.</li>
            <li> It can easily fit into any purse, even most wrist-lets or clutches, for on the go touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybelline: add a better applicator or leave the cheap one&#x27;s out and</li>
            <li> I had better results with W7&#x27;s dupes (In the Nude, In the Buff, In the Buff Lightly Toasted, etc.)</li>
            <li> Again, this is expected, and the product is perfectly serviceable.</li>
            <li> When make up is applied the right way, these shades will look amazing.</li>
            <li> What I like about this:  The colors are excellent because there is a good range from very light vanilla to very dark charcoal, and there are some very useful medium- dark taupes that are great for every day.  </li>
            <li> It arrived intact, with no breakage and the TWELVE colors provided a perfect compliment to each other.</li>
            <li> But overall, it&#x27;s a good value!</li>
            <li> It was easy to put on and take off -</li>
            <li> , these can easily carry the wearer from night to day with ease.  </li>
            <li> The colors are visible and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow also wiped away easily with a makeup remover cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, the selection is good, however, they could provide a larger selection of colors 2 or more in light and medium shades would make this a staple go-to for those that prefer to wear  nude eye shadows.  </li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t worth more than the asking price.  </li>
            <li> I used with the matte brown shades to fill in my eyebrows, and it worked fantastic.  </li>
            <li> They flow on smoothly, and stay on for hours; I would reapply every 8 hours or so.</li>
            <li> I also like the lightness of the powder that goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I have brown eyes, brown hair and light to med skin tone.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this product was available for review, I leapt at the chance.</li>
            <li> coppery to deeper plums and a light and medium gray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The colors go on smoothly and evenly, and feel like quality eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> which are also available on Amazon and (at the time I purchased them) cheaper than Maybelline&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> Genuine Maybelline product.</li>
            <li> also want to mention the cheap applicators included in this set.</li>
            <li> I wear light eye-shadow and find that if I apply these using the tips I know to make the colors stay on longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I am more of a natural kind of person, use lots of bronzer.</li>
            <li> As far as price goes, $9.98 is a good price for a set of 12 shades, which combine 4 3-shade Maybelline pallets, 3 4-shade and 6</li>
            <li> have a light shimmer that appears halfway between a matte and a true shimmer.</li>
            <li> These shadows are between a creamy and cakey consistency and you may experience more fallout than higher end</li>
            <li> However, with a primer, it can be worn alone or layered with other shades to create a beautiful nude look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it three stars because there&#x27;s nothing special about it</li>
            <li> After really packing on the color, the blending brush removes most of it</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow is my absolute favorite beauty product and I apply it often.</li>
            <li> Urban Decay is my absolute favorite and for a good reason.</li>
            <li> Not bad...</li>
            <li> and I mean all the colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li> The original The Nudes palette has much better pigmentation, in my opinion, which is a shame because I like the actual colors in this palette better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, overall this is a very good palette for those embracing the natural look this year.</li>
            <li> I would classify this as a younger palette, and I know my teen would be very happy with these colors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the brushes that come in these compacts, so I do use my own and it applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Maybelline takes its best shot at mirroring the Urban Decay line of make-up products and the result is.... solid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky I have quality brushes to apply it with.  </li>
            <li> favorite colors out of this palette are the light gold and dark gold -  #3 and #5 on the top.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blend, and contains bright pink sparkles.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it for convenience.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors were darker than I had expected and some were lighter but all in all they do make a good combination if you like pinks and greens.</li>
            <li> eye shadows looks more natural on me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this -- and so does my 14 year old.</li>
            <li> rose to sultry deep tones that enhance the bone structure.</li>
            <li> I own all three UD Naked Palettes and use them often.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $12 price.</li>
            <li> That rarely happens to me with eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I tried to get a deal again because I got lucky the first time but not this time.</li>
            <li> The gold shades looks good when I wear black.  </li>
            <li> I love the warm bronze/gold tones throughout and although I would not do \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; on my entire lid, I adore the accents I create with this very lovely set when I&#x27;m in the mood for something a little extra.</li>
            <li> The price of about a dollar a shade was very reasonable given the verity provided.</li>
            <li> The top 4 starting from the left are very light.</li>
            <li> This set has sultry range of mostly earth tones,that certainly rival more expensive lines.the range goes from warm to cool-tones and really do work to enhance the structure of your face giving shimmering</li>
            <li> Overall a nice compact and although the price initially seemed a bit high in my opinion, when you think about how many colors you receive</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how they would hold up when I wore them out, on a hot day.  </li>
            <li> I applied the shadow first thing in the morning, before 8am and was at an outdoor festival all day.  </li>
            <li> Love these colors and I use it several times a week, very neutral, they go with just about everything, they stay on for me all work day!</li>
            <li> All of the top row are sea shell shades, shimmery, but low on pigment.  </li>
            <li> Great colors and long lasting color.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors</li>
            <li> The browns in this palette bring out the color in my eyes much more than the Urban Debay 3 palette -</li>
            <li> The colors look exactly like they do on the pictures.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them, or going to a higher price point and picking up Coastal Scent&#x27;s Revealed palettes.</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty, but the formula is chalky.</li>
            <li> They have a bit more variety on the color spectrum than the Naked Palettes do.</li>
            <li> and I recommend you do the same for better results.</li>
            <li> However, trust me when I say that you would be better off saving up for a Naked Palette and splurging.</li>
            <li> The application brushes included with this product might as well be thrown away, which is exactly what I have always done.</li>
            <li> Perfect for daytime or a casual evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a nice range of shades, but that hardly matters when the shadows are chalky and break up easily.  </li>
            <li> Love the soft natural colors!</li>
            <li> My favorite shade is the matte dusty rose, which is the basis of many different looks.  </li>
            <li> The deep rose shade can make the eyes look tired, and is best used for the crease only.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t need any other eye shadow for the 12 days I&#x27;ll be traveling, just my own makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice if you are wanting to save some money from the other name brand palettes.</li>
            <li> Love the color selection, easy to take several different colors with you.</li>
            <li> The color palette is made up of 12 different shades that are different enough to make the set very useful while also really giving the user a great option of colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to have a palette and much more affordable here than some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> quality, however, I am not sure it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> go on smoothly and offer really nice, subtle color and shading.</li>
            <li> While expectations were definitely kept at a minimum due to the overall brand image of Maybelline among most higher end make-up users, the product is actually a nice step in the right direction for the brand.</li>
            <li> The box containing the palette is a nice quality solid plastic that will keep the shadows safe, and it is quite small -- about the size of an iPhone 6.</li>
            <li> These are fine especially at this price point.  </li>
            <li> may be misunderstanding the concept of this particular pallet, and this may be just what you want exactly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to say I like it better than the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not kidding about the nudes being blushed: most of the colors, even the brownish ones, have a pink or reddish tint.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot a of make-up, but what I do wear tends to be very neutral and</li>
            <li> really put them to the test, though.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So - four stars - because the powder is clearly a lot cheaper than the UD formula - but SO worth a try.  </li>
            <li> This pallet competes VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with a pink and yellow undertone and they all work really well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Anyone who buys a lot of eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t expect much from these brushes, so no surprise there.</li>
            <li> I would have to get it wet to be able to blend it, and that probably won&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> The pink shades looks good on me when I wear white.</li>
            <li> Nice colors but a bit crumbly making some waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say their medium to high pigmentation depending on shade and some of the liter shades are more sheer, but provide a soft wash of shimmering color.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, as I&#x27;ve noted, the shimmer is subtle on most of the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that have commented that the colors are a bit more glittery than they need to be, which is the biggest drawback I could find as well with this set.</li>
            <li> I use Urban Decay original formula eye primer.  </li>
            <li> Although I have an authentic urban decay eye shadow primer which gets me the exact results of the real urban decay palette</li>
            <li> I am a gal who has never worn &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; makeup or &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; colors, especially now in my middle 40&#x27;s,  so I chose Maybelline&#x27;s  new Blushed Nudes Eyeshadow to see how I liked them.  </li>
            <li> There are many on the market (I prefer Bare Minerals and Urban Decay) that work well.  </li>
            <li> The coloring goes well with my &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; coloring (dark blond hair, blue eyes, fair skin with pink/blue undertones).</li>
            <li> It offers a mix of both matte and sparkly colors, and it&#x27;s easy to create a bunch of different looks.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super pigmented, but at the same time, you don&#x27;t have to apply a whole lot to see it.</li>
            <li> I prefer more single professional make up brushes for eye color</li>
            <li> I normally apply first thing in the morning and by late afternoon it&#x27;s still showing nicely.</li>
            <li> I actually loved it so much, that I purchased one for myself a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> and I want my eyes to look pretty natural.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a bad thing, but it is different.  </li>
            <li> These shadows are better than the Maybelline Nude Palette, so maybe the company rethought its formulation, improving it slightly.  </li>
            <li> On my 40-something face, I need to be careful not to overdo the shimmer, so I&#x27;d go easy on this palette.</li>
            <li> The applicator that comes with this has a traditional eyeshadow eand, but also has a more blunt side on the opposite end.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like particularly clingy shadows - and lasted all throughout my work day.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant in the palette.</li>
            <li> I have a urban decay naked 2 palette knock off that cost me 10 dollars and it works better than this one.</li>
            <li> The main reason I gave this product 4 stars is because it met the expectations that I had.</li>
            <li> But if, like me, a $54 price tag is too high, then this palette is an acceptable substitute.  </li>
            <li> I have to assume that this palette is competing with the Urban Decay Naked palette in terms of coloring; I have the Naked palette and that&#x27;s why I was interested in how this, with fewer colors but a MUCH more reasonable price point, would</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a solid mid-tier makeup set that won&#x27;t break the bank, this set is worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> and I used the two shades on the upper right for a medium tone.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the next 4 to the right</li>
            <li> This set from Maybelline New York</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York The Blushed Nudes eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the urban decay naked pallets, but my budget won&#x27;t allow me to have them all.</li>
            <li> This is such an innovative knock off of the Urban Decay (UD) line&#x27;s NAKEDS #3 - FANTASTIC for green eyes!  </li>
            <li> I am really surprised at how accurate the tone, shade, ​​and arrangement mimic the much more expensive brand!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the texture is different, and the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t go onto my applicator as easy as a more expensive brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The eye shadow does take a little more to apply, but will last all day even in heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> I love all the shades, the only thing I would change is the applicators are kind of thin, I like them to be a little wider.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be too shimmery, too young for me</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who uses natural eye shadow shades.</li>
            <li> these are soft, semi-transparent shades, they are flattering for any complexion.  </li>
            <li> They really are tiny and sheI would have appreciated a larger set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So you can create looks for natural day-time, all the way to glamorous night-time.</li>
            <li> As far as Maybelline goes, it is on the cheaper side in the makeup world.</li>
            <li> but if you compare to Urban Decay, the difference is pretty apparent.  </li>
            <li> The gray is a beautiful shade that is very difficult to blend.  </li>
            <li> Good for beginners as it isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> Four are very sparkly and probably will not be very useful, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> Right away I noticed that the 2 applicator brushes that come with this set are not very practical</li>
            <li> The small size makes it convenient for portability, or just easy handling while transforming yourself to face the world.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to hold in your hand (comparable to the size of the latest smartphones-</li>
            <li> The colors last pretty well all day, though occasionally I will touch up if I have something in the evening.</li>
            <li> Really pretty, mostly sparkly shadows, varying from very pale to dark.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t begin to compare with UD Naked 3 palette, whose shadows are creamy and highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li> You can certainly buy a similar product from Urban Decay, Stila, or any other high end brand, and you can pay twice as much.</li>
            <li> the colors are pretty and light but still have a dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> The matte shades are chalky and not very pigmented and the shimmery shades have far too much fallout.  </li>
            <li> The pale shades to the left and most of the top row were a subtle blush of pink</li>
            <li> in all this is a decent low to mid range palette for a drugstore price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a decent palette if you can not afford the Urban Decay Naked Palettes.</li>
            <li> I am definitely drawn to using natural shades of browns for eye shadow to sculpt and highlight.</li>
            <li> I am a Bare Minerals fan</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette for my 14 year old daughter this summer at a local store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Urban Decay and other expensive brands and been happy with them.</li>
            <li> No matter how many layers of these eye shadows you apply, it is very hard to achieve any deep colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not a high end palette by any means but it could be decent for those starting out with makeup or those who don&#x27;t want to break the bank on eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> If this was supposed to compete with the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette, it has fallen far short of the mark.  </li>
            <li> As far as longevity, this eyeshadow lasted as long as any others.</li>
            <li> It all comes down to how much you want to spend on makeup, and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that these shades are very &amp;#34;shimmer-y.&amp;#34; There was a little too much shimmer.</li>
            <li> The pale colors have so much glitter in them that there is little room for real pigment.</li>
            <li> I typically use high end cosmetics, UD, BAREMINERALS</li>
            <li> You usually have a least one color you don&#x27;t use thus making your purchase more costly.  </li>
            <li> A pretty selection of shades dominated by purples and browns with some blue, green, mauve, black and white also.  </li>
            <li> But glowing is the right word to describe this set of subtle eye</li>
            <li> I have a flat eyeliner brush that I use the darkest color on my lash line.  </li>
            <li> Was having trouble with using a normal shadow brush</li>
            <li> As expected, the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t stay on quite as long as a more expensive brand, such as Clinique or Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> It makes them look less natural than matte colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering that the entire set costs about what a single shadow does at a department store, this is truly a bargain.</li>
            <li> I typically use 3-5 colors at a time (lighter on the inside, shimmery in the middle, slightly darker on the outside and dark in the crease and on the very end).</li>
            <li> The dark pigments are very dark and do not blend very well either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive eyeshadow, and I&#x27;ve used cheap brands.</li>
            <li> I have one quibble (and it&#x27;s a minor one)</li>
            <li> Complete waste</li>
            <li> this palette is a tiny bit wider yet a half an inch smaller in length).</li>
            <li> You will love this, and you can&#x27;t go wrong price-wise!</li>
            <li> All of the colors are very subtle, not to &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; and look very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; no matter what combination of the 10 different shades you choose to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She thought this little box of various shades did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with it.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT SEVERAL, AROUND 5 OF THE LITTLE CAKES, HAD ARRIVED UNGLUED.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I have absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I spent over $50 for the UD brand.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> My eyes are hazel with lots of green and yellow.</li>
            <li> ; like me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this beautiful but subtle 10 shade color eyeshadow palette!</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair (with gray) and pale skin.  </li>
            <li> The eye make up kit comes with two small sponge brushes of different shapes and sizes (two to each brush).</li>
            <li> Since this palette arrived it has become my go-to -- all my other eye shadows are lying unused in my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> Loose powder has a tendency to be messy while this collection was not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sheer but not densely pigmented so that without a primer, it hardly shows up at all.  </li>
            <li> To me, it is just average.  </li>
            <li> I use the bottom dark colors 3 - 6 on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like dark colors or unnatural</li>
            <li> It brings the product&#x27;s value down in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The darker shades are a little on the dull side for me and none of them looked like the same color on my skin as they did in the case.</li>
            <li> I end up with a muddied mess on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s only small complaint is that she thinks the applicators are too skinny.  </li>
            <li> The colors are well pigmented and stay strong throughout the day (I do use concealer as a base for my eye makeup).</li>
            <li> The shadows are a little crumbly-powdery.  </li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I still prefer Revlon eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Noticed it on Amazon few dollars</li>
            <li> I was quite shocked at how they almost exactly mirror the UD colors.  </li>
            <li> All have a shimmer to them and the variety can create simple accents to very heavy and dramatic shading.  </li>
            <li> The deep gray shade on the bottom right is horrific.  </li>
            <li> It should be noted that all 12 shades have some sort of shimmer in them, none of which are excessive.</li>
            <li> AND THE EYESHADOW ITSELF IS DIFFICULT TO OPEN.</li>
            <li> EcoTool brushes, a highlighter brush, a small shadow brush, and a lid brush.</li>
            <li> I did have to use my finger because the applicators were small.  </li>
            <li> I never use the application brushes because I have a fairly expensive set of brushes that I bought several years ago.</li>
            <li> They do shimmer a bit, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> When I checked my eyes late that afternoon, imagine my surprise to see that there was still color on my lids.  </li>
            <li> Eye shadow should glide onto the eyelid, not have to be shoved around on this delicate area.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will have to get proper brushes if you don&#x27;t already have them, the applicators that come with Maybelline are crap.  </li>
            <li> dont have anything bad to say except I bought it at meijers for 10.50 and should of bought it at amazon for less money.</li>
            <li> I get frustrated with the quads.  </li>
            <li> I wish with all my heart that Maybelline would stop putting sparkles into their eye makeup. :(</li>
            <li> I have a physicians formula one that I hate.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are horrible compared to my knock off.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Too many of these shades are shimmery.  If this was supposed to compete with the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette, it has fallen far short of the mark.  The matte shades are chalky and not very pigmented and the shimmery shades have far too much fallout.  My favorite shade is the matte dusty rose, which is the basis of many different looks.  It&#x27;s sheer but not densely pigmented so that without a primer, it hardly shows up at all.  However, with a primer, it can be worn alone or layered with other shades to create a beautiful nude look.  Pinks and rose gold shades are on trend for the Spring of 2015 and this palette can be used for versatile purposes.  However, it doesn&#x27;t begin to compare with UD Naked 3 palette, whose shadows are creamy and highly pigmented.  But if, like me, a $54 price tag is too high, then this palette is an acceptable substitute.  These shadows are better than the Maybelline Nude Palette, so maybe the company rethought its formulation, improving it slightly.  I&#x27;m giving it three stars because there&#x27;s nothing special about it and it isn&#x27;t worth more than the asking price.  There is a nice range of shades, but that hardly matters when the shadows are chalky and break up easily.  I recommend it only if you are expert at applying sub par eyeshadows, creating a silk purse out of a sow&#x27;s ear, lol!  To me, it is just average.  I&#x27;m going to give it away and start saving my $$ for the UD Naked 3 palette.</li>
            <li> The applicator that comes with this has a traditional eyeshadow eand, but also has a more blunt side on the opposite end.  This blunt end I used with the matte brown shades to fill in my eyebrows, and it worked fantastic.  The compact has a beautiful array of neutral shadows in matte &amp; shimmering suitable for day or night.  I&#x27;m very happy with this compact.</li>
            <li> A lovely palate of nude shades, perfect for enhancing a natural look. The price of about a dollar a shade was very reasonable given the verity provided. The number of shades made this the perfect collection to experiment and find just the right combination for me. It was easy to put on and take off - I don&#x27;t like particularly clingy shadows - and lasted all throughout my work day. All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this collection.</li>
            <li> Great colors for the summer!!  I can&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> The one thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how shimmery most of these colors are. That&#x27;s not a bad thing, but it is different.  It makes them look less natural than matte colors. They&#x27;re not kidding about the nudes being blushed: most of the colors, even the brownish ones, have a pink or reddish tint.  But it&#x27;s a nice effect, and the colors blend well together.  The coloring goes well with my &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; coloring (dark blond hair, blue eyes, fair skin with pink/blue undertones). They flow on smoothly, and stay on for hours; I would reapply every 8 hours or so. I would classify this as a younger palette, and I know my teen would be very happy with these colors.  On my 40-something face, I need to be careful not to overdo the shimmer, so I&#x27;d go easy on this palette. It won&#x27;t be one of my favorites, but it&#x27;s still a nice set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot a of make-up, but what I do wear tends to be very neutral and so this &amp;#34;Blushed Nudes&amp;#34; set was perfect. It arrived intact, with no breakage and the TWELVE colors provided a perfect compliment to each other. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the brushes that come in these compacts, so I do use my own and it applies smoothly and evenly. I normally apply first thing in the morning and by late afternoon it&#x27;s still showing nicely. Overall a nice compact and although the price initially seemed a bit high in my opinion, when you think about how many colors you receive it&#x27;s well worth it for convenience.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be giving a glowing review to Maybelline cosmetics. But glowing is the right word to describe this set of subtle eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most have a light shimmer that appears halfway between a matte and a true shimmer. The colors are a bit lighter than they appear on-screen. There are both slightly warm and slightly cool shades, so you can have a nude palette that goes with any outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go on smoothly and offer really nice, subtle color and shading. Perfect for daytime or a casual evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have one quibble (and it&#x27;s a minor one), it would be nice if the darker shades were matte rather than shimmer. Fortunately, as I&#x27;ve noted, the shimmer is subtle on most of the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that the entire set costs about what a single shadow does at a department store, this is truly a bargain.</li>
            <li> While this is not as deeply pigmented as some more expensive brands, it will do the trick.  And the trick to making it look like a deeper color and have more staying power?  Use a primer.  If I want makeup to stay all day, I use a primer. There are many on the market (I prefer Bare Minerals and Urban Decay) that work well.  Once that has been applied I tend to use a brush for my shadows.  If you want a deeper look, patting the shadow on with the applicators provided works well.  My eyeshadow lasted through a 9 hour workday + several hours of rock climbing....even without the primer it was still apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadow is a bit shimmery, more so in the case than on your face.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be too shimmery, too young for me (I&#x27;m 38).</li>
            <li> Gorgeous range of colors, some matte and some with a shimmer, these can easily carry the wearer from night to day with ease.  I am not a fan of the applicators that come with the set and wish that there were a mirror included.  Otherwise, I have absolutely no complaints.  The pale shades to the left and most of the top row were a subtle blush of pink and I used the two shades on the upper right for a medium tone.  The darker shades on the bottom blended so beautifully that I used them for a smokey eye. In fact, this set is so perfect for my complexion that I am going to take it with me on a trip in July.  I won&#x27;t need any other eye shadow for the 12 days I&#x27;ll be traveling, just my own makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really put them to the test, though.  I wanted to see how they would hold up when I wore them out, on a hot day.  I applied the shadow first thing in the morning, before 8am and was at an outdoor festival all day.  It was 90F and I was sweating.  When I checked my eyes late that afternoon, imagine my surprise to see that there was still color on my lids.  I don&#x27;t know when the last time was I found myself so pleased with both the colors and the quality of an eyeshadow. Simply the best collection of colors I&#x27;ve picked up in ages!</li>
            <li> I am a gal who has never worn &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; makeup or &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; colors, especially now in my middle 40&#x27;s,  so I chose Maybelline&#x27;s  new Blushed Nudes Eyeshadow to see how I liked them.  All of the colors are very subtle, not to &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; and look very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; no matter what combination of the 10 different shades you choose to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a more &amp;#34;natural gal&amp;#34; like me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this beautiful but subtle 10 shade color eyeshadow palette!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. I am definitely drawn to using natural shades of browns for eye shadow to sculpt and highlight. This set from Maybelline New York (and I do absolutely love Maybelline) has that and more. I love the warm bronze/gold tones throughout and although I would not do \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; on my entire lid, I adore the accents I create with this very lovely set when I&#x27;m in the mood for something a little extra. The small size makes it convenient for portability, or just easy handling while transforming yourself to face the world. Very nice product and I would recommend it to anyone who uses natural eye shadow shades.</li>
            <li> This is such an innovative knock off of the Urban Decay (UD) line&#x27;s NAKEDS #3 - FANTASTIC for green eyes!  I spent over $50 for the UD brand.  The UD shadow is creamier and more luxurious.  The box is nicer, and it comes with a proper  eyeshadow brush.  However, having said all that, this Maybelline eye shadow palette has the colors NAILED!  I was quite shocked at how they almost exactly mirror the UD colors.  And they are a total bargain, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have to get proper brushes if you don&#x27;t already have them, the applicators that come with Maybelline are crap.  But the colors - *DAMN* I am really surprised at how accurate the tone, shade, ​​and arrangement mimic the much more expensive brand!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - four stars - because the powder is clearly a lot cheaper than the UD formula - but SO worth a try.  Great set, nice and compact.  You will love this, and you can&#x27;t go wrong price-wise!</li>
            <li> Some of the colors were darker than I had expected and some were lighter but all in all they do make a good combination if you like pinks and greens. There are no blue colors in this collection. What surprised me the most was bits of sparkle in most of the colors making this a good collection for evening wear as well. The eye make up kit comes with two small sponge brushes of different shapes and sizes (two to each brush). I prefer more single professional make up brushes for eye color but these are still suitable. I also like the lightness of the powder that goes on smooth. I am a Bare Minerals fan but I may just change my mind. Loose powder has a tendency to be messy while this collection was not.</li>
            <li> The lady of the house doesn&#x27;t use a lot of makeup. She thought this little box of various shades did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have never tried Maybelline eye shadows before, but I I liked these colors so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. You have to put a lot on for it to actually show, which I don&#x27;t like. After using it a few times, I still prefer Revlon eye shadows.</li>
            <li> This is not a high end palette by any means but it could be decent for those starting out with makeup or those who don&#x27;t want to break the bank on eyeshadow. Right away I noticed that the 2 applicator brushes that come with this set are not very practical and I feel that it would have been best for Maybelline to have just left them out of the packaging all together! It brings the product&#x27;s value down in my opinion. The colors are on the warm to cool side so buy accordingly based on your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like is this palette&#x27;s great size! It is small enough to hold in your hand (comparable to the size of the latest smartphones- I have a Samsung S6 Edge and this palette is a tiny bit wider yet a half an inch smaller in length). It can easily fit into any purse, even most wrist-lets or clutches, for on the go touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added some pictures of swatches on my forearm using a primer. As with most eye shadows, it helps to use an eyelid primer to bring out the best colors in the shadow and help it to last all day (I used Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion in Eden- matte with yellow undertones). I found the lighter colors to be very beautiful and great for highlighting the brow bone and the inner part of the eyes. It should be noted that all 12 shades have some sort of shimmer in them, none of which are excessive. The darker shades are a little on the dull side for me and none of them looked like the same color on my skin as they did in the case. They seemed to lack dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a decent low to mid range palette for a drugstore price. These shadows are between a creamy and cakey consistency and you may experience more fallout than higher end brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline: add a better applicator or leave the cheap one&#x27;s out and this palette is a winner!</li>
            <li> Love these colors and I use it several times a week, very neutral, they go with just about everything, they stay on for me all work day!</li>
            <li> What I like about this:  The colors are excellent because there is a good range from very light vanilla to very dark charcoal, and there are some very useful medium- dark taupes that are great for every day.  The box containing the palette is a nice quality solid plastic that will keep the shadows safe, and it is quite small -- about the size of an iPhone 6. The rose colors are pretty and fairly subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wish were different-- only two of the twelve are truly matte. Six  are slightly to moderately shimmery.  Four are very sparkly and probably will not be very useful, at least for me.  I would have preferred more matte colors.  The shadows are a little crumbly-powdery.  They&#x27;re OK but if you compare to Urban Decay, the difference is pretty apparent.  These are fine especially at this price point.  It&#x27;s fun to have a palette and much more affordable here than some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT SEVERAL, AROUND 5 OF THE LITTLE CAKES, HAD ARRIVED UNGLUED.  THEY IS NO MIRROR----&lt;br /&gt;WHO SENDS MAKE-UP WITH NO MIRROR AND THE EYESHADOW ITSELF IS DIFFICULT TO OPEN.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye shadow at Walmart back in April of this year. Noticed it on Amazon few dollars cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite colors out of this palette are the light gold and dark gold -  #3 and #5 on the top. I use 3 as a highlighter, 5 as a lid shade. Then in the crease of the eye I use the bottom dark colors 3 - 6 on the bottom. The pink shades looks good on me when I wear white. The gold shades looks good when I wear black.  I apply these shadows with make up brushes. EcoTool brushes, a highlighter brush, a small shadow brush, and a lid brush. I have a flat eyeliner brush that I use the darkest color on my lash line.  It&#x27;s best to use make up brushes and not the ones included in the palette. When make up is applied the right way, these shades will look amazing. One just got to know their colors and how to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These eye shadows looks more natural on me. I am more of a natural kind of person, use lots of bronzer. My skin tone, eye color and hair color just fits perfectly with this eyeshadow palette. I have brown eyes, brown hair and light to med skin tone.  I don&#x27;t like dark colors or unnatural colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye shadow palette makes me look refreshed, polished and professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with Maybelline New York The Blushed Nudes eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Love this palette! The colors are SUPER pigmented and nice.</li>
            <li> This palette is GREAT. I love it way more than the original nudes palette, as I&#x27;m more into pinks than browns. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Maybelline takes its best shot at mirroring the Urban Decay line of make-up products and the result is.... solid. While expectations were definitely kept at a minimum due to the overall brand image of Maybelline among most higher end make-up users, the product is actually a nice step in the right direction for the brand. The color palette is made up of 12 different shades that are different enough to make the set very useful while also really giving the user a great option of colors. I agree with other reviewers that have commented that the colors are a bit more glittery than they need to be, which is the biggest drawback I could find as well with this set. If you&#x27;re looking for a solid mid-tier makeup set that won&#x27;t break the bank, this set is worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> All of the top row are sea shell shades, shimmery, but low on pigment.  Adding more shadow will add pigment, and these shades, as well as the first three on the bottom row, blend wonderfully.  They don&#x27;t flake, the shimmer doesn&#x27;t travel, and they hold up a good eight hours without creasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because these are soft, semi-transparent shades, they are flattering for any complexion.  Everyone can use them.  Even if you have some wrinkling on your eyelids, you can achieve a nice dewy look if you don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last three on the bottom row are troubling.  The gray is a beautiful shade that is very difficult to blend.  I don&#x27;t like it.  The deep rose shade can make the eyes look tired, and is best used for the crease only.  The deep gray shade on the bottom right is horrific.  It doesn&#x27;t blend, and contains bright pink sparkles.  It looks like a postcard from the mouth of Mt. Kilauea.  You don&#x27;t want that on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, overall this is a very good palette for those embracing the natural look this year.</li>
            <li> I have to assume that this palette is competing with the Urban Decay Naked palette in terms of coloring; I have the Naked palette and that&#x27;s why I was interested in how this, with fewer colors but a MUCH more reasonable price point, would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Solidly good. A good value for what you get. If you&#x27;re &amp;#34;into&amp;#34; makeup, this won&#x27;t cut it, but then you should just buy the more expensive makeup because you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that these shades are very &amp;#34;shimmer-y.&amp;#34; There was a little too much shimmer. Some of the pinks didn&#x27;t show well on my skin (medium brown); it&#x27;s probably better for lighter skin tones. But overall, it&#x27;s a good value!</li>
            <li> When I saw this product was available for review, I leapt at the chance. My 14 year-old had purchased this palette and uses it daily. Now I understand why. This palette contains 12 different shades that are coordinated. The top 4 starting from the left are very light. Because my skin has olive undertones I can only use them for highlights beneath my eyebrows or in the inside corner of my eyes. The bottom right color is ideal for lining my eyes. Everything in between is coordinated for different looks. On the back of the palette is a guide that shows you how to combine the shades in units of 2, 3, or 4. I tend to use three at a time plus the one as an eyeliner. With the variety of shades it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing the same look every day. Since this palette arrived it has become my go-to -- all my other eye shadows are lying unused in my makeup drawer. And when I travel, this is the collection I will take with me. The colors last pretty well all day, though occasionally I will touch up if I have something in the evening. Bottomline? I LOVE this -- and so does my 14 year old. Also these colors make my blue eyes pop!</li>
            <li> I love the colors, they are soft and attractive and I feel good wearing the blushed nudes.</li>
            <li> Great colors and long lasting color. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  Lovely colors. I had only ordered one pallete but received two.&lt;br /&gt;The pallete is about the size of a palm.</li>
            <li> Revive my today and I&#x27;m in love with this palette is yes beautiful and suthe colors for any age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with this pallet! All and I mean all the colors are beautiful! I&#x27;d say their medium to high pigmentation depending on shade and some of the liter shades are more sheer, but provide a soft wash of shimmering color. Only one shade is Matte. Colors are pinks, maybes, rose gold/coppery to deeper plums and a light and medium gray. The price can&#x27;t be beat. I typically use high end cosmetics, UD, BAREMINERALS, TOO FACED. This pallet competes VERY WELL. I think I&#x27;ll order a backup.</li>
            <li> There are twelve great colors in this collection - something for everyone.  If you follow the diagrams on the back of the package, it even provides instructions on several ways you can wear each color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors go on smoothly and evenly, and feel like quality eye makeup.  My wife&#x27;s only small complaint is that she thinks the applicators are too skinny.  They really are tiny and sheI would have appreciated a larger set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that&#x27;s not a deal breaker. She loves this makeup set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars</li>
            <li> Not bad...the colors weren&#x27;t great options..I know blush colors are all the rage right now, but I have to say I liked the Loreal Nudes palette much more than this. Both for better quality and better color choices.</li>
            <li> I like these colors. Nice to have many good ones to design my eye accent with.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that so many of the colors were shimmer. I prefer matte, but its my fault for not checking. I do like the colors</li>
            <li> Wonderful colors. Lots or compliments!</li>
            <li> A pretty selection of shades dominated by purples and browns with some blue, green, mauve, black and white also.  All have a shimmer to them and the variety can create simple accents to very heavy and dramatic shading.  The case is sturdy with a nice applicator.</li>
            <li> As expected. Colors are good for my complexion.</li>
            <li> Nice colors but a bit crumbly making some waste.</li>
            <li> Recommend theses shades for someone who is fair skinned. I am fair skinned with a pink and yellow undertone and they all work really well with my skin tone. The eye shadow does take a little more to apply, but will last all day even in heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> As far as price goes, $9.98 is a good price for a set of 12 shades, which combine 4 3-shade Maybelline pallets, 3 4-shade and 6 doubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality, however, I am not sure it&#x27;s good. I understand that these a nude colors, but are they supposed to be almost entirely transparent? No matter how many layers of these eye shadows you apply, it is very hard to achieve any deep colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be misunderstanding the concept of this particular pallet, and this may be just what you want exactly. But these are very, very sheer.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. It rivals the more expensive palets I&#x27;ve been buying.</li>
            <li> Nice colors for summer&lt;br /&gt;only $10 at Walmart</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but it&#x27;s not pigmented at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great Product....LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I&#x27;m quite impressed. My eyes are hazel with lots of green and yellow. The browns in this palette bring out the color in my eyes much more than the Urban Debay 3 palette - those tend to be more rose golds and they bring out more redness in my eyes, which is unflattering. I tried the 4 colors on the left with a primer and it is stunning. Can&#x27;t wait to try the next 4 to the right and so on...</li>
            <li> Really nicely pigmented for the price.</li>
            <li> One of the best eye shadow palettes I&#x27;ve ever used. The colors look exactly like they do on the pictures. I love how flexible this is... I use it when I go to work and it&#x27;s great for a night out too.</li>
            <li> best to use a eye primer.  I use Urban Decay original formula eye primer.  When used with this, the colors will last all day.  A lot of the colors are shimmery, only one or two could be called matte or satin.  I didn&#x27;t realize that when I bought it, or I probably wouldn&#x27;t have.  I use it but probably won&#x27;t repurchase.  I do like that maybelline is trying to market a palette.  I get frustrated with the quads.  You usually have a least one color you don&#x27;t use thus making your purchase more costly.  With a palette you do have more options.</li>
            <li> The colors In this set of eye shadows is in the fighter shades I love, and the price was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and I love it. Great set of colors that go with everything in my wardrobe.  Ideal to take on a trip. Nice quality for the price too. Love it!</li>
            <li> This set has sultry range of mostly earth tones,that certainly rival more expensive lines.the range goes from warm to cool-tones and really do work to enhance the structure of your face giving shimmering rose to sultry deep tones that enhance the bone structure.This is a nice set at twice the price.A nice quality set.</li>
            <li> Fantastic color palate, perfect for summer. I love all the shades, the only thing I would change is the applicators are kind of thin, I like them to be a little wider. But great eye shadow from Maybelline.</li>
            <li> Package has scratches</li>
            <li> Nice if you are wanting to save some money from the other name brand palettes. I like it a lot and the shadows lasted all day when used with a primer.</li>
            <li> The original The Nudes palette has much better pigmentation, in my opinion, which is a shame because I like the actual colors in this palette better. They just don&#x27;t show up well for me, and need to be used with a primer and layered to achieve the look I&#x27;m going for. I know these Nudes / Blushed Nudes palettes are being called dupes for the Naked palettes, but they simply do not stand up to the hype. I had better results with W7&#x27;s dupes (In the Nude, In the Buff, In the Buff Lightly Toasted, etc.) which are also available on Amazon and (at the time I purchased them) cheaper than Maybelline&#x27;s version. I would recommend them, or going to a higher price point and picking up Coastal Scent&#x27;s Revealed palettes.</li>
            <li> Great color pallet. Genuine Maybelline product. Love the color selection, easy to take several different colors with you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Urban Decay and other expensive brands and been happy with them. I purchased this because I wanted a smaller eye shadow case for my overnight back. I&#x27;m thrilled to say I like it better than the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I love the colors! It has pigmentation on par with the more expensive brands. It lasts all day. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love love love this!  The colors are visible and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty, but the formula is chalky. After really packing on the color, the blending brush removes most of it so it ends up looking sheer. Good for beginners as it isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow is my absolute favorite beauty product and I apply it often. I am by no means a makeup expert, but I have tested a lot of different brands. Urban Decay is my absolute favorite and for a good reason. I own all three UD Naked Palettes and use them often. While it may not be fair to compare a $12 palette to a $50 palette, I am going to do so since that is what Maybelline seems to be trying to mimic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the colors included in this palette are gorgeous. They have a bit more variety on the color spectrum than the Naked Palettes do. The colors are vibrant in the palette. However, once applied they go on very, very light. On some of the colors I had to apply several layers. I typically use 3-5 colors at a time (lighter on the inside, shimmery in the middle, slightly darker on the outside and dark in the crease and on the very end). I then blend all the colors to create a gorgeous sultry look. Well, this didn&#x27;t quite work as well with this palette. The colors all seemed to run together and my eyes came out looking monotone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention the cheap applicators included in this set. I wish Maybelline had included an eyeshadow brush instead. I ditched the applicators and used my brush and I recommend you do the same for better results. As far as longevity, this eyeshadow lasted as long as any others. I used Urban Decay Primer underneath it. (Tip: apply foundation to your eyelid if you don&#x27;t have primer before applying the eyeshadow). The eyeshadow also wiped away easily with a makeup remover cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a decent palette if you can not afford the Urban Decay Naked Palettes. You could definitely make this work for you. However, trust me when I say that you would be better off saving up for a Naked Palette and splurging. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I like earth tones even thought they do not go with my coloring.  I have dark blonde hair (with gray) and pale skin.  I should be wearing pinks, but I just can’t.  I like the grays, violets and browns.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are nice and go on evenly-ish.  I did have to use my finger because the applicators were small.  The applicators, there are only two, look like they will not last the entire life of the shadows.  It is a pet peeve of mine.  Definitely worth the $12 price.</li>
            <li> I have a urban decay naked 2 palette knock off that cost me 10 dollars and it works better than this one. The eyeshadows are horrible compared to my knock off. Although I have an authentic urban decay eye shadow primer which gets me the exact results of the real urban decay palette but I used it as well with the Maybelline and it still didn&#x27;t look good. I tried to get a deal again because I got lucky the first time but not this time. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Really pretty, mostly sparkly shadows, varying from very pale to dark. So you can create looks for natural day-time, all the way to glamorous night-time. The colors blend nicely and wear well. You should probably get your own applicators or brushes though to prevent mixing and muddying the colors in the palette.</li>
            <li> dont have anything bad to say except I bought it at meijers for 10.50 and should of bought it at amazon for less money. the colors are pretty and light but still have a dramatic effect. I loves nude palettes. I have a physicians formula one that I hate. the eye shadow is flaky and they arent even separated from eachother. this maybeline one goes on very smooth and you dont have to dig into it to get color on the eyeshadow brush. I think im going to get the regular nudes pallet too, this teview is for the blushed nudes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the urban decay naked pallets, but my budget won&#x27;t allow me to have them all. Maybelline&#x27;s pallet is a great option if you love UD&#x27;s pallets. It offers a mix of both matte and sparkly colors, and it&#x27;s easy to create a bunch of different looks. The colors are well pigmented and stay strong throughout the day (I do use concealer as a base for my eye makeup). Now I need to try Maybelline&#x27;s The Nudes pallet!</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors perfect on a blonde really great for summer!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I was very pleased with colors of the pallets. Came nicely packaged with no damage to any of the shadows, which I was very happy with considering it was shipped to me all the way in Alaska. If you like more &amp;#34;natural tones&amp;#34; this a good pallet for you.</li>
            <li> I love eyeshadow, and I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years. I&#x27;ve bought expensive eyeshadow, and I&#x27;ve used cheap brands. As far as Maybelline goes, it is on the cheaper side in the makeup world. As expected, the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t stay on quite as long as a more expensive brand, such as Clinique or Estee Lauder. Again, this is expected, and the product is perfectly serviceable. I never use the application brushes because I have a fairly expensive set of brushes that I bought several years ago. The application brushes included with this product might as well be thrown away, which is exactly what I have always done. Anyone who buys a lot of eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t expect much from these brushes, so no surprise there. The cheaper eyeshadows always have the same problem for me: the texture is different, and the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t go onto my applicator as easy as a more expensive brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do love the colors, which are some great neutral shades. The main reason I gave this product 4 stars is because it met the expectations that I had. It all comes down to how much you want to spend on makeup, and you get what you pay for. You can certainly buy a similar product from Urban Decay, Stila, or any other high end brand, and you can pay twice as much. Those products are better in many ways, but, for the price, Maybelline does the job. I will continue doing what I have always done, which is to mix and match my eye shadow brands.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the selection is good, however, they could provide a larger selection of colors 2 or more in light and medium shades would make this a staple go-to for those that prefer to wear  nude eye shadows.  I wear light eye-shadow and find that if I apply these using the tips I know to make the colors stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**4/5 STARS:  Receiving this product through Amazon&#x27;s Vine Program did not influence my rating or review of this product.; all opinions are my own.**.</li>
            <li> Superior product. Love the ways the colors mesh.n</li>
            <li> Good value in terms of shades.  I&#x27;m lucky I have quality brushes to apply it with.  Was having trouble with using a normal shadow brush but it worked well when used with primer.</li>
            <li> I wish with all my heart that Maybelline would stop putting sparkles into their eye makeup. :( I may as well have bought a pot of glitter as use this eye shadow. The pale colors have so much glitter in them that there is little room for real pigment. I would have to get it wet to be able to blend it, and that probably won&#x27;t work well. The dark pigments are very dark and do not blend very well either. I end up with a muddied mess on my eyelid. Eye shadow should glide onto the eyelid, not have to be shoved around on this delicate area. Once I place it on my eyelid, it isn&#x27;t moving from that one spot, so I can&#x27;t blend it.</li>
            <li> Not pigmented enough.  I should have gone with a better brand.  Complete waste</li>
            <li> Beautiful quality good color</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette for my 14 year old daughter this summer at a local store. I actually loved it so much, that I purchased one for myself a few weeks later. I am in my late 40&#x27;s and I want my eyes to look pretty natural. Same with my daughter. The colors in this palette fit the bill. They aren&#x27;t super pigmented, but at the same time, you don&#x27;t have to apply a whole lot to see it. They do shimmer a bit, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I wear these colors for daytime use and I am very happy with how it looks. I have noticed that it&#x27;s still there at the end of the day when I get home from work. That rarely happens to me with eye shadow. It comes with some sponge applicators, but I prefer using brushes to apply it. I am extremely happy with this!</li>
            <li> Love the soft natural colors! USe this product with the LIME CRIME primer (BEST PRIMER EVER)! The shadow will last ALL DAY and EVENING!</li>
            <li> A nice variety of shades allowing me to toss out all my others over this one now.</li>
