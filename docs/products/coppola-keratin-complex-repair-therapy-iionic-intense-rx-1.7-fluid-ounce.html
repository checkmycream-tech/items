            <li>If you have curly, frizzy hair, you will love this product.  </li>

            <li>Real Coppola Keratin and works great on my hair</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>However, my hairdresser noticed how healthy my hair was.</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have to unscrew the lid and pour it into my hand which causes me to use more product than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does wonders for my hair--I get many compliments.</li>
            <li>I prefer the infusion much better..</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product from my hair salon and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>The product is so easy to use and the results are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I love how light weight and non-greasy</li>
            <li>After one use, my hair is soft, my ends look great</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny and I was happy by the packaging of it as well.</li>
            <li>other brand has great products like this and the Repair Therapy is a God sent!</li>
            <li>If you use more than a tiny amount you will not be happy.  </li>
            <li>Beware of the smell; as the RX and day straightening spray do not have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and was excited to try this product, as my hair is the perfect type for thed Keratin treatments.</li>
            <li>since it is so fine, it would always break.</li>
            <li>I love it, but it runs out quick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so miffed that I bought two bottles because I trusted that it would be genuine because I was buying it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>THE REAL PRODUCT IS AMAZING ...</li>
            <li>so I was so excited to find it at such a great price here.</li>
            <li>The original greatly increases the elasticity and shine when blow drying which reduces the amount of flat ironing</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results and will purpose more in the future.</li>
            <li>:),  It made my hair so much softer and shinyer!</li>
            <li>This price is amazing and this product makes your hair soooo soft, sleek and smooth for longer in between washes.</li>
            <li>and I knew they weren&#x27;t the true keratin products.</li>
            <li>I love it, it is a infusion of new keratin.</li>
            <li>Perhaps lowering the price would make this product receive higher sales due to more accurate usage, resulting in better results.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, accurate description of product.</li>
            <li>Love the product; keeps my hair shiny and soft but this is NOT a 6-pack.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks just like it did when I had a fresh keratin treatment at the salon</li>
            <li>non greasy, lightweight, and leaves my hair soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>great product for fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this and after the first use you could see the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Just be aware of what you are buying.</li>
            <li>Well, first - I received the bottle and it was leaking.  </li>
            <li>The pump didn&#x27;t work, and I had to unscrew the entire top (breaking it off) to get at the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s changed since i last used it, now its thicker and smells better.</li>
            <li>I have found my hair to be incredibly soft and smooth with this product.</li>
            <li>Style as usual and flat iron for best results.</li>
            <li>I am 47 and love the sleek , smooth look of straight healthy hair , however being a natural brunette that dyes blonde my hair was damaged and dry.</li>
            <li>I mix this product with the Infusion Kerating Replenisher, the two together really make my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for a few years now and Amazon never lets me down with great deals!!!</li>
            <li>This Coppola Keratin Intense Serum works wonders on my hair.  </li>
            <li>They were very fragrant</li>
            <li>This is the ultimate product for the smooth look without the investment.  </li>
            <li>Then, the directions aren&#x27;t clear....use as much as your hair needs????</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I think this takes time before you really start seeing results.</li>
            <li>The reviews where people do not understand how much to put on, really people put on enough to lightly coat your hair.</li>
            <li>This really helps extend the time between treatments.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>This is not the real product.</li>
            <li>I have very curly and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>I really think this product keeps your Keratin treatment in your hair longer.</li>
            <li>and I believe you will really like this product.</li>
            <li>That is just too much.</li>
            <li>I received the products and was very surprised at first from the smell.</li>
            <li>This particular tube was very watery and not at all like</li>
            <li>Now, I must say, my complaint is not about amazon because I am usually very satisfied, but they must check the vendor and see what&#x27;s going on there.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t use conditioner in the shower and applied this product directly to shampooed hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is you must flatiron your hair or you do not get the full effect.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the same product I had been using, but it was for a  lesser price than I have been getting..</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not the main reason why you don&#x27;t want to buy it from here.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest it!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Works really well to de frizz curly hair, i put it on clean wet hair and sit under the drier 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Only need a little bit and it de-frizzes in all weather conditions, also great with the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This product has brought new life and it now bounces , shines and is very soft to touch .</li>
            <li>Use the small amount and you will LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Product arrived spilled completely out on the box!  </li>
            <li>I have had Coppolla Brazilian in the past and I use the shampoo and conditioner religiously, so I figured this product would compliment the rest quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>The original has a slight fragrance but nothing like this.</li>
            <li>I must clear up something.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked for me and has helped my hair.</li>
            <li>This adds protein and makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>When I use the Coppola Keratin Complex repair therapy, my curls are more defined and softer.  </li>
            <li>Once you have it done professionally, then put this product on after every shampoo.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S VERY FUSTRATING GHETTING PRODUCT WHEN YOU GET LOW.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine, naturally dark blonde to mousy brown.</li>
            <li>Since using these products, my hair is much stronger and I don&#x27;t have to flat iron.</li>
            <li>I really like the product, but unfortunately my bottle was broken, and the nice pump top feature does not work.</li>
            <li>My hair was so dry, it was breaking off left and right</li>
            <li>I have since repurchased it from my local store just to see if it was a new formula</li>
            <li>I did not want to spend the money on the Brazilian Blowout every 3 months and this product used once or twice a week keeps my hair smooth and shiny when blow dried and flat ironed.  </li>
            <li>especially if you have had a professional keratin treatment and want to maintain the benefits</li>
            <li>If you have wavy, thick corse hair this is a fantastic product to use.</li>
            <li>and I barely had to use my flat iron.</li>

            <li> I did not want to spend the money on the Brazilian Blowout every 3 months and this product used once or twice a week keeps my hair smooth and shiny when blow dried and flat ironed.  </li>
            <li> especially if you have had a professional keratin treatment and want to maintain the benefits</li>
            <li> If you have wavy, thick corse hair this is a fantastic product to use.</li>
            <li> and I barely had to use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> used to flat iron my hair a lot and</li>
            <li> It is thin, One reviewer was correct when suggesting to flat iron your hair for full effect.</li>
            <li> Simply apply to towel-dried hair, comb through, and dry.  </li>
            <li> I would normally have to do to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time so do not be put off by the expense.</li>
            <li> so the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and no, the one I spent the big bucks on worked wonders.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time too.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it if you spent a lot of money on treatment and use this product it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I find my hair is soft for a day, but then feels stiff..</li>
            <li> It is expensive but I will continue to pay the higher price locally and just use it sparingly to make it last.</li>
            <li> This product works fantastically on my dry, colored and highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair that is wavy naturally.</li>
            <li> THE TOP WILL UNSCREW AND ALL OF YOUR EXPENSIVE PRODUCT WILL BE WASTED!</li>
            <li> also it appears to be missing fluid from bottle !</li>
            <li> That is the product that is pink and a thicker cream.</li>
            <li> After towel drying my hair, I simply massage in a few pumps of this product.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions carefully</li>
            <li> and it was absolutely NOT the smell of the product I know.</li>
            <li> this was not an option due to some sort inventory snufu .olny</li>
            <li> When people say it only takes a small amount...believe them.  </li>
            <li> All the other products I&#x27;ve purchased in this line seem to work well.</li>

            <li> also use Keratin Complex Infusion Keratin Replenisher regularly also.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth your money.  </li>
            <li> You should only apply it to the hair that is at least 2 inches below the shaft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will help cut down on the frizz.</li>
            <li> Tames the hair without weighing it down and making it look &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It has a slight smell, like coconut water.</li>
            <li> previous tube I had purchased.  </li>

            <li> MISTAKE - still dried out my hair, still noticed breakage.</li>
            <li> this product is thin and has a smell of coconut, it sounds like the same product I purchased for around $50-60.</li>
            <li> I like it, problem is with shoulder  length hair the applications are few and it gets pricy.</li>
            <li> It is thinner, smells like coconut and doesn&#x27;t remotely work like the Coppola Keratin Complex Repair Therapy I have been using from the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair - so I used a handful.  </li>
            <li> This product is so expensive at my local beauty supply store and also from the manufacturer&#x27;s website</li>
            <li> No more frizz</li>
            <li> I have tried this product before in the past.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s fake or totally different.</li>
            <li> I use at least 6 pumps on my hair.</li>
            <li> Got it late.</li>
            <li> I also use the Keratin Complex shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> no product would dispense from bottle the pick up hose was broken off and missing from inside the bottle .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The pump was broken when I got this item.  Love the product itself but where is the quality control?</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple times now and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling smoother even at the time nor does it seem to have any revitalizing effect on my Keratin treatment.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This Coppola Keratin Intense Serum works wonders on my hair.  Only need a little bit and it de-frizzes in all weather conditions, also great with the flat iron.  I would recommend this to anyone with frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING ! I am. Dry skeptical when it comes to personal beauty products and their claims . I purchased this and after the first use you could see the difference in my hair. I am 47 and love the sleek , smooth look of straight healthy hair , however being a natural brunette that dyes blonde my hair was damaged and dry. This product has brought new life and it now bounces , shines and is very soft to touch . You will be as amazed as I was !  B</li>
            <li> I have been using the Coppola line for years and I absolutely love the products. I received the products and was very surprised at first from the smell. They were very fragrant and I knew they weren&#x27;t the true keratin products. Beware of the smell; as the RX and day straightening spray do not have a strong scent. I have used Amazon several times and have never been disappointed before. This was just a one time deal, hopefully. Just be aware of what you are buying.</li>
            <li> If you have curly, frizzy hair, you will love this product.  I have battled this all my life.  I did not want to spend the money on the Brazilian Blowout every 3 months and this product used once or twice a week keeps my hair smooth and shiny when blow dried and flat ironed.  In lower humidities, blow drying is all I need to do.  I love how light weight and non-greasy this product is and would recommend it to anyone with frizz issues.  It lasts a long time so do not be put off by the expense.</li>
            <li> My hair is course, dyed and weak. After one use, my hair is soft, my ends look great and I barely had to use my flat iron. Great Product. Also, people have been writing that this was recalled by AUSTRALIA gov. recently. I checked into that and it was recalled if you purchased it between JULY 2010 AND FEBRUARY 2011. [...] is the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will call company to make sure that I do not have one of the bottles recalled but I doubt I do since I just purchased it last week</li>
            <li> Love the product; keeps my hair shiny and soft but this is NOT a 6-pack.  Amazon needs to remove the false advertising.</li>
            <li> we were happy to find this product on amazon it arrived on time .we went to use it no product would dispense from bottle the pick up hose was broken off and missing from inside the bottle . also it appears to be missing fluid from bottle ! i tried to get a replacement bottle unfortunetly this was not an option due to some sort inventory snufu .olny a refund was offered ,the orignal package has been disposed of on the eve of trash day our tough luck i guess !  bigredtruck99@live.com</li>
            <li> Great for split ends, the best.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it was shipped on time.  It makes my hair soft and shiny and I was happy by the packaging of it as well.</li>
            <li> Real Coppola Keratin and works great on my hair</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!  I have had Keratin treatments in the past but they are expensive and with summer coming it is hard to invest in a treatment because the pool strips those expensive products out.  This is the ultimate product for the smooth look without the investment.  It gives you the ultimate flexibility.  When people say it only takes a small amount...believe them.  If you use more than a tiny amount you will not be happy.  Use the small amount and you will LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product to use between keratin treatments or to extend the life of your treatment. The product is so easy to use and the results are outstanding.  Simply apply to towel-dried hair, comb through, and dry.  Style as usual and flat iron for best results. My hair looks just like it did when I had a fresh keratin treatment at the salon---amazing!.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I see an improvement after using the product.  May just be my hair.  All the other products I&#x27;ve purchased in this line seem to work well.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and was excited to try this product, as my hair is the perfect type for thed Keratin treatments. I have had Coppolla Brazilian in the past and I use the shampoo and conditioner religiously, so I figured this product would compliment the rest quite nicely.  Well, first - I received the bottle and it was leaking.  The pump didn&#x27;t work, and I had to unscrew the entire top (breaking it off) to get at the product.  Then, the directions aren&#x27;t clear....use as much as your hair needs???? I have very thick, long hair - so I used a handful.  The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t use conditioner in the shower and applied this product directly to shampooed hair.  MISTAKE. My hair was so dry, it was breaking off left and right as I tried styling it.  So, the second time, I conditioned my hair with the Coppolla conditioner, then applied this product.  MISTAKE - still dried out my hair, still noticed breakage. This product is supposed to restructure my hair, not damage it to the point of it breaking.  I am not happy with this product at all.    The one thing that I have to say that is favorable is that I contacted Amazon the same day as I received it, in the damaged state, and they immediately credited my account and told me I did not have to send it back because it was leaking. So, as always, Amazon provides the best customer service!</li>
            <li> I mix this product with the Infusion Kerating Replenisher, the two together really make my hair soft and smooth.  I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Read all reviews and decided to give it a try. So far it has worked for me and has helped my hair. Anytime I use it, my hair feels nice. Some people mention there is a smell to it... I do not find that with this product. I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and have bought it locally at a price of $40.00.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the same product I had been using, but it was for a  lesser price than I have been getting.. It always to save.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I think this takes time before you really start seeing results. However, my hairdresser noticed how healthy my hair was. I&#x27;m hoping it will help cut down on the frizz.</li>
            <li> Will definitely repurchase this! I Love this stuff. It helped repair damage to my hair. Fast delivery, accurate description of product.</li>
            <li> Having the Keratin Coppola treatment in my hair I thought why not try it. I love it, it is a infusion of new keratin. The only thing is you must flatiron your hair or you do not get the full effect. The reviews where people do not understand how much to put on, really people put on enough to lightly coat your hair. That easy!</li>
            <li> I use it but you do have to watch for buildup when it seems not to work.  A few clarifying shampoos gets your hair ready to retreat it if that happens.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product for damaged and unruly hair. If you have wavy, thick corse hair this is a fantastic product to use. Tames the hair without weighing it down and making it look &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34;. I highly recommend this product and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but unfortunately my bottle was broken, and the nice pump top feature does not work. I have to unscrew the lid and pour it into my hand which causes me to use more product than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nut shell I like the product, would probably rate 5 stars if the pump worked</li>
            <li> great stuff especially if you have had a professional keratin treatment and want to maintain the benefits</li>
            <li> Coppola makes the best keratin products as far as I am concerned. I have coarse curly/frizzy hair with salon keratin treatments. This really helps extend the time between treatments.</li>
            <li> This adds protein and makes my hair soft.  I love it, but it runs out quick.  I use at least 6 pumps on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Have been using it for a few years now and Amazon never lets me down with great deals!!!</li>
            <li> another great Coppola product that I have been using since my first keratin treatment. A friend told me to get it and not to skimp. I use it maybe a couple of times a week so the product lasts a long time. Does wonders for my hair--I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> This product is so expensive at my local beauty supply store and also from the manufacturer&#x27;s website so I was so excited to find it at such a great price here. What a disappointment when I tried it. It was thinner and smelled and looked like coconut water. The original has a slight fragrance but nothing like this. This one wasn&#x27;t unpleasant, just different. The original greatly increases the elasticity and shine when blow drying which reduces the amount of flat ironing I would normally have to do to tame my hair. This product did absolutely nothing. I have since repurchased it from my local store just to see if it was a new formula and no, the one I spent the big bucks on worked wonders. The one I bought from Amazon was worthless. It is expensive but I will continue to pay the higher price locally and just use it sparingly to make it last.</li>
            <li> Got it late. Haven&#x27;t used it yet. Looks great. Cannot wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this product from Amazon yet. However, I did purchase it from CVS and it was around $50-$60. It has a slight smell, like coconut water. It is thin, One reviewer was correct when suggesting to flat iron your hair for full effect. This one needs some heat to infuse it. My hair is baby fine, naturally dark blonde to mousy brown. I regularly have it highlighted. I do get regular Keratin treatments now since Aug 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Keratin Complex Infusion Keratin Replenisher regularly also. That is the product that is pink and a thicker cream. I also use the Keratin Complex shampoos and conditioners.  My hair is actually growing and is several inches longer.&lt;br /&gt;I used to flat iron my hair a lot and since it is so fine, it would always break. Since using these products, my hair is much stronger and I don&#x27;t have to flat iron. No more frizz either.&lt;br /&gt;If this product is thin and has a smell of coconut, it sounds like the same product I purchased for around $50-60. When I run out, I will order from Amazon and give an update.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I like it, problem is with shoulder  length hair the applications are few and it gets pricy. Perhaps lowering the price would make this product receive higher sales due to more accurate usage, resulting in better results.</li>
            <li> Product arrived spilled completely out on the box!  Not good!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look awesome and seems to repair split ends.  I use it  after my brazillian straightening.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, and used it several times.. I find my hair is soft for a day, but then feels stiff.. I prefer the infusion much better..Linda</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while and still have some left. This is not the real product. It is thinner, smells like coconut and doesn&#x27;t remotely work like the Coppola Keratin Complex Repair Therapy I have been using from the beauty supply. I&#x27;m so miffed that I bought two bottles because I trusted that it would be genuine because I was buying it from Amazon. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY IT FROM A REPUTABLE SELLER! THE REAL PRODUCT IS AMAZING ...THIS IS JUNK...</li>
            <li> This product is not worth your money.  Look elsewhere.  Poor service by the vendor and poor product.</li>
            <li> very good stuff :),  It made my hair so much softer and shinyer! I highly suggest it!&lt;br /&gt;But I won’t lie.  This product is quite expensive so I don’t buy it often.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I color my hair and this is the oly thing that make it feel silky.I definitely recommend this product.  You don&#x27;t have to use but a dime size.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my hair feel healthier.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and unruly hair.  When I use the Coppola Keratin Complex repair therapy, my curls are more defined and softer.  I use it everytime I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everybody who has the Coppola Keratin treatment. and if you have another brand of Keratin, switch.&lt;br /&gt;No other brand has great products like this and the Repair Therapy is a God sent! I spend 3x the $$$ at a salon for this same product(what a rip off!). This price is amazing and this product makes your hair soooo soft, sleek and smooth for longer in between washes. It lasts for a long time too. It&#x27;s like boosting your treatment because of the amount of Keratin it has in it. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product on Amazon. I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s changed since i last used it, now its thicker and smells better. Works really well to de frizz curly hair, i put it on clean wet hair and sit under the drier 10 mins. Works wonders.</li>
            <li> Had an express keratin treatment and using this to help extend the length of time the treatment will last.  This is a great product if you have had the treatment.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing !! i have used it after my gastric bypass and i have not even needed a trim. it changes your hair for the best it can even be.color lasts longer too.</li>
            <li> I really think this product keeps your Keratin treatment in your hair longer. Would recommend it if you spent a lot of money on treatment and use this product it will last longer.</li>
            <li> This product changed the texture of my hair making ituch softer and smoother.  In addition, I don&#x27;t have the breakage I was experiencing.</li>
            <li> not the same as bought at Gene Juarez the consistency is different</li>
            <li> I have tried this product before in the past. I am very pleased with the results and will purpose more in the future.</li>
            <li> This product works fantastically on my dry, colored and highlighted hair. After towel drying my hair, I simply massage in a few pumps of this product. It nourishes and moisturizes my hair giving it beautiful manageability when styling. This purchase has now become my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; hair product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is part of my treatment regimen. I have keratin treated hair. My hair is responding to the treatments. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I had severely damaged hair from coloring and perming, and my hair was breaking off daily. As soon as I began using this product, the breakage stopped. I would recommend finding a salon that uses this line of products. Once you have it done professionally, then put this product on after every shampoo. Oh - their shampoo and conditioner is great, too!</li>
            <li> This particular tube was very watery and not at all like&lt;br /&gt;the previous tube I had purchased.  I questioned its&lt;br /&gt;age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GIVING THIS PRODUCT ONLY 3 STARS FOR THE PACKAGING. THE TOP WILL UNSCREW AND ALL OF YOUR EXPENSIVE PRODUCT WILL BE WASTED! IT IS IN A PUMP TYPE BOTTLE BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A PUMP PLASTIC TUBE THAT GOES TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE. IT&#x27;S VERY FUSTRATING GHETTING PRODUCT WHEN YOU GET LOW. A REVAMP OF THE PACKAGING AND THIS PRODUCT WOULD RECEIVE 5 STARS.</li>
            <li> non greasy, lightweight, and leaves my hair soft and healthy.  great product for fine thin hair.  Helps hydrate in winter and keep out the humidity in summer.  Its perfect!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and have to say that you only need to use a small amount. You should only apply it to the hair that is at least 2 inches below the shaft. If you put it to close to your roots, you will get greasy hair. I have found my hair to be incredibly soft and smooth with this product. Follow the instructions carefully and I believe you will really like this product. Do not use generously. I also use it only one time a week, not every day.  That is just too much. I have thick coarse hair that is wavy naturally. Not every hair type needs this, and you should consult with your hair dresser for advice before spending this sort of money on any product.</li>
            <li> I must clear up something. I first bought this product from my hair salon and absolutely loved it. it worked great on my hair and smelled good.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, When I ordered the same item from amazon (the vendor is different though), it arrived damaged. the cap was opened and the content was spilled all over the place. but that&#x27;s not the main reason why you don&#x27;t want to buy it from here. I smelled what was left in the bottle and it was absolutely NOT the smell of the product I know. it smelled pretty awful and I think it&#x27;s fake or totally different. the consistensy was also different, like they added water to it. weird and pretty horrible! how dare they sell it? Now, I must say, my complaint is not about amazon because I am usually very satisfied, but they must check the vendor and see what&#x27;s going on there. if this vendor is seeling fake products this is something to beware of and get to the bottom of it!</li>
