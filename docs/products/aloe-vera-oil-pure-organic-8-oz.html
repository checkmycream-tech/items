    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome and great price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps some of these qualities can be attributed to the fact that it absorbs into the skin almost four times faster than water – making it an excellent moisturizer and emollient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>

            <li>For instance in order to stay beautiful</li>
            <li>Its antimicrobial properties kill bacteria and its anti-inflammatory abilities make it a great solution for those with oily skin who may also suffer with acne, without leaving a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>The oil is great.  </li>

            <li>they are all great oils</li>
            <li>I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great seller as always.</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Often grown as an ornamental decoration, its advantageous uses in skin care, cosmetics, and medicine are as impressive as the plant itself is lovely and hearty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great I can use in my hair before wash, and my skin too, no have any smell, for me work good</li>
            <li>This product feels good on the skin and in the hair...</li>
            <li>I know that aloe is good for sunburned skin, so knowing this</li>
            <li>Thank you Dr. Adorable!,</li>

            <li>and I must say that I love it!</li>
            <li>I use it as a body oil, hair oil, makeup remover and more!</li>
            <li>The fact that it is Aloe Vera oil means it is soothing to the skin, which is a nice plus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and is a great moisturizer for my body.</li>
            <li>Easier to store and possessing a longer shelf life, its great for quick mixing with water to produce an Aloe Vera “juice” or gel.</li>
            <li>It came early and perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera is moisturizing, antimicrobial, and antifungal and is suitable for all skin types.</li>

            <li>I knew of the many amazing benefits of aloe vera oil but, unconcerned with that, I bought a bottle thinking</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blend with a cucumber to make a refreshing facialetc.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with not only the quality of the oils, but also their customer service.</li>
            <li>(What more can you say?  </li>
            <li>This works better than any $80 product I&#x27;ve tried, has zero chemicals in it, and it leaves your face feeling fresher and</li>
            <li>Okay so guess what?</li>
            <li>but I had to buy more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it for my skin</li>
            <li>I really love the way it feels</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, it&#x27;s not runny, it has perfect consistent texture, just don&#x27;t use too much and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Very light and smooth oil.</li>
            <li>Amazingly smooth oil..</li>
            <li>so, so useful for so many hair and skin problems or just for beautifying yourself.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with aloe vera lotion and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>It is light and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li>once I&#x27;ve had a chance to use it more consistently, but I can already tell this a quality product.</li>
            <li>So I can use these carrier oils with a bit of essential oils, and make pleasant smelling things: lotions, cremes, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read time and time again how Aloe Vera is so good for the skin in healing, maintaining moisture, and even managing conditions such as eczema and lichen planus.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderfully slippery oil and really thin, which is great when I need something to add to butters with a lot of hardness such as Kokum, Mango, or Shea butter.</li>
            <li>and they promptly responded answering my question in full.</li>
            <li>you are wondering why I use both fragrance oils and essential oils, there is a good reason.  </li>
            <li>a fresh clean smell to your massage oil or aromatherapy&lt;</li>
            <li>a fresh clean smell to your massage oil or aromatherapy&lt;</li>
            <li>When making your own, you can be confident that what you are creating for yourself, your family and even your customers, is a pure all natural product that begins with pure ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When making your own, you can be confident that what you are creating for yourself, your family and even your customers, is a pure all natural product that begins with pure ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have always been a firm advocate for using Aloe Vera leaves, and I&#x27;ve successfully used the leaves to smooth wrinkles, heal burns (of course), and rapidly cure athlete&#x27;s foot</li>
            <li>Really no scent at all which is good for some people..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll heal to a more natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is not oily, it soaks right into my skin and leaves it silky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Blend with a cucumber to make a refreshing facial</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of a Dr. Adorable product and at the same time I purchased their [[ASIN:B005ERACPM 8 Oz Organic Evening Primrose OIL]].</li>
            <li>wella can you say smooth, soft, manageable.</li>
            <li>I actually like this better than a product I have been using by Neutrogena that is a oil.</li>
            <li>First time using this oil for my hair and body butters</li>
            <li>My first time using Aloe Vera Oil</li>
            <li>I use Shea Butter and combine it with this and coconut oil to make my own &amp;#34;shea loe&amp;#34; foot creme (you can use it anywhere, but my feet get very rough).  </li>
            <li>However the healing and antimicrobial properties have been proven beneficial, not only on the skin, but also when used as a natural toothpaste and mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder form provides a more economical way to package, transport and store for those looking to use bulk quantities.</li>
            <li>Only had to use a little and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I Iove it and will buy more when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>no known natural populations in the world, perhaps the origin of this succulent plant was the result of the ancient mating of two genetically distinct varieties.</li>
            <li>This is done frequently in modern times to create plants stronger than either one of the parents, and to isolate and enhance beneficial properties of both.</li>
            <li>Those about to study Medicine, and the younger Physicians, should light their torches at the fires of the Ancients.”</li>
            <li>As soon as I received it (amazingly fast shipping, BTW)</li>
            <li>Before I went to bed last night I checked my arms and legs and they still felt smooth and moisturized...</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>after shaves, lotions, perfumes, scented, and even UNSCENTED air fresheners, really bother these people--they break out into rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like the purity of this oil</li>
            <li>it helps my acne so much</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing when I put it on my arms after my bath.</li>
            <li>What I like about this oil is that it absorbs quickly and completely - in half an hour or so a light application is no longer oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li>Big surprise, right!</li>
            <li>I add fragrance oils (strong, but synthetic) and/or essential oils (natural, but concentrated) for fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Ebers Papyrus, while written around 1,500 B.C. in ancient Egypt, is thought to be a collection of knowledge much, much older.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue using it for my skin and hair, along with the other hair care products I use,(my hair never looked better)!</li>
            <li>While scientists are yet to find definitive evidence of the efficacy of ingesting aloe, studies continue with high hopes.</li>
            <li>But it is not always convenient to run outside to cut a fresh leaf before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put a powerful oil on my skin that left my cheek with a chemical burn.</li>
            <li>and I even cured a mild Shingles reaction with it in a single day.  </li>
            <li>But that didn&#x27;t clear it up!</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera has also been shown to support the healing of first and second-degree burns and is approved by the FDA and often recommended by doctors for such use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this oil hoping to have a wonderful skin, but I have to say I have used not many times because it smells worse than my kitchen oil.</li>
            <li>My little fine lines and wrinkles go away when I use this oil on them.  </li>
            <li>that this is not USDA organic (not that I currently trust our government and its agencies very much - pretty much gutted by the big bucks boys).  </li>
            <li>like to mix about an ounce of this oil with about 10 drops of pure Lemon essential oil</li>
            <li>Many commercially available products have already incorporated aloe, but also contain artificial colors and fragrances.</li>
            <li>Many commercially available products have already incorporated aloe, but also contain artificial colors and fragrances.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and this helps my skin so much within days I see results and lesser spotting.</li>
            <li>one of the most commonly known benefits of Aloe Vera Gel is its ability to sooth sunburned skin.</li>
            <li>Ultra violet radiation suppresses the body’s natural immune responses and causes premature aging.</li>
            <li>Natural Health Supplement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have two friends at church, and both are sensitive to chemicals--</li>
            <li>This condition is more common than you might imagine.  </li>
            <li>ok so i usually use aloe vera juice or gel to return my hair&#x27;s ph back to normal and close my cuticles at end of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I received about half bottle full.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil does not work as well as a fresh leaf off of a plant, but it smells better, does not have to be kept alive and watered on your bathroom counter, works beautifully as a base oil for other cosmetics and moisturizers, and is much more convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Go</li>
            <li>There really is no other brand like Dr Adorables</li>
            <li>I developed the rash and tried to get rid of it the medical way.</li>
            <li>I stopped it early enough before it got out of hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its natural pain killing properties provide relief from burns, minor cuts and abrasions as well as soothing insect bites</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its natural pain killing properties provide relief from burns, minor cuts and abrasions as well as soothing insect bites</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this helps my skin so much within days I see results and lesser spotting. I recommend this to anyone dealing with the same thing as I am. It&#x27;s not sticky, it&#x27;s not runny, it has perfect consistent texture, just don&#x27;t use too much and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I have Shrogrens Disorder and one of the things that goes with is itch, very dry skin.  This oil is amazing!  It is not oily, it soaks right into my skin and leaves it silky.  I Iove it and will buy more when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> This oil has no smell and has healing properties that I like. I will order this product again. It came early and perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s very light, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and is a great moisturizer for my body. I&#x27;ve been rubbing it into a scape on my knee. It has helped it heal faster and reduced the scar. My aphorism also loves it. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Awesome and great price!</li>
            <li> No ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> Amazingly smooth oil.. Really no scent at all which is good for some people.. This product feels good on the skin and in the hair... Must reorder soon</li>
            <li> Liquid Aloe Vera Uses and Benefits&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps one of the most commonly known benefits of Aloe Vera Gel is its ability to sooth sunburned skin. Besides merely making it less of a painful experience, studies suggest that the polysaccharides it contains might protect against non-melanoma type skin cancers by targeting pathways activated by ultra violet radiation. Ultra violet radiation suppresses the body’s natural immune responses and causes premature aging. While not able to prevent sunburns, these polysaccharides help prevent the damage of the body’s natural immunities in the epidermis. Aloe Vera has also been shown to support the healing of first and second-degree burns and is approved by the FDA and often recommended by doctors for such use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps some of these qualities can be attributed to the fact that it absorbs into the skin almost four times faster than water – making it an excellent moisturizer and emollient. Its antimicrobial properties kill bacteria and its anti-inflammatory abilities make it a great solution for those with oily skin who may also suffer with acne, without leaving a greasy feel. The rapid stretching in skin causes small tears (commonly called “stretch marks”) that Aloe Vera gel can help heal and prevent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The History of Aloe Vera&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no known natural populations in the world, perhaps the origin of this succulent plant was the result of the ancient mating of two genetically distinct varieties. This is done frequently in modern times to create plants stronger than either one of the parents, and to isolate and enhance beneficial properties of both. Regardless of how it came about, it has become a pillar of health and beauty. Often grown as an ornamental decoration, its advantageous uses in skin care, cosmetics, and medicine are as impressive as the plant itself is lovely and hearty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Baron Carl con Rokitansky was quoted in the English translation of the oldest known medical document known to exist (the Ebers Papyrus), “Those about to study Medicine, and the younger Physicians, should light their torches at the fires of the Ancients.” Obviously Rokitansky held ancient practitioners in the highest regard and knew the valuable lessons we could learn from their wisdom. The Ebers Papyrus, while written around 1,500 B.C. in ancient Egypt, is thought to be a collection of knowledge much, much older. Mentioned in this text, as well as Natural History (written by Pliny the Elder) that claims to include all of the ancient knowledge, Aloe Vera’s role in history should be taken seriously by the health conscious individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Powder Uses and Benefits&lt;br /&gt;Incorporate the above-mentioned benefits in everything from your soap making to your lotions, shampoos, conditioners, lip balms, and massage oils. Simply mix the powder in during the liquid portion of your homemade creation. Easier to store and possessing a longer shelf life, its great for quick mixing with water to produce an Aloe Vera “juice” or gel. It contains vitamins C and B, and is commonly marketed as an internal health supplement. While scientists are yet to find definitive evidence of the efficacy of ingesting aloe, studies continue with high hopes. However the healing and antimicrobial properties have been proven beneficial, not only on the skin, but also when used as a natural toothpaste and mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder form provides a more economical way to package, transport and store for those looking to use bulk quantities. It also provides additional resourcefulness for the “do-it-yourselfer” simply looking to use what they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Natural Health Supplement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In either form this product will bring value to you, or your customers lives.

            <li> Was just what I needed.  Larger bottle than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome. For an oil it&#x27;s not too oily or greasy. I&#x27;ve already seen a difference in in skin. And I also use it on salads. great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read time and time again how Aloe Vera is so good for the skin in healing, maintaining moisture, and even managing conditions such as eczema and lichen planus. I wanted Aloe Vera in the oil form so that I could add it to my body butters and lotion bars. As soon as I received it (amazingly fast shipping, BTW) I opened it. There is no discernible smell to it. I applied some to my legs and arms. It is a wonderfully slippery oil and really thin, which is great when I need something to add to butters with a lot of hardness such as Kokum, Mango, or Shea butter. Before I went to bed last night I checked my arms and legs and they still felt smooth and moisturized... and I&#x27;ve got truly dry skin. This was my first purchase of a Dr. Adorable product and at the same time I purchased their [[ASIN:B005ERACPM 8 Oz Organic Evening Primrose OIL]]. I&#x27;m really impressed with not only the quality of the oils, but also their customer service. I had a question about the Evening Primrose Oil, shot them an email and they promptly responded answering my question in full. I&#x27;ll update later on the benefits I get from this oil once I&#x27;ve had a chance to use it more consistently, but I can already tell this a quality product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I used it with a combination of other essential oils to make a stretch mark removal cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in homemade lip balm. Only had to use a little and it worked great. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Helps with my psoriasis! Very soothing. Consistency is like olive oil.</li>
            <li> I use Shea Butter and combine it with this and coconut oil to make my own &amp;#34;shea loe&amp;#34; foot creme (you can use it anywhere, but my feet get very rough).  I add fragrance oils (strong, but synthetic) and/or essential oils (natural, but concentrated) for fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this is little boxes or jars and give them to my friends., and keep a few on hand for myself.  In addition, I use this oil and others to make a carrier oil base for natural essential oil bug deterrent.  I put those in little blue rollover containers, and keep one in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering why I use both fragrance oils and essential oils, there is a good reason.  I have two friends at church, and both are sensitive to chemicals-- after shaves, lotions, perfumes, scented, and even UNSCENTED air fresheners, really bother these people--they break out into rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I travel with one of these people regularly, and in one motel, she had to sleep in the car, the scent (we think it was in the carpet) was so bad.  This condition is more common than you might imagine.  So I can use these carrier oils with a bit of essential oils, and make pleasant smelling things: lotions, cremes, etc. The fact that it is Aloe Vera oil means it is soothing to the skin, which is a nice plus.</li>
            <li> My little fine lines and wrinkles go away when I use this oil on them.  (What more can you say?  This works better than any $80 product I&#x27;ve tried, has zero chemicals in it, and it leaves your face feeling fresher and healed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to mix about an ounce of this oil with about 10 drops of pure Lemon essential oil (seems to plump things up - collagen, maybe?) and a few drops of Carrot essential oil. This has become my daily moisturizer, and my face is looking a decade younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a firm advocate for using Aloe Vera leaves, and I&#x27;ve successfully used the leaves to smooth wrinkles, heal burns (of course), and rapidly cure athlete&#x27;s foot and I even cured a mild Shingles reaction with it in a single day.  But it is not always convenient to run outside to cut a fresh leaf before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil does not work as well as a fresh leaf off of a plant, but it smells better, does not have to be kept alive and watered on your bathroom counter, works beautifully as a base oil for other cosmetics and moisturizers, and is much more convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.......It will give your poor decimated plant time to regrow a few leaves.</li>
            <li> I knew of the many amazing benefits of aloe vera oil but, unconcerned with that, I bought a bottle thinking I would only use it on my hair  and skin. Ha! This fungal rash, I developed, proved this idiot savant to be wrong! I developed the rash and tried to get rid of it the medical way. But that didn&#x27;t clear it up! Big surprise, right! So I thought I would try the aloe Vera oil. And within a minute of using it the swelling, bumps, and inflammation was gone! Just like that! Now to be honest, the fungus( yuck, even the name sounds disgusting!) I had,wasn&#x27;t too bad. I stopped it early enough before it got out of hand. But the aloe oil did the trick! I will definitely use it again for any rash I get. I will definitely continue using it for my skin and hair, along with the other hair care products I use,(my hair never looked better)! And I will definitely buy it again! I guess I&#x27;m not that much of an idiot at all! No, wait! Yep, I still am! Ha! Lol!      ***&#x27;&#x27; BUT WAIT: \\&quot;GUESS WHO&#x27;S BACK, BACK , BACK. BACK AGAIN. Shon IS BACK, BACK, BACK.TELL YOUR FRIENDS!\\&quot; Okay so guess what? I bought another bottle of (just got to scream about it!) DR. ADORABLES ALOE OIL! My other bottle wasn&#x27;t even gone yet but I had to buy more. It&#x27;s so, so, so useful for so many hair and skin problems or just for beautifying yourself. For instance in order to stay beautiful I put a powerful oil on my skin that left my cheek with a chemical burn. I know that aloe is good for sunburned skin, so knowing this I rubbed it on my face. A decision I am definitely not regreting The small area(I recommend you see a doctor or hospital for deep or bad burns) is smooth and already showing improvement. There really is no other brand like Dr Adorables I&#x27;ve tried. If I were you I&#x27;d try it to. Rhyming? Yep idiot savant!. Ha! Lol!d not at all irritated. The small area is still red but as long as I use it regularly it&#x27;ll heal to a more natural skin tone. Thank you Dr. Adorable!,</li>
            <li> My skin drinks this up. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great I can use in my hair before wash, and my skin too, no have any smell, for me work good</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The oil is great.  I received about half bottle full.  In the shipment the oil leaked.</li>
            <li> Great on my acne skin. Cleared it up with everyday use. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil hoping to have a wonderful skin, but I have to say I have used not many times because it smells worse than my kitchen oil.</li>
            <li> What I like about this oil is that it absorbs quickly and completely - in half an hour or so a light application is no longer oily or sticky.  I&#x27;m using it for my cracked heels and it seems to be doing them some good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It bugs me a bit that this is not USDA organic (not that I currently trust our government and its agencies very much - pretty much gutted by the big bucks boys).  It&#x27;s from South Africa, and the label pictured is the sum total of information on the product.</li>
            <li> Really like the purity of this oil</li>
            <li> ok so i usually use aloe vera juice or gel to return my hair&#x27;s ph back to normal and close my cuticles at end of shampoo. i added this oil to my oil rinse and my oil i use to moisturize and seal. wella can you say smooth, soft, manageable. why have i been on my hair journey for almost 3 years and never once has anyone suggested using this oil to help combat dryness.... So Im telling you now add this into your oil mix and you wont be sorry. This is now a staple for me.</li>
            <li> seems no name brand !</li>
            <li> Perfect  for the lotion I made! Dr Adorable always delivers quality!</li>
            <li> Great oil, worked so well in my homemade body butter.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I cant find aloe vera oil in stores so i always get it here. Love it for my skin it helps my acne so much</li>
            <li> they are all great oils</li>
            <li> Very light and smooth oil. I mixed it with aloe vera lotion and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe this is Aloe Vera oil. It is light and has no fragrance. It is very moisturizing when I put it on my arms after my bath. I actually like this better than a product I have been using by Neutrogena that is a oil. The reason I give it a 4 star rather than five is because you have to be careful when pouring because it will run down the sides. I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered the wrong thing (I wanted gel) but you see what you want&lt;br /&gt;when I used it in one of my recipes I really love the way it feels so I think I will&lt;br /&gt;make my mistake again and again!</li>
            <li> Great seller as always. First time using this oil for my hair and body butters and I love it. Will repurchase again and fast shipping as usual.</li>
            <li> Just started using it and it seems to be helping my skin.</li>
            <li> My first time using Aloe Vera Oil and I must say that I love it! I use it as a body oil, hair oil, makeup remover and more!</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my dermatologist. Love it..</li>
