            <li>Along with a facial spider vein treatment from my MD, my skin has improved greatly!  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and great for sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>I would defiantly suggest Rosaclear Gentle Cleanser by,Obagi.</li>
            <li>but did absolutely nothing to help my rosecea.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of other cleansers and many of them really exacerbate the problem.  </li>
