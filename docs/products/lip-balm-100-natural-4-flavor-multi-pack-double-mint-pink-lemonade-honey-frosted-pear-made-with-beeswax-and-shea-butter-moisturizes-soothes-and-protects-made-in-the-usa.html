            <li>Great flavors and all natural!</li>
            <li>I find the flavors very sweet, too.  </li>
            <li>Here are the flavors listed below and why I loved them starting from my very favorite at the top:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I did receive these lip balm&#x27;s complimentary for my honest thoughts and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>This lip balm feels really nice when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li>Love these lip balms - my family of 4 divided Them up quickly.</li>
            <li>These little lip balms are wonderful!  </li>
            <li>glides on smooth.</li>
            <li>smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>all natural, beeswax balms.&lt;br /&gt;The recipient Loved</li>
            <li>For my Husband to do that is very rare.</li>
            <li>Smooth, rich, long-lasting benefit to them, as well.  </li>
            <li>So that was a major plus in why I loved this lip balm set.</li>
            <li>They taste/smell great (which is a plus), go on so smooth and feel so good, they moisturize (my lips feel really good for hours and hours after the balm wears off), and they last a decent amount of time (a few hours anyway).</li>
            <li>First of all, the flavors are incredible &amp; the fact that they are all natural is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>did not find anything special about this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ve come to the right place!</li>
            <li>these smell and how sweet they taste.</li>
            <li>It gives your lip that minty cool effect to it.</li>
            <li>I am a guy so these are too sweet and fruity for me.</li>
            <li>I appreciate having a safe alternative to lipstick for children, since they don&#x27;t really need that at their ages.  </li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, though, because it&#x27;s too oily &amp; sweet for me.</li>
            <li>but when i use this lip balm my lips are more soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My favorite was pink lemonaide, it is tangy but sweet and really smells like the sugary drink and tastes really good too.</li>
            <li>It is paraben free, no petrolium and no GMO which is a hot topic in todays media.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they are made out of 100% Natural Beeswax and Shea Butter!</li>
            <li>Another thing I loved about these are they 100% natural and made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love NATURAL lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that these are made from all natural products.</li>
            <li>They come in a package of 4, which means that you will have lots of fun trying them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lip balm not only is all natural and very soothing to the lips but tastes great.  </li>
            <li>I did have to help the girls remove the caps the first time we opened them, but my seven-year-old snapped up two of these right away.  </li>
            <li>he has sensitive skin and breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>The price is so reasonable, and I love the fact that these balms are made out of all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The first thing he asked me was what is in it?Because</li>
            <li>and they really work!</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing when you first put it on, except</li>
            <li>It is better than corporate lip balms.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lip balm set as an alternate to the lipsticks geared at children, and my 4 and 7 year old girls love it!  </li>
            <li>Like any environment friendly company this compnay DOES NOT test on animals, no petroleum, and 100 % natural..</li>
            <li>/&gt;These comes in four flavors that you are sure to like (though Honey was my least favorite)</li>
            <li>Thanks for providing this sample for my evaluation - it was much needed this winter!</li>
            <li>Not only do they keep your lips feeling hydrated, fresh and cool, but the flavors are so yummy.</li>
            <li>I put a light coat on this morning, it did not feel sticky, and just now, 12 hours later, I found I needed another swipe.</li>
            <li>These wil really help my lips.</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>My Husband is very PICKY about what he uses.</li>
            <li>so there is plenty to use and switch out if you really wanted to.</li>
            <li>out if you really wanted to.</li>
            <li>I find it really oily, though, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be an oil that absorbs readily because the layer of oil just sits on your lips.  </li>
            <li>My favorite out of all the flavors is the Pink Lemonade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great quality,smells great,tastes sweet,safe for you,paraben free,100% natural ingredients,love the variety of flavors &amp; smells,Hubby finally enjoys using a lip balm I suggest,&amp; it is safe for my toddler as well.</li>

            <li>Frosted Pear is lovely as well and smells like vanilla and pears with a touch of herbal (to me at least) and was my third favorite.</li>
            <li>I am soo glad that he actually loves it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is all natural and the smell is really nice and not strong at all.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It needs a bit more wax to stiffen it up just a little.  </li>
            <li>If you have a Husband like mine who has sensitive lips and is very picky then try this out he might like</li>
            <li>It brings a smile to my face knowing he finally got a lip balm he likes.</li>
            <li>Very soft and soothing.</li>
            <li>Very soft but not shiny.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily care that these are all natural, but they are really nice-feeling, smoothe, great-tasting chapsticks.</li>
            <li>It really surprised me.</li>
            <li>I told him it is natural</li>
            <li>Avia brings that with their four pack of natural lip balms made with beeswax and 100% natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>They are made from 100% natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>These use the standard twist bottom to push the product up and down (why mess with a good thing?)</li>
            <li>it smells like a glass of pink lemonade on a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>Just received these late last week &amp; I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>I scored Major points...</li>
            <li>This is a small company from what I can see, but I was excited on what I read about this company.</li>

            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ve come to the right place!</li>
            <li> these smell and how sweet they taste.</li>
            <li> It gives your lip that minty cool effect to it.</li>
            <li> I am a guy so these are too sweet and fruity for me.</li>
            <li> I appreciate having a safe alternative to lipstick for children, since they don&#x27;t really need that at their ages.  </li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, though, because it&#x27;s too oily &amp; sweet for me.</li>
            <li> but when i use this lip balm my lips are more soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My favorite was pink lemonaide, it is tangy but sweet and really smells like the sugary drink and tastes really good too.</li>
            <li> It is paraben free, no petrolium and no GMO which is a hot topic in todays media.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they are made out of 100% Natural Beeswax and Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> Another thing I loved about these are they 100% natural and made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love NATURAL lip balm.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that these are made from all natural products.</li>
            <li> They come in a package of 4, which means that you will have lots of fun trying them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lip balm not only is all natural and very soothing to the lips but tastes great.  </li>
            <li> I did have to help the girls remove the caps the first time we opened them, but my seven-year-old snapped up two of these right away.  </li>
            <li> he has sensitive skin and breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> The price is so reasonable, and I love the fact that these balms are made out of all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The first thing he asked me was what is in it?Because</li>
            <li> and they really work!</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing when you first put it on, except</li>
            <li> It is better than corporate lip balms.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm set as an alternate to the lipsticks geared at children, and my 4 and 7 year old girls love it!  </li>
            <li> Like any environment friendly company this compnay DOES NOT test on animals, no petroleum, and 100 % natural..</li>

            <li> Not only do they keep your lips feeling hydrated, fresh and cool, but the flavors are so yummy.</li>
            <li> I put a light coat on this morning, it did not feel sticky, and just now, 12 hours later, I found I needed another swipe.</li>
            <li> These wil really help my lips.</li>
            <li> i really like it.</li>
            <li> My Husband is very PICKY about what he uses.</li>
            <li> so there is plenty to use and switch out if you really wanted to.</li>
            <li> out if you really wanted to.</li>
            <li> I find it really oily, though, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be an oil that absorbs readily because the layer of oil just sits on your lips.  </li>
            <li> My favorite out of all the flavors is the Pink Lemonade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great quality,smells great,tastes sweet,safe for you,paraben free,100% natural ingredients,love the variety of flavors &amp; smells,Hubby finally enjoys using a lip balm I suggest,&amp; it is safe for my toddler as well.</li>

            <li> I like it because it is all natural and the smell is really nice and not strong at all.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It needs a bit more wax to stiffen it up just a little.  </li>
            <li> If you have a Husband like mine who has sensitive lips and is very picky then try this out he might like</li>
            <li> It brings a smile to my face knowing he finally got a lip balm he likes.</li>
            <li> Very soft and soothing.</li>
            <li> Very soft but not shiny.</li>

            <li> They are made from 100% natural ingredients.</li>

            <li> Just received these late last week &amp; I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> I scored Major points...</li>
            <li> This is a small company from what I can see, but I was excited on what I read about this company.</li>
            <li> It seems they&#x27;re either too goopy, too waxy, too sticky, don&#x27;t moisturize enough (or stay on long enough)</li>
            <li> later it made my lips dry out and peeling.</li>
            <li> We have very low humidity here--often single digit.</li>
            <li> They are also a little too soft.</li>
            <li> of these are free of artificial colorants and thus are creamy white and go on as such.</li>
            <li> I use the Pink Lemonade &amp; Double Mint,Frosted pear for my daughter,&amp; Honey for my Husband.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the way they smell and leave my lips feeling and smelling. They have 4 different scents all are delightful to smell as well as applying to my lips. I like that i can let my children use these as well to keep their lips from being dry and getting cracked. They are all natural beeswax lip balm so your children will love using them as they go on easily and smell great without leaving any kind of burning or tingling sensation. I did receive these lip balm&#x27;s complimentary for my honest thoughts and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily care that these are all natural, but they are really nice-feeling, smoothe, great-tasting chapsticks. Up there on my list of favorites for sure. I bought them from Amazon based on raving user reviews and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed in the least. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These do the job and are tasty. I put a light coat on this morning, it did not feel sticky, and just now, 12 hours later, I found I needed another swipe. We have very low humidity here--often single digit. These wil really help my lips.</li>
            <li> Love these! Great flavors and all natural! Set of four. :)</li>
            <li> I would not have posted any review but the seller asked, so here goes..&lt;br /&gt;I did not find anything special about this product. Over priced Chapstick</li>
            <li> Great lip balms and flavors.  They also have excellent customer service! I will definitely order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Delicious flavors and it definitively works for me!</li>
            <li> Great flavors to choose from and very smoothe.</li>
            <li> Love the flavor of these and the feel on my lips.  Very soft and soothing.</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm addict/snob. I&#x27;ve tried SO many products. It seems they&#x27;re either too goopy, too waxy, too sticky, don&#x27;t moisturize enough (or stay on long enough)....the list goes on. But with these, I am extremely pleased. They taste/smell great (which is a plus), go on so smooth and feel so good, they moisturize (my lips feel really good for hours and hours after the balm wears off), and they last a decent amount of time (a few hours anyway). No balm lasts on your lips forever. These are definitely my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of lips balms now. And I got a really nice followup email from Avia. That&#x27;s great customer service. I&#x27;m just really pleased to have found this lip balm from this company.</li>
            <li> I love these lips balm, the design is very cool and nice.  I was able to get them during a promotion, and I&#x27;m very happy to get them.  I like it because it is all natural and the smell is really nice and not strong at all.  My lips are very dry but when i use this lip balm my lips are more soft and smooth. i really like it.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. It is very different from all other lip moisturizers I have used. The product goes on smooth and its thin. Chapstick and other products with petroleum are thick and feel like lard when applied. The flavoring took some getting used to but they are delicious flavors.</li>

            <li> Love these lip balms - my family of 4 divided Them up quickly. Very soft but not shiny. Perfect for the whole family.</li>
            <li> These little lip balms are wonderful!  My lips love them, and they also have delicious flavors.  Smooth, rich, long-lasting benefit to them, as well.  I will be buying more of these!</li>
            <li> I dont know why this happens but its not smooth. Like sand is in it.</li>
            <li> I am a guy so these are too sweet and fruity for me. They are also a little too soft. A girl might like them but I&#x27;ll get something else next time.</li>
            <li> Love these, no aftertaste and they really work!</li>
            <li> cup fits to tight. Love Love the moisturizing balm. Great flavors too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm set as an alternate to the lipsticks geared at children, and my 4 and 7 year old girls love it!  The colorful packaging was very attractive to them, even without any glitter!  I did have to help the girls remove the caps the first time we opened them, but my seven-year-old snapped up two of these right away.  I appreciate having a safe alternative to lipstick for children, since they don&#x27;t really need that at their ages.  I&#x27;ll have to purchase more if I want some for myself!</li>
            <li> Just received these late last week &amp; I&#x27;m in love.  First of all, the flavors are incredible &amp; the fact that they are all natural is a real plus.  I will definitely be purchasing additional sets because I think they also would make a nice gift for anyone and a great stocking stuffer for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing when you first put it on, except later it made my lips dry out and peeling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally like the taste</li>
            <li> I love lip balm. I love NATURAL lip balm. Avia brings that with their four pack of natural lip balms made with beeswax and 100% natural ingredients. It is paraben free, no petrolium and no GMO which is a hot topic in todays media. These are safe to lick and are safe in case your dog gets a hold of one. These are made in the USA and are cruelty free (YES!) and Vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these are free of artificial colorants and thus are creamy white and go on as such. The feel of them is amazing and they add a good amount of moisture to your lips. There is some shine to them so you also get a bit of healthy looking wetness to your lips as well. These last a while before you need to reapply (unless you keep licking it off!) These use the standard twist bottom to push the product up and down (why mess with a good thing?) and the caps are secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These comes in four flavors that you are sure to like (though Honey was my least favorite) My favorite was pink lemonaide, it is tangy but sweet and really smells like the sugary drink and tastes really good too. Double Mint is also great and is perfect for reading your lips for kisses or close talks. Frosted Pear is lovely as well and smells like vanilla and pears with a touch of herbal (to me at least) and was my third favorite. They are all tasty and smell terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> glides on smooth. smells fantastic. will purcase again</li>
            <li> i received this product discounted for my honest review. The flavours are delicious and it makes you want to eat them. I love the fact that these are made from all natural products. Makes my lips so plum :). Very good for the price.</li>
            <li> This lip balm feels really nice when you first put it on.  It is better than corporate lip balms. I find it really oily, though, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be an oil that absorbs readily because the layer of oil just sits on your lips.  It needs a bit more wax to stiffen it up just a little.  I find the flavors very sweet, too.  It&#x27;s sweeter than what I want and probably appeals to kids more than most adults.  It is good quality and the packaging is nice.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, though, because it&#x27;s too oily &amp; sweet for me.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.&lt;br /&gt;The four tubes are nicely packaged with printed descriptions of the flavored, all natural, beeswax balms.&lt;br /&gt;The recipient Loved them!!&lt;br /&gt;And I scored Major points...</li>
            <li> love them!! lips stay moisturized for a long time and lips do not feel like they need the lip balm or they chap like other chap sticks make my lips feel.</li>
            <li> I like to use the product that I know are safe. I was a a huge fan of using Burt&#x27;s Bees products because they offered this to me, but although their lip balm is fantastic and this is product also is great and the price is great.It has four lip balm -four flavors which include Frosted Pear, Honey, Double Mint and Pink Lemonade.and i kept one for myself and gifted the rest and everyone loved it.Through some research online, I stumbled upon a product from a company called Avia Essentials. This is a small company from what I can see, but I was excited on what I read about this company. Like any environment friendly company this compnay DOES NOT test on animals, no petroleum, and 100 % natural.. Ingredients in these include beeswax, shea butter, coconut oil, lanolin, and vitamin E. This product does as it promises beautifully. My favorite out of all the flavors is the Pink Lemonade. This would be perfect for kids, teens, and even adults.I received this product in exchange for my unbiased reviews.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best sets of Lip Balm I have used. I love the fact that they are made out of 100% Natural Beeswax and Shea Butter! They have a great scent and taste good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve come to the right place! Avia Skincare Beeswax Lip Balm is what you have been searching for. Our all natural lip balm tastes great and feels wonderful. They are made from 100% natural ingredients. NO PETROLEUM. NO GMOs.

They come in a package of 4, which means that you will have lots of fun trying them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this lip balm. I have been looking everywhere, all winter long, for a product that will soothe my dry, cracked lips. I&#x27;ve tried all different types of medicated balms...many of the &#x27;popular&#x27; ones that we all see at the pharmacy or grocery checkout. I was determined to find something different, something that actually WORKED,  and  these AVIA lip balms are AMAZING!!! Not only do they keep your lips feeling hydrated, fresh and cool, but the flavors are so yummy. The price is so reasonable, and I love the fact that these balms are made out of all natural ingredients. I will definitely be checking out their other  products. So great!!!</li>
            <li> This lip balm not only is all natural and very soothing to the lips but tastes great.  Thanks for providing this sample for my evaluation - it was much needed this winter!</li>
