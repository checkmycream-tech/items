    <ol>
            <li>It smells wonderful and gives the perfect style and hold.</li>
            <li>And smells great too!  </li>
            <li>Smells awesome....</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>The product is great at giving texture to fine hair; the company took a week to box and mail it.</li>
            <li>Love the scent of it as it is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product, because I love their hairspray.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Wen Products, but like his much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the Manipulate-its&#x27; my favorite.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean too!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product helps give it more definition.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily when the time comes, but holds the style all day .</li>
            <li>Also, washes out of my hands really easy.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that is medium length and need volume and texture.</li>
            <li>Not fragrance free but has a light smell, a light lemon something.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Tigi for creating a product free of parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances (all of which have been linked with cancer).  </li>
            <li>This is my first purchase from the Love Peace &amp; The Planet line.</li>
            <li>They were good enough to send me  samples of another product to add shine.  </li>
            <li>I really love the way such little product makes my hair look so great!</li>
            <li>I could find a fiber cream that was all natural, fragrance free until them</li>
            <li>May have to rethink using it, if the price gets any higher.</li>
            <li>It really enhanced my wavy curls!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and it&#x27;s a steal of a price!</li>
            <li>First time was at an secondary market store where I tried it on a fluke, then I loved it so much, I had to go find it elsewhere when it ran out and low and behold</li>
            <li>This product works as well as my high end salon product does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that gives my straight, fine, short haircut a SASSY look and stays all day!  </li>
            <li>I bought this stuff to try to give my fine, straight hair a little life.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a fair few different waxes/gels/texturisers/putties over the years and this was by far my favourite, as people have said a little of this stuff goes a looonggg way, you had to be very sparse if you wanted a natural look</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this product.</li>
            <li>Natural, but it is a greasy pomade.  </li>
            <li>my hairdresser told me about this line and so far, i like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it really gave me much texture, just weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li>i have been looking for professional natural texturizing products for my short hair.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and gritty and is not at all easy to rub into the palm of your hands.  </li>

            <li> It is very thick and gritty and is not at all easy to rub into the palm of your hands.  </li>
            <li> It is harder to find now, and much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> several different ways &amp; still ended up with a very sticky stiff mess.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a little hold and safer natural product you got it.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that the life it gave it was the stiff, wild, punk hair that I was trying to get when I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this stuff is supposed to look like in the package, but when I opened it, it looked old and shrunken.  </li>
            <li> the smell is not strong, which is a big factor to me.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use product on my hair, but I like this texturizer and think the amount I got will last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The factory seal was missing...</li>
            <li> not sure if I will use it now.</li>
            <li> Everyone who has been frustrated with pomeade that seems to be too waxy or fall flat with their finer hair - THIS IS IT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sad to see it go &#x3D;(, going to have a hard time finding a replacement.</li>
            <li> It just made my hair look extremely dirty.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Thank you Tigi for creating a product free of parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances (all of which have been linked with cancer).  This is my first purchase from the Love Peace &amp; The Planet line. I have baby fine hair that is medium length and need volume and texture. This product is amazing! It smells wonderful and gives the perfect style and hold. I will definitely purchase the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> Adds body to hair just by taking a tiny amount and scrunching hair. Love the scent of it as it is not overpowering. Washes out easily when the time comes, but holds the style all day .</li>
            <li> Does just what I need it to do!  And smells great too!  I take a dab on my finger and mix it with a dab of my Kiwi pomade and I&#x27;m all set!</li>
            <li> Everyone who has been frustrated with pomeade that seems to be too waxy or fall flat with their finer hair - THIS IS IT. I have been using this for years and when my salon stopped keeping it on the shelves I have been buying it here. I constantly get asked by people how I get my flip-style to stay up. It rinses clean too! No furiously applying soap to get the junk off. Does not harm my hair and leaves it shiny and in place. I really can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this product.</li>
            <li> Natural, but it is a greasy pomade.  If you are looking for a little hold and safer natural product you got it.  Not fragrance free but has a light smell, a light lemon something.  Companies need to go fragrance free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could find a fiber cream that was all natural, fragrance free until them I will keep looking for non toxic alternatives.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome....but I had to wash my hair immediately. It just made my hair look extremely dirty. I don&#x27;t feel like it really gave me much texture, just weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li> i have been looking for professional natural texturizing products for my short hair. my hairdresser told me about this line and so far, i like it. the smell is not strong, which is a big factor to me. she also said i got it cheaper at amazon than what she could have even with her discount at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, because I love their hairspray. I have short spiky blonde hair. This product was simply too sticky for me. Couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The product is great at giving texture to fine hair; the company took a week to box and mail it. I&#x27;ll buy it again, but not from them.</li>
            <li> My cousin use to carry this product for work. Living in AZ a lot of hair gels melt and drip out in the heat. My son uses this and it stays set all day!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is harder to find now, and much more expensive.  May have to rethink using it, if the price gets any higher.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use product on my hair, but I like this texturizer and think the amount I got will last quite a while.  They were good enough to send me  samples of another product to add shine.  I like this too.  I had been using Wen Products, but like his much better.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to try to give my fine, straight hair a little life.  The problem is that the life it gave it was the stiff, wild, punk hair that I was trying to get when I was a teenager.  I tried using it several times...several different ways &amp; still ended up with a very sticky stiff mess.</li>
            <li> Brill can not find it shops</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ll use in my hair. I can change my style up from day to day even with my short hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product helps give it more definition.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time buying this product!  First time was at an secondary market store where I tried it on a fluke, then I loved it so much, I had to go find it elsewhere when it ran out and low and behold Amazon had it.  It&#x27;s the only product that gives my straight, fine, short haircut a SASSY look and stays all day!  Also, washes out of my hands really easy.  I highly recommend and it&#x27;s a steal of a price!</li>
            <li> The factory seal was missing...not sure if I will use it now.</li>
            <li> This product works as well as my high end salon product does. I ordered it for the size, as it travels well.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! I really love the way such little product makes my hair look so great! It really enhanced my wavy curls!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this stuff is supposed to look like in the package, but when I opened it, it looked old and shrunken.  It is very thick and gritty and is not at all easy to rub into the palm of your hands.  I always buy Tigi products, but will NEVER purchase this junk again.  I&#x27;ll stick with the Manipulate-its&#x27; my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a fair few different waxes/gels/texturisers/putties over the years and this was by far my favourite, as people have said a little of this stuff goes a looonggg way, you had to be very sparse if you wanted a natural look so it lasted ages too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad to see it go &#x3D;(, going to have a hard time finding a replacement.</li>
