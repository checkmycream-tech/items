            <li>/&gt;good good.</li>
            <li>i am very pleased that anthony logistics for men carries something</li>
            <li>smell of this toner is lightly refreshing: the citrus note is pleasant, and dissipates so you don&#x27;t walk around smelling feminine in any way.</li>
            <li>Has a nice citrus odor that leaves a refreshing smell and feel.  </li>
            <li>Anthony Logistics makes awesome products...from the Glycolic skin cleanser to the facial lotion to shaving oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many years.</li>
            <li>I like that Anthony has added a spray spout for the toner which means now this travels even better to the gym with me</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is actually working for me or doing anything, but it feels great on my face and is good after a shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>Love the spray cap - no need for cotton pads.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll get there.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good, right?</li>
            <li>alcohol free formula means i&#x27;m not subjecting my face to additional drying effects of even the slightest amount of alcohol in it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of Citrus Grandis and Citrus Noblis from this line from Anthony like their exfoliator and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding alcohol-free toner that refreshes and leaves your skin looking vibrant.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps my skin stay healthy and clean.</li>

            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me at all.</li>
            <li>I really like the spray head on it -</li>
            <li>after shaving when you don&#x27;t really want to rub and cause ingrown hair risk).</li>
            <li>Kind of dried out my face too.</li>
            <li>Really simple and clean.  </li>
            <li>Once I started using it I noticed more even skin with less blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>particularly if you don&#x27;t pamper it.</li>
            <li>Most toners, especially those at the big boxes, contain alcohol which dries your skin out.</li>
            <li>I had decent skin</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it as I do everything I can to avoid steroid cream.</li>
            <li>and doesnt kill my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>but I think if have same sale is really</li>
            <li>I ordered this and within one day, it completely healed my skin.  </li>
            <li>I pour a little on my hands and then rub it all over my face right after I shower.</li>
            <li>I suffer from eczema / atopic dermatitis and found this to be very helpful to stop the urge to itch and to also keep my skin looking normal and not super red.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i used a different toner previously until that brand discontinued making it. i am very pleased that anthony logistics for men carries something comparable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the alcohol free formula means i&#x27;m not subjecting my face to additional drying effects of even the slightest amount of alcohol in it. if you&#x27;re a guy, your skin can age quicker compared to a woman&#x27;s...particularly if you don&#x27;t pamper it. this product tones and provides some hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;begin by washing and cleansing thoroughly first, then pat your face dry before applying this toner to close up any pores that may have been opened up after the warm wash. follow afterwards with a non-oily moisturizer...easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell of this toner is lightly refreshing: the citrus note is pleasant, and dissipates so you don&#x27;t walk around smelling feminine in any way. this toner contains water, glycerin and aloe vera (hydrating property), chamomile (antibacterial property), and grapefruit (antibacterial and antioxidant properties), along with some other necessary stabilizing ingredients...nothing too harsh considering what some of the other alcohol-free toners may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. I do not feel like it does anything at all. Kind of dried out my face too.</li>
            <li> This product is great after using any acne washes, scrubs, etc. Once I started using it I noticed more even skin with less blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I use it like face lotion. I pour a little on my hands and then rub it all over my face right after I shower. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.&lt;br /&gt;Before I used it, my face would initially get dry after washing, and then overreact and get irritated and oily. Now it stays moist.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002WZPG2I Anthony Logistics for Men Anti-Aging Starter Kit]]  [[ASIN:B000HP7IM6 Anthony Logistics For Men Oil Free Facial Lotion SPF 15, 2.50-Ounce]]    Use it 2 or 3 times a week and then use anti-aging kit. Great combo.</li>
            <li> good I think this is a good choose. but I think if have same sale is really good.&lt;br /&gt;good good.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was. This is fake tan spray. I thought it was something else to help with aging. Guess it&#x27;s my fault thus the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Anthony Logistics makes awesome products...from the Glycolic skin cleanser to the facial lotion to shaving oil. This is an outstanding alcohol-free toner that refreshes and leaves your skin looking vibrant. Most toners, especially those at the big boxes, contain alcohol which dries your skin out. I&#x27;ve been using this for many years. I like that Anthony has added a spray spout for the toner which means now this travels even better to the gym with me (I don&#x27;t have to worry about carrying cotton balls to apply it).</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema / atopic dermatitis and found this to be very helpful to stop the urge to itch and to also keep my skin looking normal and not super red. I HIGHLY recommend it as I do everything I can to avoid steroid cream. This also just makes my skin look and feel great! Recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this product. I put some on in the mornings and at night after I shower and shave. It definitely helps my skin stay healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is actually working for me or doing anything, but it feels great on my face and is good after a shave. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> Really simple and clean.  Has a nice citrus odor that leaves a refreshing smell and feel.  Love the spray cap - no need for cotton pads.</li>
            <li> I have really bad dry skin during the winter time.  I ordered this and within one day, it completely healed my skin.  Regular lotion would just make my skin break out so this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product is doing anything for my skin.  I had decent skin pH before, not much acne either.  Its got a subtle citrus smell and my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse.  That&#x27;s good, right?</li>
            <li> Very good product very pleasant and refreshing fragrance does not burn when applied very pleased with this product in all aspects</li>
            <li> Smells great (just used it in fact!) and doesnt kill my sensitive skin! I have&#x27;t used it long enough to see change my skin brilliantly but i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll get there.</li>
            <li> I got for friend. Maybe works, But since I saw a lot of chemical in ingredients, change my mind. I did not return. Let see, how works</li>
            <li> Another solid product from Anthony L. Applying it on my face after a facial cleanser or shaving feels relaxing and leaves me feeling hydrated. I use it twice daily, 6 pumps each time(gonna try for less) and appears like the bottle will last for months.  I enjoy the smell of Citrus Grandis and Citrus Noblis from this line from Anthony like their exfoliator and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me at all. It just makes my face shiny and sticky. I was hoping it would even my skin tone and soothe after shaving, but it actually stings a little after I shave.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks, my skin is tighter and cleaner.  Anthony products aren&#x27;t the world&#x27;s cheapest, but you get what you pay for.  I think the bottle will last quite a while.  I really like the spray head on it - it makes application easier (esp. after shaving when you don&#x27;t really want to rub and cause ingrown hair risk).</li>
            <li> Was not what I thought I ordered&lt;br /&gt;Another product was pictured so I was suprised when I saw this.did not want the hassle of the return</li>
