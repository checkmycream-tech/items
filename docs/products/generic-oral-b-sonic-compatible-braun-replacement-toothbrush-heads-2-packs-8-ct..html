            <li>These replacement brush heads are nearly as good as the Oral B/ Braun brand.  </li>
            <li>Quality is quite good and was delivered on time.</li>
            <li>However, for me, that&#x27;s a good thing because it helps me remember</li>

            <li>The replacement heads fit our brushes perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and working well.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t fit perfectly on my Oral B Sonic, which means that whenever I use them they make a vibrating noise.</li>

            <li>The product, of course, is not as good as the name-brand toothbrush heads, but they work well and get the job done.</li>

            <li>if you own one of these, don&#x27;t buy this set.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled with both the value and the quality</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with theses toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>These are cheap money wise and product wise.</li>
            <li>This looks like a good value purchase, nevertheless I haven&#x27;t unpacked it yet, so you better keep reading reviews.</li>
            <li>full price again.i haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with this product yet .the</li>
            <li>The new toothbrush heads are excellent value and appear to work as w ell as the OralB ones.  </li>
            <li>Work perfectly on my Sonic Complete!</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly on my Sonic, but the bristles wear out very fast.  </li>
            <li>Replacement heads fit the described toothbrush models and are a good value.</li>
            <li>Fitted perfectly on my Sonic Complete handle.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly with my Oral B Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li>The number of bristles, durability and fit are all fine without regard to price, which makes this a great deal.</li>
            <li>May not be quite as good as the original, but I&#x27;ve been using them for a while and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li>My husband is using these and says they are as good as the original equipment.  </li>
            <li>I looked for some time for the brushheads and was so happy when I finally found them and at a great price, too.</li>
            <li>Good quality, good price for value, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Works just fine!</li>
            <li>The original heads are no longer made and these are a great match to the original.</li>
            <li>for the price ok, not exceptional,but will use and throw away....</li>
            <li>But at that price, you might have to change them more often.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price for sure.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK on the massaging speed.</li>
            <li>The bristles seem to pull out but for the price it is okay.  </li>
            <li>It does fit my Oral-B Sonic toothbrush!</li>
            <li>so mabe they do not mak them any more</li>
            <li>It is better than spending $$$$ for something you are&lt;br /&gt;supposed to replace every three months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even too confident that they are not going to fall out.</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided to look on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Hadn&#x27;t been able to find them in stores anywhere.</li>
            <li>I will buy again when in need of more refills.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make that model any more.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off buying another electric toothbrush than bothering with these things.  </li>
            <li>we didn&#x27;t spend more on them.</li>
            <li>I love them and I am all about more for your money</li>
            <li>Bought these based upon the description, but without even opening the package I noticed the hole that the toothbrush connects into is circular on these heads, when the toothbrush itself is more rectangular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the bristles could be better.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask from a tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Cheap for a Reason!</li>
            <li>Not as many bristles.</li>
            <li>These are made in Germany  and fit my Oral-B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush perfectly.  </li>
            <li>i am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>They brush, but not even closer to the original!</li>
            <li>Great fit and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The second one fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>These were a perfect fit at only 25% the cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They fit perfect, the only thing I notice is that there is no visible warning that the brush is getting worn, (wear indicator)</li>
            <li>Because of the looser fit, the brush makes more noise when it is running.</li>
            <li>I would buy them again mostly because they are cheap.</li>
            <li>We checked the listing to make sure these replacement heads would fit our oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They fit my toothbrush perfectly but seem to wear out 2x as fast as my real oral b heads.  </li>
            <li>and they fit my device perfectly, arrived on schedule although a long period of time on the road.</li>
            <li>A good money saver without much sacrifice on quality</li>
            <li>These are very affordable,  The quality is also good.  </li>
            <li>These are okay and fit the toothbrush fine</li>
            <li>Thank heavens you still have this product,My original toothbrush,that is still working, has been discontinued,and I still have one more in the box,these brush heads were sorely need,and I understand the company no longer provides them.</li>
            <li>Still, for the price you can afford to replace them more often, so they&#x27;re still a value compared to the original replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Buy them, and smile! :-)</li>
            <li>The fit just like the original heads did!</li>
            <li>The brush head slides on and off easily.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even use these bristles to clean the grout in my shower, let alone my precious teeth.  </li>
            <li>These are good replacements, but don&#x27;t fit exactly like the original to me.</li>
            <li>but since I can&#x27;t find the name brand version anymore, they will work just fine.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads work fine.  </li>
            <li>vibrates just fine.</li>
            <li>They worked just fine on my oral b sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li>These are a lot cheaper than brand name replacement brushes and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>Fits my Sonic Vitality just fine.</li>
            <li>but it works fine and is a lot cheaper</li>
            <li>worked fine.</li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>bristles are holding up fine.</li>
            <li>brushes fit beautifully and the price is definitely right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>JUST FINE.  </li>
            <li>But, after a week or two of use, they go on and off just fine.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads work just fine for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Easy to navigate and use to purchase different items for great prices.</li>
            <li>They fit fine, however sometimes the bristles come out while brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>I even bought one I thought would work, but did not.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes did fit and are working fine.  </li>
            <li>These fit great, but double check your model before you order.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li>out of 3 packages fit correctly (Sold by CART-WHEELS)&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes flick water all over but fit well and work well otherwise.</li>
            <li>Works, but fit is a touch off.  </li>
            <li>Cheap alternatives.</li>
            <li>These tooth brush heads fit as well as the Oral B brand</li>
            <li>They said it would fit, anyway they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Selected free shipping and</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t quite fit the toothbrush</li>
            <li>They fit my sonicare tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Work great, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>They arrived and fit my needs.</li>
            <li>THEY DON&#x27;T FIT.  </li>
            <li>It fits nicely and was extremely reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just no difference in size and fit.  </li>
            <li>They fit my sonic toothbrush and were not of inferior  quality.</li>
            <li>And such a great value.</li>
            <li>Cheap product.</li>
            <li>AND THESE FIT 100%</li>
            <li>Anyway, it is so cheap.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit and now I have 8 heads that I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>THEY FIT</li>
            <li>Some of them do fit.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and do no stay on.</li>
            <li>The blue on the bristles fades faster and have to replace head more often, but still much more cost effective.</li>
            <li>I do not believe that they are quite as good, but for the much lower cost they are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I gave them 4 stars because the product is good, but bristles are soft and I would prefer them a bit firmer.  </li>
            <li>These are a great price, but the bristles are much softer than the real brand.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not made by the original manufacturer, but they fit and work fine.  </li>
            <li>cheap but not half as good as the originals.</li>
            <li>Most important thing is that these brushheads clean your teeth well and just as good as original with same amount of brushing, and yes it does that.  </li>
            <li>While form and fit  matched and functioned like original Sonic Toothbrush Head.  </li>
            <li>We were hoping they would fit as the original oral B heads are so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>quality isn&#x27;t fantastic, but my teeth end up clean.</li>
            <li>They fit well and clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks strong enough to use three times a day for three months and the color is good.</li>
            <li>Seems almost like original equipment...</li>
            <li>They do look like the original, but when you pull them off the toothbrush the inside of the head stays on you</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll need to order the original.  </li>
            <li>Works like original.</li>
            <li>Bristles are softer than the original brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are softer than the original Oral B&#x27;s, but I like that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and this is better, will go for higher end unit when I run out of spare heads</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t Buy this product, buy the manufactuer original.</li>
            <li>Will probably revert to the original replacement product.</li>
            <li>The original will change colors when they are worn.</li>
            <li>These generic toothbrush heads fit my old Oral-B electric toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product is not even close to the quality of the original.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and are MUCH cheaper than any other replacement heads we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads clean the heck out of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>bristles are shorter which makes them firmer so they wont clean between teath,I think I will be buying originals from now on.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean teeth well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like my teeth get as clean.</li>
            <li>Same as original, good quality.</li>
            <li>I have a sonic complete and was very excited to get these!</li>
            <li>They work just fine and the price is right.</li>
            <li>surprisingly they arrived in a very short time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about them, but they were cheap</li>
            <li>Good product at a generic price.</li>
            <li>These brushes fit just fine and are very affordable compared to the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I can replace the heads quickly at the amazing low price.</li>
            <li>They appear to me to be able to FIT Sonic Complete or Vitality Sonic brushes.</li>
            <li>Super value.</li>
            <li>The head fit my Complete perfectly and brushing my teeth felt almost identical to my previous brush.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The first one I tried did not appear to fit</li>
            <li>The price was excellent compared to other offers.  </li>
            <li>It saved me from having to get a brand new set for $30 or more.</li>
            <li>Not bad, except some of the brushes wouldn&#x27;t fit very well</li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;m willing to compromise a bit but the brush heads don&#x27;t fit on the brush quite right</li>
            <li>Although these are generic, they fit just fine and seem to do the job of cleaning my teeth just fine.</li>
            <li>These replacement toothbrush heads fit my oral-b sonic complete electric toothbrush just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding replacement brushes for my Sonic Complete, these fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I extend the useful life of my brush heads by putting them in the dishwasher from time to time.</li>
            <li>After brushing, I had the smile of Steve Buscemi.  </li>
            <li>worth the $.i&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>It did take about 3 weeks for the package to arrive from China, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>So far brush quality is comparable to originals at much better price.</li>
            <li>Until Braun lowers the price and charges a fair price, I will continue to use these decent brush heads at a third of the cost.</li>
            <li>I ORDERED THE RIGHT ONES, BUT THEY DON&#x27;T MATCH MY TOOTH BRUSH HOLDER.  </li>
            <li>, The price was right</li>
            <li>The seller makes that clear with a picture of the original brush head so look at the picture if there is any doubt!</li>
            <li>One will work and the next will not go on or come off your brush very easily.</li>
            <li>After a month of use, the new heads are holding up just fine.  </li>
            <li>these replacement brushes are ok, they don&#x27;t last as long as the oral-b&#x27;s, but I sure can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t seem that much less quality, but not as good</li>
            <li>They have a greater tendency to start to fray early in usage but have not fallen apart so they can be used and at a much lower rate of cost for the brush.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have found is that the heads didn&#x27;t fit down perfectly on the motor unit, making it necessary to take off the heads for cleaning more frequently than before.</li>
            <li>This is the only replacement head you will ever use, as it is the LAST ONE you will ever be able to put on your toothbrush!!</li>
            <li>The replacement heads fit my Oral-B Sonic Complete toothbrush as advertised.  </li>
            <li>As far as being exactly like the oral-b brand replacement heads I did find these to be a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>They fit our sonic complete - they aren&#x27;t the name brand</li>
            <li>The only thing better than the quality of the knock-offs is the price.  </li>
            <li>They look and measure exactly</li>
            <li>They fit my sonic complete and I can&#x27;t find those anywhere anymore.  </li>
            <li>The bristles started falling out the first time I used one.</li>
            <li>The first one I tried to put on shattered into pieces.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied enough.</li>
            <li>No problems with the fit (I have a Oral B Sonic Complete) and</li>
            <li>I tried the first one 3 months ago and as a toothbrush, it works.</li>
            <li>Considering how expensive the \\&quot;genuine\\&quot; replacement heads are, I&#x27;m very  happy with these generics.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Seems to be an exact match.  </li>
            <li>This is much more affordable than purchasing in my local store.  </li>
            <li>These are well worth the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>perfect for units requiring 18-a heads (also lists 12-a but unable to verify)&lt;br /&gt;Bristles</li>
            <li>But the product stated it fit complete&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The price on the generic Oral-B compatible toothbrush heads was outstanding.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really even expect these to work on my Sonic Complete after getting them at such a good price.</li>
            <li>AND IF YOU BUY THEM AND OPEN THEM TO MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>You can save so much money using these!</li>
            <li>Love this product - my second one!</li>
            <li>So if above doesn&#x27;t matter these are ok to go get.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li>GREAT price , as expected , fits ,feels on e-brush, only had 1 bristle fall out in about 2 months.</li>
            <li>works as intended, not as well built as the real ones, bristtles coming off after a few uses, but for the price, its a good buy</li>
            <li>At first, the brush head was almost too snug, and I really had to pull to get it off.</li>
            <li>Fits the toothbrush, but does not have the fading blue part that normally tells you when to switch after so many uses.</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and is satisfactory, but must be changed twice as frequently as the name brand product.  </li>
            <li>I bought both these, which were 8 brush heads for $8.94 and the single pack, which were 4 brush heads for $7.85, because I wasn&#x27;t sure what the difference was.  </li>
            <li>I learned that you just can&#x27;t skimp on quality with certain things.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to buy a new electric toothbrush right away, so</li>
            <li>It is hard to find replacement heads for our Sonic Vitality, so I was glad to fine these.</li>
            <li>Initial quality seems fine.  </li>
            <li>I paid much more in the past for original Oral B replacement heads.</li>
            <li>These generic heads are a fraction of the cost and they work fine for me.</li>
            <li>At the super low price even if a few of the package are duds it is still a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>; on the package, these seems to be reasonably hard - what I find to be a good quality.  </li>
            <li>Great buy diffidently going to tell a friend and buy this  Generic brand again!</li>
            <li>Thanks for supplying it</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain for the price</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really nitpicking here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I can keep on using the brush.</li>
            <li>The heads work very well</li>
            <li>Also, much cheaper in price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out why the manufacturer charges so much money for the heads.</li>
            <li>Fast  </li>
            <li>This product will go straight in the garbage.</li>
            <li>Stick with the real thing</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the real thing at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But, thanks to Amazon, I found some to keep going for awhile longer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It fits very well and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ships fast, item as described.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than replacement Braun Sonicare brand.  </li>
            <li>Recommend highly!</li>
            <li>Although the gap is just a hair taller then the real ones it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the brush head and doesn&#x27;t slide off the metal post with use.</li>
            <li>Softer brussels than original.&lt;br /&gt;Wears out much faster.</li>
            <li>Same product that I was buying before only this was much more economical.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I had to take a star off is because these are slightly smaller as far as how many bristles it has and the bristles are somewhat stiffer than original.  </li>
            <li>Based on some of the other reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well these replacement heads would hold up.</li>
            <li>Bought this as the original Oral-B heads are retailing for around USD 11 per brushhead locally plus its a rarity.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for a month now and cannot tell the difference between the original and these generic replacements.  </li>
            <li>Customers need to learn to be smart about their purchases and just because this says SONIC does not mean PULSONIC.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are much more firm at first and took some breaking in for me to get used to.</li>
            <li>These fit my toothbrush perfectly and are so much less expensive than the brand name.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit on the stiff side, so be aware, but the price is a lot better than the brand name.</li>
            <li>The average use is way better than that.  </li>
            <li>When brushing teeth with these heads the plastic edges seem to &amp;#34;clank&amp;#34; against your teeth a little more often than the real ones.  </li>
            <li>Just like the brand name heads except maybe not as long-lasting, but with the price so much cheaper, I can live with that.</li>
            <li>Authentic has a slight gap as well.  </li>
            <li>the one we needed were braum its a older one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve uploaded pics of the old genuine toothbrush heads and this generic replacement.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>the extremely high price, I ordered these.</li>
            <li>I have the Oral B Vitality Sonic and was dreading the high cost of replacment heads.</li>
            <li>These are okay----Stiffer than the real Oral B brand and if you have sensitive teeth, be for warner, your gums might bleed.</li>
            <li>Love the price, but one head lasts about a month (heavy use about 6 times a day).  </li>
            <li>I will update this review after I have tried a few more.</li>
            <li>no idea how long it will last, but it fits my toothbrush OK.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described,  can&#x27;t believe how much cheaper this generic brand is and works just as well!</li>
            <li>Found bristles on this generic brand soft not firm like original Toothbrush Heads..  </li>
            <li>cheap, doubt they last as long as the real thing.</li>
            <li>These will fit the Braun Sonic Vitality electric toothbrush, but not &#x27;exactly&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I will use all the replacement heads and hopefully by the time they are gone I will need a new sonic toothbrush as I will not be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li>they were new in package.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s time for a new hear.</li>
            <li>I thought I might have to buy a new sonic toothbrush because I could not find replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I then attached a new head and tried to pull it off immediately.</li>
            <li>Time to suck it up and order a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>- these brush heads don&#x27;t fit onto the metal post as far down as the real ones.</li>
            <li>These brush heads look fine, but will NOT FIT THE Professional Care, Advanced Power, and Cross Action Power series, so</li>
            <li>I have an older sonic complete...</li>
            <li>Well, they are very soft.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have just spent a little bit more to get something a little better!</li>
            <li>The bristles fall out faster than more expensive brands, but I still think these are a much better value overall.  </li>
            <li>Lo and behold, they are the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>First brush head only lasted 6 weeks....   </li>
            <li>This is a cheap version of the original, but since it is almost impossible to get the original and&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am only on the first one so far</li>
            <li>Also, the package indicates they are soft brushes, but they don&#x27;t seem very soft to me.</li>
            <li>They work fine, maybe wear out a little faster, but you could use them 3 to 1 vs the name brand and still come out ahead.  </li>
            <li>Sufficient - bristles are not very hard but they seem to be what we need.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, some of the brush heads don&#x27;t fit the toothbrush because they&#x27;re too tight.  </li>
            <li>and they wear down a lot faster than the original oral b heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First visual impressions were not really that pleasing as the bristles were already quite frayed when new compared to a brand new original Oral-Bs.</li>
            <li>This product looks fine but does not fit the Fits Oral sonic B toothbrush as indicated in the product description</li>
            <li>how long they will last compared to the original Oral B product, but at this price, who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little bummed they didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>This is a slight gap and the bristle material does not seem as durable as the original.  </li>
            <li>It works but probably because of copyright issues, it does not fit onto the handle securely.  </li>
            <li>next time I&#x27;ll just pay for the real thing.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my Sonic Complete, since it seems that the brand-name heads are out of production.  </li>
            <li>Plus the bristles are soft which dentists recommend.</li>
            <li>I read that the bristles were soft, but I figured I buy soft brushes anyways.</li>
            <li>They are holding up well so far.  </li>
            <li>These do not fit the model they promised to fit.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I purchased these as replacement brush heads for my Oral B Sonic Complete toothbrush, when Oral B stopped making them.</li>
            <li>If you are considering buying these, you just need to realize that your Sonic Complete, like mine, is too old to keep.</li>
            <li>Terribly soft and nothing like the OEM ones.</li>
            <li>HAVE ORAL-B SONIC AND SONIC COMPLETE</li>
            <li>which compared to my old one is the &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; that I wanted.</li>
            <li>Some fit and some do not fit.  </li>
            <li>but so far I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about except that they are made in China.</li>
            <li>Not firm.</li>
            <li>These were not compatible with Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li>Tried these generic ones and they&#x27;re ok, but not exactly like the same thing.  </li>
            <li>These fit my old Sonic Complete, although there is a small gap preventing them from seamlessly snapping in.</li>
            <li>I will update my post if they wear down quickly.  </li>
            <li>On the first head I used a couple of bristles popped loose after about a month.</li>
            <li>They are a very tight fit on my toothbrush, they will go on but it takes some doing, also to remove them.</li>
            <li>They may not last as long, but for the price we paid for the amount, worth it.</li>
            <li>Heads are meant for the sonic brush, but they do not fit snugly to give the true &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action of the head.</li>
            <li>Not fitting when our model was listed as fitting was the reason I only gave 2 stars.</li>
            <li>Decent product, will try something else next time.</li>
            <li>while not quite as stiff the original-</li>
            <li>I had looked around and didn&#x27;t want to spend those high prices at local stores.</li>
            <li>THE BOTTOM OF THE HEAD IS TO SMALL TO FIT MY HANDLE.</li>
            <li>After brushing with these heads a few times: - the width of the brush head bristle coverage area is slightly more narrow than the real Oral-B heads.  </li>
            <li>work, but the bristles are a little stiffer than the ones we are used to.&lt;br /&gt;After using for several weeks, we&#x27;re used to them and at the fantastic price, will buy again.</li>
            <li>Same as original but a lot less money.</li>
            <li>The next time I need replacement heads, I may end up buying a new toothbrush instead.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the new replacement a couple of times, so</li>
            <li>and I can really overlook all the tiny misgivings above.</li>
            <li>But they work, and the price is much cheaper, especially if you have several users in the house.</li>
            <li>Contrary to other postings, they didn&#x27;t fall apart after the first week.  </li>
            <li>These fit an Oral b Sonic Vitality brush, which is hard to find replacement heads for.</li>
            <li>I feel like these bristles are not going to last as long as the bristles used in the real heads.</li>
            <li>Go grab them, no regrets.</li>
            <li>When they came, I compared the old and new heads and found only minor differences.</li>
            <li>They are a little harder than what I would call &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>I have thrown them away and gone back to the higher priced oral B. Don&#x27;t believe the other reviews that tell you there is in difference..there is.</li>
            <li>These are not exactly like the real Toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>Although this is a slight issue, the current much lower cost of these heads could make this a non-issue.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are good and so much less expensive.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads (generic) work just fine; however, they do not fit quite as tight as the OEM&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>They fit a little looser and the bristles may be a little softer, however, they do the job.</li>
            <li>Some loss of brushes and seem to not clean teeth as well as the real factory heads.</li>
            <li>A little softer and don&#x27;t vibrate quite like the real.</li>
            <li>The packaging is rather flimsy (the glue on the clear plastic to the cardboard backing had loosened on one pack) but the USPS was not gentle</li>

            <li> The product, of course, is not as good as the name-brand toothbrush heads, but they work well and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I loved the savings I get using amazon.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> well, I regard it as a good buy.</li>
            <li> I admit the quality is not as good as the manufacturer brushes, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat them.  </li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> Delivery of product was good.</li>
            <li> This is a good value.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly in my Baun Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> A good value.</li>
            <li> I could not find my replacement brushes anywhere and thought I would have to get rid of the toothbrush, but these fit perfect and are as good as the name brand ones.</li>
            <li> Very pleased to find these tooth brush heads.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased at the cost and quality of these replacement tips.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with these heads.</li>
            <li> Plug and use on my sonic toothbrush very pleased.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, good fit and great price.</li>
            <li> Now I can afford to replace my brush more often!</li>
            <li> But ordering it online was great and easy.</li>
            <li> truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I have the Oral B Vitality Sonic and they fit and work great.</li>
            <li> The heads fit great and</li>
            <li> For the price, they are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing price compared to anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> Great quantity with cheap price.</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my oral b tooth brush and the quality is great.</li>
            <li> if you own one of these, don&#x27;t buy this set.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled with both the value and the quality</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with theses toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> These are cheap money wise and product wise.</li>
            <li> This looks like a good value purchase, nevertheless I haven&#x27;t unpacked it yet, so you better keep reading reviews.</li>
            <li> full price again.i haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with this product yet .the</li>
            <li> The new toothbrush heads are excellent value and appear to work as w ell as the OralB ones.  </li>
            <li> Work perfectly on my Sonic Complete!</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly on my Sonic, but the bristles wear out very fast.  </li>
            <li> Replacement heads fit the described toothbrush models and are a good value.</li>
            <li> Fitted perfectly on my Sonic Complete handle.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Oral B Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li> The number of bristles, durability and fit are all fine without regard to price, which makes this a great deal.</li>
            <li> May not be quite as good as the original, but I&#x27;ve been using them for a while and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> My husband is using these and says they are as good as the original equipment.  </li>
            <li> I looked for some time for the brushheads and was so happy when I finally found them and at a great price, too.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price for value, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works just fine!</li>
            <li> The original heads are no longer made and these are a great match to the original.</li>
            <li> for the price ok, not exceptional,but will use and throw away....</li>
            <li> But at that price, you might have to change them more often.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for sure.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK on the massaging speed.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem to pull out but for the price it is okay.  </li>
            <li> It does fit my Oral-B Sonic toothbrush!</li>
            <li> so mabe they do not mak them any more</li>
            <li> It is better than spending $$$$ for something you are&lt;br /&gt;supposed to replace every three months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even too confident that they are not going to fall out.</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided to look on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t been able to find them in stores anywhere.</li>
            <li> I will buy again when in need of more refills.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make that model any more.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off buying another electric toothbrush than bothering with these things.  </li>
            <li> we didn&#x27;t spend more on them.</li>
            <li> I love them and I am all about more for your money</li>
            <li> Bought these based upon the description, but without even opening the package I noticed the hole that the toothbrush connects into is circular on these heads, when the toothbrush itself is more rectangular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of the bristles could be better.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask from a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Cheap for a Reason!</li>
            <li> Not as many bristles.</li>
            <li> These are made in Germany  and fit my Oral-B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush perfectly.  </li>
            <li> i am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> They brush, but not even closer to the original!</li>
            <li> Great fit and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The second one fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> These were a perfect fit at only 25% the cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They fit perfect, the only thing I notice is that there is no visible warning that the brush is getting worn, (wear indicator)</li>
            <li> Because of the looser fit, the brush makes more noise when it is running.</li>
            <li> I would buy them again mostly because they are cheap.</li>
            <li> We checked the listing to make sure these replacement heads would fit our oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They fit my toothbrush perfectly but seem to wear out 2x as fast as my real oral b heads.  </li>
            <li> and they fit my device perfectly, arrived on schedule although a long period of time on the road.</li>
            <li> A good money saver without much sacrifice on quality</li>
            <li> These are very affordable,  The quality is also good.  </li>
            <li> These are okay and fit the toothbrush fine</li>
            <li> Thank heavens you still have this product,My original toothbrush,that is still working, has been discontinued,and I still have one more in the box,these brush heads were sorely need,and I understand the company no longer provides them.</li>
            <li> Still, for the price you can afford to replace them more often, so they&#x27;re still a value compared to the original replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Buy them, and smile! :-)</li>
            <li> The fit just like the original heads did!</li>
            <li> The brush head slides on and off easily.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even use these bristles to clean the grout in my shower, let alone my precious teeth.  </li>
            <li> These are good replacements, but don&#x27;t fit exactly like the original to me.</li>
            <li> but since I can&#x27;t find the name brand version anymore, they will work just fine.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads work fine.  </li>
            <li> vibrates just fine.</li>
            <li> They worked just fine on my oral b sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> These are a lot cheaper than brand name replacement brushes and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Fits my Sonic Vitality just fine.</li>
            <li> but it works fine and is a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> worked fine.</li>
            <li> They work fine.</li>
            <li> bristles are holding up fine.</li>
            <li> brushes fit beautifully and the price is definitely right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But they work just fine.  </li>
            <li> JUST FINE.  </li>
            <li> But, after a week or two of use, they go on and off just fine.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work just fine for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Easy to navigate and use to purchase different items for great prices.</li>
            <li> They fit fine, however sometimes the bristles come out while brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> I even bought one I thought would work, but did not.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes did fit and are working fine.  </li>
            <li> These fit great, but double check your model before you order.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li> out of 3 packages fit correctly (Sold by CART-WHEELS)&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes flick water all over but fit well and work well otherwise.</li>
            <li> Works, but fit is a touch off.  </li>
            <li> Cheap alternatives.</li>
            <li> These tooth brush heads fit as well as the Oral B brand</li>
            <li> They said it would fit, anyway they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Selected free shipping and</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t quite fit the toothbrush</li>
            <li> They fit my sonicare tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Work great, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> They arrived and fit my needs.</li>
            <li> THEY DON&#x27;T FIT.  </li>
            <li> It fits nicely and was extremely reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just no difference in size and fit.  </li>
            <li> They fit my sonic toothbrush and were not of inferior  quality.</li>
            <li> And such a great value.</li>
            <li> Cheap product.</li>
            <li> AND THESE FIT 100%</li>
            <li> Anyway, it is so cheap.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit and now I have 8 heads that I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> THEY FIT</li>
            <li> Some of them do fit.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and do no stay on.</li>
            <li> The blue on the bristles fades faster and have to replace head more often, but still much more cost effective.</li>
            <li> I do not believe that they are quite as good, but for the much lower cost they are well worth it.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I gave them 4 stars because the product is good, but bristles are soft and I would prefer them a bit firmer.  </li>
            <li> These are a great price, but the bristles are much softer than the real brand.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not made by the original manufacturer, but they fit and work fine.  </li>
            <li> cheap but not half as good as the originals.</li>
            <li> Most important thing is that these brushheads clean your teeth well and just as good as original with same amount of brushing, and yes it does that.  </li>
            <li> While form and fit  matched and functioned like original Sonic Toothbrush Head.  </li>
            <li> We were hoping they would fit as the original oral B heads are so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> quality isn&#x27;t fantastic, but my teeth end up clean.</li>
            <li> They fit well and clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks strong enough to use three times a day for three months and the color is good.</li>
            <li> Seems almost like original equipment...</li>
            <li> They do look like the original, but when you pull them off the toothbrush the inside of the head stays on you</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll need to order the original.  </li>
            <li> Works like original.</li>
            <li> Bristles are softer than the original brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are softer than the original Oral B&#x27;s, but I like that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and this is better, will go for higher end unit when I run out of spare heads</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Buy this product, buy the manufactuer original.</li>
            <li> Will probably revert to the original replacement product.</li>
            <li> The original will change colors when they are worn.</li>
            <li> These generic toothbrush heads fit my old Oral-B electric toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product is not even close to the quality of the original.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and are MUCH cheaper than any other replacement heads we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads clean the heck out of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> bristles are shorter which makes them firmer so they wont clean between teath,I think I will be buying originals from now on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean teeth well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like my teeth get as clean.</li>
            <li> Same as original, good quality.</li>
            <li> I have a sonic complete and was very excited to get these!</li>
            <li> They work just fine and the price is right.</li>
            <li> surprisingly they arrived in a very short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about them, but they were cheap</li>
            <li> Good product at a generic price.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit just fine and are very affordable compared to the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I can replace the heads quickly at the amazing low price.</li>
            <li> They appear to me to be able to FIT Sonic Complete or Vitality Sonic brushes.</li>
            <li> Super value.</li>
            <li> The head fit my Complete perfectly and brushing my teeth felt almost identical to my previous brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The first one I tried did not appear to fit</li>
            <li> The price was excellent compared to other offers.  </li>
            <li> It saved me from having to get a brand new set for $30 or more.</li>
            <li> Not bad, except some of the brushes wouldn&#x27;t fit very well</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;m willing to compromise a bit but the brush heads don&#x27;t fit on the brush quite right</li>
            <li> Although these are generic, they fit just fine and seem to do the job of cleaning my teeth just fine.</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrush heads fit my oral-b sonic complete electric toothbrush just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding replacement brushes for my Sonic Complete, these fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I extend the useful life of my brush heads by putting them in the dishwasher from time to time.</li>
            <li> After brushing, I had the smile of Steve Buscemi.  </li>
            <li> worth the $.i&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> It did take about 3 weeks for the package to arrive from China, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> So far brush quality is comparable to originals at much better price.</li>
            <li> Until Braun lowers the price and charges a fair price, I will continue to use these decent brush heads at a third of the cost.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THE RIGHT ONES, BUT THEY DON&#x27;T MATCH MY TOOTH BRUSH HOLDER.  </li>
            <li> , The price was right</li>
            <li> The seller makes that clear with a picture of the original brush head so look at the picture if there is any doubt!</li>
            <li> One will work and the next will not go on or come off your brush very easily.</li>
            <li> After a month of use, the new heads are holding up just fine.  </li>
            <li> these replacement brushes are ok, they don&#x27;t last as long as the oral-b&#x27;s, but I sure can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t seem that much less quality, but not as good</li>
            <li> They have a greater tendency to start to fray early in usage but have not fallen apart so they can be used and at a much lower rate of cost for the brush.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have found is that the heads didn&#x27;t fit down perfectly on the motor unit, making it necessary to take off the heads for cleaning more frequently than before.</li>
            <li> This is the only replacement head you will ever use, as it is the LAST ONE you will ever be able to put on your toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads fit my Oral-B Sonic Complete toothbrush as advertised.  </li>
            <li> As far as being exactly like the oral-b brand replacement heads I did find these to be a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> They fit our sonic complete - they aren&#x27;t the name brand</li>
            <li> The only thing better than the quality of the knock-offs is the price.  </li>
            <li> They look and measure exactly</li>
            <li> They fit my sonic complete and I can&#x27;t find those anywhere anymore.  </li>
            <li> The bristles started falling out the first time I used one.</li>
            <li> The first one I tried to put on shattered into pieces.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied enough.</li>
            <li> No problems with the fit (I have a Oral B Sonic Complete) and</li>
            <li> I tried the first one 3 months ago and as a toothbrush, it works.</li>
            <li> Considering how expensive the \\&quot;genuine\\&quot; replacement heads are, I&#x27;m very  happy with these generics.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Seems to be an exact match.  </li>
            <li> This is much more affordable than purchasing in my local store.  </li>
            <li> These are well worth the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> perfect for units requiring 18-a heads (also lists 12-a but unable to verify)&lt;br /&gt;Bristles</li>
            <li> But the product stated it fit complete&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The price on the generic Oral-B compatible toothbrush heads was outstanding.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really even expect these to work on my Sonic Complete after getting them at such a good price.</li>
            <li> AND IF YOU BUY THEM AND OPEN THEM TO MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> You can save so much money using these!</li>
            <li> Love this product - my second one!</li>
            <li> So if above doesn&#x27;t matter these are ok to go get.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> GREAT price , as expected , fits ,feels on e-brush, only had 1 bristle fall out in about 2 months.</li>
            <li> works as intended, not as well built as the real ones, bristtles coming off after a few uses, but for the price, its a good buy</li>
            <li> At first, the brush head was almost too snug, and I really had to pull to get it off.</li>
            <li> Fits the toothbrush, but does not have the fading blue part that normally tells you when to switch after so many uses.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and is satisfactory, but must be changed twice as frequently as the name brand product.  </li>
            <li> I bought both these, which were 8 brush heads for $8.94 and the single pack, which were 4 brush heads for $7.85, because I wasn&#x27;t sure what the difference was.  </li>
            <li> I learned that you just can&#x27;t skimp on quality with certain things.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to buy a new electric toothbrush right away, so</li>
            <li> It is hard to find replacement heads for our Sonic Vitality, so I was glad to fine these.</li>
            <li> Initial quality seems fine.  </li>
            <li> I paid much more in the past for original Oral B replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These generic heads are a fraction of the cost and they work fine for me.</li>
            <li> At the super low price even if a few of the package are duds it is still a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> ; on the package, these seems to be reasonably hard - what I find to be a good quality.  </li>
            <li> Great buy diffidently going to tell a friend and buy this  Generic brand again!</li>
            <li> Thanks for supplying it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain for the price</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really nitpicking here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I can keep on using the brush.</li>
            <li> The heads work very well</li>
            <li> Also, much cheaper in price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out why the manufacturer charges so much money for the heads.</li>
            <li> Fast  </li>
            <li> This product will go straight in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Stick with the real thing</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the real thing at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> But, thanks to Amazon, I found some to keep going for awhile longer.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It fits very well and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ships fast, item as described.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than replacement Braun Sonicare brand.  </li>
            <li> Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Although the gap is just a hair taller then the real ones it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the brush head and doesn&#x27;t slide off the metal post with use.</li>
            <li> Softer brussels than original.&lt;br /&gt;Wears out much faster.</li>
            <li> Same product that I was buying before only this was much more economical.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I had to take a star off is because these are slightly smaller as far as how many bristles it has and the bristles are somewhat stiffer than original.  </li>
            <li> Based on some of the other reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well these replacement heads would hold up.</li>
            <li> Bought this as the original Oral-B heads are retailing for around USD 11 per brushhead locally plus its a rarity.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a month now and cannot tell the difference between the original and these generic replacements.  </li>
            <li> Customers need to learn to be smart about their purchases and just because this says SONIC does not mean PULSONIC.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are much more firm at first and took some breaking in for me to get used to.</li>
            <li> These fit my toothbrush perfectly and are so much less expensive than the brand name.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit on the stiff side, so be aware, but the price is a lot better than the brand name.</li>
            <li> The average use is way better than that.  </li>
            <li> When brushing teeth with these heads the plastic edges seem to &amp;#34;clank&amp;#34; against your teeth a little more often than the real ones.  </li>
            <li> Just like the brand name heads except maybe not as long-lasting, but with the price so much cheaper, I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Authentic has a slight gap as well.  </li>
            <li> the one we needed were braum its a older one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve uploaded pics of the old genuine toothbrush heads and this generic replacement.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> the extremely high price, I ordered these.</li>
            <li> I have the Oral B Vitality Sonic and was dreading the high cost of replacment heads.</li>
            <li> These are okay----Stiffer than the real Oral B brand and if you have sensitive teeth, be for warner, your gums might bleed.</li>
            <li> Love the price, but one head lasts about a month (heavy use about 6 times a day).  </li>
            <li> I will update this review after I have tried a few more.</li>
            <li> no idea how long it will last, but it fits my toothbrush OK.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described,  can&#x27;t believe how much cheaper this generic brand is and works just as well!</li>
            <li> Found bristles on this generic brand soft not firm like original Toothbrush Heads..  </li>
            <li> cheap, doubt they last as long as the real thing.</li>
            <li> These will fit the Braun Sonic Vitality electric toothbrush, but not &#x27;exactly&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I will use all the replacement heads and hopefully by the time they are gone I will need a new sonic toothbrush as I will not be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> they were new in package.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s time for a new hear.</li>
            <li> I thought I might have to buy a new sonic toothbrush because I could not find replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I then attached a new head and tried to pull it off immediately.</li>
            <li> Time to suck it up and order a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> - these brush heads don&#x27;t fit onto the metal post as far down as the real ones.</li>
            <li> These brush heads look fine, but will NOT FIT THE Professional Care, Advanced Power, and Cross Action Power series, so</li>
            <li> I have an older sonic complete...</li>
            <li> Well, they are very soft.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have just spent a little bit more to get something a little better!</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out faster than more expensive brands, but I still think these are a much better value overall.  </li>
            <li> Lo and behold, they are the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> First brush head only lasted 6 weeks....   </li>
            <li> This is a cheap version of the original, but since it is almost impossible to get the original and&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am only on the first one so far</li>
            <li> Also, the package indicates they are soft brushes, but they don&#x27;t seem very soft to me.</li>
            <li> They work fine, maybe wear out a little faster, but you could use them 3 to 1 vs the name brand and still come out ahead.  </li>
            <li> Sufficient - bristles are not very hard but they seem to be what we need.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, some of the brush heads don&#x27;t fit the toothbrush because they&#x27;re too tight.  </li>
            <li> and they wear down a lot faster than the original oral b heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First visual impressions were not really that pleasing as the bristles were already quite frayed when new compared to a brand new original Oral-Bs.</li>
            <li> This product looks fine but does not fit the Fits Oral sonic B toothbrush as indicated in the product description</li>
            <li> how long they will last compared to the original Oral B product, but at this price, who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bummed they didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> This is a slight gap and the bristle material does not seem as durable as the original.  </li>
            <li> It works but probably because of copyright issues, it does not fit onto the handle securely.  </li>
            <li> next time I&#x27;ll just pay for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Sonic Complete, since it seems that the brand-name heads are out of production.  </li>
            <li> Plus the bristles are soft which dentists recommend.</li>
            <li> I read that the bristles were soft, but I figured I buy soft brushes anyways.</li>
            <li> They are holding up well so far.  </li>
            <li> These do not fit the model they promised to fit.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as replacement brush heads for my Oral B Sonic Complete toothbrush, when Oral B stopped making them.</li>
            <li> If you are considering buying these, you just need to realize that your Sonic Complete, like mine, is too old to keep.</li>
            <li> Terribly soft and nothing like the OEM ones.</li>
            <li> HAVE ORAL-B SONIC AND SONIC COMPLETE</li>
            <li> which compared to my old one is the &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Some fit and some do not fit.  </li>
            <li> but so far I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about except that they are made in China.</li>
            <li> Not firm.</li>
            <li> These were not compatible with Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li> Tried these generic ones and they&#x27;re ok, but not exactly like the same thing.  </li>
            <li> These fit my old Sonic Complete, although there is a small gap preventing them from seamlessly snapping in.</li>
            <li> I will update my post if they wear down quickly.  </li>
            <li> On the first head I used a couple of bristles popped loose after about a month.</li>
            <li> They are a very tight fit on my toothbrush, they will go on but it takes some doing, also to remove them.</li>
            <li> They may not last as long, but for the price we paid for the amount, worth it.</li>
            <li> Heads are meant for the sonic brush, but they do not fit snugly to give the true &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action of the head.</li>
            <li> Not fitting when our model was listed as fitting was the reason I only gave 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Decent product, will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> while not quite as stiff the original-</li>
            <li> I had looked around and didn&#x27;t want to spend those high prices at local stores.</li>
            <li> THE BOTTOM OF THE HEAD IS TO SMALL TO FIT MY HANDLE.</li>
            <li> After brushing with these heads a few times: - the width of the brush head bristle coverage area is slightly more narrow than the real Oral-B heads.  </li>
            <li> work, but the bristles are a little stiffer than the ones we are used to.&lt;br /&gt;After using for several weeks, we&#x27;re used to them and at the fantastic price, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Same as original but a lot less money.</li>
            <li> The next time I need replacement heads, I may end up buying a new toothbrush instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the new replacement a couple of times, so</li>
            <li> and I can really overlook all the tiny misgivings above.</li>
            <li> But they work, and the price is much cheaper, especially if you have several users in the house.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other postings, they didn&#x27;t fall apart after the first week.  </li>
            <li> These fit an Oral b Sonic Vitality brush, which is hard to find replacement heads for.</li>
            <li> I feel like these bristles are not going to last as long as the bristles used in the real heads.</li>
            <li> Go grab them, no regrets.</li>
            <li> When they came, I compared the old and new heads and found only minor differences.</li>
            <li> They are a little harder than what I would call &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> I have thrown them away and gone back to the higher priced oral B. Don&#x27;t believe the other reviews that tell you there is in difference..there is.</li>
            <li> These are not exactly like the real Toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> Although this is a slight issue, the current much lower cost of these heads could make this a non-issue.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are good and so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads (generic) work just fine; however, they do not fit quite as tight as the OEM&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> They fit a little looser and the bristles may be a little softer, however, they do the job.</li>
            <li> Some loss of brushes and seem to not clean teeth as well as the real factory heads.</li>
            <li> A little softer and don&#x27;t vibrate quite like the real.</li>
            <li> The packaging is rather flimsy (the glue on the clear plastic to the cardboard backing had loosened on one pack) but the USPS was not gentle</li>
            <li> Very firm bristles - package says soft, but I think they&#x27;re a little more firm than that.  </li>
            <li> In terms of cleaning performance its not as thorough compared to the real stuff as the bristles were harder and slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> It remains to be seen if they last as long as the Oral B brand.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell if they last as long.</li>
            <li> They will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Even if they didn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> Plus that, what I really didn&#x27;t like was that the packages (blister packs) had broken open so the brushes were loose in a zipper plastic bag, which didn&#x27;t look new.</li>
            <li> Previously, I purchased replacement brushes for my Oral B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> If you get them be ready for a stray brush falling off every now and again, but that isn&#x27;t a problem for me in the least.  </li>
            <li> am disappointed that I didn&#x27;t catch the small print on the photo top left of the 8 heads that clearly says Soft Bristles.</li>
            <li> and I only experience a couple brushes falling out of maybe every 3rd or 4th brush head on average.</li>
            <li> Definitely a minor problem.</li>
            <li> These are labeled in German, for unknown reasons.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, I noticed that the individual bristles were also 10-15℅ thicker thus harder as well.</li>
            <li> My brush says Sonic complete on the charger and these brushes DO NOT fit.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it that long</li>
            <li> So far, not a problem, and I will update review after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> As long as one or two work</li>
            <li> Just looks funny, there&#x27;s a quarter of an inch gap between the head and the base, but it is secure and brushes/</li>
            <li> but the heads don&#x27;t last as long as other heads I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Price on original replacement heads was quite expensive</li>
            <li> Was surprised when I received the brush heads for my now extinct discontinued Oral B Sonic Complete Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I typically replace the toothbrush at 3 months and will update this with whether these brushes last that long.</li>
            <li> Authentic Oral B replacement heads are very expensive.</li>
            <li> out of 3 packages were too loose for the toothbrush head (</li>
            <li> The cost was less than a regular manual toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It is german printed and quality is the same if not better.</li>
            <li> The product is just as expected.  </li>
            <li> we wasted our money and didn&#x27;t want to ship it back to China</li>
            <li> not only do they not fit my Oral-B tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Came before expected ship date.  </li>
            <li> This was a total waste of time.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the generic would not fit.</li>
            <li> This is specifically for Oral-B sonic complete (Unfortunately even a slightly different Oral-B product might have a different brush head).</li>
            <li> The heads do not fit properly on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The Braun Vitality electric toothbrush is a reasonably priced item, but the replacement heads are a rip-off.</li>
            <li> No thanks.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who still uses this specific brand and was a little skeptical at first because in store or on Oral-B&#x27;s website a 4 pack was anywhere from 20-40 dollars.</li>
            <li> Only drawback, they fit a tiny bit loosely on my toothbrush base and vibrate a little.  </li>
            <li> They are a little hard at first but after a few uses the bristles are a little softer.</li>
            <li> I look for other items for purchase.</li>
            <li> I found these brushes on Amazon and was skeptical the first time I ordered them.  </li>
            <li> I have the Sonic Complete and was having a difficult time finding replacement heads locally.  </li>
            <li> So far have not experienced any other issues.  </li>
            <li> These are a little harder in the bristle than the name brand and they start to shed some bristles when they wear out.</li>
            <li> It not worth paying for the shipping in order to return the items.</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out, they are not cut evenly and it&#x27;s just a very poor imitation of the real thing.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t slip all the way down onto the shaft to form a flush connection, but they do still work.</li>
            <li> After not being able to find replacement toothbrush heads locally and refusing to pay the incredibly outrageous prices asked on other websites, I found and decided to try these.  </li>
            <li> The replacement head got stuck half way down the metal prong and won&#x27;t move in either direction.</li>
            <li> Though it claims that it uses DuPont&#x27;s Tynex&#x27;s nylon filaments, the bristles is slightly harsher than originals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It costs less than 10% compared to the originals</li>
            <li> were just as described and got all 8 heads for less than the cost of 1 in a store.</li>
            <li> I paid half a price and still cannot believe I got it.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem to be softening after less that 2 months.</li>
            <li> I will seriously rethink the generic oral-b compatibles that I use.</li>
            <li> I believe these work just as well as those purchased in a store for much less.</li>
            <li> I guess u get what u pay for, does not clean well.</li>
            <li> It is just a little noisy</li>
            <li> fitment a little off.</li>
            <li> The bristles did splay a little faster than OEM, but I also tend to apply a lot of pressure when I brush</li>
            <li> These are truly not worth the money!</li>
            <li> These were a little over 6 for eight!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are a bit firm</li>
            <li> They did not fit our Braun even though it was advertised as compatible.</li>
            <li> It did not fit our Braun Oral B.</li>
            <li> I have a few of these.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit snugly (1/5 inch space between bottom of brush and base)</li>
            <li> It will barely fit over the metal portion of your toothbrush base.</li>
            <li> This does not fit the Oral B Vitality Sonic, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was blown away when I got this 8 pack for around 5 dollars and they completely work!&lt;br</li>
            <li> firmly attached&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
            <li> THESE DO NOT FIT</li>
            <li> Does not fit my oral b vitality sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding brush heads in stores</li>
            <li> There is a slight vibration noise, a little annoying at first, but it does not seem to detract from the cleaning function!  </li>
            <li> Too stiff needs to have softer bristles.</li>
            <li> They either do not fit properly or else they are next to impossible to get off because they get wedged on.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because of other reviews; but with the difference in price of $1/head for generic and $10/head for brand name, I felt that I had to at least try for myself.</li>
            <li> Not much more needs to be said in this review.  </li>
            <li> The bristles (in the past, anyway) soften a bit over time.</li>
            <li> There is not much more to say, since I haven&#x27;t used them yet.</li>
            <li> We have an older tooth brush and the heads can be impossible to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I would suggest not trying to save the money as it&#x27;s likely to just be a useless exercise in frustration.</li>
            <li> My sonic brush uses Oral-B SR-18 replacement heads usually.</li>
            <li> THESE DO NOT FIT ORAL B VITALITY!  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> They are also increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> I change mine about once a month now, where it used to be at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> I had to take it into my workshop and remove it with a Dremel cutting tool, sawing through the plastic until only the metal post remained.</li>
            <li> priced well considering i can&#x27;t even find replacement brushes anywhere, and if i did, they would cost at least $5-$12 each.</li>
            <li> With that cost in mind, I can afford to discard these brush heads every 2-3 months instead of the usual 5-6months!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads do NOT fit!!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they did not fit and we were past the 30 day return period.</li>
            <li> Is the insert hole a rectangular shape with a small slit at approximately 4 o&#x27;clock (with the brush head facing upwards)?</li>
            <li> They are not compatible with the Braun toothbrush - they did not fit the brush base properly.  </li>
            <li> as a side note I have seen a lot of angry reviews that this product does not fit their -insert brand of electronic toothbrush-</li>
            <li> These are hard to find at any store now!</li>
            <li> They are too short for the base of the toothbrush, and they have to be forced on.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that Oral-B doesn&#x27;t continue to make replacement heads for my sonic toothbrush and these are the only ones I can find.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush and is very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Have had some get stuck or not even go on without having to push them very hard to go on the brush end.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Poor quality, you get what you paid for</li>
            <li> They fir poorly and I ended up removing those brushes with a pliers.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> THE IDIOT ABOVE ME.</li>
            <li> False advertising to say the lest</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping wasn&#x27;t too bad, either, taking less than two weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> If you have an Oral B Sonic toothbrush, you know the brush heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> this were wrong ones we returned them and still waiting for refund</li>
            <li> They do not look difficult to produce.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get them on the toothbrush rotating</li>
            <li> Trust me that they are expensive junk.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately...</li>
            <li> This is sad as the type of bristle is listed as US Dupont Tynex Bristle end-rounded bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was about to ditch my electric toothbrush because of the expensive replacement heads when I found these.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself the pain and expenses you&#x27;ll undoubtedly receive from dentist after using these, and pay for the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> They are not equivalent to the brand Oral B sonic brush heads, but, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find the originals anywhere.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> So sad for me:-(</li>
            <li> Oral-B make it very complicated.</li>
            <li> I was having a very difficult time finding these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking in the stores for the Oral-B replacement toothbrushes and they either don&#x27;t have them or they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> They are as bad as HP and their ink cartridges.  </li>
            <li> THESE SUCK REALLY, REALLY BAD BLAH BLAH BLAH.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These things are crap.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  </li>
            <li> This product is awful.  </li>

            <li> The fit just like the original heads did! No problems. I will order these again. Received in two days.</li>
            <li> Great fit and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit correctly. Sent them back.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads fit my Oral-B Sonic Complete toothbrush as advertised.  Contrary to other postings, they didn&#x27;t fall apart after the first week.  They are a bit firm but since I can&#x27;t find the name brand version anymore, they will work just fine.  Finally, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads work fine.  The product is just as expected.  I will purchase again when needed.  Thanks for supplying it</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrush heads fit my oral-b sonic complete electric toothbrush just fine. As far as being exactly like the oral-b brand replacement heads I did find these to be a cheap knock off. The bristles are much more firm at first and took some breaking in for me to get used to. I will use all the replacement heads and hopefully by the time they are gone I will need a new sonic toothbrush as I will not be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> This product looks fine but does not fit the Fits Oral sonic B toothbrush as indicated in the product description</li>
            <li> These brush heads look fine, but will NOT FIT THE Professional Care, Advanced Power, and Cross Action Power series, so if you own one of these, don&#x27;t buy this set.  They appear to me to be able to FIT Sonic Complete or Vitality Sonic brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 3 packages of these toothbrush heads.&lt;br /&gt;1 out of 3 packages fit correctly (Sold by CART-WHEELS)&lt;br /&gt;2 out of 3 packages were too loose for the toothbrush head (Sold by Universal-Sales) - they wouldn&#x27;t refund my money because i had opened the packages, but how was i to know they were too big without opening the packages?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very frustrating, but i guess that&#x27;s what happens when you go cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ordering from Universal Sales.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads work great.  The replacement heads are the same quality as the name brand.  I&#x27;ll order these again.</li>
            <li> Based on some of the other reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well these replacement heads would hold up. When they came, I compared the old and new heads and found only minor differences. After a month of use, the new heads are holding up just fine.  The only problem I have found is that the heads didn&#x27;t fit down perfectly on the motor unit, making it necessary to take off the heads for cleaning more frequently than before. Definitely a minor problem.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are nearly as good as the Oral B/ Braun brand.  I do not believe that they are quite as good, but for the much lower cost they are well worth it.  Companies like Braun need to learn and stop overcharging for replacement parts.  They are as bad as HP and their ink cartridges.  Until Braun lowers the price and charges a fair price, I will continue to use these decent brush heads at a third of the cost.</li>
            <li> Just looks funny, there&#x27;s a quarter of an inch gap between the head and the base, but it is secure and brushes/vibrates just fine.</li>
            <li> cheap, doubt they last as long as the real thing.</li>
            <li> Junk... heads are falling off in the mouth...</li>
            <li> Same as original but a lot less money.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes flick water all over but fit well and work well otherwise.</li>
            <li> They fit our sonic complete - they aren&#x27;t the name brand but they don&#x27;t seem that much less quality, but not as good but I can&#x27;t find the name brand anymore anyway.  They may not last as long, but for the price we paid for the amount, worth it.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads fit the described toothbrush models and are a good value.</li>
            <li> They worked just fine on my oral b sonic toothbrush and I&#x27;m thrilled with both the value and the quality</li>
            <li> They did not fit our Braun even though it was advertised as compatible.</li>
            <li> If you have an Oral B Sonic toothbrush, you know the brush heads are expensive. They are also increasingly hard to find. This product was so inexpensive I bought a big supply so I won&#x27;t run out before the handle dies. I extend the useful life of my brush heads by putting them in the dishwasher from time to time.</li>
            <li> Love the price, but one head lasts about a month (heavy use about 6 times a day).  The bristles fall out faster than more expensive brands, but I still think these are a much better value overall.  It is hard to find replacement heads for our Sonic Vitality, so I was glad to fine these.</li>
            <li> Works, but fit is a touch off.  Can&#x27;t really complain for the price and it is fully functional.  Seems almost like original equipment...</li>
            <li> Very pleased to find these tooth brush heads.</li>
            <li> for the price ok, not exceptional,but will use and throw away....</li>
            <li> It works but probably because of copyright issues, it does not fit onto the handle securely.  This is a slight gap and the bristle material does not seem as durable as the original.  But at that price, you might have to change them more often.</li>
            <li> Not much more needs to be said in this review.  These are a lot cheaper than brand name replacement brushes and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Cheap alternatives. They fit a little looser and the bristles may be a little softer, however, they do the job. Because of the looser fit, the brush makes more noise when it is running.</li>
            <li> It did not fit our Braun Oral B. we wasted our money and didn&#x27;t want to ship it back to China</li>
            <li> These tooth brush heads fit as well as the Oral B brand and I don&#x27;t have to hop all over town to find them.  I will be purchasing them again.  It remains to be seen if they last as long as the Oral B brand.  I will update my post if they wear down quickly.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> These are labeled in German, for unknown reasons. That isn&#x27;t why I don&#x27;t like them. They are a very tight fit on my toothbrush, they will go on but it takes some doing, also to remove them. Plus that, what I really didn&#x27;t like was that the packages (blister packs) had broken open so the brushes were loose in a zipper plastic bag, which didn&#x27;t look new. I&#x27;ll disinfect them before I use them but next time I&#x27;ll just pay for the real thing.</li>
            <li> Quality is quite good and was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> truly amazing. will shop again.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit as snug and so the noise when brushing can be irritating. they still work. It is just a little noisy</li>
            <li> Sufficient - bristles are not very hard but they seem to be what we need. Can&#x27;t beat the price for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought these not only do they not fit my Oral-B tooth brush. They said it would fit, anyway they don&#x27;t. I have a few of these. So sad for me:-(</li>
            <li> They are not compatible with the Braun toothbrush - they did not fit the brush base properly.  I do not recommend these.</li>
            <li> great and great price.</li>
            <li> Bought this as the original Oral-B heads are retailing for around USD 11 per brushhead locally plus its a rarity. Selected free shipping and surprisingly they arrived in a very short time. Only disappoinment is that the packaging differs from what&#x27;s its shown here and its not German made but made by Paz Generix in China instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First visual impressions were not really that pleasing as the bristles were already quite frayed when new compared to a brand new original Oral-Bs. Out of the box, I noticed that the individual bristles were also 10-15℅ thicker thus harder as well. Though it claims that it uses DuPont&#x27;s Tynex&#x27;s nylon filaments, the bristles is slightly harsher than originals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actual brushing impressions. These compatible heads have excellent fitting, as good as originals. Fitted perfectly on my Sonic Complete handle. In terms of cleaning performance its not as thorough compared to the real stuff as the bristles were harder and slightly thicker. It can&#x27;t reach in as deep to flush out the interdental cavities but I&#x27;m really nitpicking here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary these replacement brushes are very good value for money. It costs less than 10% compared to the originals and I can really overlook all the tiny misgivings above. With that cost in mind, I can afford to discard these brush heads every 2-3 months instead of the usual 5-6months! Go grab them, no regrets. Hope they could maintain the quality consistency every batch.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t quite fit the toothbrush so there was a lot of rattling and extra vibration.  I will stick with the name-brand brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> Best place to get replacement heads for a good price.</li>
            <li> Bristles not holding up well.</li>
            <li> These will fit the Braun Sonic Vitality electric toothbrush, but not &#x27;exactly&#x27;. They don&#x27;t slip all the way down onto the shaft to form a flush connection, but they do still work. The next time I need replacement heads, I may end up buying a new toothbrush instead.</li>
            <li> The only thing better than the quality of the knock-offs is the price.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are okay and fit the toothbrush fine but the heads don&#x27;t last as long as other heads I have purchased.</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;m willing to compromise a bit but the brush heads don&#x27;t fit on the brush quite right, they work alright at the end of the day though</li>
            <li> Given difficulty in locating replacement Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush Heads in quantity. I mistakenly experimented using this generic brand. While form and fit  matched and functioned like original Sonic Toothbrush Head.  Found bristles on this generic brand soft not firm like original Toothbrush Heads..  Will not order again. Switching back to original&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MLW</li>
            <li> Thank heavens you still have this product,My original toothbrush,that is still working, has been discontinued,and I still have one more in the box,these brush heads were sorely need,and I understand the company no longer provides them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for several months. They fit fine, however sometimes the bristles come out while brushing my teeth and they wear down a lot faster than the original oral b heads. I change mine about once a month now, where it used to be at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Sonic Complete, since it seems that the brand-name heads are out of production.  They fit perfectly on my Sonic, but the bristles wear out very fast.  I&#x27;ve used one for a month now and it looks like someone has been scrubbing tile with it.  The brand-name heads lasted for months, but you&#x27;ll want to replace these once a month or so.  Still, for the price you can afford to replace them more often, so they&#x27;re still a value compared to the original replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads clean the heck out of my teeth.  I had the teeth of a pirate, yellow &amp; dingy.  After brushing, I had the smile of Steve Buscemi.  I am thrilled with theses toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT work with Oral B Vitality, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Awesome and saved a lot of money!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads do NOT fit!!  They look and measure exactly but for some reason the insert hole is too short.</li>
            <li> These heads are a great deal - you get 8 for probably the price of 1.  They fit my sonic complete and I can&#x27;t find those anywhere anymore.  Very firm bristles - package says soft, but I think they&#x27;re a little more firm than that.  Otherwise, good fit and great price.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find at any store now! I don&#x27;t know why. But ordering it online was great and easy.</li>
            <li> These are cheap money wise and product wise. I often get a rogue bristle in my mouth after use. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> They do look like the original, but when you pull them off the toothbrush the inside of the head stays on you toothbrush and is very hard to remove. I love my Oral-B toothbrush so I&#x27;ll need to order the original.  I will NOT order them again.</li>
            <li> Too stiff needs to have softer bristles. It can cause tooth sensitivity when used on the faster speeds. It&#x27;s OK on the massaging speed.</li>
            <li> Great product! After reading reviews and researching I found these to work great with my Oral B Sonic Care toothbrush. Plus the bristles are soft which dentists recommend. I use each head for around 2 months and switch them out. Great price!</li>
            <li> These are not exactly like the real Toothbrush heads. A little softer and don&#x27;t vibrate quite like the real. They do work.</li>
            <li> I could no longer find replacement heads for my still working electric toothbrush. It looked like I would have to toss it. Thanks to Amazon, I can keep on using the brush. The heads work very well</li>
            <li> bristles are shorter which makes them firmer so they wont clean between teath,I think I will be buying originals from now on.</li>
            <li> We bought these to use on our Oral-B Sonic electric toothbrushes.  They fit perfectly and are MUCH cheaper than any other replacement heads we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit on the stiff side, so be aware, but the price is a lot better than the brand name. The bristles (in the past, anyway) soften a bit over time.</li>
            <li> great idea that didn&#x27;t work for my toothbrush. they were new in package. at this price I kept them for brushing the dogs teeth!</li>
            <li> The bristles seem to pull out but for the price it is okay.  I would buy them again mostly because they are cheap.</li>
            <li> They fit my toothbrush perfectly but seem to wear out 2x as fast as my real oral b heads.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy them again</li>
            <li> The new toothbrush heads are excellent value and appear to work as w ell as the OralB ones.  Time will tell if they last as long.</li>
            <li> These are a little harder in the bristle than the name brand and they start to shed some bristles when they wear out. However, for me, that&#x27;s a good thing because it helps me remember it&#x27;s time for a new hear.</li>
            <li> These brushes work and feel great.  They are an excellent value!  I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> These fit my toothbrush perfectly and are so much less expensive than the brand name.  They give me the same quality of cleaning as the brand name replacements did.</li>
            <li> Fits the brush.  Works like original.</li>
            <li> These are good heads.  They fit my sonicare tooth brush.  I think its the total care one.  The only reason I had to take a star off is because these are slightly smaller as far as how many bristles it has and the bristles are somewhat stiffer than original.  They will work though if you can&#x27;t find a replacement.</li>
            <li> It does fit my Oral-B Sonic toothbrush! Great buy diffidently going to tell a friend and buy this  Generic brand again!</li>
            <li> fitment a little off.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  The bristles started falling out the first time I used one. I would not recommend this specific brand to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find these on Amazon after having our dentist tell us where to shop for them. The original heads are no longer made and these are a great match to the original. Also, much cheaper in price. I am only on the first one so far and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Work great, especially for the price.  May not be quite as good as the original, but I&#x27;ve been using them for a while and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> Great Value and fit our Oral B toothbrush perfectly. What a great value.Really a great product and price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have the Oral B Vitality Sonic and they fit and work great. I had looked around and didn&#x27;t want to spend those high prices at local stores. A must buy for everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement product that is produced in Germany I believe.  The price is a fraction of what you will pay for the OEM replacement.  When I received them I opened them and attemted to place one on my Oral-B.  The first one I tried did not appear to fit and I was worried.  The second one fit perfectly.  So far have not experienced any other issues.  At the super low price even if a few of the package are duds it is still a good purchase.  I will update this review after I have tried a few more.</li>
            <li> the sample picture of the product shows the brush heads were made in Germany.  When I receive them they show they were made in China. They are too short for the base of the toothbrush, and they have to be forced on. The first one I tried to put on shattered into pieces.  The picture was deceiving.</li>
            <li> this were wrong ones we returned them and still waiting for refund the one we needed were braum its a older one so mabe they do not mak them any more</li>
            <li> I can read English and guess what? My brush says Sonic complete on the charger and these brushes DO NOT fit.  Oral-B make it very complicated. Just bought my kids some Phillips electric toothbrushes to avoid this headache in future.</li>
            <li> These were what I wanted. They arrived and fit my needs. There is not much more to say, since I haven&#x27;t used them yet. I can&#x27;t figure out why the manufacturer charges so much money for the heads. They do not look difficult to produce.</li>
            <li> Came before expected ship date.  Fits my Sonic Vitality just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap version of the original, but since it is almost impossible to get the original and&lt;br /&gt;with the extremely high price, I ordered these. It is difficult to get them on the toothbrush rotating&lt;br /&gt;head, but once you do, they do work. It is better than spending $$$$ for something you are&lt;br /&gt;supposed to replace every three months. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I read that the bristles were soft, but I figured I buy soft brushes anyways. Well, they are very soft. I&#x27;m not even too confident that they are not going to fall out. They are still usable, though. Also, the brush is smaller than the non-generic brushes. I&#x27;m not crazy about them, but they were cheap and I don&#x27;t have to buy a new electric toothbrush right away, so I am satisfied enough.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit snugly (1/5 inch space between bottom of brush and base) but it works fine and is a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> The replacement heads fit our brushes perfectly.  I have been using them for a month now and cannot tell the difference between the original and these generic replacements.  They are holding up well so far.  Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome, they work so good and the price is great.</li>
            <li> These do not fit the model they promised to fit.  I am returning them now! This was a total waste of time.</li>
            <li> II loked everywhere for replacement brushes for my Sonic Oral B toothbrush. No one carried the brush I needed. I looked in several stores for weeks but nothing worked. I even bought one I thought would work, but did not.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes did fit and are working fine.  The cost was less than a regular manual toothbrush!</li>
            <li> GREAT price , as expected , fits ,feels on e-brush, only had 1 bristle fall out in about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Price on original replacement heads was quite expensive so I looked at aftermarket versions. Found these and took a chance and I was pleasantly surprised. The heads fit great and the bristles- while not quite as stiff the original- worked fine. Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I thought I might have to buy a new sonic toothbrush because I could not find replacement heads. I am glad I decided to look on Amazon. They work fine. No problems with the fit (I have a Oral B Sonic Complete) and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These were a perfect fit at only 25% the cost. I am very pleased at the cost and quality of these replacement tips.</li>
            <li> So greatful I found these. Hadn&#x27;t been able to find them in stores anywhere. They fit perfectly and working well.</li>
            <li> Everything was Great ad Fast  one of the best purchases I ever made. I look for other items for purchase.</li>
            <li> I have the Sonic Complete and was having a difficult time finding replacement heads locally.  These brushes fit just fine and are very affordable compared to the original manufacturer.</li>
            <li> THEY DON&#x27;T FIT.  I ORDERED THE RIGHT ONES, BUT THEY DON&#x27;T MATCH MY TOOTH BRUSH HOLDER.  THE BOTTOM OF THE HEAD IS TO SMALL TO FIT MY HANDLE.</li>
            <li> I have two models of the Braun Oral B Vitality. Both have the same insert hole shape. Pull the brush head off your Oral B Vitality. Is the insert hole a rectangular shape with a small slit at approximately 4 o&#x27;clock (with the brush head facing upwards)? If so, there is ZERO COMPATIBILITY with these &#x27;replacement&#x27; toothbrush heads. The shape of the insert hole on these is a perfect circle of 0.5cm diameter. It will barely fit over the metal portion of your toothbrush base. This product will go straight in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Although these are generic, they fit just fine and seem to do the job of cleaning my teeth just fine. For the price, they are amazing.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, you get what you paid for</li>
            <li> Just like the brand name heads except maybe not as long-lasting, but with the price so much cheaper, I can live with that.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely and was extremely reasonably priced.  Have not used it enough to rate it yet.  Bristles are softer than the original brushes.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as replacement brush heads for my Oral B Sonic Complete toothbrush, when Oral B stopped making them. I tried the first one 3 months ago and as a toothbrush, it works. It is time to change the head, so I pulled it off my brush handle. The guts of the head came out of the brush head and are permanently affixed to my brush handle.The head refuses to detach from the handle. I had to take it into my workshop and remove it with a Dremel cutting tool, sawing through the plastic until only the metal post remained. I then attached a new head and tried to pull it off immediately. Guts came out. Now attached permanently to my brush handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are crap. This is the only replacement head you will ever use, as it is the LAST ONE you will ever be able to put on your toothbrush!! If you are considering buying these, you just need to realize that your Sonic Complete, like mine, is too old to keep. Time to suck it up and order a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I ordered these after reading the review on them on amazon.com and were advertised from Germany and arrived made in China.They fit my oral-b electric tooth brush but are smaller in the brush size and poor quality.</li>
            <li> We needed some replacements and found these.&lt;br /&gt;They work, but the bristles are a little stiffer than the ones we are used to.&lt;br /&gt;After using for several weeks, we&#x27;re used to them and at the fantastic price, will buy again.</li>
            <li> These fit great, but double check your model before you order.  The bristles did splay a little faster than OEM, but I also tend to apply a lot of pressure when I brush</li>
            <li> Amazing price compared to anywhere else.  Can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s generic.</li>
            <li> Heads are meant for the sonic brush, but they do not fit snugly to give the true &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action of the head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve uploaded pics of the old genuine toothbrush heads and this generic replacement.  There&#x27;s just no difference in size and fit.  I&#x27;ve only used the new replacement a couple of times, so no idea how long it will last, but it fits my toothbrush OK.  Considering how expensive the \\&quot;genuine\\&quot; replacement heads are, I&#x27;m very  happy with these generics.</li>
            <li> These are okay----Stiffer than the real Oral B brand and if you have sensitive teeth, be for warner, your gums might bleed. Stick with the real thing</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fit perfectly on my Oral B Sonic, which means that whenever I use them they make a vibrating noise. It&#x27;s not a problem, just a nuisance, but that&#x27;s why i gave them 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Oral-B Vitality Sonic--and you cannot beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;The quality isn&#x27;t fantastic, but my teeth end up clean.</li>
            <li> items stated it was german made but it actually is made in china I would not purchase again. False advertising to say the lest</li>
            <li> When I saw the advertisement for the sonic brushes at an incredibly low price, I was suspicious but ordered them.  I recommend them.  They fit my sonic toothbrush and were not of inferior  quality.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the generic would not fit. It is a perfect fit and works great. Good quality product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Oral B Sonic Complete.  And such a great value. I will buy again when in need of more refills.</li>
            <li> Ordered these and the next week my Oral B Sonic toothbrush died.  They don&#x27;t make that model any more.  So now I am stuck with all these replacement heads. Of course, that&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> worth the $.i&#x27;ll never pay full price again.i haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with this product yet .the bristles are holding up fine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with bristles falling out. They work just as well as the real thing at a fraction of the price. It did take about 3 weeks for the package to arrive from China, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I have thrown them away and gone back to the higher priced oral B. Don&#x27;t believe the other reviews that tell you there is in difference..there is. The bristles fall out, they are not cut evenly and it&#x27;s just a very poor imitation of the real thing. I learned that you just can&#x27;t skimp on quality with certain things. Dental hygiene is one of those things</li>
            <li> fast shipping. exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  The bristles aren&#x27;t even evenly cut on the brushes.  They rattle as well.  I am so disappointed that Oral-B doesn&#x27;t continue to make replacement heads for my sonic toothbrush and these are the only ones I can find.  You&#x27;d be better off buying another electric toothbrush than bothering with these things.  Trust me that they are expensive junk.</li>
            <li> Great price and they fit my device perfectly, arrived on schedule although a long period of time on the road.</li>
            <li> I looked for some time for the brushheads and was so happy when I finally found them and at a great price, too.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly on my Sonic Complete! Such a value compared to name brand!</li>
            <li> The brushes are good and so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Terribly soft and nothing like the OEM ones.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean teeth well. Had to buy brand.</li>
            <li> These are truly not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Made in Germany.  Seems to be an exact match.  Very good value.</li>
            <li> I was having a very difficult time finding these toothbrushes.  But these should last me for quite awhile.  I like the Oral B brushes, I just dislike that they build in obsolescence with that electric toothbrush.  I haven&#x27;t had it that long and already it is getting phased out.  But, thanks to Amazon, I found some to keep going for awhile longer.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> After not being able to find replacement toothbrush heads locally and refusing to pay the incredibly outrageous prices asked on other websites, I found and decided to try these.  Initial quality seems fine.  Rated as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; on the package, these seems to be reasonably hard - what I find to be a good quality.  I typically replace the toothbrush at 3 months and will update this with whether these brushes last that long.</li>
            <li> Good  product with excellent pricing.  A good value</li>
            <li> The price was excellent compared to other offers.  I paid much more in the past for original Oral B replacement heads.</li>
            <li> We checked the listing to make sure these replacement heads would fit our oral B toothbrush. Unfortunately they did not fit and we were past the 30 day return period. We were hoping they would fit as the original oral B heads are so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Glad we didn&#x27;t spend more on them. Not fitting when our model was listed as fitting was the reason I only gave 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Previously, I purchased replacement brushes for my Oral B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush from another manufacturer. They fir poorly and I ended up removing those brushes with a pliers.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes fit beautifully and the price is definitely right.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads do not come from Oral B but they are just as nice and well made!  They will last me a long time. I could not be happier and they didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg!!</li>
            <li> The product, of course, is not as good as the name-brand toothbrush heads, but they work well and get the job done. They were a value. It saved me from having to get a brand new set for $30 or more.</li>
            <li> These are good replacements, but don&#x27;t fit exactly like the original to me. But they work, and the price is much cheaper, especially if you have several users in the house. I have purchased several times.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with these heads. We have an older tooth brush and the heads can be impossible to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;They were just as described and got all 8 heads for less than the cost of 1 in a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding replacement brushes for my Sonic Complete, these fit perfectly.  I will definitely order again!!!!</li>
            <li> I love them and I am all about more for your money I definitely got that with this product.</li>
            <li> This does not fit the Oral B Vitality Sonic, as advertised. The replacement head got stuck half way down the metal prong and won&#x27;t move in either direction. Even with pliers. Cheap product.</li>
            <li> These fit my old Sonic Complete, although there is a small gap preventing them from seamlessly snapping in. So far, not a problem, and I will update review after a few weeks of use. The brushes are softer than the original Oral B&#x27;s, but I like that.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 2 pack, but received only one pack of four. I sent an email and within a week received a 2 pack, so I have 12 for the price of 8.&lt;br /&gt;So this is a very good seller.</li>
            <li> This is much more affordable than purchasing in my local store.  Target carries these, but two are the price of this entire pack.</li>
            <li> Same as original, good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who still uses this specific brand and was a little skeptical at first because in store or on Oral-B&#x27;s website a 4 pack was anywhere from 20-40 dollars. Needless to say I was blown away when I got this 8 pack for around 5 dollars and they completely work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a side note I have seen a lot of angry reviews that this product does not fit their -insert brand of electronic toothbrush- This is specifically for Oral-B sonic complete (Unfortunately even a slightly different Oral-B product might have a different brush head). The seller makes that clear with a picture of the original brush head so look at the picture if there is any doubt!</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than the BRAND. Works Great!</li>
            <li> Super value. Authentic Oral B replacement heads are very expensive. I&#x27;ve been using these and have no complaints. Buy them, and smile! :-)</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!!!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because of other reviews; but with the difference in price of $1/head for generic and $10/head for brand name, I felt that I had to at least try for myself. Comparing the bristles with the brand-name head I was replacing, there is definitely a difference in quality; but it didn&#x27;t seem to matter and definitely not enough to overcome the price difference. The head fit my Complete perfectly and brushing my teeth felt almost identical to my previous brush. I recommend them and will continue to buy the generic in the future.</li>
            <li> These are well worth the reasonable price.  Only drawback, they fit a tiny bit loosely on my toothbrush base and vibrate a little.  But they work just fine.  Now I can afford to replace my brush more often!</li>
            <li> Great deal! I loved the savings I get using amazon. Easy to navigate and use to purchase different items for great prices.</li>
            <li> works great and fits as described</li>
            <li> buy same thing as oral-b over price ones</li>
            <li> these replacement brushes are ok, they don&#x27;t last as long as the oral-b&#x27;s, but I sure can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Works great on my vitality sonic toothbruch!</li>
            <li> These are just what I have been looking for. Plug and use on my sonic toothbrush very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great values for the money. They are a little hard at first but after a few uses the bristles are a little softer.</li>
            <li> In regards to the gentlemen above.  This brush head does not even say PULSONIC ANYWHERE IN THIS LISTING.  Customers need to learn to be smart about their purchases and just because this says SONIC does not mean PULSONIC.  Those two models are 100% completely different and that is not the sellers fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE ORAL-B SONIC AND SONIC COMPLETE AND THESE FIT 100% JUST FINE.  IF YOU HAVE PULSONIC DO NOT PURCHASE LIKE THE IDIOT ABOVE ME.</li>
            <li> Works just fine! Perfect replacement heads!</li>
            <li> I have the Oral B Vitality Sonic and was dreading the high cost of replacment heads. The heads are not listed as compatible but after finding the Braun site and the listing for the 18-A heads I decided to order. Fit perfectly and for a fraction of the cost. The packaging is rather flimsy (the glue on the clear plastic to the cardboard backing had loosened on one pack) but the USPS was not gentle either.&lt;br /&gt;So the nitty gritty is:&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfect for units requiring 18-a heads (also lists 12-a but unable to verify)&lt;br /&gt;Bristles firmly attached&lt;br /&gt;Same quality as original&lt;br /&gt;side note; I was looking for a firmer bristle and these only come in &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; which compared to my old one is the &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works great - and lots cheaper than the Oral-B brand.</li>
            <li> Some fit and some do not fit.  It works well if it fits.  Anyway, it is so cheap.  As long as one or two work well, I regard it as a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have a sonic complete and was very excited to get these! Unfortunately... They don&#x27;t fit and now I have 8 heads that I can&#x27;t use. I have an older sonic complete... But the product stated it fit complete&#x27;s. A little bummed they didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> Exactly as described,  can&#x27;t believe how much cheaper this generic brand is and works just as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun toothbrush for about 4 years now.  It has been great.  I found these brushes on Amazon and was skeptical the first time I ordered them.  I admit the quality is not as good as the manufacturer brushes, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat them.  They work fine, maybe wear out a little faster, but you could use them 3 to 1 vs the name brand and still come out ahead.  The average use is way better than that.  If you get them be ready for a stray brush falling off every now and again, but that isn&#x27;t a problem for me in the least.  Some reviews comment on the brushes falling out, but I&#x27;ve been using these for about 3 years and I only experience a couple brushes falling out of maybe every 3rd or 4th brush head on average.</li>
            <li> Good product at a generic price. Very good response from vendor. Definitely will do business with them again.</li>
            <li> It fits very well and&lt;br /&gt;It looks strong enough to use three times a day for three months and the color is good.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes. They have a greater tendency to start to fray early in usage but have not fallen apart so they can be used and at a much lower rate of cost for the brush. A good money saver without much sacrifice on quality</li>
            <li> These work as advertised but seem to have a rattle inside I can&#x27;t solve.&lt;br /&gt;No big deal, The price was right and I would purchase again</li>
            <li> Decent product, will try something else next time. I have a cheapo sonicare and this is better, will go for higher end unit when I run out of spare heads</li>
            <li> I loved it. It is german printed and quality is the same if not better. I paid half a price and still cannot believe I got it.</li>
            <li> Bought these based upon the description, but without even opening the package I noticed the hole that the toothbrush connects into is circular on these heads, when the toothbrush itself is more rectangular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned the item for a refund, but paid for the return shipping myself.  I would suggest not trying to save the money as it&#x27;s likely to just be a useless exercise in frustration.</li>
            <li> Fits the toothbrush, but does not have the fading blue part that normally tells you when to switch after so many uses.</li>
            <li> Did not receive the Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush heads.  Received something else.</li>
            <li> These work great for me. Especially for the price!</li>
            <li> fits as designed. priced well considering i can&#x27;t even find replacement brushes anywhere, and if i did, they would cost at least $5-$12 each.</li>
            <li> These worked great with my system.</li>
            <li> The price on the generic Oral-B compatible toothbrush heads was outstanding. Got the shipment almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the bristles could be better. On the first head I used a couple of bristles popped loose after about a month. This is sad as the type of bristle is listed as US Dupont Tynex Bristle end-rounded bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that I didn&#x27;t catch the small print on the photo top left of the 8 heads that clearly says Soft Bristles. The bristles seem to be softening after less that 2 months. Fortunately, I can replace the heads quickly at the amazing low price. I will seriously rethink the generic oral-b compatibles that I use. See if I can use another manufacturer. These are sold from YOUTHPOWER through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like that I can afford this product.  I gave them 4 stars because the product is good, but bristles are soft and I would prefer them a bit firmer.  Delivery of product was good.</li>
            <li> These fit an Oral b Sonic Vitality brush, which is hard to find replacement heads for. They are a little harder than what I would call &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really even expect these to work on my Sonic Complete after getting them at such a good price. I have been using them for only about a month but so far I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about except that they are made in China.</li>
            <li> This is a good value.</li>
            <li> My husband is using these and says they are as good as the original equipment.  Very happy with the quality and price.</li>
            <li> For the price, these work great.</li>
            <li> I guess u get what u pay for, does not clean well. Don&#x27;t Buy this product, buy the manufactuer original.</li>
            <li> Item came in from Singapore but did not work on our sonics as advertised. Don&#x27;t buy these as they will not work.</li>
            <li> This looks like a good value purchase, nevertheless I haven&#x27;t unpacked it yet, so you better keep reading reviews. lol</li>
            <li> The replacement heads (generic) work just fine; however, they do not fit quite as tight as the OEM&#x27;s.  There is a slight vibration noise, a little annoying at first, but it does not seem to detract from the cleaning function!  I will buy from this seller again.  Compare $5.70 for 8 heads versus $21.00 for 3 OEM&#x27;s....</li>
            <li> I was about to ditch my electric toothbrush because of the expensive replacement heads when I found these.  These are very affordable,  The quality is also good.  I frankly can&#x27;t tell any difference between the brand name and these.  I use them with my Braun (Oral B) vitality sonic.</li>
            <li> This product is awful.  The heads do not fit properly on the toothbrush.  They either do not fit properly or else they are next to impossible to get off because they get wedged on.  It&#x27;s a great price but you get what you pay for.  It not worth paying for the shipping in order to return the items.</li>
            <li> Ships fast, item as described.</li>
            <li> Delivers what was advertised</li>
            <li> We were very happy with our purchase. I have been looking in the stores for the Oral-B replacement toothbrushes and they either don&#x27;t have them or they are very expensive. Good Deal!!!</li>
            <li> ************THESE DO NOT FIT PULSONIC *************** AND IF YOU BUY THEM AND OPEN THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY FIT THEY ARE NOT RETURNABLE.....AMAZON DOES A GREAT JOB!!&lt;br /&gt;bUT WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR PULSONIC REPLACEABLE HEADS THESE COME UP AND THEY&lt;br /&gt;SAY \\&quot;COMPATIBLE WITH ALL ORAL-B TOOTHBRUSHES\\&quot;+++++++++  THIS IS A SCAM AND&lt;br /&gt;YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THEM....http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008XBGNDG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> At first, the brush head was almost too snug, and I really had to pull to get it off. But, after a week or two of use, they go on and off just fine. Great deal for a hard-to-find item. I cannot speak yet as to how long they will last compared to the original Oral B product, but at this price, who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping wasn&#x27;t too bad, either, taking less than two weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> These are a great price, but the bristles are much softer than the real brand. It doesn&#x27;t feel like my teeth get as clean.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere else.  They&#x27;re not made by the original manufacturer, but they fit and work fine.  I have noticed some bristles falling out, but not enough to make a difference, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I believe these work just as well as those purchased in a store for much less. Even if they didn&#x27;t last as long I don&#x27;t need to feel guilty replacing them more often</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and is satisfactory, but must be changed twice as frequently as the name brand product.  So the cost about evens out.  Will probably revert to the original replacement product.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes arrived quickly. The brush head slides on and off easily.  So far brush quality is comparable to originals at much better price.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than replacement Braun Sonicare brand.  They fit perfectly in my Baun Sonicare toothbrush.  Will order again.  Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> I could not find my replacement brushes anywhere and thought I would have to get rid of the toothbrush, but these fit perfect and are as good as the name brand ones.</li>
            <li> Was surprised when I received the brush heads for my now extinct discontinued Oral B Sonic Complete Toothbrush. Replacements from Oral B are about 30 bucks for three. These were a little over 6 for eight!!&lt;br /&gt;They fit perfect, the only thing I notice is that there is no visible warning that the brush is getting worn, (wear indicator) The original will change colors when they are worn. No big deal, at that price I just change them every 6 months anyway!</li>
            <li> These are great! They fit well and clean my teeth. What more could you ask from a tooth brush. You can save so much money using these!</li>
            <li> Love this product - my second one!</li>
            <li> After two or three uses bristles were bent and curled over.  The OEM brand is more expensive, but takes 2-3 months of brushing before they start looking worn out.  I wouldn&#x27;t even use these bristles to clean the grout in my shower, let alone my precious teeth.  Save yourself the pain and expenses you&#x27;ll undoubtedly receive from dentist after using these, and pay for the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> works as intended, not as well built as the real ones, bristtles coming off after a few uses, but for the price, its a good buy</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price for value, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought both these, which were 8 brush heads for $8.94 and the single pack, which were 4 brush heads for $7.85, because I wasn&#x27;t sure what the difference was.  Lo and behold, they are the exact same thing.  For the price, you might as well buy the 2-pack.  HOWEVER, some of the brush heads don&#x27;t fit the toothbrush because they&#x27;re too tight.  Some of them do fit.  Also, the package indicates they are soft brushes, but they don&#x27;t seem very soft to me. They are not equivalent to the brand Oral B sonic brush heads, but, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find the originals anywhere.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 7.11.15 - First brush head only lasted 6 weeks....   Oral B advises that they don&#x27;t make these brush heads anymore.  My sonic brush uses Oral-B SR-18 replacement heads usually. Tried these generic ones and they&#x27;re ok, but not exactly like the same thing.  After brushing with these heads a few times: - the width of the brush head bristle coverage area is slightly more narrow than the real Oral-B heads.  When brushing teeth with these heads the plastic edges seem to &amp;#34;clank&amp;#34; against your teeth a little more often than the real ones.  See image of width comparison. - these brush heads don&#x27;t fit onto the metal post as far down as the real ones. Authentic has a slight gap as well.  Although the gap is just a hair taller then the real ones it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the brush head and doesn&#x27;t slide off the metal post with use. See images. - in looking/feeling the bristles I feel like these bristles are not going to last as long as the bristles used in the real heads. Although this is a slight issue, the current much lower cost of these heads could make this a non-issue.  Most important thing is that these brushheads clean your teeth well and just as good as original with same amount of brushing, and yes it does that.  So if above doesn&#x27;t matter these are ok to go get.</li>
            <li> THESE DO NOT FIT ORAL B VITALITY!  I WANT MY MONEY BACK! THESE SUCK REALLY, REALLY BAD BLAH BLAH BLAH.</li>
            <li> These generic toothbrush heads fit my old Oral-B electric toothbrush perfectly. They appear to be identical to the brand name brushes. Fit perfectly and work great. I&#x27;ve used almost all of the brushes that came in the package and haven&#x27;t had any problems with bristles falling out. They might be a tad softer then the originals but that&#x27;s fine with me. I will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> Cheap for a Reason! This product is not even close to the quality of the original. Not firm. Bristles fall out. Not as many bristles.</li>
            <li> Cheap and do no stay on. Bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> Great quantity with cheap price.</li>
            <li> does not work as advertised.  is not compatible with my Braun Vitality Brush Head.  I have contacted the seller and she responded that I can return but haven&#x27;t sent any instructions on how.</li>
            <li> Does not fit my oral b vitality sonic toothbrush.  Not eligible to return per Amazon.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Softer brussels than original.&lt;br /&gt;Wears out much faster.</li>
            <li> These were not compatible with Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li> Same product that I was buying before only this was much more economical.  I was having trouble finding brush heads in stores</li>
            <li> These brush heads are just great. These brush heads fit my oral b tooth brush and the quality is great.</li>
            <li> The Braun Vitality electric toothbrush is a reasonably priced item, but the replacement heads are a rip-off. These generic heads are a fraction of the cost and they work fine for me.</li>
            <li> These are made in Germany  and fit my Oral-B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush perfectly.  I couldn&#x27;t find replacement brushes for my model anywhere . This are under $12.00 for 8 brushes and I&#x27;m very happy with them. I&#x27;ll order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> works just as well as the name brand toothbrush heads for a fraction of the cost!  i am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these &amp;#34;knockoffs&amp;#34; were made in China.  I buy some stuff from China, but nothing that goes in my mouth.  No thanks.  Sticking with American made toothbrush heads.  Bought BBraun product.</li>
            <li> They work just fine and the price is right.</li>
            <li> One will work and the next will not go on or come off your brush very easily. Have had some get stuck or not even go on without having to push them very hard to go on the brush end.&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap but not half as good as the originals. Some loss of brushes and seem to not clean teeth as well as the real factory heads.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work just fine for a fraction of the cost. If you take the time to read what this product is and what product you have they&#x27;ll be compatible. The number of bristles, durability and fit are all fine without regard to price, which makes this a great deal. Quit whining and read what this product is meant to replace.</li>
            <li> These work well in my electric toothbrush.  A good value.</li>
            <li> Not bad, except some of the brushes wouldn&#x27;t fit very well</li>
            <li> This item works perfectly for my husband&#x27;s electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Work just as well as the Brand name. The blue on the bristles fades faster and have to replace head more often, but still much more cost effective.</li>
            <li> They brush, but not even closer to the original! You get what you pay for!  Wish I would have just spent a little bit more to get something a little better!</li>
