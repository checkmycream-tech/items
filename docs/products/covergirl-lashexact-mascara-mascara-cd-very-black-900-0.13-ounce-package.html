            <li>But it&#x27;s perfect for daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great!  </li>
            <li>Great, great product!</li>
            <li>It is really good!</li>
            <li>I wear contacts, so this is especially important to me.</li>
            <li>Great mascara.  </li>
            <li>Great price, great formula, love it!</li>
            <li>This mascara separates lashes well and gives good length.</li>
            <li>Good color.</li>
            <li>This is good mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many others, but this one works best for me.</li>
            <li>So glad I can still find it!</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li>Unless I&#x27;m going to go really high quality (like, Dior show), I figure that Covergirl and Maybelline will give me the best value for my money.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much, I have given ones out to some friends just so they can see for themselves how awesome it is.  </li>
            <li>It also comes off very easily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Then I became mascara companies&#x27; best friend as I went on a quest trying many different brands in order to duplicate the nice end result that I always had with the comb style applicator.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on and stays on.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>have used it for years as my all-time favorite.  </li>
            <li>#34;it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>I love this mascarra i have more than 3 years using it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>(For the lengthening, I still haven&#x27;t found anything better than Maybelline&#x27;s lash stilleto).</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are more moist than the norm and most mascaras, if they aren&#x27;t waterproof, will run.  </li>
            <li>And what more important for me can be easaly removed with the make up remover,</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, the container does a good job wiping off the brush as you pull it out to prevent clumps.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smear, and it comes off easily at night.</li>
            <li>mascara along with this for a perfect set of long and full lashes.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smear throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>The best mascara for everyday.</li>
            <li>This is a great basic mascara that I use in addition to a thickening mascara.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and separates my long lashes beautifully.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a tighter budget now, but even if I wasn&#x27;t, I personally find drugstore brand mascaras to be pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li>It goes on great, doesn&#x27;t clump, separates and elongates lashes and you can add more coats later (if you&#x27;re going out at night or whatever) without any flaking or other issues.  </li>
            <li>Fell apart right after opening it.  </li>
            <li>I originally, &#x27;back in the day,&#x27; used a comb-on style mascara for many years...</li>
            <li>I bought a three or four pack, and when I opened the first tube and used it a couple of times, I was thinking &amp;</li>
            <li>I have tried others to see if I like them better, but always come back to this mascara!</li>
            <li>Been buying this for years, and like most of us: it&#x27;s hard to find one you love</li>
            <li>The price was the specific reason that I picked this mascara over other comparable mascaras, and I think I got a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s really affordable is a bonus.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;  It didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my barely-there lashes.</li>
            <li>, I used to spend loads of time separating my lashes, and I really don&#x27;t with this mascara.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to struggle to remove it, unlike many other mascaras.</li>
            <li>I had not tried Lashexact before, but I&#x27;ve used many of the other Covergirl mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you want a lot of volume or longer lashes, you&#x27;d do better with other CG / Maybelline mascaras.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend if you want a solid mascara that&#x27;ll give you clean coverage.  </li>
            <li>My local stores for some reason have stopped carrying it and luckily I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Outside of work, and especially when I&#x27;m putting on my face for a night out, I prefer thicker coverage, especially with some lengthening, to bring out my eyes more.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A few years ago I tried this when I lost my then favorite mascara and continued to use it ever since.  </li>
            <li>Good, not great. ...</li>
            <li>It picks up the right amount of mascara from the tube, but not too much -- I haven&#x27;t had a single clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When freshly opened it goes on a little light, not in color but in texture but after using it a few times it gets better and slightly thicker.</li>
            <li>Although, since it has been discontinued in stores near me, I was using another brand.  </li>
            <li>This mascara works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>and I can get a fairly natural look, with just some definition around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The change is dramatic, I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried high end mascaras (Dior, Benefit, Clinique, you name it) and I always come back to Cover Girl.</li>
            <li>no dark circles in the morning.</li>
            <li>:  Compared to the other CG mascaras I&#x27;ve used, this one is not volumizing, and doesn&#x27;t thicken my lashes very much, even when I apply it by sweeping it back-and-forth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for making my lashes big and bold when I&#x27;m going out, but on an average day - going to work, shopping, etc</li>
            <li>But no other mascara grabs the individual lashes like this one.</li>

            <li> I really like this mascara, the container does a good job wiping off the brush as you pull it out to prevent clumps.  Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smear throughout the day.  I will definitely use again</li>

Great, great product!</li>
            <li> For years I used much more expensive mascaras.  A few years ago I tried this when I lost my then favorite mascara and continued to use it ever since.  I love the way it goes on and stays on.  It doesn&#x27;t clump at all.  When freshly opened it goes on a little light, not in color but in texture but after using it a few times it gets better and slightly thicker. My local stores for some reason have stopped carrying it and luckily I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good, not great. ...it&#x27;s CoverGril though, so you shouldn&#x27;t expect any miracles.</li>
            <li> This mascara works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes. I wear contacts, so this is especially important to me. I don&#x27;t usually wear eye makeup, so the result is pleasing to me. It&#x27;s probably not as dramatic as some products.</li>
            <li> The best mascara for everyday.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a mascara that is not clumpy, and doesn&#x27;t turn your lashes into tarantula legs, this is it! I&#x27;m all for making my lashes big and bold when I&#x27;m going out, but on an average day - going to work, shopping, etc - I use this mascara.</li>
            <li> Been buying this for years, and like most of us: it&#x27;s hard to find one you love and you don&#x27;t want to change once you do.  But I think CG is discontinuing it, cause now it&#x27;s hard to find.  Thank you, Amazon !</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. I&#x27;ve tried many, many others, but this one works best for me. It doesn&#x27;t smear, and it comes off easily at night. I don&#x27;t have to struggle to remove it, unlike many other mascaras. I don&#x27;t have raccoon eyes the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on well and isn&#x27;t clumpy. The fact that it&#x27;s really affordable is a bonus.</li>
            <li> It is really good! My eyelashes never looked soooo long. And what more important for me can be easaly removed with the make up remover, no dark circles in the morning. Just one small minus, comparing to the one I used before feels like my eyelashes are too dry and  harden.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to have a hard time finding this mascara...have used it for years as my all-time favorite.  I originally, &#x27;back in the day,&#x27; used a comb-on style mascara for many years...but it is almost impossible to find. Then I became mascara companies&#x27; best friend as I went on a quest trying many different brands in order to duplicate the nice end result that I always had with the comb style applicator.  This product is the winner.  The lashs do not clump together...but look terrific. As long as they sell it, I will buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought a three or four pack, and when I opened the first tube and used it a couple of times, I was thinking &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay...&amp;#34;  It didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my barely-there lashes. Now after using it for a few months though, I must say I underestimated this product. Maybe it is a crazy coincidence, but my lashes have been growing and been healthier since i switched to this mascara, so now that the mascara has something to work with, well it really works. And I have to admit, I used to spend loads of time separating my lashes, and I really don&#x27;t with this mascara. I plan to keep buying it!</li>
            <li> Fell apart right after opening it.  Tried to apply the mascara and the brush tip just broke off.  I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> Great mascara.  Getting harder to find locally.  So glad I can still find it!</li>
            <li> Great price, great formula, love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great basic mascara that I use in addition to a thickening mascara. This mascara separates lashes well and gives good length. The brush is plastic bristled so it doesn&#x27;t cause clumpy but won&#x27;t make your lashes &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; so I would definitely use something like Maybelline &amp;#34;Full N Soft&amp;#34; mascara along with this for a perfect set of long and full lashes.</li>
            <li> Works well. Good color.</li>
            <li> I love this mascarra i have more than 3 years using it</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite mascara.  Been using this brand and type for years.  I have tried others to see if I like them better, but always come back to this mascara!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!  It goes on smooth and separates my long lashes beautifully.  I will say that after about 10 applications or so, it will start to get a little clumpy.  The mascara will also last about a month with daily application.</li>
            <li> The change is dramatic, I liked it.  Next time I would buy a dark brown instead of black.</li>
            <li> So hard to find this mascara anywhere. I love it. I&#x27;ve tried high end mascaras (Dior, Benefit, Clinique, you name it) and I always come back to Cover Girl. Go figure!</li>
            <li> This is good mascara.  I used to buy higher-end mascaras, in the $10 to $25 range.  I&#x27;m on a tighter budget now, but even if I wasn&#x27;t, I personally find drugstore brand mascaras to be pretty darn good.  Unless I&#x27;m going to go really high quality (like, Dior show), I figure that Covergirl and Maybelline will give me the best value for my money.  I had not tried Lashexact before, but I&#x27;ve used many of the other Covergirl mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GENERAL IMPRESSION:  I like this mascara a lot, for work purposes.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and I can get a fairly natural look, with just some definition around my eyes.  It also comes off very easily at the end of the day.  It&#x27;s not heavy on my eyes and hasn&#x27;t been irritating to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of work, and especially when I&#x27;m putting on my face for a night out, I prefer thicker coverage, especially with some lengthening, to bring out my eyes more.  I won&#x27;t use this mascara for those nights out.  But it&#x27;s perfect for daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VOLUME:  Compared to the other CG mascaras I&#x27;ve used, this one is not volumizing, and doesn&#x27;t thicken my lashes very much, even when I apply it by sweeping it back-and-forth and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRUSH:  Great!  It picks up the right amount of mascara from the tube, but not too much -- I haven&#x27;t had a single clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE:  Can&#x27;t be beat, especially with subscribe &amp; save.  The price was the specific reason that I picked this mascara over other comparable mascaras, and I think I got a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend if you want a solid mascara that&#x27;ll give you clean coverage.  It you want a lot of volume or longer lashes, you&#x27;d do better with other CG / Maybelline mascaras.  (For the lengthening, I still haven&#x27;t found anything better than Maybelline&#x27;s lash stilleto).</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I can no longer find it in the store, so when I found it at Amazon I bought 4.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl Lashexact for quite a while and the reason is it does not run.  My eyes are more moist than the norm and most mascaras, if they aren&#x27;t waterproof, will run.  I do use the waterproof CoverGirl when I&#x27;m traveling as it will stay on for days.  But it&#x27;s difficult to remove.  Highly recommend.</li>
