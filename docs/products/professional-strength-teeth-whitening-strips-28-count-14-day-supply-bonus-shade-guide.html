            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>so nice!</li>
            <li>I used to buy many products for whitening, but for some reason, this works perfectly!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m thrilled to see what 14 will be!</li>
            <li>Very effective teeth whitening system for a good price.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, work great and cheap!</li>
            <li>These are the best and most cost effective  strips I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the good reviews, but now that I have them in hand</li>
            <li>They work just as good as any name brand whitening system.</li>
            <li>Work well, stay on good.</li>
            <li>Anyway so I settled on these and was delighted by the results and the added spearmint flavoring that&#x27;s added to the strips.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get as good of results as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I have seen good results after about a week.</li>
            <li>Plenty of people have given these a good review, so</li>
            <li>You just don&#x27;t know if you are getting a good product</li>
            <li>no expiration date printed, the result is not so good</li>
            <li>I have not heard of this brand of whitening strips before but the price was so good</li>
            <li>my teeth are a good 2-3 shades lighter.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work good.</li>
            <li>Good product I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this product is great!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>Better quality at a lower price!</li>
            <li>so, so glad I ordered these!  </li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, they stick well, and there was never any pain as some reviewers experienced.</li>
            <li>very cost effective and great product!!</li>
            <li>I have never used any kind of whitening strips or gels or anything, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare...</li>
            <li>My friends loved it :-)</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;d followed the suggested use I&#x27;d have nice white-white teeth.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff.</li>
            <li>Great product and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>These are very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and results can be seen almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for the price, they don&#x27;t stick as well as say Crest strips but for the price they get the job done!</li>
            <li>and the brown stains are coming off more and more each day!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect such a great result!</li>
            <li>most of the strips had no product on them.</li>
            <li>However, the gel stays on your teeth but swishing your teeth with water will get rid of it :).</li>
            <li>Much better than the Crest strips.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed that I saw a visible difference after only one use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a whitening pen/brush works much better</li>
            <li>These work great and much cheaper than others.</li>
            <li>I just stocked up on two more orders. :)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased ...</li>
            <li>Love this whitening gel ...</li>
            <li>These are great and work fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to pay more for the Crest strips since I know they are approved to be sold in the US and have been through testing</li>
            <li>It does whiten but not at top level.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s OK - sort</li>
            <li>I like these strips and they are better cost than Crest.</li>
            <li>Way better then the tray days.</li>
            <li>Planning on ordering another one. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better with toothpaste.</li>
            <li>These work great and are so much cheaper than what you can buy at the store.  </li>
            <li>So I love my coffee.</li>
            <li>REALLLLY love these.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a great price for a good product.</li>
            <li>I love how they helped made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>They are kind of cheap.  </li>
            <li>Seemed it worked okay for people like</li>
            <li>Performed just as well as name-brand products, but for a notable discount.</li>
            <li>I bought these mostly because of the price.  </li>
            <li>They are okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to write a review about how well they worked or didn&#x27;t -</li>
            <li>Sometimes there is more solution on the plastic part and the product does not work.</li>
            <li>Wish they would inventory it better and send a product that does work.  </li>
            <li>It helps the strip stick better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a quarter of the cost, just as many strips</li>
            <li>This helped my lipstick obsession even more.</li>
            <li>Be sure to brush your teeth before the application.</li>
            <li>I order many things from amazon and never write reviews, but it was imperative I write one for this product.</li>
            <li>Im pleased that I took the cheaper plunge and tried them out.</li>
            <li>but I dont know the actual reason just happy they dont!</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy this again :-)</li>
            <li>Most days it looked like my teeth were more stained than before I started using the strips.</li>
            <li>I will buy these again for sure.</li>
            <li>They leave goo on my teeth but work ok for whitening</li>
            <li>but nonetheless, they look better.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this whitening treatment is the ease of use.</li>
            <li>my teeth are clean &amp; whiter than most!</li>
            <li>I am super pleased with these strips!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>but overall very good product.</li>
            <li>Maybe if Amazing Smile reads this, they will refund my money........</li>
            <li>Whitened great and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>When I take them off, my teeth are incredibly gooey and gross, but I just take my toothbrush and brush off the goo from the strips.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them, they worked for me and that was important because it wasn&#x27;t a known brand for me.</li>
            <li>makes me gag because of the gel and makes my mouth very watery but over all good product</li>
            <li>good price but really hurt my teeth when I used after 2 days</li>
            <li>I use these once a week and my teeth are easily three to four shades lighter.</li>
            <li>For this price and how easy it is to put them on</li>
            <li>Could be they are not as strong</li>
            <li>I will say I achieved a slight whiter shade from when I started, but nothing to write an excellent review or give the product a 5 star rating!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, item as described!</li>
            <li>Thank you for the super quality!</li>
            <li>That made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the whitening guide that&#x27;s included</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are cheap and pop at you because of it.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use again.</li>
            <li>They are great I can notice a big difference.</li>
            <li>They do a fantastic job at sticking to your finger or your lips, but not your teeth.</li>
            <li>It is because these are cheaply made and dont work.</li>
            <li>This was a much better solution and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Only thing is, they do not stick that great, after about 20 mins</li>
            <li>I completed the 14 day treatment and honestly I did not see much difference in a whiter shade for my teeth.</li>
            <li>* Good for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It worked just fine, the strips are easy to use and quick to apply.</li>
            <li>Most people seem to rave about this product and say they notice a difference right away but after using these strips for 5 days I can&#x27;t say I see any difference at all yet....</li>
            <li>they worked very well!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I tried this product based on the reviews and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The new set is easier to use, and somewhat effective in whitening.</li>
            <li>I removed one star because the strips don&#x27;t remove cleanly from the teeth -</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy more when I am done with this pack.</li>
            <li>shipping was quick and I was so excited to use these.</li>
            <li>I recommend these to anyone who wants beautiful white teeth without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li>They are every bit as good as crest white strips at about 1/4 of the price.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this, I used this while in the tanning bed smiling the whole time.</li>
            <li>Great product cheaper than the more expensive products but equally effective as crest products will def get these again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve heard they can be very damaging to teeth and cause pain for many people.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheap and worth</li>
            <li>Not a bad choice at all.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all for the price.</li>
            <li>My 12-year-old even complimented me on my teeth, asked to use them and the confidence he has in his smile now is so worth it!</li>
            <li>The first time I bought these whitening strips, they worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I found the whitening to be very satisfactory, and I only experienced mild post-whitening sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing and works really well and fast.</li>
            <li>I feel very confident smiling, I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>They work great and are just as good as the more expensive brands and professional ones from my dentist.</li>
            <li>Great value and half the price of Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>and they work really well!!</li>
            <li>These took a while to arrive but they are worth the price.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I am amazed and will definitely repurchase these.</li>
            <li>For the price, I think these are worth a try.</li>
            <li>I use these every six months and feel it is worth the money and the time.</li>
            <li>My smile looks brighter.</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>They are 15,00 $ worth of beauty.</li>
            <li>The issue with that is you have some gel left over after you take them off, but honestly just grab your tooth brush and scrub it off.</li>
            <li>however I thought that for the price it was worth me giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>Worth the pain.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop checking my smile in the mirror.</li>
            <li>Very low cost, kind of flimsy product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price and time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>Even being very gentle, I have been lucky to preserve 50% of the gel on the strip before getting it onto my teeth.</li>
            <li>They worked just as good as any other I have used.</li>
            <li>whitened quite well, tasted good compared to other strips, stayed on well&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased the Crest whitestrips but wish that I just purchased those right away instead of going for the cheaper option.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine how nice my teeth will look after I use up the whole pack!</li>
            <li>Ok so I usually use the crest kind,and was kind of iffy about ordering these strips</li>
            <li>The texture of the strips is strange and kind of glides</li>
            <li>Only a couple days in but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Because of all this I have extremely sensitive teeth (and super stained!)</li>
            <li>I noticed results after my first application.</li>
            <li>And, with only five days in I noticed a lot more difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>and I could see results after the first use.</li>
            <li>Even after the FIRST use.</li>
            <li>However, the second batch I got couldn&#x27;t do their work because most of the whitening gel would stay on the packet when I peeled them off.</li>
            <li>I bought it and my teeth didn&#x27;t get more white.</li>
            <li>Invest in the higher price HIGHER quality product</li>
            <li>I have 2 more left to go</li>
            <li>I love sugar, just like the next person.</li>
            <li>At first I used them every day; first I brush my teeth and then put this one for 30 minutes, and then floss..</li>
            <li>They do irritate my teeth if I use them more than once a week, but they do their job quite well with only that one use.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I had ever tried whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no expiration date on the package - but when opening each individual packet, most if not all of the gel stays on the plastic cover and not on the strips themselves</li>
            <li>, so when I tried the Crest product many years ago, not only did it not work</li>
            <li>The top strip fell apart in my fingers and into several pieces when I tried to put it on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I saw an improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>I also used name-brand strips and this is my first time using a generic-ish brand.</li>
            <li>They also irritated my gums for the first 2-3 days, but that subsided.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve suffered with Bulimia for the last 5 years, you can imagine the damage done to my teeth &amp; the yellowing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was first going to do the crest Whiting</li>
            <li>The last thing I want is more damage to my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re brighter, and I&#x27;ve noticed after the first try.</li>
            <li>but I really needed to let the world know about these!  </li>
            <li>As an avid tea, coffee, and wine drinker, my teeth have always been pretty stained ever since I was a kid.  </li>
            <li>I saw results after my first treatment.</li>
            <li>Was hesitant at first but they really do work!</li>
            <li>My teeth where getting very yellow since i was drinking more coffee</li>
            <li>, so i got these and stopped drinking as much coffee and voila!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more when i run out.</li>
            <li>As good as Crest strips for a lot less money!</li>
            <li>They stick to teeth well, not too harsh for sensitive teeth/gums, and the price is pretty great.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look great after using this product for the very small price of this product.</li>
            <li>The price was awesome and they worked just as good if not better than the expensive crest strips.</li>
            <li>But they didn&#x27;t do much and my teeth were more white than not to begin with.</li>
            <li>My teeth aren&#x27;t even super noticeably sensitive either!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how anyone could give these a positive review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other methods of whitening, mainly pens and those moth guard-looking contraptions full of gel, but my nerves would get the better of me</li>
            <li>I decided to make it a once a week thing, and it&#x27;s done a super mild job at getting rid of the yellow.</li>
            <li>They got a lot whiter right after taking off the strip but in the morning my teeth were back to their original color as if I hadn&#x27;t whitened them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love dark lipstick colors and in order to wear lipstick and look elegant your teeth must be some shade of white.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stick to your bottom teeth very well, but it helps to make sure your teeth are dry before you put it on.</li>
            <li>The product worked good, I saw a slight difference but it made my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>I purchased these based on the reviews at the time -- it was a cheaper alternative to Crest 3D White Strips, which were great but a little pricey.  </li>
            <li>They work very well.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I cannot believe they are really user verified.</li>
            <li>These strips do not stick to your teeth very well</li>
            <li>These work very well at a fraction of the cost of competitive brands.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!  </li>
            <li>Looks promising.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very stained teeth..</li>
            <li>Also, the strips don&#x27;t always stay on very well</li>

            <li>/&gt;Original Review Oct 2013: For the price I thought this may be a risk in quality - but no, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>I bought these and used them for 10 days straight.  </li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with these.</li>
            <li>These strips really worked.</li>
            <li>My teeth are so much whiter.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as sticky as they could be as others have mentioned, and I have an issue of a permanent bar on the back of my lower teeth, but after a couple minutes they fit well.  </li>
            <li>The gel isn&#x27;t squishy and likely to be swallowed, which is important if you&#x27;re inclined to try and swallow it like I am.  </li>
            <li>These strips work very well.</li>
            <li>Did not do much of a difference on my teeth.</li>
            <li>(rhymes with high art)!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even have to finish the whole 14-day pack.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as good as the more expensive teeth whitening products, but it still whitens the teeth considerably.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for the product based off of the reviews, but I saw no improvement and now my teeth are super sensitive as before they were not.</li>
            <li>Just as good as Crest Whitestrips if not better!</li>
            <li>It surely does and at a fraction of the price of other whitening agents.</li>
            <li>and this product hasn&#x27;t been able to touch it; then, like other reviewers, I have had problems with the flimsy strips peeling off and leaving the gel on the backing.</li>
            <li>and this product hasn&#x27;t been able to touch it; then, like other reviewers, I have had problems with the flimsy strips peeling off and leaving the gel on the backing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the active ingredients are comparable to more other name-brand products, but the problem is that the adhesive portion of the strips sticks to the packaging as you pull it off.</li>
            <li>They really cling to your teeth nicely and don&#x27;t slip around on your teeth, which has been a problem for me in the past.</li>
            <li>Easy fix though, just squish the strips around until they are loose then pull them off.</li>
            <li>Also, my teeth are super sensitive and I use sensitive toothpaste every day.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m actually surprised that they work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>As fate would have it, I&#x27;ve come into possession of another package of these, and they perform quite a bit better than the original pack I reviewed, which must have been left out in the Venusian sun for a few months.  </li>
            <li>Left my teeth splotchy, did not stay on teeth, and results seemed to fade as quickly as they appeared.</li>
            <li>These worked for me briefly, but then quickly faded.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive whitening strips, and sure they work...but for $30.00?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever trued that are way more expensive.</li>
            <li>I did not have the money to pay the high price charged by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they were exposed to high heat in shipping or what, but they are not usable.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended this product to anyone in need teeth whiting.</li>
            <li>I was pretty nervous to try these after hearing so many people talk about tooth/gum sensitivity when using other brands of white strips.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s after only the first use!  </li>
            <li>Instead, because of my fear of the affect on my sensitive teeth, I was really conservative with the use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that much of a result because of the price, but it surprised me.</li>
            <li>These are just as good if not better than every crest white strip I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I received many a few compliments already in just a weeks use.</li>
            <li>I used the full 14 days worth without missing any days.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of these whitening strips before but decided to give them a try, they really work good, they seem to stay in place very well until you take them off, I like that they are very thin</li>
            <li>I am always looking to try new techniques for teeth whitening, whether its an at home concoction, tooth paste, or strip.</li>
            <li>but I live in Ukraine</li>
            <li>They are definitely not &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality though, and I&#x27;ve had to be careful peeling the strips from the backing to be sure the whitening gel goes with the strip and not the backing.  </li>
            <li>* Decent &amp; natural looking whitening</li>
            <li>My teeth were a little more sensitive than usual though nothing that was more than a bit of an annoyance.  </li>
            <li>And I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>after 1 use my teeth are very sensitive now.</li>
            <li>Not sure how well it whitens since I didn&#x27;t use it more than once.</li>
            <li>Seem pretty generic.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the second I took it off the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used whitening strips so many times in the past and have NEVER had an issue with getting them on.</li>
            <li>as her smile is as white as always, i&#x27;m assuming they work very well and, as she buys them regularly, she likes their performance.</li>
            <li>After only 15 minutes into my first time using these, I could tell a visible difference looking in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>the adhesive used isn&#x27;t as tenacious as on the more expensive ones, so these feel a little more slippery, but they&#x27;re worth the $.</li>
            <li>they did not make my teeth sensitive, and if the strips are too long or big they can easily be cut.</li>
            <li>Not only are they 1/3 the price of high quality whitening strips, but they work twice as fast.</li>
            <li>Teeth were a tiny bit sensitive after first use but that happens when I have used the Crest ones as well.</li>
            <li>I am definitely satisfied with my choice to use these over a typical commercial brand.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that for me, my gums got a little tender; but I switched to once a day and it was fine after that!</li>
            <li>The strips don&#x27;t stay put super well, but neither do the basic Crest White Strips, which are 3 times the cost.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the bottom ones are a little stupid and don&#x27;t work as well at the top ones, But over all im very very satisfied and am planning on ordering more soon .</li>
            <li>I usually buy Crest strips but these have no disappointed!</li>
            <li>Worked as well as crest white strips, only they didn&#x27;t get my teeth as white as the crest ones, they fit exactly the same</li>
            <li>This is amazing and the price is unbelievable!!</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this product, $13 sounds reasonable, and the reviews weren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li>I will never again purchase Crest White strips again because they&#x27;re just too expensive and this product is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>the product was dry.the strips were like a piece of clear paper..</li>
            <li>and I use these sort of products frequently.</li>
            <li>makes my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>I have old teeth</li>
            <li>these strips make my old teeth look young.</li>
            <li>When I have a big event or a date, I&#x27;ll put the strips on while I&#x27;m getting ready and leave them on for about 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>you can actually wear them and nobody really notices.</li>
            <li>Our teeth were whiter, but sensitive.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t get that far, because I can&#x27;t get them on my teeth.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old sobrina could do this in her sleep.</li>
            <li>These strips does not work, do not waste your time buying and trying them.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00BR0H6KY Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Strips 28</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but difficult to get out of  the  outer foil packaging.</li>
            <li>I love that the application is for only 14 days versus the 30 days I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>This means that you have less adhesive for your teeth and the strips fall off really quick as a consequence.</li>
            <li>My only &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34; would be that there is a particular spot on one of my teeth that&#x27;s somehow been stained brown for years</li>
            <li>My only &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34; would be that there is a particular spot on one of my teeth that&#x27;s somehow been stained brown for years</li>
            <li>They will make your teeth very sensitive, especially if you already have sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fillings in my front teeth and lately they are becoming brownish colored</li>
            <li>After a 30-minute treatment each night, my teeth were noticably whiter immediately but back to normal by morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty shocked to see so many positive reviews for these things, which are a joke.  </li>
            <li>, Crest White Strips work good, but have gotten too expensive...</li>
            <li>I think they might have also made my gums pretty sensitive, but it also could have just been my new toothbrush, not sure</li>
            <li>These are definitely a cheaper alternative to most whitening strips and I have found them to work the same , if not better, than the expensive kind.</li>
            <li>Also, most of the strips will not come out of the individual metallized packing without some serious effort.  </li>
            <li>and I can barely talk</li>
            <li>Product was reasonably priced but did not work as well as expected.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is it leaves my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so surprised that they actually work this well.</li>
            <li>This product has immediate results, just as I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;But the quality of the bands is kind of weird.</li>
            <li>Second is these are not really that strong, i can tell because there is zero sensitivity - compared to the Crest and there is way less foaming.  </li>
            <li>They also weakened the enamel in my teeth and one week after using them I had several major stains on my teeth that were never there before.</li>
            <li>There was a slight improvement after the first use, though I only kept them on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It also allowed me to keep them on for the whole 30 minutes because I was laying down and wasn&#x27;t keeping my mouth closed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the effort to repackage and send them back.</li>
            <li>Did cause mild sensitivity, but that is common and happened when I tried name-brand as well.</li>
            <li>Got my money&#x27;s worth and they do work to whiten teeth just hard to use.</li>

            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> so nice!</li>
            <li> I used to buy many products for whitening, but for some reason, this works perfectly!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m thrilled to see what 14 will be!</li>
            <li> Very effective teeth whitening system for a good price.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, work great and cheap!</li>
            <li> These are the best and most cost effective  strips I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews, but now that I have them in hand</li>
            <li> They work just as good as any name brand whitening system.</li>
            <li> Work well, stay on good.</li>
            <li> Anyway so I settled on these and was delighted by the results and the added spearmint flavoring that&#x27;s added to the strips.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get as good of results as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I have seen good results after about a week.</li>
            <li> Plenty of people have given these a good review, so</li>
            <li> You just don&#x27;t know if you are getting a good product</li>
            <li> no expiration date printed, the result is not so good</li>
            <li> I have not heard of this brand of whitening strips before but the price was so good</li>
            <li> my teeth are a good 2-3 shades lighter.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work good.</li>
            <li> Good product I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product is great!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> Better quality at a lower price!</li>
            <li> so, so glad I ordered these!  </li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, they stick well, and there was never any pain as some reviewers experienced.</li>
            <li> very cost effective and great product!!</li>
            <li> I have never used any kind of whitening strips or gels or anything, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare...</li>
            <li> My friends loved it :-)</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;d followed the suggested use I&#x27;d have nice white-white teeth.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> These are very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and results can be seen almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price, they don&#x27;t stick as well as say Crest strips but for the price they get the job done!</li>
            <li> and the brown stains are coming off more and more each day!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect such a great result!</li>
            <li> most of the strips had no product on them.</li>
            <li> However, the gel stays on your teeth but swishing your teeth with water will get rid of it :).</li>
            <li> Much better than the Crest strips.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed that I saw a visible difference after only one use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a whitening pen/brush works much better</li>
            <li> These work great and much cheaper than others.</li>
            <li> I just stocked up on two more orders. :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased ...</li>
            <li> Love this whitening gel ...</li>
            <li> These are great and work fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to pay more for the Crest strips since I know they are approved to be sold in the US and have been through testing</li>
            <li> It does whiten but not at top level.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s OK - sort</li>
            <li> I like these strips and they are better cost than Crest.</li>
            <li> Way better then the tray days.</li>
            <li> Planning on ordering another one. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better with toothpaste.</li>
            <li> These work great and are so much cheaper than what you can buy at the store.  </li>
            <li> So I love my coffee.</li>
            <li> REALLLLY love these.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a great price for a good product.</li>
            <li> I love how they helped made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> They are kind of cheap.  </li>
            <li> Seemed it worked okay for people like</li>
            <li> Performed just as well as name-brand products, but for a notable discount.</li>
            <li> I bought these mostly because of the price.  </li>
            <li> They are okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to write a review about how well they worked or didn&#x27;t -</li>
            <li> Sometimes there is more solution on the plastic part and the product does not work.</li>
            <li> Wish they would inventory it better and send a product that does work.  </li>
            <li> It helps the strip stick better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a quarter of the cost, just as many strips</li>
            <li> This helped my lipstick obsession even more.</li>
            <li> Be sure to brush your teeth before the application.</li>
            <li> I order many things from amazon and never write reviews, but it was imperative I write one for this product.</li>
            <li> Im pleased that I took the cheaper plunge and tried them out.</li>
            <li> but I dont know the actual reason just happy they dont!</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this again :-)</li>
            <li> Most days it looked like my teeth were more stained than before I started using the strips.</li>
            <li> I will buy these again for sure.</li>
            <li> They leave goo on my teeth but work ok for whitening</li>
            <li> but nonetheless, they look better.</li>
            <li> What I like most about this whitening treatment is the ease of use.</li>
            <li> my teeth are clean &amp; whiter than most!</li>
            <li> I am super pleased with these strips!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> but overall very good product.</li>
            <li> Maybe if Amazing Smile reads this, they will refund my money........</li>
            <li> Whitened great and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> When I take them off, my teeth are incredibly gooey and gross, but I just take my toothbrush and brush off the goo from the strips.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them, they worked for me and that was important because it wasn&#x27;t a known brand for me.</li>
            <li> makes me gag because of the gel and makes my mouth very watery but over all good product</li>
            <li> good price but really hurt my teeth when I used after 2 days</li>
            <li> I use these once a week and my teeth are easily three to four shades lighter.</li>
            <li> For this price and how easy it is to put them on</li>
            <li> Could be they are not as strong</li>
            <li> I will say I achieved a slight whiter shade from when I started, but nothing to write an excellent review or give the product a 5 star rating!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, item as described!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the super quality!</li>
            <li> That made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the whitening guide that&#x27;s included</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are cheap and pop at you because of it.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use again.</li>
            <li> They are great I can notice a big difference.</li>
            <li> They do a fantastic job at sticking to your finger or your lips, but not your teeth.</li>
            <li> It is because these are cheaply made and dont work.</li>
            <li> This was a much better solution and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Only thing is, they do not stick that great, after about 20 mins</li>
            <li> I completed the 14 day treatment and honestly I did not see much difference in a whiter shade for my teeth.</li>
            <li> * Good for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It worked just fine, the strips are easy to use and quick to apply.</li>
            <li> Most people seem to rave about this product and say they notice a difference right away but after using these strips for 5 days I can&#x27;t say I see any difference at all yet....</li>
            <li> they worked very well!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on the reviews and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The new set is easier to use, and somewhat effective in whitening.</li>
            <li> I removed one star because the strips don&#x27;t remove cleanly from the teeth -</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy more when I am done with this pack.</li>
            <li> shipping was quick and I was so excited to use these.</li>
            <li> I recommend these to anyone who wants beautiful white teeth without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> They are every bit as good as crest white strips at about 1/4 of the price.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this, I used this while in the tanning bed smiling the whole time.</li>
            <li> Great product cheaper than the more expensive products but equally effective as crest products will def get these again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve heard they can be very damaging to teeth and cause pain for many people.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheap and worth</li>
            <li> Not a bad choice at all.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for the price.</li>
            <li> My 12-year-old even complimented me on my teeth, asked to use them and the confidence he has in his smile now is so worth it!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought these whitening strips, they worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I found the whitening to be very satisfactory, and I only experienced mild post-whitening sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing and works really well and fast.</li>
            <li> I feel very confident smiling, I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> They work great and are just as good as the more expensive brands and professional ones from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Great value and half the price of Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> and they work really well!!</li>
            <li> These took a while to arrive but they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am amazed and will definitely repurchase these.</li>
            <li> For the price, I think these are worth a try.</li>
            <li> I use these every six months and feel it is worth the money and the time.</li>
            <li> My smile looks brighter.</li>
            <li> So worth it.</li>
            <li> They are 15,00 $ worth of beauty.</li>
            <li> The issue with that is you have some gel left over after you take them off, but honestly just grab your tooth brush and scrub it off.</li>
            <li> however I thought that for the price it was worth me giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> Worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop checking my smile in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Very low cost, kind of flimsy product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price and time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> Even being very gentle, I have been lucky to preserve 50% of the gel on the strip before getting it onto my teeth.</li>
            <li> They worked just as good as any other I have used.</li>
            <li> whitened quite well, tasted good compared to other strips, stayed on well&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the Crest whitestrips but wish that I just purchased those right away instead of going for the cheaper option.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how nice my teeth will look after I use up the whole pack!</li>
            <li> Ok so I usually use the crest kind,and was kind of iffy about ordering these strips</li>
            <li> The texture of the strips is strange and kind of glides</li>
            <li> Only a couple days in but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Because of all this I have extremely sensitive teeth (and super stained!)</li>
            <li> I noticed results after my first application.</li>
            <li> And, with only five days in I noticed a lot more difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I could see results after the first use.</li>
            <li> Even after the FIRST use.</li>
            <li> However, the second batch I got couldn&#x27;t do their work because most of the whitening gel would stay on the packet when I peeled them off.</li>
            <li> I bought it and my teeth didn&#x27;t get more white.</li>
            <li> Invest in the higher price HIGHER quality product</li>
            <li> I have 2 more left to go</li>
            <li> I love sugar, just like the next person.</li>
            <li> At first I used them every day; first I brush my teeth and then put this one for 30 minutes, and then floss..</li>
            <li> They do irritate my teeth if I use them more than once a week, but they do their job quite well with only that one use.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I had ever tried whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no expiration date on the package - but when opening each individual packet, most if not all of the gel stays on the plastic cover and not on the strips themselves</li>
            <li> , so when I tried the Crest product many years ago, not only did it not work</li>
            <li> The top strip fell apart in my fingers and into several pieces when I tried to put it on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I saw an improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> I also used name-brand strips and this is my first time using a generic-ish brand.</li>
            <li> They also irritated my gums for the first 2-3 days, but that subsided.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve suffered with Bulimia for the last 5 years, you can imagine the damage done to my teeth &amp; the yellowing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was first going to do the crest Whiting</li>
            <li> The last thing I want is more damage to my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re brighter, and I&#x27;ve noticed after the first try.</li>
            <li> but I really needed to let the world know about these!  </li>
            <li> As an avid tea, coffee, and wine drinker, my teeth have always been pretty stained ever since I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> I saw results after my first treatment.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant at first but they really do work!</li>
            <li> My teeth where getting very yellow since i was drinking more coffee</li>
            <li> , so i got these and stopped drinking as much coffee and voila!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more when i run out.</li>
            <li> As good as Crest strips for a lot less money!</li>
            <li> They stick to teeth well, not too harsh for sensitive teeth/gums, and the price is pretty great.  </li>
            <li> My teeth look great after using this product for the very small price of this product.</li>
            <li> The price was awesome and they worked just as good if not better than the expensive crest strips.</li>
            <li> But they didn&#x27;t do much and my teeth were more white than not to begin with.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t even super noticeably sensitive either!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how anyone could give these a positive review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other methods of whitening, mainly pens and those moth guard-looking contraptions full of gel, but my nerves would get the better of me</li>
            <li> I decided to make it a once a week thing, and it&#x27;s done a super mild job at getting rid of the yellow.</li>
            <li> They got a lot whiter right after taking off the strip but in the morning my teeth were back to their original color as if I hadn&#x27;t whitened them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love dark lipstick colors and in order to wear lipstick and look elegant your teeth must be some shade of white.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stick to your bottom teeth very well, but it helps to make sure your teeth are dry before you put it on.</li>
            <li> The product worked good, I saw a slight difference but it made my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> I purchased these based on the reviews at the time -- it was a cheaper alternative to Crest 3D White Strips, which were great but a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> They work very well.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe they are really user verified.</li>
            <li> These strips do not stick to your teeth very well</li>
            <li> These work very well at a fraction of the cost of competitive brands.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!  </li>
            <li> Looks promising.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very stained teeth..</li>
            <li> Also, the strips don&#x27;t always stay on very well</li>

            <li> /&gt;Original Review Oct 2013: For the price I thought this may be a risk in quality - but no, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> I bought these and used them for 10 days straight.  </li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with these.</li>
            <li> These strips really worked.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so much whiter.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as sticky as they could be as others have mentioned, and I have an issue of a permanent bar on the back of my lower teeth, but after a couple minutes they fit well.  </li>
            <li> The gel isn&#x27;t squishy and likely to be swallowed, which is important if you&#x27;re inclined to try and swallow it like I am.  </li>
            <li> These strips work very well.</li>
            <li> Did not do much of a difference on my teeth.</li>
            <li> (rhymes with high art)!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even have to finish the whole 14-day pack.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as good as the more expensive teeth whitening products, but it still whitens the teeth considerably.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the product based off of the reviews, but I saw no improvement and now my teeth are super sensitive as before they were not.</li>
            <li> Just as good as Crest Whitestrips if not better!</li>
            <li> It surely does and at a fraction of the price of other whitening agents.</li>
            <li> and this product hasn&#x27;t been able to touch it; then, like other reviewers, I have had problems with the flimsy strips peeling off and leaving the gel on the backing.</li>
            <li> and this product hasn&#x27;t been able to touch it; then, like other reviewers, I have had problems with the flimsy strips peeling off and leaving the gel on the backing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the active ingredients are comparable to more other name-brand products, but the problem is that the adhesive portion of the strips sticks to the packaging as you pull it off.</li>
            <li> They really cling to your teeth nicely and don&#x27;t slip around on your teeth, which has been a problem for me in the past.</li>
            <li> Easy fix though, just squish the strips around until they are loose then pull them off.</li>
            <li> Also, my teeth are super sensitive and I use sensitive toothpaste every day.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m actually surprised that they work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> As fate would have it, I&#x27;ve come into possession of another package of these, and they perform quite a bit better than the original pack I reviewed, which must have been left out in the Venusian sun for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Left my teeth splotchy, did not stay on teeth, and results seemed to fade as quickly as they appeared.</li>
            <li> These worked for me briefly, but then quickly faded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive whitening strips, and sure they work...but for $30.00?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever trued that are way more expensive.</li>
            <li> I did not have the money to pay the high price charged by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they were exposed to high heat in shipping or what, but they are not usable.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended this product to anyone in need teeth whiting.</li>
            <li> I was pretty nervous to try these after hearing so many people talk about tooth/gum sensitivity when using other brands of white strips.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s after only the first use!  </li>
            <li> Instead, because of my fear of the affect on my sensitive teeth, I was really conservative with the use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that much of a result because of the price, but it surprised me.</li>
            <li> These are just as good if not better than every crest white strip I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I received many a few compliments already in just a weeks use.</li>
            <li> I used the full 14 days worth without missing any days.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of these whitening strips before but decided to give them a try, they really work good, they seem to stay in place very well until you take them off, I like that they are very thin</li>
            <li> I am always looking to try new techniques for teeth whitening, whether its an at home concoction, tooth paste, or strip.</li>
            <li> but I live in Ukraine</li>
            <li> They are definitely not &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality though, and I&#x27;ve had to be careful peeling the strips from the backing to be sure the whitening gel goes with the strip and not the backing.  </li>
            <li> * Decent &amp; natural looking whitening</li>
            <li> My teeth were a little more sensitive than usual though nothing that was more than a bit of an annoyance.  </li>
            <li> And I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> after 1 use my teeth are very sensitive now.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it whitens since I didn&#x27;t use it more than once.</li>
            <li> Seem pretty generic.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the second I took it off the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening strips so many times in the past and have NEVER had an issue with getting them on.</li>
            <li> as her smile is as white as always, i&#x27;m assuming they work very well and, as she buys them regularly, she likes their performance.</li>
            <li> After only 15 minutes into my first time using these, I could tell a visible difference looking in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> the adhesive used isn&#x27;t as tenacious as on the more expensive ones, so these feel a little more slippery, but they&#x27;re worth the $.</li>
            <li> they did not make my teeth sensitive, and if the strips are too long or big they can easily be cut.</li>
            <li> Not only are they 1/3 the price of high quality whitening strips, but they work twice as fast.</li>
            <li> Teeth were a tiny bit sensitive after first use but that happens when I have used the Crest ones as well.</li>
            <li> I am definitely satisfied with my choice to use these over a typical commercial brand.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that for me, my gums got a little tender; but I switched to once a day and it was fine after that!</li>
            <li> The strips don&#x27;t stay put super well, but neither do the basic Crest White Strips, which are 3 times the cost.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the bottom ones are a little stupid and don&#x27;t work as well at the top ones, But over all im very very satisfied and am planning on ordering more soon .</li>
            <li> I usually buy Crest strips but these have no disappointed!</li>
            <li> Worked as well as crest white strips, only they didn&#x27;t get my teeth as white as the crest ones, they fit exactly the same</li>
            <li> This is amazing and the price is unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product, $13 sounds reasonable, and the reviews weren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I will never again purchase Crest White strips again because they&#x27;re just too expensive and this product is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> the product was dry.the strips were like a piece of clear paper..</li>
            <li> and I use these sort of products frequently.</li>
            <li> makes my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> I have old teeth</li>
            <li> these strips make my old teeth look young.</li>
            <li> When I have a big event or a date, I&#x27;ll put the strips on while I&#x27;m getting ready and leave them on for about 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li> you can actually wear them and nobody really notices.</li>
            <li> Our teeth were whiter, but sensitive.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get that far, because I can&#x27;t get them on my teeth.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old sobrina could do this in her sleep.</li>
            <li> These strips does not work, do not waste your time buying and trying them.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00BR0H6KY Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Strips 28</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but difficult to get out of  the  outer foil packaging.</li>
            <li> I love that the application is for only 14 days versus the 30 days I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This means that you have less adhesive for your teeth and the strips fall off really quick as a consequence.</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34; would be that there is a particular spot on one of my teeth that&#x27;s somehow been stained brown for years</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34; would be that there is a particular spot on one of my teeth that&#x27;s somehow been stained brown for years</li>
            <li> They will make your teeth very sensitive, especially if you already have sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fillings in my front teeth and lately they are becoming brownish colored</li>
            <li> After a 30-minute treatment each night, my teeth were noticably whiter immediately but back to normal by morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty shocked to see so many positive reviews for these things, which are a joke.  </li>
            <li> , Crest White Strips work good, but have gotten too expensive...</li>
            <li> I think they might have also made my gums pretty sensitive, but it also could have just been my new toothbrush, not sure</li>
            <li> These are definitely a cheaper alternative to most whitening strips and I have found them to work the same , if not better, than the expensive kind.</li>
            <li> Also, most of the strips will not come out of the individual metallized packing without some serious effort.  </li>
            <li> and I can barely talk</li>
            <li> Product was reasonably priced but did not work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is it leaves my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so surprised that they actually work this well.</li>
            <li> This product has immediate results, just as I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;But the quality of the bands is kind of weird.</li>
            <li> Second is these are not really that strong, i can tell because there is zero sensitivity - compared to the Crest and there is way less foaming.  </li>
            <li> They also weakened the enamel in my teeth and one week after using them I had several major stains on my teeth that were never there before.</li>
            <li> There was a slight improvement after the first use, though I only kept them on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> It also allowed me to keep them on for the whole 30 minutes because I was laying down and wasn&#x27;t keeping my mouth closed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the effort to repackage and send them back.</li>
            <li> Did cause mild sensitivity, but that is common and happened when I tried name-brand as well.</li>
            <li> Got my money&#x27;s worth and they do work to whiten teeth just hard to use.</li>
            <li> And the whole ordeal is very messy.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my teeth became really sensitive over the last few days.  </li>
            <li> Overall, they&#x27;re worth the $13, but I&#x27;m finally out of the strips and plan on trying another product (there are several that are also $12.99 here on Amazon) to see if there&#x27;s something that works the same but isn&#x27;t wasteful about the gel or difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I gave my teeth a break for a few days, just in case they might get too sensitive, and on the fourth day of using the strips (today) my teeth are at level 3!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was due to a new formula, or they were just really old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying for crest brand white strips for years with great results but recently decided to try something else because they are expensive and how expensive can it be to put some fluoride on a strip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, they&#x27;re worth the $13, but I&#x27;m finally out of the strips and plan on trying another product (there are several that are also $12.99 here on Amazon) to see if there&#x27;s something that works the same but isn&#x27;t wasteful about the gel or difficult to apply.had any problem with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> These strips definitely make your teeth much whiter in just half an hour!!!</li>
            <li> but after using it a few times I developed a tooth root abscess that required draining and a root canal.</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s old and dried up.</li>
            <li> For example, after 30 minutes when I was ready to take the strips off, I tried to remove them and the plastic came off my teeth but left behind a ton of this gel-like substance which was absolutely gross.</li>
            <li> My teeth are still not pure white though.</li>
            <li> A whole lot easier and way less messy than the teeth whitening tray method.</li>
            <li> I mean, REALLY.</li>
            <li> I debated 5 stars but I will admit that my gums do get a little sensitive if left on even slightly too long...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed that I didn&#x27;t get the same results as other have.</li>
            <li> After using the first use, at least 60% of the staining was already gone!</li>
            <li> These strips were dry.</li>
            <li> the concentration of active ingredients is way to low.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth too sensitive, even if I&#x27;ve worn the strips past 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they are start to come loose.</li>
            <li> After I removed the strips I used a half paper towel to wipe the excess slime left on my teeth from the strips and then just washed my mouth out.</li>
            <li> The residue it leaves behind is common with whitening strips, and easily brushes away.</li>
            <li> and when I finally got them on the strips started to dissolve into little pieces.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that sometimes the gel doesn&#x27;t stay on the strip as you open it, so I&#x27;ll have to wipe it off the backing and smear it onto the strip which is off course not quite uniform.</li>
            <li> Do not really think this did anything to my teeth.</li>
            <li> But two problems - one is that sticky side is not very sticky so it takes a lot of effort to get them to stick.  </li>
            <li> These were a total waste of money and I would never buy them again.</li>
            <li> No matter how careful you are opening them, 80% of the time one of the strips gets messed up.  </li>
            <li> and I have to be careful with how I use my mouth.</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful with how I use my mouth.</li>
            <li> THIS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few strips</li>
            <li> but this was a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second round of these strips and my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> Works as well a most base white strips for much less</li>
            <li> gave 4 stars because I was hard taking some out of the package, they would come off the clear plastic then stick to itself causing the gooey stuff to clump together and make a mess.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the quality would be lacking due to the cost...</li>
            <li> And I have not noticed a difference in my teeth yet, and I usually notice after the second treatment with the Crest strips.  </li>
            <li> These do the job at a fraction of the cost of the other whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been a drinker &amp; smoker in the past, and am currently a regular coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> and I have had no sensitivity issues like other whitening products.</li>
            <li> Place the strips on your teeth by pressing firmly on both the back and front of your teeth with your thumb and index finger and they should stick tight.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was a little apprehensive, but for the price they were worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A total of 28 whitening strips were provided, but I&#x27;ve only used two since I bought them because of the poor quality.  </li>
            <li> My tooth enamel is extremely worn down from years of illness and medications.</li>
            <li> I usually have to take toilet paper or a napkin to wipe off the gel or sometimes scrap with they nails.</li>
            <li> Half the price of other brands</li>
            <li> These strips are not worth your money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink any dark drinks...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly not that big of a deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it only covers sbout 8 of them which kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> I am hoping a few brushes will even it back out :/  </li>
            <li> I purchased a second package of these whiteners, and unfortunately they must be old because they are dried out.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only used about 4, and my teeth are whitening slowly.</li>
            <li> And seriously, my teeth have never been so white before!</li>
            <li> Over half the strips we unusable.</li>
            <li> When you peel them off the plastic, half of the whitening gel comes off the strip and sticks to the plastic.  </li>
            <li> but the last 4 white strip packs had the gel on the wrong side</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth are slightly whiter.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended to use them less often and this would not happen.</li>
            <li> I decided to go on a hunt for something; I figured, it&#x27;s been a decade, there has to be a whitening product for sensitive &amp; weak teeth!</li>
            <li> My teeth are a little whiter though.</li>
            <li> Nothing terrible though, and still love this product!</li>
            <li> The strip and the gel sometimes gets separated so you have to tap it a little before you separate and apply ...</li>
            <li> Could be a little bit messy ...</li>
            <li> Will not purchase again; waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I used them everyday for a week and did see a difference</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t messy.</li>
            <li> Then I wait a few weeks then</li>
            <li> Im about half through these strips and my teeth have gotten whiter!</li>
            <li> After cutting open the packet  and pulling the strips out of the gel soaked container, there was very little whitening gel left on the strips themselves; the majority had either remained inside the packet or spread all over my fingers.  </li>
            <li> : At first I thought it was a bad pack</li>
            <li> I would have given these a terrible rating after I tried them once because I brushed my teeth and applied them right after I brushed which made it almost impossible to get the stips to stick on my teeth properly.</li>
            <li> Some of the strips were a little hard to peel from the packaging.</li>
            <li> The strips have very little gel, are tus very hard to apply AND they do not really whiten -</li>
            <li> Maybe we got a bad batch, but it seems these are of a much lower quality than should be accepted.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to even take the strips out of the packet as the gel is smeared throughout the entire package.  </li>
            <li> I recommend no more than the instructed time.</li>
            <li> This one is not okay.</li>
            <li> For me, that&#x27;s a small inconvenience to save on the price.</li>
            <li> they are non expensive and I&#x27;ve been using them for only 2 days now</li>
            <li> Was not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Don&#x27;t always peel off cleanly [small prob] and have to swish water to remove gel</li>
            <li> Usually use it while i shower, makes those 30 minutes go faster.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure why I put myself through the torture.</li>
            <li> Count - 14 Day Supply + Bonus Shade Guide]]I must be the first disappointed customer to have tried this no name product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s small though</li>
            <li> It seems to me, from the other reviews, that such bad batches happen quite a lot.</li>
            <li> In general, whitening strips, gel trays etc make my mouth water like crazy</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to put it on sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe</li>
            <li> Hard to apply</li>
            <li> The package said you should get at least 5 shades lighter and it worked.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any sort of dental insurance and cannot afford professional whitening, so I&#x27;ve just kinda &amp;#34;suffered&amp;#34; with ugly teeth.</li>
            <li> but I kept mine on for a hour at least</li>
            <li> a lot of thick gel remains stuck to the teeth</li>
            <li> Being cheap, I also didn&#x27;t want to dish out $30 on a product that might not work, or worse, might be very painful.</li>
            <li> Definitely comparable to 3 times as expensive counterparts!</li>
            <li> But its like plastic wrap covering my teeth, Very uncomfortable for 30 mins, and they only cover the front teeth.</li>
            <li> They did nothing and the taste it leaves once you take them off is horrible, assuming you get them to stick in the first place.</li>
            <li> and my teeth are at least 3 days whiter now!</li>
            <li> knocked off a star because once I take the strips off of my teeth, it leaves behind the gel.</li>
            <li> the strips were too thin.</li>
            <li> Saw no difference in my teeth, they looked worse if any thing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably worse case scenario when using these sorts of products.</li>
            <li> but this was too frustrating of an experience not to report.</li>
            <li> They are so thin you can wear them without anyone noticing.  </li>
            <li> Also, my bottom back teeth (the last teeth that are on the strip) hurt very bad now :(  </li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re so flimsy, and the gel is thick, and it gets all over your fingers and mouth - and just, a terrible experience overall.</li>
            <li> They would not stay on my teeth and left a very nasty film residue afterward.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> They did sort of start turning translucent around the edges, though, which was kinda weird.</li>
            <li> So I have not seen as some reported that gel is on wrong side.  </li>
            <li> * Can be difficult to apply/adhere and keep on</li>
            <li> , one day I saw a picture of myself smiling really big, and my teeth were disgusting.</li>
            <li> but they are SO expensive</li>
            <li> Maybe you guys are doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> but for the price and result; you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Do not get me wrong</li>
            <li> The strip is a bit awkward,  doesn&#x27;t always stay in place</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost unpleasant having it on my teeth though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to get them to stick to your teeth, you&#x27;re supposed to leave them in for 30 minutes (very uncomfortable), and I see no color change whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Too bad that manufacturer is discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Don&#x27;t taste bad</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. :(</li>
            <li> I do not recommend these at all. :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> You can still use it, but it is annoying.  </li>
            <li> Very bad whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> absolutely terrible product.</li>
            <li> These were horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible, would not stay on teeth well.  </li>
            <li> These strips are terrible!  </li>
            <li> Horrible!!!!</li>
            <li> In fact, the gel that is supposed to stay on the strips came off in my mouth and was disgusting.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pretty good for the price, they don&#x27;t stick as well as say Crest strips but for the price they get the job done!</li>
            <li> absolutely terrible product. They did nothing and the taste it leaves once you take them off is horrible, assuming you get them to stick in the first place. Give them a shot if you want, but don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t pre-warned...</li>
            <li> Very good buy.  They work very well.  I am a regular buyer of these on amazon.</li>
            <li> They worked just as good as any other I have used.</li>
            <li> These whitening strips are so-so. They stick to teeth well, not too harsh for sensitive teeth/gums, and the price is pretty great.  However, they leave my teeth spotted. Within an hour or two the color evens out a bit, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> I would buy this product again. It works. I&#x27;m a whiteningholic and I use these sort of products frequently. Now that I&#x27;ve discovered this I will never again purchase Crest White strips again because they&#x27;re just too expensive and this product is a great alternative. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth too sensitive, even if I&#x27;ve worn the strips past 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off a star because once I take the strips off of my teeth, it leaves behind the gel. I usually have to take toilet paper or a napkin to wipe off the gel or sometimes scrap with they nails. I really don&#x27;t like that but I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> makes my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> Whitened great and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> makes me gag because of the gel and makes my mouth very watery but over all good product</li>
            <li> most of the strips had no product on them. Did not whiten teeth at all. Will not purchase again; waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are excellent if you brush your teeth and wait about 15 to 30 minutes before using. I would have given these a terrible rating after I tried them once because I brushed my teeth and applied them right after I brushed which made it almost impossible to get the stips to stick on my teeth properly. (A lot of sliding around) Place the strips on your teeth by pressing firmly on both the back and front of your teeth with your thumb and index finger and they should stick tight. Let them stay on for 30 minutes. After I removed the strips I used a half paper towel to wipe the excess slime left on my teeth from the strips and then just washed my mouth out. These work the best of any strips I have ever used and you will notice results after just one use. I have old teeth and I drink a lot of coffee and these strips make my old teeth look young.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after my first application. And, with only five days in I noticed a lot more difference in the color of my teeth. I am definitely satisfied with my choice to use these over a typical commercial brand.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to pay 20-30 for a whiting strips.  After one use my teeth was whiter great produced great price</li>
            <li> Worked as well as crest white strips, only they didn&#x27;t get my teeth as white as the crest ones, they fit exactly the same</li>
            <li> These took a while to arrive but they are worth the price. It isn&#x27;t as good as the more expensive teeth whitening products, but it still whitens the teeth considerably. However, the gel stays on your teeth but swishing your teeth with water will get rid of it :). I would buy this again in the future</li>
            <li> Do not really think this did anything to my teeth. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Will make your teeth white if your use all of it in a row.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used all 14 yet but I&#x27;ve noticed quite a difference.  These are very easy to use and I could see results after the first use. I&#x27;m a week in and I&#x27;ve had friends comment on the difference and how white my teeth look.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Crest strips. I will be buying these again. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These were horrible. They would not stay on my teeth and left a very nasty film residue afterward. I don&#x27;t see how anyone could give these a positive review. As for the whitening, I would give that a C-. These rave reviews make no sense. I cannot believe they are really user verified.</li>
            <li> These strips do not stick to your teeth very well and when I finally got them on the strips started to dissolve into little pieces. My teeth are a little whiter though.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed that I saw a visible difference after only one use.  They don&#x27;t stick to your bottom teeth very well, but it helps to make sure your teeth are dry before you put it on.</li>
            <li> On time , was as described.</li>
            <li> Great price and size to decide what works for yourself.</li>
            <li> the highlight of my day was wearing these!!! they worked very well!!! they did not make my teeth sensitive, and if the strips are too long or big they can easily be cut. do reccoment! very cost effective and great product!!</li>
            <li> Made my gums bleed. Not sure how well it whitens since I didn&#x27;t use it more than once.</li>
            <li> Most people seem to rave about this product and say they notice a difference right away but after using these strips for 5 days I can&#x27;t say I see any difference at all yet.... It claims they should be whiter by now but so far I&#x27;m not impressed. The texture of the strips is strange and kind of glides off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will write another updated review after completing all 14 days. Fingers crossed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I continued using the strips until the 11th day but they were literally the same color as I started out with. They got a lot whiter right after taking off the strip but in the morning my teeth were back to their original color as if I hadn&#x27;t whitened them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed that I didn&#x27;t get the same results as other have. I purchased the Crest whitestrips but wish that I just purchased those right away instead of going for the cheaper option. If only I knew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to work for others though so maybe give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was pretty nervous to try these after hearing so many people talk about tooth/gum sensitivity when using other brands of white strips. Honestly, I am amazed and will definitely repurchase these. I bought them from some staining that had appeared on the bottom/sides of my teeth (all that coffee over the Winter, I suppose). After using the first use, at least 60% of the staining was already gone! I can only imagine how nice my teeth will look after I use up the whole pack!</li>
            <li> Used 3 times and can tell a big difference! Just as good as Crest Whitestrips if not better!</li>
            <li> Works well at a great price.</li>
            <li> Not only are they 1/3 the price of high quality whitening strips, but they work twice as fast. When I have a big event or a date, I&#x27;ll put the strips on while I&#x27;m getting ready and leave them on for about 30-40 minutes. When I take them off, my teeth are incredibly gooey and gross, but I just take my toothbrush and brush off the goo from the strips. And seriously, my teeth have never been so white before! Even after the FIRST use. And I have very sensitive teeth, these didn&#x27;t bother my gums or teeth at all. Everyone will have different results, but for me, these are an A+.</li>
            <li> These work very well at a fraction of the cost of competitive brands.  I found the whitening to be very satisfactory, and I only experienced mild post-whitening sensitivity.  I removed one star because the strips don&#x27;t remove cleanly from the teeth - a lot of thick gel remains stuck to the teeth so lots of rinsing (and occasionally re-brushing) are necessary to remove the residue.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought these whitening strips, they worked just fine. They stayed on and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation or sensitivity. And, they whitened my teeth noticeably every time I wore them! However, the second batch I got couldn&#x27;t do their work because most of the whitening gel would stay on the packet when I peeled them off. Even being very gentle, I have been lucky to preserve 50% of the gel on the strip before getting it onto my teeth. And the whole ordeal is very messy. All of the strips in the pack are like this. It seems to me, from the other reviews, that such bad batches happen quite a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, they stick well, and there was never any pain as some reviewers experienced. But they didn&#x27;t do much and my teeth were more white than not to begin with. After a 30-minute treatment each night, my teeth were noticably whiter immediately but back to normal by morning. I used the full 14 days worth without missing any days.</li>
            <li> Too bad that manufacturer is discontinuing this product. It&#x27;s good, but difficult to get out of  the  outer foil packaging.</li>
            <li> This product has immediate results, just as I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;But the quality of the bands is kind of weird. Sometimes when you pull the strip away from the plastic, the whitening stuff stays on the plastic, not the strip and it&#x27;s hard to put it on sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the temperature of my bathroom does that but it still bothers me a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, AMAZING!~</li>
            <li> These are awesome!  They are every bit as good as crest white strips at about 1/4 of the price.  I highly recommend them!  I purchased a second package of these whiteners, and unfortunately they must be old because they are dried out.  I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the effort to repackage and send them back.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these! Great value and half the price of Crest Whitestrips. Teeth are 2-3 shades whiter when all done. Shipped on time. Teeth were a tiny bit sensitive after first use but that happens when I have used the Crest ones as well.</li>
            <li> Works great, however the strips won&#x27;t get the creases of the teeth...I purchased a whitening pen/brush works much better</li>
            <li> These work great and much cheaper than others. I was concerned that the quality would be lacking due to the cost... Boy was I wrong. Great quality, work great and cheap!</li>
            <li> These are a great value and they work!</li>
            <li> I purchased these based on the reviews at the time -- it was a cheaper alternative to Crest 3D White Strips, which were great but a little pricey.  A total of 28 whitening strips were provided, but I&#x27;ve only used two since I bought them because of the poor quality.  It is difficult to even take the strips out of the packet as the gel is smeared throughout the entire package.  After cutting open the packet  and pulling the strips out of the gel soaked container, there was very little whitening gel left on the strips themselves; the majority had either remained inside the packet or spread all over my fingers.  Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> For the price, I think these are worth a try. Just received them in the mail 3 days after I order. Looks promising. I will try them out and update my review.</li>
            <li> Went with this bargain brand and regret it. Over half the strips we unusable. Gummy paste was stuck to the inside of each package and would not peel off to use. Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay on teeth and made no changes in color.</li>
            <li> I am always looking to try new techniques for teeth whitening, whether its an at home concoction, tooth paste, or strip. I also dont want to spend a fortune! These are definitely a cheaper alternative to most whitening strips and I have found them to work the same , if not better, than the expensive kind. They really cling to your teeth nicely and don&#x27;t slip around on your teeth, which has been a problem for me in the past. I enjoy the whitening guide that&#x27;s included so I can measure any improvement. I debated 5 stars but I will admit that my gums do get a little sensitive if left on even slightly too long... I recommend no more than the instructed time. Nothing terrible though, and still love this product! I just stocked up on two more orders. :)</li>
            <li> the strips were too thin.</li>
            <li> these aren&#x27;t  quite the same as the name-brand strips, but they seem to do the job. i&#x27;ve only used about 4, and my teeth are whitening slowly. the adhesive used isn&#x27;t as tenacious as on the more expensive ones, so these feel a little more slippery, but they&#x27;re worth the $.</li>
            <li> I have never used any kind of whitening strips or gels or anything, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare...but I have to say my teeth look great &amp; that is what counts.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my teeth became really sensitive over the last few days.  The strips were self explanatory &amp; I had no problems with them once I got used to having them on my teeth.  Once I took the strips off after 30 minutes, I just used my toothbrush to brush all the excess bleach out of my mouth &amp; my Listerine to freshen it all up.  I kinda wish I would have taken before &amp; after pics, but I did not think about it.  I would recommend these...especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Terrible, would not stay on teeth well.  Seem pretty generic.</li>
            <li> LOVE this, I used this while in the tanning bed smiling the whole time. That made a HUGE difference. It also allowed me to keep them on for the whole 30 minutes because I was laying down and wasn&#x27;t keeping my mouth closed.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because I was hard taking some out of the package, they would come off the clear plastic then stick to itself causing the gooey stuff to clump together and make a mess. Some were not useable after that. The price was awesome and they worked just as good if not better than the expensive crest strips.</li>
            <li> My teeth got whiter. Yay! They did sort of start turning translucent around the edges, though, which was kinda weird.</li>
            <li> I bought it and my teeth didn&#x27;t get more white. I had them on for 45 minutes and still didn&#x27;t help. I wasn&#x27;t pleased ... so I give 3 stars... look for another option. . This one is not okay.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of these whitening strips before but decided to give them a try, they really work good, they seem to stay in place very well until you take them off, I like that they are very thin you can actually wear them and nobody really notices. I will definitly buy again....</li>
            <li> These strips are not worth your money.  The gel stays on the backing strip and does not stay on the part that you put on your teeth.  You must wipe the gel off of the backing strip and place on your teeth and then put the plastic covering over your teeth.  Also, most of the strips will not come out of the individual metallized packing without some serious effort.  Maybe we got a bad batch, but it seems these are of a much lower quality than should be accepted.</li>
            <li> Love this whitening gel ... Could be a little bit messy ... The strip and the gel sometimes gets separated so you have to tap it a little before you separate and apply ... Otherwise it does works well.</li>
            <li> These are great and work fast.,  I will purchase again</li>
            <li> product didn&#x27;t whiten as well as Crest Whitestrips and left it&#x27;s gel between all my front teeth. Had to pick it all out&lt;br /&gt;with a dental instrument every time I used it..also caused gum bleeding.......would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for about a week and I can definitely see an improvement in my teeth.  They are definitely not &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality though, and I&#x27;ve had to be careful peeling the strips from the backing to be sure the whitening gel goes with the strip and not the backing.  For me, that&#x27;s a small inconvenience to save on the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using these strips for about three years now. I feel they do make a difference with the color of my teeth. I love that the application is for only 14 days versus the 30 days I have used in the past. I use these every six months and feel it is worth the money and the time.</li>
            <li> The gel stuck to the plastic, NOT the strip when it was removed. Couldnt use. I tried putting them in fridge, to no avail. I would have asked for refund/return but I live in Ukraine and I sent to my friend in the U.S. to bring to me. Maybe if Amazing Smile reads this, they will refund my money........</li>
            <li> Never thought something this inexpensive would actually work to whiten teeth...  It surely does and at a fraction of the price of other whitening agents.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews, but now that I have them in hand I&#x27;m freaked out that there are no ingredients anywhere on this and it doesn&#x27;t say where it is made. What if there is lead or off label industrial bleach on these things? I&#x27;m going to pay more for the Crest strips since I know they are approved to be sold in the US and have been through testing</li>
            <li> They work just as good as any name brand whitening system.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest pro strength strips for  years, thought I&#x27;d try these as price was very good.  So I have not seen as some reported that gel is on wrong side.  But two problems - one is that sticky side is not very sticky so it takes a lot of effort to get them to stick.  Second is these are not really that strong, i can tell because there is zero sensitivity - compared to the Crest and there is way less foaming.  It does whiten but not at top level.  But it&#x27;s cheap so it&#x27;s OK - sort of.&lt;br /&gt;Update;&lt;br /&gt;I have reduced my rating to one star - that is because there is no option here for zero.  This is a junk product.  The strips have very little gel, are tus very hard to apply AND they do not really whiten - the concentration of active ingredients is way to low.  Invest in the higher price HIGHER quality product</li>
            <li> Do not use these! They will make your teeth very sensitive, especially if you already have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;They are cheap and pop at you because of it.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use again.</li>
            <li> They work great and are just as good as the more expensive brands and professional ones from my dentist.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I did not have the money to pay the high price charged by my dentist. My teeth look great after using this product for the very small price of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest whitestrips for years and decided to try these because of the price difference.  Well, you get what you pay for... These strips are terrible!  When you peel them off the plastic, half of the whitening gel comes off the strip and sticks to the plastic.  And I have not noticed a difference in my teeth yet, and I usually notice after the second treatment with the Crest strips.  These were a total waste of money and I would never buy them again.</li>
            <li> I like these strips and they are better cost than Crest. However I do have to rinse my mouth out a lot afterwards, lots of jelly stuff leftover. But they work!!</li>
            <li> Work well, stay on good.</li>
            <li> good price but really hurt my teeth when I used after 2 days, Crest White Strips work good, but have gotten too expensive...will try another brand next time....</li>
            <li> These do the job at a fraction of the cost of the other whitening strips. I highly recommend them! Better quality at a lower price!</li>
            <li> Way better then the tray days. Worked great and I&#x27;d use it again in a second.....if needed. Simple and efficient.</li>
            <li> They came in on time... Works great. I have 2 more left to go and I totally see a difference in my teeth. My smile looks brighter. You can&#x27;t beat the price. So worth it. Planning on ordering another one. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very stained teeth.. I don&#x27;t drink any dark drinks... I don&#x27;t drink coffee or soda and it didn&#x27;t lighten my teeth at all...</li>
            <li> Left my teeth splotchy, did not stay on teeth, and results seemed to fade as quickly as they appeared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the active ingredients are comparable to more other name-brand products, but the problem is that the adhesive portion of the strips sticks to the packaging as you pull it off. This means that you have less adhesive for your teeth and the strips fall off really quick as a consequence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fillings in my front teeth and lately they are becoming brownish colored so I ordered these... I read all the reviews and they were all good! so I ordered! I am super pleased with these strips! they are non expensive and I&#x27;ve been using them for only 2 days now and my teeth are at least 3 days whiter now! and the brown stains are coming off more and more each day!</li>
            <li> Works great Awesome !</li>
            <li> These strips were dry. Not sure if it was due to a new formula, or they were just really old. In any case, I saw no difference in my teeth. I&#x27;ve seen better with toothpaste.</li>
            <li> You can see a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> These work great and are so much cheaper than what you can buy at the store.  I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the packaging.  No matter how careful you are opening them, 80% of the time one of the strips gets messed up.  You can still use it, but it is annoying.  I&#x27;ve bought these several times.</li>
            <li> Great product and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> These worked for me briefly, but then quickly faded. They also weakened the enamel in my teeth and one week after using them I had several major stains on my teeth that were never there before. According to my dentist, some whitening strips have that effect.</li>
            <li> So I love my coffee. I love sugar, just like the next person. I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive whitening strips, and sure they work...but for $30.00?&lt;br /&gt;I REALLLLY love these. I mean, REALLY. They are 15,00 $ worth of beauty. At first I used them every day; first I brush my teeth and then put this one for 30 minutes, and then floss..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this 4/5 stars is because they are gel. The issue with that is you have some gel left over after you take them off, but honestly just grab your tooth brush and scrub it off. It&#x27;s honestly not that big of a deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a college student and someone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay 30-40 $, these are the best I have ever tried. I noticed a difference the second I took it off the first time.</li>
            <li> As good as Crest strips for a lot less money! My only complaint is that sometimes the gel doesn&#x27;t stay on the strip as you open it, so I&#x27;ll have to wipe it off the backing and smear it onto the strip which is off course not quite uniform. Otherwise I&#x27;d give 5 stars, so to the manufacturers, can you make it so the gel stays on the strip as you peel it open?</li>
            <li> My friends loved it :-)</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! I&#x27;ve been paying for crest brand white strips for years with great results but recently decided to try something else because they are expensive and how expensive can it be to put some fluoride on a strip. Anyway so I settled on these and was delighted by the results and the added spearmint flavoring that&#x27;s added to the strips. These are just as good if not better than every crest white strip I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Well priced and works great!!</li>
            <li> The product worked good, I saw a slight difference but it made my teeth sensitive. Try the product out though.</li>
            <li> visibly works!! I&#x27;ve purchased it twice.</li>
            <li> You can see results in days..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get as good of results as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. :( Very bad whitening strips. Was not pleased at all. I do not recommend these at all. :( Horrible!!!!</li>
            <li> the bottom strip doesnt even cover all of the teeth. it only covers sbout 8 of them which kinda sucks. but it does whiten the teeth tho</li>
            <li> It worked just fine, the strips are easy to use and quick to apply. The only downside is that the bottom ones are a little stupid and don&#x27;t work as well at the top ones, But over all im very very satisfied and am planning on ordering more soon .</li>
            <li> This is not a well known brand however I thought that for the price it was worth me giving it a shot. I have seen good results after about a week. Some of the strips were a little hard to peel from the packaging. I found that it helps to keep these strips in the fridge so that they come off easier.  Overall it was a great price for a good product. I would recommend these if you are shopping for teeth whitening strips.</li>
            <li> These whitening strips are great!!! I absolutely love them, they worked for me and that was important because it wasn&#x27;t a known brand for me.</li>
            <li> I use these once a week and my teeth are easily three to four shades lighter. They do the job of Crest Whitestrips in one use a week. They do irritate my teeth if I use them more than once a week, but they do their job quite well with only that one use. My one riff is that you have to smudge the strips as you pull them off or you won&#x27;t get any of the gel on them. Easy fix though, just squish the strips around until they are loose then pull them off.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I had ever tried whitening strips.  The package said you should get at least 5 shades lighter and it worked. My teeth are still not pure white though.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply and it doesn&#x27;t even whiten. Plus it will not stay on. Disappointed. Saw no difference in my teeth, they looked worse if any thing.</li>
            <li> Great product and competitively priced.  Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> I love how they helped made my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> Not the best strips.  They are kind of cheap.  They don&#x27;t stick on that well.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no expiration date on the package - but when opening each individual packet, most if not all of the gel stays on the plastic cover and not on the strips themselves</li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter after just 4 days.  Curios what they will look like after 2 weeks of using them.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Decent &amp; natural looking whitening&lt;br /&gt;* Good for sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Can be difficult to apply/adhere and keep on&lt;br /&gt;* Sometimes the gel doesn&#x27;t stick to the strip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a decade ago I tried the Crest whitening strips (this was the only teeth whitening product/process I&#x27;ve ever used until these). My tooth enamel is extremely worn down from years of illness and medications. I&#x27;ve also been a drinker &amp; smoker in the past, and am currently a regular coffee drinker. Because of all this I have extremely sensitive teeth (and super stained!), so when I tried the Crest product many years ago, not only did it not work but after using it a few times I developed a tooth root abscess that required draining and a root canal. That&#x27;s probably worse case scenario when using these sorts of products. Ever since then I was terrified of ever trying anything like this again. I haven&#x27;t had any sort of dental insurance and cannot afford professional whitening, so I&#x27;ve just kinda &amp;#34;suffered&amp;#34; with ugly teeth. No fancy Hollywood teeth for this gal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, one day I saw a picture of myself smiling really big, and my teeth were disgusting. It&#x27;s all I could see in the photo. I decided to go on a hunt for something; I figured, it&#x27;s been a decade, there has to be a whitening product for sensitive &amp; weak teeth! Being cheap, I also didn&#x27;t want to dish out $30 on a product that might not work, or worse, might be very painful. I was happy to find this product, $13 sounds reasonable, and the reviews weren&#x27;t too bad. Seemed it worked okay for people like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use this product as directed. Instead, because of my fear of the affect on my sensitive teeth, I was really conservative with the use. There was a slight improvement after the first use, though I only kept them on for 20 minutes. I decided to make it a once a week thing, and it&#x27;s done a super mild job at getting rid of the yellow. I&#x27;m pretty sure if I&#x27;d followed the suggested use I&#x27;d have nice white-white teeth. I haven&#x27;t had any problem with sensitivity. My only &amp;#34;complaints&amp;#34; would be that there is a particular spot on one of my teeth that&#x27;s somehow been stained brown for years and this product hasn&#x27;t been able to touch it; then, like other reviewers, I have had problems with the flimsy strips peeling off and leaving the gel on the backing. My solution has been to just wipe the strip over it and pick up the rest of the goo before applying to my teeth. Also, the strips don&#x27;t always stay on very well and I have to be careful with how I use my mouth. I use the strips when I&#x27;m home alone doing chores so I don&#x27;t have to worry about talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they&#x27;re worth the $13, but I&#x27;m finally out of the strips and plan on trying another product (there are several that are also $12.99 here on Amazon) to see if there&#x27;s something that works the same but isn&#x27;t wasteful about the gel or difficult to apply.had any problem with sensitivity.

            <li> They work great.  The strip is a bit awkward,  doesn&#x27;t always stay in place</li>
            <li> Performed just as well as name-brand products, but for a notable discount. No product-specific downsides. Did cause mild sensitivity, but that is common and happened when I tried name-brand as well.</li>
            <li> The top strip fell apart in my fingers and into several pieces when I tried to put it on my teeth. I don&#x27;t know if they were exposed to high heat in shipping or what, but they are not usable. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> They are great I can notice a big difference. But its like plastic wrap covering my teeth, Very uncomfortable for 30 mins, and they only cover the front teeth. but overall very good product. it does what it says it does. I just thing they should consider a different method to place on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I used these twice and my teeth looked great!  They did not cause any sensitivity and stayed on well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty shocked to see so many positive reviews for these things, which are a joke.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to get them to stick to your teeth, you&#x27;re supposed to leave them in for 30 minutes (very uncomfortable), and I see no color change whatsoever.  EDIT:  As fate would have it, I&#x27;ve come into possession of another package of these, and they perform quite a bit better than the original pack I reviewed, which must have been left out in the Venusian sun for a few months.  The new set is easier to use, and somewhat effective in whitening.</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on the reviews and I was not disappointed. I saw an improvement after the first use. I was really impressed. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> They left my teeth with white spots. Yes they are like 1/5 of the price but you get what you paid for.... A mistake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these twice because I keep forgetting but I&#x27;m actually surprised that they work pretty well.  I left them on for 30 min and saw about one shade difference immediately.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Very good! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for four days now. I notice no difference in the whiteness of my teeth (but it has only been four days so I&#x27;m hopeful!). I gave one star because they will not stay in place! They slip and slide everywhere in my mouth and then fold into themselves after three minutes, so I&#x27;m then using the remaining 27 minutes to try and keep them in place without getting the goo on my fingers and keeping it on my teeth. They have also made my teeth sensitive, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> Update January 2014: At first I thought it was a bad pack but the last 4 white strip packs had the gel on the wrong side so when you peeled the strip from the plastic - there was no gel on the strip. All whitening gel remained on the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a toothbrush to swipe the gel onto your teeth it&#x27;s usable but not the same level of effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review Oct 2013: For the price I thought this may be a risk in quality - but no, it&#x27;s the real deal. The white strips work well within 30 minutes and I have had no sensitivity issues like other whitening products. Not a bad choice at all.</li>
            <li> I bought these and used them for 10 days straight.  I noticed my teeth are slightly whiter.  My teeth were a little more sensitive than usual though nothing that was more than a bit of an annoyance.  I did stop using them as they caused my gums to breakdown a bit.  My dentist recommended to use them less often and this would not happen.</li>
            <li> Whitens teeth after one use.  My girlfriend and I used them 1 hour per day for three days. Our teeth were whiter, but sensitive.  Worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I bought these mostly because of the price.  They advertise they are $49.99 on sale for $9.99 making me think I got a great deal (I guess they always are on sale?!?)  Anyways, I did see a notice after just one use, but it left my teeth with white streaks!!!  I am hoping a few brushes will even it back out :/  Also, my bottom back teeth (the last teeth that are on the strip) hurt very bad now :(  Not using again!</li>
            <li> They are okay. I used them everyday for a week and did see a difference, the only probably was that they left my teeth sore and had some really white patches. If you order I hope they work! :D</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product is great!  Half the price of other brands and I had instant results in one day. My 12-year-old even complimented me on my teeth, asked to use them and the confidence he has in his smile now is so worth it! The only downfall is that for me, my gums got a little tender; but I switched to once a day and it was fine after that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening strips so many times in the past and have NEVER had an issue with getting them on. I also used name-brand strips and this is my first time using a generic-ish brand. I&#x27;d love to write a review about how well they worked or didn&#x27;t - but I can&#x27;t get that far, because I can&#x27;t get them on my teeth. They do a fantastic job at sticking to your finger or your lips, but not your teeth. And they&#x27;re so flimsy, and the gel is thick, and it gets all over your fingers and mouth - and just, a terrible experience overall. Plenty of people have given these a good review, so I know everyone won&#x27;t have have my experience - but this was too frustrating of an experience not to report.</li>
            <li> My teeth were whiter in two applications!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hit or miss with this product. Sometimes there is enough solution on the strips, and the product works. Sometimes there is more solution on the plastic part and the product does not work. You just don&#x27;t know if you are getting a good product or if it&#x27;s old and dried up. Wish they would inventory it better and send a product that does work.  I&#x27;m on day 4 of using it and have seen no change in the color of my teeth. Not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> THIS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  THESE STRIPS ARE CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE THEY STICK TO THE PLASTIC HOLDER.  THEY ARE GUMMY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> PROS: whitened quite well, tasted good compared to other strips, stayed on well&lt;br /&gt;CONS: there was a lot of residue left over after taking the strips off. They also irritated my gums for the first 2-3 days, but that subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I was extremely happy with this product!</li>
            <li> the product was dry.the strips were like a piece of clear paper..ie would not stick to teeth..Now have no way to return or aquire&lt;br /&gt;additional product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the product based off of the reviews, but I saw no improvement and now my teeth are super sensitive as before they were not. Double whammy</li>
            <li> the gel on the strip stays on the plastic. just got it hopefully works but it looks like it work if the gel that does it stays on the plastic instead of the strip were its needed. won&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> They work great! I get whiter teeth in just a couple of minute!</li>
            <li> Great product cheaper than the more expensive products but equally effective as crest products will def get these again.</li>
            <li> no expiration date printed, the result is not so good</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with these. There is a reason that they are only $16 and the ones from crest are like $40. It is because these are cheaply made and dont work. In fact, the gel that is supposed to stay on the strips came off in my mouth and was disgusting. For example, after 30 minutes when I was ready to take the strips off, I tried to remove them and the plastic came off my teeth but left behind a ton of this gel-like substance which was absolutely gross. Do not buy these.</li>
            <li> This product is affordably priced. The residue it leaves behind is common with whitening strips, and easily brushes away. I recmemd applying it to your in rushed teeth. It helps the strip stick better. I&#x27;ve only used a few strips so I can&#x27;t say yet&lt;br /&gt;How well they whiten yet, but I did see some improvement after three applications</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, item as described! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This will whiten your teeth and is an incredible deal. Definitely comparable to 3 times as expensive counterparts! (words required)</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve suffered with Bulimia for the last 5 years, you can imagine the damage done to my teeth &amp; the yellowing.&lt;br /&gt;I was first going to do the crest Whiting but they are SO expensive and I&#x27;ve heard they can be very damaging to teeth and cause pain for many people. The last thing I want is more damage to my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a quarter of the cost, just as many strips and I thought what the heck I&#x27;ve nothing to loose.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was quick and I was so excited to use these. Well they worked, so well!!! My teeth actually look like a shade of white instead of pasty yellow after using all the strips!! I wish I&#x27;d taken before &amp; after photos to show everyone the work so nice! I&#x27;m definetley buying again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 2 strips in the morning and night one day, then one strip in the morning the next day, then 2 strips, then 1 you get the idea. The directions say to leave them on for 30min but I kept mine on for a hour at least, sometimes I&#x27;d forget their on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-don&#x27;t cause pain&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t taste bad&lt;br /&gt;-Actually Whiten&lt;br /&gt;-can see difference after 2nd strip and so fourth&lt;br /&gt;-don&#x27;t slide of teeth when on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t always peel off cleanly [small prob] and have to swish water to remove gel&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes the bottom strip slides around when your placing on ur teeth, but once is secured stays fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously guys, I know the comments on here are 50/50 but it&#x27;s cheap and worth you figuring out the difference for yourself &#x3D;}</li>
            <li> Maybe you guys are doing it wrong. My teeth are amazingly white. I love dark lipstick colors and in order to wear lipstick and look elegant your teeth must be some shade of white. This helped my lipstick obsession even more. They&#x27;re brighter, and I&#x27;ve noticed after the first try. Put it on for those 30 mins, then after you&#x27;ll see. Be sure to brush your teeth before the application. It wasn&#x27;t messy. My 3 year old sobrina could do this in her sleep. And to think I was gonna pay 89$ for teeth bleaching. This was a much better solution and worth every penny. I order many things from amazon and never write reviews, but it was imperative I write one for this product. Muchas gracias! Cuidate!</li>
            <li> Im about half through these strips and my teeth have gotten whiter! Im pleased that I took the cheaper plunge and tried them out. I usually buy Crest strips but these have no disappointed! They also havent caused me any pain which the Crest ones do. Could be they are not as strong but I dont know the actual reason just happy they dont!</li>
            <li> Very effective teeth whitening system for a good price.  I like it.  There is a bit of &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; that is left on your teeth after usage, but I just quickly brushed it off.  Not a big issue . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one set and my teeth are already brighter! I can&#x27;t stop checking my smile in the mirror. The strips don&#x27;t stay put super well, but neither do the basic Crest White Strips, which are 3 times the cost. I recommend these to anyone who wants beautiful white teeth without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> my daughter bought this for herself.  as her smile is as white as always, i&#x27;m assuming they work very well and, as she buys them regularly, she likes their performance.</li>
            <li> While I did not have time for a 14 day run, I used these 4 times and could see a definitive brightening and whitening of my teeth. They worked!</li>
            <li> I have not heard of this brand of whitening strips before but the price was so good - I had to give them a try. I am glad I did. These strips really worked. They stay in place until you are done with them. They are so thin you can wear them without anyone noticing.  I will certainly buy more when I am done with this pack. Very good.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing and works really well and fast.I would highly recommended this product to anyone in need teeth whiting.</li>
            <li> Very low cost, kind of flimsy product. Got my money&#x27;s worth and they do work to whiten teeth just hard to use.</li>
            <li> I used to buy many products for whitening, but for some reason, this works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love these. My teeth are so much whiter. I didn&#x27;t expect that much of a result because of the price, but it surprised me. Definitely worth the price and time.</li>
            <li> I never ever write reviews... but I really needed to let the world know about these!  These are A-MAZ-ING.  As an avid tea, coffee, and wine drinker, my teeth have always been pretty stained ever since I was a kid.  I&#x27;ve tried other methods of whitening, mainly pens and those moth guard-looking contraptions full of gel, but my nerves would get the better of me and I&#x27;d swallow the gel, resulting in some stomach issues.  Also, my teeth are super sensitive and I use sensitive toothpaste every day.  Needless to say I was a little apprehensive, but for the price they were worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I am so, so, so glad I ordered these!  They aren&#x27;t as sticky as they could be as others have mentioned, and I have an issue of a permanent bar on the back of my lower teeth, but after a couple minutes they fit well.  The gel isn&#x27;t squishy and likely to be swallowed, which is important if you&#x27;re inclined to try and swallow it like I am.  After only 15 minutes into my first time using these, I could tell a visible difference looking in the mirror.  After 30 my teeth are a good 2-3 shades lighter.  That&#x27;s after only the first use!  I will update this review as I continue to use them, as if after one use I&#x27;m so happy, I&#x27;m thrilled to see what 14 will be!</li>
            <li> These strips definitely make your teeth much whiter in just half an hour!!! Amazing!  Honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect such a great result! Thank you for the super quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different whitening strips for awhile and came across this one. As soon as it arrived I tried it out..the next day I received compliments on how white my teeth are! I can see a difference instantly! I&#x27;ll buy this again :-)</li>
            <li> Guess it wasn&#x27;t meant to be</li>
            <li> after 1 use my teeth are very sensitive now.</li>
            <li> Great price work, amazingly!</li>
            <li> These strips work very well. Granted my teeth were not terribly yellow, about a 4-5 on the shade scale, but they are noticeably whiter after 1 use. I couldn&#x27;t do 30 minutes so I managed 20 minutes. In general, whitening strips, gel trays etc make my mouth water like crazy and I can barely talk but for the price and result; you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> These strips does not work, do not waste your time buying and trying them. Most days it looked like my teeth were more stained than before I started using the strips. Well they say you get what you pay for but this was a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Product was reasonably priced but did not work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> These are great! I saw results after my first treatment. And totally afforable. I will buy these again for sure.</li>
            <li> These are the best and most cost effective  strips I&#x27;ve used to date. &amp;#34;Stickier&amp;#34; than crest whitestrips, and no pain. Can definitely tell a difference after one use.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. Seems to work good. Only drawback is it leaves my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> Works as well a most base white strips for much less</li>
            <li> Only a couple days in but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant at first but they really do work! I&#x27;ve only used 5 strips and already have seen my teeth shades whiter! No joke, get these.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a difference within a one time use. It&#x27;s almost unpleasant having it on my teeth though. It feels as if i can&#x27;t open my mouth to talk because I don&#x27;t want to swallow the peroxide. Usually use it while i shower, makes those 30 minutes go faster. Not bad at all for the price.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and results can be seen almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Did not do much of a difference on my teeth. Hardy noticeable.</li>
            <li> Awful. Ive used the majority of the amount that came but I am not sure why I put myself through the torture. doesn&#x27;t stay on, get everywhere, made teeth look spotty like spit stains. DO NOT PURCHASE</li>
            <li> Everything is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Only thing is, they do not stick that great, after about 20 mins they are start to come loose. They do, do an awesome job though of whitening</li>
            <li> They leave goo on my teeth but work ok for whitening</li>
            <li> Ok so I usually use the crest kind,and was kind of iffy about ordering these strips but since im on disability and short on money i decided to try these. Well let me just say they work just as well. My teeth where getting very yellow since i was drinking more coffee, so i got these and stopped drinking as much coffee and voila! White teeth again. I will definitely be ordering more when i run out. Shipping was great as always</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00BR0H6KY Professional Strength Teeth Whitening Strips 28 Count - 14 Day Supply + Bonus Shade Guide]]I must be the first disappointed customer to have tried this no name product. I completed the 14 day treatment and honestly I did not see much difference in a whiter shade for my teeth. Do not get me wrong my teeth are clean &amp; whiter than most! I will say I achieved a slight whiter shade from when I started, but nothing to write an excellent review or give the product a 5 star rating! AND WHERE&#x27;S THE BONUS SHADE GUIDE? It was not included in the order. Next time I will go with the product which I used before sold by W......(rhymes with high art)!</li>
            <li> They work well, they didn&#x27;t irritate my gums at all. I use one of the strips about once a week to keep my teeth white and it works well.</li>
            <li> According to the level of whiteness guide card that this kit comes with, my teeth were at about level 12 of yellow. I used the strips every DAT for three days in a row and after every use I already noticed great results. I gave my teeth a break for a few days, just in case they might get too sensitive, and on the fourth day of using the strips (today) my teeth are at level 3!! This is amazing and the price is unbelievable!! I won&#x27;t even have to finish the whole 14-day pack. I&#x27;ll just save it for future uses, but I am so impress. This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever trued that are way more expensive. My teeth aren&#x27;t even super noticeably sensitive either! Will definitely repurchase for life!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second round of these strips and my teeth are noticeably whiter. For this price and how easy it is to put them on I&#x27;m so surprised that they actually work this well. My friends even noticed that my teeth where whiter even though they didn&#x27;t know I was using them. Only issue is that if you already have cuts in your mouth, I think these make it so they take longer to heal. I think they might have also made my gums pretty sensitive, but it also could have just been my new toothbrush, not sure but it&#x27;s worth mentioning. That&#x27;s small though and they work really well!!</li>
            <li> I love these! They are a great product at a great price. I received many a few compliments already in just a weeks use. I feel very confident smiling, I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> While I did not use the strips every day consecutively, I have used all of them and do see a difference. My teeth are not brilliantly white&lt;br /&gt;nor as white as they would probably be after a zapping treatment or two costing hundreds of dollars but nonetheless, they look better. I will order the strips again. What I like most about this whitening treatment is the ease of use. You stick the strips on as instructed, leave them in place for thirty minutes and you are done!  A whole lot easier and way less messy than the teeth whitening tray method. I will say, give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. I use about 6 days in a row and can personally see a big difference. Then I wait a few weeks then do the remaining. Good product I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
