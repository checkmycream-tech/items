            <li>I wear it for day or night, and even after 28 years, I frequently smell my wrists as I&#x27;m wearing it, it&#x27;s that wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great perfume and also share some great artist such as Michael Jackson.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of Bal a Versailles is very fine and make you feel confident wearing it.</li>
            <li>This cologne is good for a quick spritz though, and works well as a body spray.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love that I am able to wear something that he really enjoyed.</li>
            <li>As I was looking on the internet after his death I saw that this fragrance was his favorite</li>
            <li>If you like musk, you&#x27;ll love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I also love the bottle.</li>
            <li>I just love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love the sent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the price I love how I smell after using it.</li>
            <li>She really love the fragancy.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Bal a Versailles is one of my favorite Perfums .</li>
            <li>I love this exotic and elegant smell , I get a lot of compliment .</li>
            <li>I was glad I could purchase online as I cannot find it in any store anymore...</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for about a year now, and we love it.</li>
            <li>It sold for over a grand.  </li>
            <li>We feel confident this was indeed Michael&#x27;s favorite perfume; one of many he no doubt used.</li>
            <li>It has been a favorite of mine for many years.</li>
            <li>And the top is plastic, it is suppose to be glass.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume as much as I love Shalimar from Guerlain.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?  </li>
            <li>have used this for more than 40 years...</li>
            <li>Not only was Michael handsome, talented, loving, and kind</li>
            <li>I was so excited!</li>
            <li>But, it did not smell at all like the original scent which I love.  </li>
            <li>It is a strong perfurm for women with strong personality.</li>
            <li>soo quick !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read that some people referred to his scent as soft or light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Michael Jackson fan and like the rest of the world, was devastated when we lost him this June.</li>
            <li>It is similar in quality to a lighter version Tabu which I wore for many years and loved.</li>
            <li>Bal A Versailles is my absolute favorite of Michael Jackson&#x27;s favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>It is a fragrance that captures the essence of orange blossom and amber perfectly, and it is not too sweet or spicy, but subtle and exotic and alluring.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Because I am such a huge fan of Michael&#x27;s, I had to try it, I ordered a bottle of it, and I can see why Michael loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>But make no mistake, the full potency of the perfume is far more sublime.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks for the fast delivery of the perfume !  </li>
            <li>It sure helps to keep the passion alive after 21 years of marriage!</li>
            <li>It is a classic scent, but it does not smell old ladyish, and as it dries down, the exotic scent of amber emerges brilliantly.</li>
            <li>It is pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this to anyone who likes a light, fruity/flowery fragrance.</li>
            <li>So,for any female fans of our precious Michael who have heard that this was what he wore all the time and if what it smells like, order yourself a bottle of it.</li>
            <li>and I was so glad it is still the same.  </li>
            <li>I first found this fragrance while looking through my grandmothers 150+ perfume bottle collection,</li>
            <li>Elegant and deep.</li>
            <li>First of all I want to say that I never got my idem</li>
            <li>I received it the next day :)</li>
            <li>I first discovered this fragrance, when a gentleman told my Mother to try it, because he found it so intoxicating and alluring.  </li>
            <li>pro&#x27;s: shippin was fast, pretty bottle</li>
            <li>the packaging doesn&#x27;t match the real product my wife has been using for 1000 years....</li>
            <li>The supplier was very prompt in fulfilling my order.</li>
            <li>Does it fit with my current life?  </li>
            <li>I started given this to my bride , when I was a young  U S Marine  over seas , Now almost 50 years later its still our favorite.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this perfume for all the classic perfumes&#x27; fans, it is really the classic for all the ages, you only hjave to have the special mood to approach it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that this is not soft, in my opinion, but it is a fragrance that I enjoy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so nice that I like to wear it a couple of times a week at least.    </li>
            <li>Always take advantage of these deals that are available and so no regrets later.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gift for my new girlfriend who I wanted to impress.</li>
            <li>This may sound odd</li>
            <li>This is clearly counterfeit product..</li>
            <li>the fragrance is not the same as the real product.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for nearly 35 years.  </li>
            <li>I had a sample of this in high school from a teacher who went to Frances and brought everyone some samples back.</li>
            <li>Finally found it at a regular retail store last week and it was the real product.....</li>
            <li>We love it and are completely addicted.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing Bal a Versailles for about 28 years, and it still holds its power, keeping ahead of every new fragrance that tries to out-beat it.</li>

            <li> and I think you should treat your long time customers accordingly-maybe a discount.</li>
            <li> What a big let down.</li>
            <li> and I was curious.</li>
            <li> but I was always curious as to how he smelled.</li>
            <li> :  this was not what i expected, instead it smelled musky and cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cologne has a slightly sharper scent than the perfume</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong like some perfumes, it doesn&#x27;t smell flowery or feminine like some women&#x27;s fragrances do</li>
            <li> It is almost 3 times what I have paid in the past.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my disappointment, wow, why me.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to get this perfume!  </li>
            <li> This &#x27;perfume&#x27; is very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> As this fragrance is difficult to find, I took a chance and purchased it, but immediately found out I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> botlte was either a fake product or a defective</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to say the least!  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;It smelled so bad that I had to shower after I used it to remove the stench.&lt;br /&gt;And . . .</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> i hate waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is my go to perfume ever since 1980. This is the same fragrance as 35 years ago. So grateful I can still find and purchase it!</li>
            <li> This &#x27;perfume&#x27; is very hard to find.  It is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne because I learned that it was one of several that was used by Michael Jackson and I was curious. This may sound odd but I was always curious as to how he smelled. I&#x27;d read that some people referred to his scent as soft or light and pleasant. I was surprised to find that this is not soft, in my opinion, but it is a fragrance that I enjoy. It is similar in quality to a lighter version Tabu which I wore for many years and loved. I would recommend this to anyone male or female. I love that I am able to wear something that he really enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Michael Jackson fan and like the rest of the world, was devastated when we lost him this June. As I was looking on the internet after his death I saw that this fragrance was his favorite and he wore it all the time in the perfume version. Because I am such a huge fan of Michael&#x27;s, I had to try it, I ordered a bottle of it, and I can see why Michael loved it so much.  It&#x27;s become one of my favorites as well now too and it&#x27;s so nice that I like to wear it a couple of times a week at least.    It&#x27;s subtle but full bodied and the fragrance is long lasting. It&#x27;s very,very nice and it would smell as good on a man as on a woman. If you like musk, you&#x27;ll love this fragrance. It&#x27;s not strong like some perfumes, it doesn&#x27;t smell flowery or feminine like some women&#x27;s fragrances do, you just smell really nice when you wear it. Not only was Michael handsome, talented, loving, and kind but he had wonderful taste too.     I tried looking for this fragrance in the store but the only place you can get it is through mail order. Michael got his through mail order as well.     So,for any female fans of our precious Michael who have heard that this was what he wore all the time and if what it smells like, order yourself a bottle of it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Rest In Peace darling.</li>
            <li> All went perfect .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Purchased for a lady who has used the fragrance before. Smiled when she got it...</li>
            <li> Great perfume.  Quick delivery. This is my childhood scent and I was so glad it is still the same.  I also love the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is PERFECT !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume. I first found this fragrance while looking through my grandmothers 150+ perfume bottle collection, some 27 years ago. I was looking for a gift for my new girlfriend who I wanted to impress. When my grandmother handed me Bal a Versailles I knew it was the one. And it&#x27;s no granny fragrance. Elegant and deep. The girlfriend became my wife and I makesure she always has some on hand and all the rest of her. It sure helps to keep the passion alive after 21 years of marriage! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You have to buy this one!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Bal a Versailles for about 28 years, and it still holds its power, keeping ahead of every new fragrance that tries to out-beat it. It is a fragrance that captures the essence of orange blossom and amber perfectly, and it is not too sweet or spicy, but subtle and exotic and alluring. It is a classic scent, but it does not smell old ladyish, and as it dries down, the exotic scent of amber emerges brilliantly. I wear it for day or night, and even after 28 years, I frequently smell my wrists as I&#x27;m wearing it, it&#x27;s that wonderful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how places get away with this. This is clearly counterfeit product..the fragrance is not the same as the real product..... the packaging doesn&#x27;t match the real product my wife has been using for 1000 years....As this fragrance is difficult to find, I took a chance and purchased it, but immediately found out I was ripped off. Finally found it at a regular retail store last week and it was the real product.....avoid this product from this supplier!!!</li>
            <li> Bal A Versailles by Jean Deprez.  Have used for years.  Good Price!!  Was great not to pay an arm and leg.</li>
            <li> I love the sent.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it then my sister wanted one and then my mom joined.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I love how I smell after using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product !!! Thank you</li>
            <li> This Eau de toilette was a gift for my mother. She really love the fragancy. Packing was perfect, and arrives perfectly. It is a strong perfurm for women with strong personality. I love it</li>
            <li> As I remembered; heavenly.</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say that I never got my idem soo quick ! I received it the next day :) Bal a Versailles is one of my favorite Perfums . I am french and I have been using it for almost 30 years. I love this exotic and elegant smell , I get a lot of compliment .</li>
            <li> It is so hard to get this perfume!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Has been my favorite perfume forever! I was glad I could purchase online as I cannot find it in any store anymore...</li>
            <li> Great service ! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for 50 years.  Your price for this product is obnoxious.  It is almost 3 times what I have paid in the past.  The  only reason I paid this obnoxious price is because I was out.  I am a very good customer of yours and I think you should treat your long time customers accordingly-maybe a discount.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product, shipping and packaging was superb. The scent Divine! Bal A Versailles is my absolute favorite of Michael Jackson&#x27;s favorite colognes. Thank you for offering such a great product at a wonderful price and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume ! Have been using since 1980s. Way over priced but can&#x27;t find it anywhere so I paid the price and I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for about a year now, and we love it. It&#x27;s earthy, soothing and instantly takes me away. I honestly think I would have loved this, even if it wasn&#x27;t Michael&#x27;s fave.  But they recently auctioned off a an autographed personal bottle of Mike&#x27;s BAV. It sold for over a grand.  We feel confident this was indeed Michael&#x27;s favorite perfume; one of many he no doubt used. We love it and are completely addicted.  Like Michael, it&#x27;s simply sublime. But make no mistake, the full potency of the perfume is far more sublime.  This cologne is good for a quick spritz though, and works well as a body spray.  Try spraying it in your sheets; maybe you&#x27;ll dream of Michael. Worked for us!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for years and years and had L-U-V loved it.&lt;br /&gt;This botlte was either a fake product or a defective product.&lt;br /&gt;It smelled so bad that I had to shower after I used it to remove the stench.&lt;br /&gt;And . . . because it is liquid and flammable, I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for nearly 35 years.  The cologne has a slightly sharper scent than the perfume but it&#x27;s still very nice.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this fragrance, when a gentleman told my Mother to try it, because he found it so intoxicating and alluring.  It has been a favorite of mine for many years.</li>
            <li> Felicissima di aver finalmente trovato un fornitore del Bal A Versailles, qui in Italia non si trova più...&lt;br /&gt;Spedizione e consegna velocissima, anche molto prima del previsto!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cinque stelle meritatissime!!!&lt;br /&gt;Grazie, ripeterò senz&#x27;altro l&#x27;ordine!!!</li>
            <li> Fast service, packaged very good, and was as described. This is for a friend, she broke her only bottle, I told her I&#x27;d find it for her and she was so happy when I did. I&#x27;d order from you again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great service</li>
            <li> Thank you for a speedy delivery, however, this is not Bal A Versailles. It smells like Chantilly with a touch of Channel. I don&#x27;t like it. And the top is plastic, it is suppose to be glass. What happened? I recognize the company got sold, maybe this is why the scent has changed. I can&#x27;t believe my disappointment, wow, why me. I was so excited! What a big let down.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume as much as I love Shalimar from Guerlain. I  always order  both of them from Amazon. The fragrance of Bal a Versailles is very fine and make you feel confident wearing it.</li>
            <li> It was wonderful to be able to purchase this beautiful fragrance because it isn&#x27;t even in stock at the stores. It is pricey but worth it. The supplier was very prompt in fulfilling my order. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?  The scent brings me back 30 years ago to a wonderful woman I was proud to have learned from.  Does it fit with my current life?  No, but who cares?  I wear it anyway.</li>
            <li> I received your product, Bal A Versailles, in a timely fashion. But, it did not smell at all like the original scent which I love.  I was very disappointed to say the least!  I csnnot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this in high school from a teacher who went to Frances and brought everyone some samples back. I had been looking for this fragrance for over 20 years and found here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of compliments when I wear it and scent lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes a light, fruity/flowery fragrance.</li>
            <li> I started given this to my bride , when I was a young  U S Marine  over seas , Now almost 50 years later its still our favorite.</li>
            <li> have used this for more than 40 years...</li>
            <li> Many thanks for the fast delivery of the perfume !  Really enjoyed it ! I would recommend this perfume for all the classic perfumes&#x27; fans, it is really the classic for all the ages, you only hjave to have the special mood to approach it!&lt;br /&gt;Again, I would recoomend this seller, too.</li>
            <li> pro&#x27;s: shippin was fast, pretty bottle&lt;br /&gt;con&#x27;s:  this was not what i expected, instead it smelled musky and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;i even let people at work smell the spray, because of the return policy, i was gonna give it away.  i hate waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t give it away... so keep in mind, this is not a spray for everyone.  wish there were a way you could get a sample prior to buying.  hope this helps</li>
            <li> Excellent aroma, excellent presentation, is an ornament in my dresser. I smell it again and again, and delight. Always take advantage of these deals that are available and so no regrets later. Great perfume and also share some great artist such as Michael Jackson.</li>
