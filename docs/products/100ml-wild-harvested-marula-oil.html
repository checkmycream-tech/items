            <li>Great way to turn 55!  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product I don&#x27;t think very many women know about.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very effective moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a plant oil with medium viscosity, and it absorbs into skin fairly well.  </li>
            <li>It feels really good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I had been using Marula oil from a named beauty store for about six months and loved it.</li>
            <li>but it good for night time use and did not make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Great light oil for skin and hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice on feet at night, with socks</li>
            <li>use it along with Desert date, Tamanu oil, Rose hip &amp; Kalahari.</li>
            <li>Would be good for the face as its so light.</li>
            <li>0ne of my favorite oils.</li>
            <li>It works more like a lotion pump.  </li>
            <li>I like the packaging, but it could be better.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped to see more benefits.  </li>
            <li>The oil is everything it was purported to be and more.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a good product, other reviewers seem happy with it.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Ok first of all yes this is the real deal!!!</li>
            <li>This oil is very light and moisturizes my face and neck very well.</li>
            <li>This oil is not bad...</li>
            <li>This brand is pure and smells natural, earthy but pleasant.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin quickly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Just apply immediately after a shower to seal in moisture quickly.</li>
            <li>It was so much more affordable, and I can use more of it as a body oil instead of just a facial oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good on cuticles and those doggone dry patches on my knuckles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also a good spot moisturizer for very dry areas.  </li>
            <li>If you do put oil on your hair or scalp, this is definitely worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks fresh and dewy.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is an all natural product.  </li>
            <li>slight pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear in color (more refined) than the Leaky Marula oil which is more yellow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whatever you use it for, you could buy a similar product at a higher price that isn&#x27;t any better.  </li>
            <li>I personally do not like the way it feels on my face, and I can&#x27;t use it on my hair, because my hair is too fine.  </li>
            <li>so I can really comment on the product itself.</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>Non greasy and very emolient.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it works any better than other products I have tried that have a lower cost.</li>
            <li>Hair yet looks full and natural, not limp or oversprayed.  </li>
            <li>Way better deal than the overpriced stuff, don&#x27;t be fooled and line other peoples pockets with your money, get this one!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Three pumps dispenses enough oil for my face and neck, with enough left to rub into my cuticles which are benefiting nicely.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>The claimed benefits were enough to make me do a little research on it, and based on what I read, I looked for it on Amazon to find a more reasonable price point and chose this brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough for really dry areas like the heels and elbows, too.</li>
            <li>It sinks into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Face looks well nourished and soft.</li>
            <li>A very little goes a long way; my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I advise you to keep it capped and in a dark place when not in use to prevent light and air from breaking down the antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>I live in Colorado where it is very dry.</li>
            <li>I even put it directly on my face at the end of a very dry day</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The bottle was defective so I can really comment on the product itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value.  it was much less expensive than other brands yet the quality seems just as good.  I will definately use this service when I need to replace my oil.</li>
            <li> Marula oil takes care of the frizzies without taking away the body.  Hair yet looks full and natural, not limp or oversprayed.  Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> 0ne of my favorite oils. slight pleasant scent. absorbs well. a little dab will do you. competitively priced. benign, no irritation, soothing.</li>
            <li> I recently read about marula oil, and that it contains vitamins A, C, and E, if I recall correctly.  There are lots of oils that can be used on skin or hair, but not all of them have antioxidants, so I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no added fragrance.  It&#x27;s a plant oil with medium viscosity, and it absorbs into skin fairly well.  I personally do not like the way it feels on my face, and I can&#x27;t use it on my hair, because my hair is too fine.  I use this primarily after a shower.  I towel off my torso, step out of the shower, and put four or five squirts on each arm, and five or six squirts on each leg.  Then I rapidly rub it around on my wet skin.  It&#x27;s a very effective moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though packaged with a spray pump, the oil is to thick to spray.  It works more like a lotion pump.  I like the packaging, but it could be better.  An opaque bottle and airtight seal would have behooved me to rate this five stars.  I advise you to keep it capped and in a dark place when not in use to prevent light and air from breaking down the antioxidants.  There are no preservatives, aside from the antioxidants, so when you get it, use it.  The bottle will last a surprisingly long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a good spot moisturizer for very dry areas.  It&#x27;s nice on feet at night, with socks so you don&#x27;t mess up your sheets.  Don&#x27;t oil your feet in the daytime.  You&#x27;ll be slip-sliding in your shoes all day.  It&#x27;s good on cuticles and those doggone dry patches on my knuckles.  If you do put oil on your hair or scalp, this is definitely worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you use it for, you could buy a similar product at a higher price that isn&#x27;t any better.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used the more expensive Leaky Marula oil, but thought I would try this one given the cheaper price. It did not heal my skin the way the Leaky one does. It&#x27;s clear in color (more refined) than the Leaky Marula oil which is more yellow. They are not equal.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to see more benefits.  I didn&#x27;t think it works any better than other products I have tried that have a lower cost.</li>
            <li> People are asking me what I did to my skin.  It looks fresh and dewy.  Great way to turn 55!  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and am giving some to my sister too!</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil after seeing it in a catalog at an outrageous price. The claimed benefits were enough to make me do a little research on it, and based on what I read, I looked for it on Amazon to find a more reasonable price point and chose this brand. The oil is everything it was purported to be and more. A very little goes a long way; my skin has never looked better. It&#x27;s of a small enough molecular structure that it penetrates well around my eyes, making the need for special eye products unnecessary. Three pumps dispenses enough oil for my face and neck, with enough left to rub into my cuticles which are benefiting nicely. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It feels really good on my skin. A bit annoyed that I ordered an extra product to get free shipping and they charged me for shipping anyway.</li>
            <li> I had been using Marula oil from a named beauty store for about six months and loved it. I even told my sister-in-law about it. I have combination skin and Marula oil absorbs well without clogging pores she found this oil on Amazon. I live in Colorado where it is very dry. I squirt a little oil in with my body lotion and my hand cream and it really helps. I even put it directly on my face at the end of a very dry day and it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found no difference between the expensive oil and this oil. With the expensive oil the bottle is constructed badly and easy to spill. This oil, no problem. Love it</li>
            <li> This oil is very light and moisturizes my face and neck very well. It sinks into my skin quickly. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> i lost my hair due to chemo. i am hoping this hair product will help in the re growth, its a slow process.</li>
            <li> I love that it is an all natural product.  It absorbs into your skin quickly and is not greasy.  It makes my face feel as if I&#x27;ve just had a facial!</li>
            <li> love it. use it along with Desert date, Tamanu oil, Rose hip &amp; Kalahari.</li>
            <li> I am black and  I use this product on my face. Non greasy and very emolient. Use it before going into the sun. Face looks well nourished and soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife, but had to return it. It caused her face to immediately break out in a rash. It&#x27;s probably a good product, other reviewers seem happy with it. I guess there was just something in it that she was allergic to.</li>
            <li> Arrived smelling rancid.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all yes this is the real deal!!! I bought the really expensive stuff too, you know in that fancy smaller bottle for over $75 bucks and yuck they use rosemary in that. This brand is pure and smells natural, earthy but pleasant. Way better deal than the overpriced stuff, don&#x27;t be fooled and line other peoples pockets with your money, get this one!</li>
            <li> This oil is not bad...it&#x27;s a bit sticky and takes a few minutes to absorb into the skin but it good for night time use and did not make my skin break out. I have normal skin</li>
            <li> Marula oil goes on easier than coconut oil and works on my face and body in place of moisturizers. I&#x27;ve been using it about one year now and have no reason to go back to expensive facial care products nor toxic body moisturizers. It&#x27;s strong enough for really dry areas like the heels and elbows, too. Just apply immediately after a shower to seal in moisture quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like the product. I had purchased the same product but with a hint of fragrance at a store for $78.00, so I wanted to give this one a try also. It was so much more affordable, and I can use more of it as a body oil instead of just a facial oil. They both work the same.</li>
            <li> Great light oil for skin and hair. No smell. Would be good for the face as its so light. Love it</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product I don&#x27;t think very many women know about.  I have bought the most expensive products and this has worked wonders on my face.  I use it at night so I&#x27;m not concerned about the oil making my hair oily during the day.</li>
