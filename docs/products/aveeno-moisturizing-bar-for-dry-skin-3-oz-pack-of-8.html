            <li>Love this soap for hands and body.  </li>

            <li>I have been using it for more than 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I love the body wash too from this company.</li>
            <li>glad Amazon has it</li>
            <li>Have used Aveeno for many years.  </li>
            <li>I am sure glad Amazon has it in stock again.</li>
            <li>Some of the soaps in hotels today seem to be vying for the title of most vile smell in a soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap</li>
            <li>but with a great intense moisture creaminess to it.</li>
            <li>, I recommend this product 1000% and more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many soaps, and invariably there are ingredients I&#x27;m allergic to.  </li>
            <li>i like the liquid soap version much better</li>
            <li>.. hope they will make it more cheaper so that i can sell it</li>
            <li>more cheaper..</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and I love using it.</li>
            <li>I love all the Aveeno Line</li>
            <li>This is a favorite product, but not so easy to find.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AWESOME on eczema and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it in Canada any more, but glad it&#x27;s available here</li>
            <li>The only flaw is it doesn&#x27;t lather on very good</li>
            <li>, however the Shower wash Aveeno offers works great fo me.</li>
            <li>So many fragrance free items still bother me, not this one.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It comes unscented and scented with a very mild scent.  </li>
            <li>We have sensitive skin, older skin and think this is perfect for us.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell to it, but you wont smell it during the day.  </li>
            <li>The oatmeal makes for a smooth surface without irritation.</li>
            <li>cheap for the price of 8</li>
            <li>this product is great for dry skin and keeps your skin moist and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s milky and washes clean away.</li>
            <li>What a relief to be calm and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It smells good, does not irritate my skin, and last a while.  </li>
            <li>They melt away relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>It can also be used for mild cases of dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect some sort of quick miracle cure.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, it even cleared up a sty that, prior to using Aveeno, I couldn&#x27;t get rid of for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds of sensitive soap, and each had the same result of being fine the first month, but eventually causing rashes.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>and this is healing them really, really well, worth the money.</li>
            <li>When it dries out between showers, it lasts as long as most soaps.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a very mild psoriasis for the last 10 years</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for it, but have seven bars to go.  </li>
            <li>I have also found it to be very helpful for preventing and curing skin infections from cuts and scrapes.  </li>
            <li>Never irritating or drying.</li>
            <li>I really like Aveeno bar soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 4 months because I have hand eczema,it works very well by not irritating the eczema</li>
            <li>Helps keep my sensitive face as clean and fresh as possible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well, but I don&#x27;t care because I bought this to cure my dry skin and that&#x27;s exactly what it did.</li>
            <li>The soap is made from natural oat meal and very gentle to my hands</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Very clean feel, without any fragrance or heavy after residue.  </li>
            <li>although doesn&#x27;t make a lot of foam, it cleans great and my small pink spots are faded completely</li>
            <li>I love the soap and it arrived on time--but there were two layers of plastic wrap around the groups of bars, in addition to the (expected) layer of plastic inside the individual bar box.</li>
            <li>Aveeno&#x27;s moisturizing bar is the only bar that I have found so far that is consistent and works very well for extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Amazon made it easy to get, it was cheaper even with the shipping, and I didn&#x27;t have to waste gas looking for it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear it overnight</li>
            <li>It also arrived early, which was a plus.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, Aveeno Moisturizing Bar is a wonderfully gentle facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>A recent stay at a hotel made me wonder who wants to smell like an avocado after they wash their hands?</li>
            <li>Now my eczema is almost completely cleared and doesn&#x27;t burn whenever I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t smell nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried topical creams (OTC and prescription) as well as lavender oil and allergy shots, but these little soaps seem to be the only thing that keeps the eczema under control; again, it took a while, but my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.</li>
            <li>but, for the first time in 3 summers, my skin no longer looks like a mess from so much scratching and itching.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin which exacerbates my eczema symptoms during the dog days of summer (Hot, Hazy, Humid).</li>
            <li>and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean at a potential other soaps</li>
            <li>I usually like and often prefer Aveeno products because of other products I&#x27;ve liked made by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s more expensive than regular soap, the benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li>And I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin, it&#x27;s still dry.</li>
            <li>I also have dry skin and the oatmeal soap is very moisterizing.</li>
            <li>This soap really helps with dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this the only soap I use to wash my hands.</li>
            <li>It is not a hard-milled soap and will not last long if exposed to too much water in a soap dish or in direct line of water from a shower.  </li>
            <li>and I bet that anyone with psoriasis has tried a bunch of products to improve, some are good and some seem to make it worse, especially with soaps (some of them clean but made it worse, some just don&#x27;t do anything)</li>
            <li>It works well for cleansing, just keep it out of constant water because it gets soft and bendable.  </li>
            <li>Decided I wanted to use an organic / natural soap and used this face bar for my entire body and got rid of the rash.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 82 yrs old father because he&#x27;s having problem with regular soaps.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this soap to others who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I keep ours in a soap dish fastened at head height near the back of our shower.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry your face out.  </li>
            <li>If you have complex skin that needs something special</li>
            <li>Aveeno gave me back the ability to bare my legs...</li>
            <li>I received the order quickly, no mistakes, and at a reasonable price  .....   </li>

            <li> The only reason it is not 5 stars is that the bars don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> not soft enough for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff has no perfumes and doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin and actually isn&#x27;t \\&quot;soap\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The oatmeal is very soothing and no more dry spots.</li>
            <li> I find that in a dry climate I don&#x27;t want anything that will overly dry out my skin, this bar doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> There is no scent, which I like, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry OR filmy</li>
            <li> My daughter has really dry skin on her hands</li>
            <li> I bought these bars to help my skin not to feel dry</li>
            <li> and yet my skin still feel dry</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it moisturizes or just doesn&#x27;t strip away natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I use this product, Aveno Soap, exclusively as I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I never had allergies until I reached my late 40&#x27;s, but have developed sensitivity to deodorants, shampoos and soaps.  </li>
            <li> Did not give me the results I expected</li>
            <li> It has gotten harder over the years to find a soap that won &#x27;t cause redness,  inflammation,  itching, or burning.</li>
            <li> not really what i was looking for in a moisturizing agent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there didn&#x27;t seem anything to distinguish this particular product from others, especially as I was looking for some relief from poison ivy--a difficult act to follow</li>
            <li> Due to severe allergies</li>
            <li> I cannot use scented soaps so I switched a couple of years ago to the Aveeno Oatmeal soap after trying other unscented brands on the market.</li>
            <li> so I use other option</li>
            <li> selling them for other people</li>
            <li> I use other Aveeno products, too - tinted moisturizer and body lotion.</li>
            <li> Also the product is hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> This helps to settle down your tingling and itching sensations.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin or eczema, there is no better soap than aveeno.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a bit less packaging?</li>
            <li> It is hard to find at a lot of stores locally, and when I do find it at some stores, they want excessive prices for it.  </li>
            <li> I have had terrible eczema on my legs for the past year until I started using this soap along with All Free &amp; Clear laundry detergent and the Aveeno Skin Relief lotion.</li>
            <li> I get little acne bumps on my arms since I started using this,although the soap doesn&#x27;t irritate them,other soaps like lever seem to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> No strong chemical perfumes.</li>
            <li> Anyway usually fragrances in soaps are the harmful ingredient to our skin anyway</li>
            <li> The bar is very hard and does not lather.  </li>
            <li> it is a bit expensive and wish Costco carried</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product--can&#x27;t find in stores here.</li>
            <li> If you like Aveeno products, this is the soap to use if you&#x27;ve been working in the lawn, mowing, trimming, or have hay fever. This helps to settle down your tingling and itching sensations. Use it together with Aveeno lotions.</li>
            <li> If you have complex skin that needs something special this is the bar for you.  It is good for people with allergies, it keeps pimples at bay, and leaves your face feeling clean.  I find that in a dry climate I don&#x27;t want anything that will overly dry out my skin, this bar doesn&#x27;t.  It has a light smell to it, but you wont smell it during the day.  It gets bubbly but not too bubbly.  Perfect for every day use.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I saw this soap while shoping for lotion for a friend.  This is a favorite product, but not so easy to find.</li>
            <li> Pedi mi producto hace un mes y no me lo an mandado les e mandado emails y no me responden Se robaron mi dinero</li>
            <li> Did not give me the results I expected, however the Shower wash Aveeno offers works great fo me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this the only soap I use to wash my hands. The soap is made from natural oat meal and very gentle to my hands</li>
            <li> The only reason it is not 5 stars is that the bars don&#x27;t last long.  They melt away relatively quickly.  It is totally unscented which my nose loves!</li>
            <li> I love this bar!  So many fragrance free items still bother me, not this one.  It works well for cleansing, just keep it out of constant water because it gets soft and bendable.  You can even grind it up and put it in your homemade laundry soap!</li>
            <li> this product is great for dry skin and keeps your skin moist and hydrated.  It comes unscented and scented with a very mild scent.  It can also be used for mild cases of dermatitis.  I recommend buying it in bulk because it comes out cheaper.</li>
            <li> Had rash, doctors didn&#x27;t know what it was. Decided I wanted to use an organic / natural soap and used this face bar for my entire body and got rid of the rash. YAY!  Only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t smell nice, it doesn&#x27;t stink but yeah...  Anyway usually fragrances in soaps are the harmful ingredient to our skin anyway so I guess thats why this soap helped me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this.  It&#x27;s the only soap that doesn&#x27;t produce allergic reactions in my skin.</li>
            <li> It has gotten harder over the years to find a soap that won &#x27;t cause redness,  inflammation,  itching, or burning. If you suffer any of these allergic reactions than this is the soap for you. What a relief to be calm and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap due to extremely sensitive skin. I have tried many kinds of sensitive soap, and each had the same result of being fine the first month, but eventually causing rashes. Aveeno&#x27;s moisturizing bar is the only bar that I have found so far that is consistent and works very well for extremely sensitive skin.  It also arrived early, which was a plus. I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 82 yrs old father because he&#x27;s having problem with regular soaps. Also the product is hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> Love this soap for hands and body.  Very clean feel, without any fragrance or heavy after residue.  Due to severe allergies this is what The Mayo Clinic recommended for me.  Safe to use on my face, but does not remove eye makeup.  But I would recommend as a body bar.</li>
            <li> I use this product, Aveno Soap, exclusively as I have very dry skin.  It is hard to find at a lot of stores locally, and when I do find it at some stores, they want excessive prices for it.  Amazon made it easy to get, it was cheaper even with the shipping, and I didn&#x27;t have to waste gas looking for it.</li>
            <li> The bar is very hard and does not lather.  I really don&#x27;t care for it, but have seven bars to go.  And I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin, it&#x27;s still dry.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin or eczema, there is no better soap than aveeno. The oatmeal is very soothing and no more dry spots.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin in certain areas.  This is the only soap that I can use without getting a rash.  I have been using it for more than 15 years.  Amazon had a good price on it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It&#x27;s milky and washes clean away. Makes my skin feel great. Only use it on my neck and face and am hooked.</li>
            <li> I like this soap. No strong chemical perfumes. I love the body wash too from this company. One time I had allergy reaction to tum chewables that are different flavors. My body broke out in rash from the dyes they use, and I used Aveeno body wash and Aveeno got rid the itching and redness.</li>
            <li> I cannot use scented soaps so I switched a couple of years ago to the Aveeno Oatmeal soap after trying other unscented brands on the market. I also have dry skin and the oatmeal soap is very moisterizing. Plus, the soap does not leave a reside like Ivory for example.</li>
            <li> My preferred &amp;#34;soap.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this soap for allergy prone skin and price nd delivery were great</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of dozen bars (stocking up). I love the soap and it arrived on time--but there were two layers of plastic wrap around the groups of bars, in addition to the (expected) layer of plastic inside the individual bar box. It took me 10 minutes just to get all the plastic wrap off. Perhaps a bit less packaging?</li>
            <li> I have allergies, this soap is the best. Don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it in Canada any more, but glad it&#x27;s available here</li>
            <li> Aveeno is a superb product for eczema people.  This is the ONLY soap I use.  I wish they did not do animal experiments.</li>
            <li> Great for general use,but especially effective against eczema!  I use the bar soap, liquid soap, and body oil....Aveeno gave me back the ability to bare my legs...once upon a time they were covered in red rashiness... all gone now!</li>
            <li> This soap really helps with dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME on eczema and dry skin. I have very dry skin which exacerbates my eczema symptoms during the dog days of summer (Hot, Hazy, Humid). It didn&#x27;t clear it overnight but, for the first time in 3 summers, my skin no longer looks like a mess from so much scratching and itching. I&#x27;ve tried topical creams (OTC and prescription) as well as lavender oil and allergy shots, but these little soaps seem to be the only thing that keeps the eczema under control; again, it took a while, but my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time. Just don&#x27;t expect some sort of quick miracle cure.</li>
            <li> I received the order quickly, no mistakes, and at a reasonable price  .....   what else could you ask for??  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin but this works real well without heavy odors or residue.  Worth the extra money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use as a face soap. Aveeno has always been an excellent product. I would definitely recommend this soap to others who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff has no perfumes and doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin and actually isn&#x27;t \\&quot;soap\\&quot;. It is great for every day in the shower. I&#x27;ve used it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my sensitive face as clean and fresh as possible.  Does not dry your face out.  Have been using for quite some time now...glad Amazon has it so I can buy a load at one time without running to the only store almost out of town here to get it!</li>
            <li> As others have noted, Aveeno Moisturizing Bar is a wonderfully gentle facial cleanser.  I have also found it to be very helpful for preventing and curing skin infections from cuts and scrapes.  Amazingly, it even cleared up a sty that, prior to using Aveeno, I couldn&#x27;t get rid of for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this on Amazon!  My husband and I have been using it for three years and I won&#x27;t try anything else now.  There is no scent, which I like, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin.  I am not sure if it moisturizes or just doesn&#x27;t strip away natural oils.  Either way, it works well for us.  It is not a hard-milled soap and will not last long if exposed to too much water in a soap dish or in direct line of water from a shower.  I keep ours in a soap dish fastened at head height near the back of our shower.  When it dries out between showers, it lasts as long as most soaps.  We have sensitive skin, older skin and think this is perfect for us.</li>
            <li> Have used Aveeno for many years.  Biggest satisfaction is that there is no allergy issue!!!  The oatmeal makes for a smooth surface without irritation.</li>
            <li> Been using Aveeno bar soap since the 70&#x27;s. I think it&#x27;s the best cleanser for face and body. Never irritating or drying.</li>
            <li> it keeps your skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> I really like Aveeno bar soap.  It smells good, does not irritate my skin, and last a while.  I am sure glad Amazon has it in stock again.</li>
            <li> None of the perfumes you see in hand hand and bath soaps today. I take a bar with me when I travel. Some of the soaps in hotels today seem to be vying for the title of most vile smell in a soap. A recent stay at a hotel made me wonder who wants to smell like an avocado after they wash their hands?</li>
            <li> I love this soap it is a bit expensive and wish Costco carried but it has just enough scrubbing power but with a great intense moisture creaminess to it. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry OR filmy I can&#x27;t explain but it is perfect and we pair it with our Aveeno body lotion which keeps our skin great through the day until tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a very mild psoriasis for the last 10 years and I bet that anyone with psoriasis has tried a bunch of products to improve, some are good and some seem to make it worse, especially with soaps (some of them clean but made it worse, some just don&#x27;t do anything), I tried this soap around two years ago and I will use it forever, although doesn&#x27;t make a lot of foam, it cleans great and my small pink spots are faded completely, I recommend this product 1000% and more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many soaps, and invariably there are ingredients I&#x27;m allergic to.  This one works for me.  No coconut oil, none of these chemicals that cause problems, no perfumes, etc.  Oats work for me!</li>
            <li> My daughter has really dry skin on her hands and this is healing them really, really well, worth the money.</li>
            <li> not really what i was looking for in a moisturizing agent. not soft enough for me. i like the liquid soap version much better</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno Bar for 30 years after a dermatologist recommended it.  Lately it has been difficult to find in retail stores and was happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> I bought these bars to help my skin not to feel dry and yet my skin still feel dry so I use other option&lt;br /&gt;Keep selling them for other people</li>
            <li> I usually like and often prefer Aveeno products because of other products I&#x27;ve liked made by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there didn&#x27;t seem anything to distinguish this particular product from others, especially as I was looking for some relief from poison ivy--a difficult act to follow but I didn&#x27;t get the relief I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I&#x27;ve found that does not cause an allergic reaction in my skin.  I never had allergies until I reached my late 40&#x27;s, but have developed sensitivity to deodorants, shampoos and soaps.  I use this soap to wash my hair as well.</li>
            <li> I have had terrible eczema on my legs for the past year until I started using this soap along with All Free &amp; Clear laundry detergent and the Aveeno Skin Relief lotion. Now my eczema is almost completely cleared and doesn&#x27;t burn whenever I get out of the shower. It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well, but I don&#x27;t care because I bought this to cure my dry skin and that&#x27;s exactly what it did.</li>
            <li> cheap for the price of 8.. hope they will make it more cheaper so that i can sell it more cheaper.. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 4 months because I have hand eczema,it works very well by not irritating the eczema and I love using it. The only flaw is it doesn&#x27;t lather on very good and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean at a potential other soaps do ( like lever 2000 ) for example. I get little acne bumps on my arms since I started using this,although the soap doesn&#x27;t irritate them,other soaps like lever seem to get rid of them. This soap is great none the less,very good for skin irritations.</li>
            <li> This product meets or exceeds the claims attributed to it. While it is &amp;#34;unscented,&amp;#34; as advertised, I now know I would have preferred a bar with scent.</li>
            <li> I love all the Aveeno Line it&#x27;s the best moisturizing soap I have ever used it&#x27;s great and good for the skin.</li>
            <li> Soap is soap.  I like this brand and it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> This product is great for anyone with sensitive skin. While it&#x27;s more expensive than regular soap, the benefits are worth it. I use other Aveeno products, too - tinted moisturizer and body lotion.</li>
