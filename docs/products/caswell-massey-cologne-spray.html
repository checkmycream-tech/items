            <li>one of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not called the Elixir of Love for nothing.    </li>
            <li>I bought this gift for my mom and she is in love with it.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I just love the scent.</li>
            <li>obviously I love</li>
            <li>I do understand that top notes like passionflower, jasmine and lavender will deteriorate over time, but I suspect something more has happened to the formula.  </li>
            <li>I adore this fragrance, my favorite</li>
            <li>Such a great scent for me !!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;she needed more and was complaining about not wanting to&lt;br /&gt;pay</li>
            <li>more potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never lost its magic.</li>
            <li>The missus likes this perfume and it has been her favorite for years.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>My wife love the fragrance</li>
            <li>and I love how she smells.</li>
            <li>LOVE Caswell-Massey.  </li>
            <li>a little goes a long way and it is a great deal and a beautiful bottle and beautiful packaging</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance, but it is so light</li>
            <li>(the item was not sealed and could easily have been opened) but the atomizer pump doesn&#x27;t work on this bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought perfumes that seemed very nice when I tried them in the store, but they overwhelmed me when I actually tried to use them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The original.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I love the scent of this cologne, because just about every other one I&#x27;ve ever tried either makes me sneeze or gets me queasy after I&#x27;ve had it on for a while.</li>
            <li>The REAL Elixir of Love</li>
            <li>lovely and very feminine without in any way being too sweet.</li>
            <li>It is not even packaged in that CM signature box (which should have been my first clue!).  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I sprayed some on and knew right away.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and beautiful blue glass bottle is the same, but not the content.  </li>
            <li>This one had such a strong cheap alcohol odor.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The bottle I purchased smells just as I remember EOL smelling when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>first bought it for her some years</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I finally bought a bottle.</li>
            <li>The price was unbeatable, especially when the website sells it for 10 bucks more.</li>
            <li>The scent has changed from a couple years ago when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just superstition on my part, due to its name, but I think I detect more of a twinkle in their eyes when I&#x27;ve spritzed myself with it, and my husband just seems to love me a little bit more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i didn&#x27;t really realize she continued to buy it</li>
            <li>I really do like the scent</li>
            <li>This is not the real McCoy.  </li>
            <li>This was very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on description plus all the reviews here and on Fragrantic.com, and I am so very happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was worried since this was really a blond purchase...</li>
            <li>Always a favorite - hard to find, but they seem to have changed the formula, it has a quick evaporation, used to be</li>
            <li>So classic.</li>
            <li>The first bottle of this I bought was back in 2008, and it was a true cobalt blue.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, that place has now closed, so I&#x27;m delighted to be able to order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell but the older version is heavier on the musk, while the newer is more floral.  </li>
            <li>always ordered this product directly from Casell Massey,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>has a soft almost grown up baby powder scent.  </li>
            <li>It wears really well and lasts moderately long.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The juice smells right, when it comes out, in a stream, after about ten pumps, and after the initial blast of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>but those scent is soft, dreamy, with a light musk and delicate floral.</li>
            <li>In fact, I was devastated when I ran out right before we were leaving for our honeymoon and the Caswell-Massey that used to be down the street was out of stock.</li>
            <li>In the future, I will order direct from Caswell-&lt;br /&gt;Massey because I&#x27;m assured of a product that works as it should.</li>
            <li>and I wish it would be fixed before I purchase my next bottle</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even smell it when I&#x27;m wearing it, though apparently men can.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> one of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not called the Elixir of Love for nothing.    I have quite literally had guys lean into my ear and take a big gigantic sniff like they were snorting coke from my neck!    Good stuff, don&#x27;t tell anyone I told you though. This is my secret fragrance and I always lie and tell unassuming gfs its something else, so they never smell like me. ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for my mom and she is in love with it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. I just love the scent. And the bottle is so beautiful with matching glass powder thingy. Its cheaper to buy online than in the store!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from BBeauty2U and i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a reflection on the seller (the item was not sealed and could easily have been opened) but the atomizer pump doesn&#x27;t work on this bottle.  It&#x27;s my 3rd bottle of this perfume- obviously I love it- but this one has a shiny spray pump whereas my others had a dull one.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;fit\\&quot; with the aesthetic of the bottle.  And it doesn&#x27;t function.  The juice smells right, when it comes out, in a stream, after about ten pumps, and after the initial blast of alcohol.  The first bottle of this I bought was back in 2008, and it was a true cobalt blue.  These newer bottles are purplish.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on...why do we insist on messing with good things?!           *****I would also like to add that after snatching up a \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; bottle on ebay (2005) I can vouch that since then this has been reformulated.  The bottle I purchased smells just as I remember EOL smelling when I first bought it.  It&#x27;s hard to tell but the older version is heavier on the musk, while the newer is more floral.  I do understand that top notes like passionflower, jasmine and lavender will deteriorate over time, but I suspect something more has happened to the formula.  FYI.</li>
            <li> I adore this fragrance, my favorite it fact, however the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. I wish it came in an ear de parfum!</li>
            <li> Such a great scent for me !!!&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorites!!!</li>
            <li> bought this for my sister for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;i first bought it for her some years back.&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t really realize she continued to buy it yearly.&lt;br /&gt;she needed more and was complaining about not wanting to&lt;br /&gt;pay the 45 to 50 dollar price for it.&lt;br /&gt;i was so happy when i saw it at amazon for 28 and change.&lt;br /&gt;yes it was the same size and all.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I use.&lt;br /&gt;I always ordered this product directly from Casell Massey,&lt;br /&gt;but because of the cost, I started to order thru Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Past several occasions, the spray does not work properly .&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to go to all the trouble of returning the item,&lt;br /&gt;because I really do like the scent so I&#x27;m living with the&lt;br /&gt;spray problem.  In the future, I will order direct from Caswell-&lt;br /&gt;Massey because I&#x27;m assured of a product that works as it should.</li>
            <li> Always a favorite - hard to find, but they seem to have changed the formula, it has a quick evaporation, used to be more potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Most annoying thing has been happening with the last 3 bottles I have purchased- I get about halfway through the bottle and it STOPS WORKING! it won&#x27;t dispense anymore, I have tried unclogging and taking it apart, but that is nearly impossible- something is defective with the spray mechanism and I wish it would be fixed before I purchase my next bottle</li>
            <li> This scent is one of a kind it is feminine sweet floral sexy beautiful and a little goes a long way and it is a great deal and a beautiful bottle and beautiful packaging</li>
            <li> This is not the real McCoy.  It is not even packaged in that CM signature box (which should have been my first clue!).  I sprayed some on and knew right away.  The REAL Elixir of Love (the seller even misspelled it!) has a soft almost grown up baby powder scent.  This one had such a strong cheap alcohol odor.  The cap was even a fake.  Kudos to Amazon for making good on a seller pushing a knock-off.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, but it is so light it is almost non-existant.  Would not purchase this product again.  Would like a slightly stronger fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume for years and I&#x27;m glad I finally bought a bottle. The price was unbeatable, especially when the website sells it for 10 bucks more.</li>
            <li> Great rpoduct -great price-will be back--thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I love the scent of this cologne, because just about every other one I&#x27;ve ever tried either makes me sneeze or gets me queasy after I&#x27;ve had it on for a while. I&#x27;ve bought perfumes that seemed very nice when I tried them in the store, but they overwhelmed me when I actually tried to use them. I remember scrubbing one off in an airport bathroom because it had sickened me in the cab on the ride out. But this one&#x27;s so subtle I can&#x27;t even smell it when I&#x27;m wearing it, though apparently men can.  Maybe it&#x27;s just superstition on my part, due to its name, but I think I detect more of a twinkle in their eyes when I&#x27;ve spritzed myself with it, and my husband just seems to love me a little bit more. In fact, I was devastated when I ran out right before we were leaving for our honeymoon and the Caswell-Massey that used to be down the street was out of stock. When they heard my dilemma, though, they got some in just in time.  Sadly, that place has now closed, so I&#x27;m delighted to be able to order it through Amazon. It&#x27;s never lost its magic. By the way, I&#x27;m only telling you about this because I&#x27;ve got my guy; who needs the competition?</li>
            <li> I have  purchased this fragrance several times in the past.  Unable to find it locally I ordered Elixir of Love No,1 from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  I was very disappointed when It arrived and I tried it on. Caswell Massey must have changed the original formula to something that faintly resembles&lt;br /&gt;The original.  This was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Why did they have to change a good thing???  In addition, the pump was defective and it had to be pressed three or four times before it would spray.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon about returning the cologne, but because it is considered a flammable item it cannot be returned.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did, however, offer to issue a&lt;br /&gt;Full refund which they did within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for great customer service!  In all fairness to the vendor,&lt;br /&gt;It is not their fault that Caswell Massey&lt;br /&gt;changed  the formula to an inferior product.  The packaging and beautiful blue glass bottle is the same, but not the content.  Will not purchase fragrance online again.</li>
            <li> What I think is really secondary. The missus likes this perfume and it has been her favorite for years. Is getting a bit hard to find though so I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, fast shipping. Will buy again. This is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on description plus all the reviews here and on Fragrantic.com, and I am so very happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was worried since this was really a blond purchase...but those scent is soft, dreamy, with a light musk and delicate floral. It wears really well and lasts moderately long.&lt;br /&gt;Just lovely and very feminine without in any way being too sweet. Happiness is!</li>
            <li> I worked at this company years ago and fell in love with this scent!  Loving it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s getting harder to find but it&#x27;s worth the effort. My wife love the fragrance and I love how she smells.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume....love it!!!</li>
            <li> My signature fragrance for years.  Perfectly feminine without being cloying.  LOVE Caswell-Massey.  So classic.</li>
            <li> The scent has changed from a couple years ago when I first bought it.  Why can&#x27;t companies keep a good thing?</li>
