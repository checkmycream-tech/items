            <li>This is the best hair lotion for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and it stays beautiful til you wash again.</li>
            <li>She loved how it made her hair feel &amp; said the smell was wonderful!</li>
            <li>&amp; I am once again a proud curly girl graduating from 2c to  level 3.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that great.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Not the curl I wanted otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>It is a Great Product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>It smells really great too, unlike a lot of products for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion!!</li>
            <li>It is worth the price!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every product for my fine wavy hair and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Also, as a bonus it smells good.  </li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>The product itself in formula worked great but the fragrance odor is STRONG!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!!!</li>
            <li>All in all I am very pleased</li>
            <li>I have used it was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo and rinses in this line and thought I would love the styling products - but no!</li>
            <li>I may not be the user this stuff was intended for, but I love it!</li>
            <li>This product is quite amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is THE BEST if you want non-crunchy natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>It feels like a lotion you would be ok putting on your face.  </li>
            <li>Using this product and a detangler, I can now go 4 or more days without washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I like the maracan oil curling cream and styling products better.</li>
            <li>Go to Target and get a Garnier curl product which works better and is kinder on your wallet.</li>
            <li>love it will order again</li>
            <li>The product should be abit more affordable and it would reach masses of consumers.</li>
            <li>The time it took to arrive was outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too-</li>
            <li>Clean, spicy scent!</li>
            <li>Great smell and looks natural and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that the smell stays strong throughout the day, but I suppose that could just be that I get used to it.</li>
            <li>It gives my curly, fine hair&lt;</li>
            <li>I lightly coat my palms and finger-comb</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and it lasts.  </li>
            <li>This stuff right here is a miracle, it brought my curls to life!</li>
            <li>easy to use and holds the curl, even in straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Also you need to use so much of their product that you end up spending more.  </li>
            <li>After having and straightening my curls for over 25 years, this is the product that allowed me to finally start wearing my hair curly most days!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re mostly for existing curls that want moisture and definition &amp; they&#x27;re mostly just too heavy for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>would recomend it for anyone with curly and /0r fly away hair to keep it under control without weighing heavy on your hair</li>
            <li>I used to have to put my hair up the day after washing, or wash every day in order to keep my hair looking fresh and bouncy--</li>
            <li>When it dries, the hair is shiny, bouncy, and the curls are fresh.</li>
            <li>Love this Motion Lotion, makes my curls moving and soft</li>
            <li>but I figured it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>I want the bouncy corkscrew curls I&#x27;ve had in humid climates and when the stars align just right.  </li>
            <li>It may work better for those with super curly hair, but not those with larger waves.</li>
            <li>I discovered that it doesn&#x27;t rinse out in the shower if I don&#x27;t shampoo (I am down to once or twice a week like a good curly girl).  </li>
            <li>Aveda&#x27;s Humectant works pretty well</li>
            <li>kind of peppery, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>I have used other Kevin Murphy products and liked them, but this?</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, it has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>It is very strong and I had other people comment on the odor.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wimpy, wavy, white girl hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, long, straight hair, and this lotion makes it feel like silk!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for my wavy hair at all.</li>
            <li>It is VERY concentrated</li>
            <li>I have VERY curly hair</li>
            <li>My hair stylist used this on my hair at my last haircut, and it smelled fantastic and controlled frizz well, so I immediately ordered some on amazon.</li>
            <li>Not so much for me.</li>
            <li>It really defines and holds curls -</li>
            <li>Although its supposed to enhance curl, and my hair is straight (and I use a flatiron)</li>
            <li>Love what this stuff does to my short naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets flat and frizzy after shower, and this stuff helps put it back to a natural curl and feel good.</li>
            <li>I was familiar with this product and it definitely lived up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I add a little more product.  </li>
            <li>It makes my natural waves more defined and drastically decreases the frizz factor without making it look weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li>Works well, leaves hair feeling ok (not too greasy, and not too stiff).  </li>
            <li>I was concerned at first about the packaging, but have since found that this product is sold in stores same as I received it.</li>
            <li>and it totally defines and makes my hair REALLY pretty.  </li>
            <li>If you are fragrance sensitive this is not for you!</li>
            <li>It has certainly increased in price (by over $10) since the last time I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Not a stiff product at all.</li>
            <li>This formula is light and it never seems that my&lt;br /&gt;hair is overloaded or dirty from using it more than once</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>My hear is naturally waved</li>
            <li>I was expecting that this product as it&#x27;s name claims, would enhance my natural curls</li>
            <li>The curls look and feel natural.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair  </li>
            <li>I have pretty curly, but fairly dry, hair.</li>
            <li>Not worth the price, expected better</li>
            <li>You can also use a diffuser and blow dry for a little more volume.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pretty intense and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping with the curl</li>
            <li>(their curl specific stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair) and adding mousse made for curls is also light enough to not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I put it on when my hair is wet and when it dries my hair is very touchable and doesn&#x27;t feel like there is even product in it.  </li>
            <li>not worth the high price</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I put a quarter sized amount in my longer hair, then break my hair into 20 or so sections and twist them, allowing them to dry like that</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that will make your curls completely still and smell heavily of baby powder for days, then this Is for you!</li>
            <li> and then use my fingers to separate some once dry!</li>
            <li> She has very dry, wavy hair</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li> I just wet my hair in the morning and apply this.</li>
            <li> the ends while wet, air-dry</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I usually apply to damp hair with KM frizz fighter, scrunch a tiny bit and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Just have to be careful not to overuse, because a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It is hard to control if you have a lot of hair because it is so thick and not that much comes in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is EXTREMELY expensive, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> love the product, hate the smell.  </li>
            <li> It shapes the curls without weighing them down.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and hard to disperse though I did with much effort.  </li>
            <li> What a pity - I am not sure I would purchase anything from Kevin.murphy again.</li>
            <li> If my hair gets a little frizzy</li>
            <li> The lotion is heavy and does not enhance curl.  </li>
            <li> I tried using cheaper products such as from Ouidad but was not happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Hair was left feeling  very waxy, felt gross and hair looked awful.  </li>
            <li> that is not great when your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I use this every day for the past 3-4 years.  </li>
            <li> not pleased at all  </li>
            <li> but instead what it did to my hair was that it became flat, no shine, stiff, and very difficult to manage</li>
            <li> but it is too thick and leaves my hair heavier than I would like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but you need very little.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty awful.</li>
            <li> but I resisted because it was so expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exceptionally expensive and it doesn&#x27;t smell enticing.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> So disappointing!</li>
            <li> This product is awful!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed !!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not worth the price, expected better</li>
            <li> I use this every day for the past 3-4 years.  I have very fine thin curly hair.  Everyone always comes up and asks me what product i put in my hair.....  It is this.  THROW OUT YOUR MOUSSE!!!!!! GET THIS INSTEAD! Also, as a bonus it smells good.  It is NOT sticky.  It feels like a lotion you would be ok putting on your face.  It&#x27;s not greasy.  I put it on when my hair is wet and when it dries my hair is very touchable and doesn&#x27;t feel like there is even product in it.  I will never go back. Thank you Kevin Murphy!</li>
            <li> I was familiar with this product and it definitely lived up to my expectations.  It has certainly increased in price (by over $10) since the last time I purchased it.  that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have pretty curly, but fairly dry, hair. I used to have to put my hair up the day after washing, or wash every day in order to keep my hair looking fresh and bouncy--that is not great when your hair is dry. Using this product and a detangler, I can now go 4 or more days without washing my hair. It is EXTREMELY expensive, but it really does work. I just wet my hair in the morning and apply this. When it dries, the hair is shiny, bouncy, and the curls are fresh. As other reviewers have said, it has a very strong smell. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it might bother others. I don&#x27;t find that the smell stays strong throughout the day, but I suppose that could just be that I get used to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to the Hair Resort. It doesn&#x27;t do much for my wavy hair at all. Doesn&#x27;t enhance curl (which Hair Resort does), and makes my hair a bit oily. It may work better for those with super curly hair, but not those with larger waves.</li>
            <li> great product, delivered on time! would recomend it for anyone with curly and /0r fly away hair to keep it under control without weighing heavy on your hair</li>
            <li> not worth the high price</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and rinses in this line and thought I would love the styling products - but no! This product is awful! The lotion is heavy and does not enhance curl.  Above and beyond that, the smell of this product is horrendous. It is very strong and I had other people comment on the odor. I can&#x27;t imagine why the company would scent this product this way. What a pity - I am not sure I would purchase anything from Kevin.murphy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells pretty awful. I have used other Kevin Murphy products and liked them, but this? Ewww! It does offer some curl enhancement, but the aroma is off-putting.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wimpy, wavy, white girl hair.  I want curls.  I want the bouncy corkscrew curls I&#x27;ve had in humid climates and when the stars align just right.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products for curly hair but they&#x27;re mostly for existing curls that want moisture and definition &amp; they&#x27;re mostly just too heavy for my fine hair.  I want something that&#x27;ll give those wimpy waves a boost &amp; curl them up.  Aveda&#x27;s Humectant works pretty well (their curl specific stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair) and adding mousse made for curls is also light enough to not weigh my hair down.  Yeah, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff but it curls my hair.  It is VERY concentrated so a little goes a long, long way.  Too much product &amp; my hair is sticky &amp; stiff.  I discovered that it doesn&#x27;t rinse out in the shower if I don&#x27;t shampoo (I am down to once or twice a week like a good curly girl).  I lightly coat my palms and finger-comb the ends while wet, air-dry and/or use a diffuser &amp; I am once again a proud curly girl graduating from 2c to  level 3.</li>
            <li> Love this Motion Lotion, makes my curls moving and soft</li>
            <li> I may not be the user this stuff was intended for, but I love it! I have fine, long, straight hair, and this lotion makes it feel like silk! Just have to be careful not to overuse, because a little goes a long way (a dime-size dollop is enough for me).</li>
            <li> This product is THE BEST if you want non-crunchy natural looking curls. After having and straightening my curls for over 25 years, this is the product that allowed me to finally start wearing my hair curly most days! I can&#x27;t say enough about this Motion Lotion! I put a quarter sized amount in my longer hair, then break my hair into 20 or so sections and twist them, allowing them to dry like that and then use my fingers to separate some once dry!</li>
            <li> easy to use and holds the curl, even in straight, fine hair. I was concerned at first about the packaging, but have since found that this product is sold in stores same as I received it. All in all I am very pleased</li>
            <li> Works well, leaves hair feeling ok (not too greasy, and not too stiff).  My hair gets flat and frizzy after shower, and this stuff helps put it back to a natural curl and feel good.</li>
            <li> This was recommended because have curly frizzy hair. The smell is pretty intense and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping with the curl but I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is undoubtedly the best after shampoo styling/conditioner product I have ever used.  It gives my curly, fine hair&lt;br /&gt;great body and holds the shape of the curls after sleeping.  I mist my hair with water in the morning, comb, scrunch&lt;br /&gt;and that&#x27;s it.  If my hair gets a little frizzy I add a little more product.  This formula is light and it never seems that my&lt;br /&gt;hair is overloaded or dirty from using it more than once and I only need to wash my hair about every 5 days. I could go on and&lt;br /&gt;on with praises.  It&#x27;s that great.</li>
            <li> It works well but it is too thick and leaves my hair heavier than I would like. Smells great. It is hard to control if you have a lot of hair because it is so thick and not that much comes in the bottle. I like the maracan oil curling cream and styling products better.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser reccomended this product quite a while ago but I resisted because it was so expensive.  I tried using cheaper products such as from Ouidad but was not happy with the results.  Also you need to use so much of their product that you end up spending more.  I&#x27;ve started using Kevin Murphy and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It leaves my hair soft and bouncy.  I should have listened to my hairdresser!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion!! I have VERY curly hair and it totally defines and makes my hair REALLY pretty.  That&#x27;s the best word to explain it!! It is worth the price!!!! Try it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed !!</li>
            <li> The product itself in formula worked great but the fragrance odor is STRONG! I smelt it all day. If you are fragrance sensitive this is not for you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exceptionally expensive and it doesn&#x27;t smell enticing. It smells like chemicals. Go to Target and get a Garnier curl product which works better and is kinder on your wallet. As you can see I am a cusotmer with a verified purchase. I returned this product after smelling it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally fuzzy hair and this product gives it enough definition to make it wavy and less frizz. Not a stiff product at all.</li>
            <li> love it will order again</li>
            <li> So disappointing! My hair stylist used this on my hair at my last haircut, and it smelled fantastic and controlled frizz well, so I immediately ordered some on amazon. It&#x27;s a tiny bottle for $27 but I figured it would be worth it. Wrong. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the same product in the salon, and doesn&#x27;t control frizz, either. I can&#x27;t help wondering if someone refilled the bottle with a different product!</li>
            <li> Not the curl I wanted otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that will make your curls completely still and smell heavily of baby powder for days, then this Is for you! Not so much for me.</li>
            <li> Love what this stuff does to my short naturally curly hair.  Clean, spicy scent!</li>
            <li> I am out of town and ran out of product. Ordered online even though it was 20% more expensive. It is a Great Product. Scrunch your hair and go. Dampen and scrunch mid week and it stays beautiful til you wash again. Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She loved it. She has very dry, wavy hair &amp; she&#x27;s letting it grow. She loved how it made her hair feel &amp; said the smell was wonderful!</li>
            <li> This stuff right here is a miracle, it brought my curls to life!</li>
            <li> love the product, hate the smell.  it is the best product i have found that works for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product is quite amazing. It does what it describes. You want curls or you already have curls. This product does the job. The scent is aromatic. The contents mixed with wet hair, just optimize curls. The 1 downside is the price. The product should be abit more affordable and it would reach masses of consumers. The time it took to arrive was outstanding.</li>
            <li> Best curl lotion I have ever found. My hair dresser introduced me to it about 3 years ago and I have been hooked ever since. It makes my natural waves more defined and drastically decreases the frizz factor without making it look weighed down or greasy. I usually apply to damp hair with KM frizz fighter, scrunch a tiny bit and let it air dry. You can also use a diffuser and blow dry for a little more volume. I love the smell too- kind of peppery, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> My hear is naturally waved I was expecting that this product as it&#x27;s name claims, would enhance my natural curls but instead what it did to my hair was that it became flat, no shine, stiff, and very difficult to manage, it did not define my curls at all, I am never buying it again.</li>
            <li> I saw the product demonstrated on a tv show for women with curly hair and thought I would try it.  The product is very thick and hard to disperse though I did with much effort.  Hair was left feeling  very waxy, felt gross and hair looked awful.  Had to use a clarifying shampoo to just get it out of my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product for my fine wavy hair and this is the best. Not heavy nor stiff. It&#x27;s expensive but you need very little. The curls look and feel natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about four months.  It really defines and holds curls - it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine and decided to try it.  I have used it was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Never found anything in stores comparable to this product.  Great smell and looks natural and not sticky.  A bottle lasts forever too.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have fine curly hair &amp; it is hard to find a product that does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair is about shoulder length and curly/wavy. This product is perfect for my hair! It shapes the curls without weighing them down. It smells really great too, unlike a lot of products for curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair lotion for curly hair.  It&#x27;s light and it lasts.  If you don&#x27;t wash your hair daily, just a little spray of water brings it back to life.</li>
            <li> not pleased at all  I have naturally curly hair  and it didn&#x27;t  work for me</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and cannot imagine styling my hair without it! Although its supposed to enhance curl, and my hair is straight (and I use a flatiron) I find that it makes the hair feel thicker and fuller.</li>
