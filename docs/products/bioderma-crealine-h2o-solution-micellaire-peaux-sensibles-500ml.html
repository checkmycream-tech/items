            <li>It removes every kind of mascara, even waterproof, very easily.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best makeup remover I have ever purchased.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m in Love and don&#x27;t see myself using anything else.</li>
            <li>It is the best product I have ever used at removing all makeup (especially eye makeup).</li>
            <li>Most eye makeup removers I have tried (Clinique, Neutrogena, Maybelline, TheBalm, Lancome, Sephora) either don&#x27;t work or leave an oily residue - Bioderma works and leaves no residue...</li>

            <li>Cleans them easily and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>Bioderma is wonderful, however when it was delivered to me, the cap on the bottle was cracked (with a piece missing) and some of the product had leaked into the box.</li>
            <li>This one feels like water and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It is alcohol, fragrance, sulfate, gluten, and color free.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for making this available.</li>

            <li>I think the H2O formula is more gentle.</li>

            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Often referred to as the product of people in the know, it has it&#x27;s own cult following across the pond.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to get my eye make-up off completely until I&#x27;ve used the Bioderma  products.</li>
            <li>It shipped super fast too!</li>
            <li>Super gentle and efficacious.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this is just a first step but get 90% make up off of my face</li>
            <li>but I like to use different products :)</li>
            <li>While I LOVE the clean feel and cleansing ability of this product, I might say that it does not remove my stubborn waterproof mascara, so for that, I first use other products designed for that.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and have tried many different makeup removers without success.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this over American department store brands.  </li>

            <li> While I LOVE the clean feel and cleansing ability of this product, I might say that it does not remove my stubborn waterproof mascara, so for that, I first use other products designed for that.  Afterward, I do use the Bioderma product over my eyes and face area for a refreshing feel.  I then cleanse and rinse.  Bioderma does, however, work wonderfully in removing anything other than waterproof mascara.  This is a product I will order again and again, love.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a year now. This is by far the best makeup remover I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Bioderma is wonderful, however when it was delivered to me, the cap on the bottle was cracked (with a piece missing) and some of the product had leaked into the box. Upon further investigation, I found that the bottle had not been damaged during the shipping process, but had been originally shipped in poor condition, because the rest of the cap was nowhere to be found in the box. I can only hope that the product inside has not been tampered with, and is in fact what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST face cleanser I ever had!  Super gentle and efficacious.  Non irritating.  Does not require rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!</li>
            <li> This does not take off my waterproof makeup very well.  Nothing else did a good job either.  I would say save your money, and buy a drugstore makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does a good job with makeup that is not waterproof.</li>
            <li> I was really tired of buying various brands of eye makeup removed promising to be &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and they never were. Eyes would sting for hours. This product is marvelous. Does an excellent job of removing mascara and no eye problems. It is relatively expensive but for me it is worth it to have eye relief.</li>

            <li> Removes makeup quickly and easily, and the formula is very refreshing and light on your skin.  No residue is left beside.</li>
            <li> i am very like this product, very clean and mild in my face. love it!! it is a good choose</li>
            <li> This is definitely safe for your eyes.  I have been using it and sometimes my eyes are slightly open and it does not make them hurt or teary or itchy.  It for sure removes your eye make-up.  Also, for the price and size, I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for removing makeup and it literally feels like water, but obviously gets rid off any trace of makeup. I&#x27;m in Love and don&#x27;t see myself using anything else. My skin is loving it.</li>
            <li> I use Bioderma to remove makeup. It is the best product I have ever used at removing all makeup (especially eye makeup). Most eye makeup removers I have tried (Clinique, Neutrogena, Maybelline, TheBalm, Lancome, Sephora) either don&#x27;t work or leave an oily residue - Bioderma works and leaves no residue...it&#x27;s like using water. Also, this stuff is completely odorless. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to this product for getting off eye makeup without any irritation whatsoever to the eye! I have sensitive eyes and have tried many different makeup removers without success. Found this by watching YouTube videos about beauty. The only thing &amp;#34;wrong&amp;#34; with this product is that you cannot buy it from a brick and mortar store in the US and it is costly to order. But until we can get it here in the US, I&#x27;ll keep purchasing online.</li>
            <li> I bought the travel size to try and I loved this so much I bought the big bottle.  I don&#x27;t like creams, gels, or oily based removers . This one feels like water and is fragrance free. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes and I only need to use one cottonball per eye. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the cap is hard to open.  I also prefer the Crealine (or Sensibio) H2O Solution over the TS H2O Solution.  They have different ingredients. I think the H2O formula is more gentle.</li>
            <li> this is the best eye and make up romover I have ever had. It works really well with sensitive skin without leave any residue .I highly recomend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> This makeup remover is similar to using plain water. It does not remove waterproof makeup or waterproof mascara. I was not happy with this product at all. I&#x27;ve been using Clinique Take the Day off for years and now that I am over 40, I notice that it is a bit drying so I was looking for an alternative but this is does not even come close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about two weeks. It removes all my makeup (even waterproof mascara). it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, nor does it leave my skin oily. I&#x27;m really loving this product. It shipped super fast too!</li>
            <li> I love it. Its the best. What I dont like is the price. Its a little bit too expensive. Although it was the best price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very good make up remover. Removes make up in one swipe. Purchased in Paris last year. I could only find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the SENSITIVE formula (sensibles), the one that all the beauty editors write about.  French and British Vogues  mention this as a popular solution that models and actresses use for problem skin. Often referred to as the product of people in the know, it has it&#x27;s own cult following across the pond.  A leading team of french dermatologists, and researchers developed this for reactive skin, (babies) for medical purposes .  It was later decided to market to the public, not just hospitals.  It is alcohol, fragrance, sulfate, gluten, and color free. Just tissue on the cleanser, wipe, no need to rinse, you can but not necessary.. Safe for use around and on eyes, even waterproof cosmetics.  Bioderma is a french medical company based in Lyon, France.  Thank you Amazon for making this available.</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of this product. I&#x27;ve never been able to get my eye make-up off completely until I&#x27;ve used the Bioderma  products. I use this to  clean my face from all make-up. It&#x27;s remarkable how easily my face comes out looking so fresh. Trust me, I&#x27;ve used numerous products to get make-up off and this has been the only line that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> This product is not gentle at all.  Don&#x27;t buy Bioderma!!!! After using this product my eyes were red and eye lids in the morning were swollen!!!!  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is great as a makeup remover and also good as a face cleanser alternative for those days you are just too tired to use soap and water.</li>
