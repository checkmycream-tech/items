            <li>great hair dye, has a dye smell afterwards but all dyes do.</li>
            <li>I also use Wen by Chaz Dean which is great for retaining color.</li>

            <li>I was so excited to get this color, i put it on and followed the directions perfectly.</li>

            <li>Color turned out just as it was shown on the container.&lt;br /&gt;No complications very satisfied.</li>
            <li>REALLY SOON THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH IM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT</li>

            <li>I love it super bright</li>
            <li>better than any color you can find at sallys.</li>
            <li>Be sure to purchase gloves and a applicator bottle for this.</li>
            <li>My hair is medium brown, I&#x27;ve been coloring it for many years, so it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;virgin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>Love the compliments I get after I use this dye.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my hair for a couple years and I am always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I also love the name of this color.</li>
            <li>This is the best red I&#x27;ve used, ever.</li>
            <li>It came out more of a magenta color</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love the hicolor line.</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT VERY MUCH HOPE TO BUY SOME MORE AGAIN</li>
            <li>I loved the Garnier but thought I could boost the color even more choosing my own developer and color at a professional level.</li>
            <li>and.got a real nice red velvet color :)</li>
            <li>The smell goes away after a couple showers and it doesnt fade to easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a healthy sheen, went on really even, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I will try again with the 30 developer now that my whole color is even, will update with more photos!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t help but to enjoy the compliments.</li>
            <li>It really will only be bright bright if your hair is virgin hair.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair in preperation for college senior photos, and it does come out very red in sun and bright light.</li>
            <li>My hair is not dry though, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>So if your looking for bright red hair this is not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>price wise its just about the same as buying it at a store, they never have this color.</li>
            <li>i think super bright red</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and will be buying in the future</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very pretty hair color</li>
            <li>It burned, and it did leave a burn on my scalp because I left it in too long, but the color was perfect.</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive review on this product i was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and got here promptly</li>
            <li>it says your just not doing it right</li>
            <li>My hair has been such a fun bright auburn for a year (people constantly stop me to ask what color it is or give me a compliment).</li>
            <li>When I used this the first time, I can&#x27;t lie</li>
            <li>The lady at Sallies even acted as though I was going to have to lift first, and</li>
            <li>It works pretty well on relaxed hair</li>
            <li>but anyway if you want bright red get the hilight one in red.</li>
            <li>and then most recently Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color Intense Auburn (R3).</li>
            <li>Loved using this I mixed it with the same.brand loreal hilights in red</li>
            <li>first then use this beautiful red,,,, i am buying again definitely to keep my red</li>
            <li>Oh, and it&#x27;s definitely worth mentioning that it was applied on the dark brown hair that you see on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering hicolor hilights in red to get the bright red I want at the moment, but will use the other tube of this when I want a more subdued red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it went on really well.</li>
            <li>I can say that i will never buy this color again, and i really hope the collection isn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li>Although this did work, it was not as intense as i was expecting.</li>
            <li>Now I knew a couple of people in reviews were saying that it doesnt really work on dyed brown hair</li>
            <li>Turned out way more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>So I had done loads and loads of research on how to get my hair from dark brown to bright red</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re looking for a dark red.</li>
            <li>but im sure this will work with someone with not too dark hair.</li>
            <li>A good little mermaid red.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s more a super deep, deep auburn or a brown with a red tint.</li>
            <li>When i first used it i mixed the hi color highlights with this one and the roots were a brilliant red color , but my mid and ends were still dark,,, so</li>
            <li>I put this color on my dyed, medium-dark brown hair (5NW with some copper and gold tones added), hair that&#x27;s been dyed many times I might add, and it actually came out red!  </li>
            <li>I had barely dyed my hair for the first time this month with the L&#x27;Oreal Feria color dye from the store.</li>
            <li>Garnier goes on just as well, the smell is WAY less intense, and the outcome is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be switching back to Garnier Nutrisse&#x27;s Ultra color right away.</li>
            <li>I keep getting compliments on this new hair color</li>
            <li>I went through the colors and the picture of red hot seemed closest to what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this color first at the store, not online.</li>
            <li>Just before I got Red Hot</li>
            <li>When i hear red hot</li>
            <li>It says red hot</li>
            <li>When I colored my hair with Red Hot, it made my highlights vibrant red and the rest of the hair nice dark red.</li>
            <li>Is a pretty, dark red, but definitely RED :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go back to my pretty natural brunette.</li>
            <li>my hair only turned dark brown after bleaching but when I put this in it turned bright datk red burgandy the same as the color strand at sallys</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand 3 times so far</li>
            <li>I left it in for an hour from when I first started applying it in foils, and then washed it out with a generic light shampoo (no conditioner), then let it dry and reapplied what I had left another 45 minutes, and then washed it out again until the water ran clear and applied [[ASIN:B005NISO6Q Ion Color Brilliance After Color Treatment]].</li>
            <li>It looks somewhat magenta in this picture but it is the exact same red as the sample swatch provided when shopping for it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Te red i so radiant and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I have never been abel to get this intense of a red with any other brand or without bleaching first.</li>
            <li>I might update this later to see how the color holds however, I&#x27;m not having high hopes there either.</li>
            <li>So when I saw the Excellence HiColor \\&quot;Made for dark hair\\&quot; in \\&quot;red hot\\&quot; I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t bad, if you want a dark reddish brown, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the highlights in this line with satisfactory results, so when I decided to go totally red, I naturally reached for this product.</li>
            <li>i have to stand under direct sunlight to even see a hint of the red.  </li>
            <li>I mixed hicolor red hot w/hicolr highlights red for a medium &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking red.</li>
            <li>i think it should be called deep red to be clear.</li>
            <li>It only gave a hint of red and  lasted a week before it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>A good deep cherry red, but not a bright little mermaid red.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how this color would look on black hair, but it is certainly works VERY WELL on medium to dark brown hair (given you use it correctly).</li>
            <li>I have an undercut, which I didn&#x27;t color, so I can compare my natural very dark brown to the new color.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has dark hair and wants red red hair.</li>

            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has dark hair and wants red red hair.</li>
            <li> Someone the other day actually asked if I got it professionally done.</li>
            <li> The color is NOT bright red or a red hot, it turned out more like a weird brick color, it was only slightly red( more of a weird brown-ish red color)  </li>
            <li> My original  hair color is a dark brown, thick, and passed my middle back, and there was no isssue in the  red actually showing up.</li>
            <li> I have naturally chocolate/esspresso brown hair, mid way down my back.</li>
            <li> I used this color with 40 volume developer and I got disappointed because I wanted to keep a really bright red</li>
            <li> Actually lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> long lasting...</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for a long time with Loreal Colour rays in red, a box color you can get at drug stores, walmart, etc.</li>
            <li> It made my hair red, but not vibrant enough.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been coloring it red for the past 14 months using Feria Ruby something (R68) for the first half</li>
            <li> it is supposed to lift your color and deposit the red color onto your hair and it didn&#x27;t lift my color at all, so now i am left with a dark cherry-brown color</li>
            <li> but it actually comes out a dark red with purple undertons.</li>
            <li> I have black asian hair with blonde highlights in it.</li>
            <li> its just that you shouldnt let it stay on ur roots for too long!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s compulsory to use this on bleached hair (if you have brown to black hair) for maximum vibrant results, else you will just end up with a typical dark shade that can only be seen under lights.</li>
            <li> It was not too bad, could be more red.</li>
            <li> and this was too dark like cherry plum red.</li>
            <li> Four tries and it was a dark red.</li>
            <li> My dark brown hair is now light brown with a slight (and I mean VERY slight) reddish tint to it.</li>
            <li> and i wanted Little Mermaid red hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my hair black for a long</li>
            <li> i have naturally dark brown hair (#2.)  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been this dark in over a year.</li>
            <li> If I wanted to go dark</li>
            <li> but no it came out dark</li>
            <li> (ALSO started on dark brown hair.)</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown</li>
            <li> but i had ombre like a year ago so it has been dyed over with dark brown dye a couple of times.</li>
            <li> My hair is that dark brown almost black virgin hair</li>
            <li> But I would recommend using this on dark brown hair or virgin black hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this color is a deep cherry red, almost brown.</li>
            <li> Garnier Ultra color also faded waaaay less than Feria R68.</li>
            <li> Not this sort of half and half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this on my black hair, that has been dyed.</li>
            <li> It has gotten a little lighter as I&#x27;ve washed it.</li>
            <li> a little money you will get a lot of satisfactions</li>
            <li> waste your money, my fellow brunettes.</li>
            <li> my hair dark and hard to work with</li>
            <li> i did not buy this from amazon, i got it at a beauty supply store and what a waste of money!  </li>

            <li> I used this color with 40 volume developer and I got disappointed because I wanted to keep a really bright red and this was too dark like cherry plum red. I will not buy it again. But it&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re looking for a dark red. Actually lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Great color... long lasting... better than any color you can find at sallys. Be sure to purchase gloves and a applicator bottle for this. BEST BEAUTY BUY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the highlights in this line with satisfactory results, so when I decided to go totally red, I naturally reached for this product. Ugh. My dark brown hair is now light brown with a slight (and I mean VERY slight) reddish tint to it. How disappointing. I have an undercut, which I didn&#x27;t color, so I can compare my natural very dark brown to the new color. It&#x27;s just lousy, and I followed the instructions to a T.</li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my hair black for a long I bleached my hair once then used this color my hair only turned dark brown after bleaching but when I put this in it turned bright datk red burgandy the same as the color strand at sallys its the best color ive used no brass at all so if its not the color it says your just not doing it right I am very satisfied and will be buying in the future</li>
            <li> So since I was going to apply it onto a lot of hair, I mixed this color with the [[ASIN:B000A3V2PE L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Hicolor Hilights Red 1.2 oz.]] and it went on really well. I used the recommended 30 developer and the proper measurements according to both packages. I left it in for an hour from when I first started applying it in foils, and then washed it out with a generic light shampoo (no conditioner), then let it dry and reapplied what I had left another 45 minutes, and then washed it out again until the water ran clear and applied [[ASIN:B005NISO6Q Ion Color Brilliance After Color Treatment]]. It looks somewhat magenta in this picture but it is the exact same red as the sample swatch provided when shopping for it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a healthy sheen, went on really even, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it. Oh, and it&#x27;s definitely worth mentioning that it was applied on the dark brown hair that you see on top.</li>
            <li> Lovee it works amazeing ill defantly stick with this brand so I don&#x27;t have to bleach my hair I love it super bright I&#x27;ve used this brand 3 times so far and I have not been yet dissapointed</li>
            <li> i did not buy this from amazon, i got it at a beauty supply store and what a waste of money!  i have naturally dark brown hair (#2.)  it is supposed to lift your color and deposit the red color onto your hair and it didn&#x27;t lift my color at all, so now i am left with a dark cherry-brown color - kinda. i have to stand under direct sunlight to even see a hint of the red.  and i wanted Little Mermaid red hair.  i didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I had barely dyed my hair for the first time this month with the L&#x27;Oreal Feria color dye from the store. It only gave a hint of red and  lasted a week before it was completely gone. I then decided to go with the L&#x27;Oreal Hi Excellence. My original  hair color is a dark brown, thick, and passed my middle back, and there was no isssue in the  red actually showing up. It has now been two weeks and it&#x27;s still noticeable. I keep getting compliments on this new hair color and I can&#x27;t help but to enjoy the compliments. Someone the other day actually asked if I got it professionally done. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for a long time with Loreal Colour rays in red, a box color you can get at drug stores, walmart, etc. Well, I needed a redye and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I decided I could just get the stuff individually, since the box contains developer and red dye. I went through the colors and the picture of red hot seemed closest to what I wanted. A good little mermaid red. Unfortunately this color is a deep cherry red, almost brown. The color isn&#x27;t bad, if you want a dark reddish brown, it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s just not what I was expecting. I ordered 2 bottles and only needed one for my medium-longish hair. I dyed my hair in preperation for college senior photos, and it does come out very red in sun and bright light. It has gotten a little lighter as I&#x27;ve washed it. I&#x27;m ordering hicolor hilights in red to get the bright red I want at the moment, but will use the other tube of this when I want a more subdued red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR A good deep cherry red, but not a bright little mermaid red.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this color first at the store, not online. My hair is medium brown, I&#x27;ve been coloring it for many years, so it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;virgin\\&quot;. Just before I got Red Hot I had some highlights done  and they turned out looking like a rust, which I didn&#x27;t like. When I colored my hair with Red Hot, it made my highlights vibrant red and the rest of the hair nice dark red. I have no idea how this color would look on black hair, but it is certainly works VERY WELL on medium to dark brown hair (given you use it correctly).</li>
            <li> great hair dye, has a dye smell afterwards but all dyes do. The smell goes away after a couple showers and it doesnt fade to easily.</li>
            <li> Bought this from a Sally&#x27;s last week. I have naturally chocolate/esspresso brown hair, mid way down my back. However, I&#x27;ve been coloring it red for the past 14 months using Feria Ruby something (R68) for the first half and then most recently Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color Intense Auburn (R3). I loved the Garnier but thought I could boost the color even more choosing my own developer and color at a professional level. So when I saw the Excellence HiColor \\&quot;Made for dark hair\\&quot; in \\&quot;red hot\\&quot; I was excited to try it. I used the Loreal Oreor Cream Developer Volume 30 and let it develop 25 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got done blow drying it and can only say I am so dissapointed in the color. My hair has been such a fun bright auburn for a year (people constantly stop me to ask what color it is or give me a compliment). Now it&#x27;s more a super deep, deep auburn or a brown with a red tint. It hasn&#x27;t been this dark in over a year. So bummed. I&#x27;ll be switching back to Garnier Nutrisse&#x27;s Ultra color right away. Garnier goes on just as well, the smell is WAY less intense, and the outcome is fabulous. Garnier Ultra color also faded waaaay less than Feria R68. I might update this later to see how the color holds however, I&#x27;m not having high hopes there either. This color is just so...blah. If I wanted to go dark I&#x27;d go back to my pretty natural brunette. Not this sort of half and half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money, my fellow brunettes. :/</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Love this color. Love the compliments I get after I use this dye. Te red i so radiant and vibrant. I have been using this on my hair for a couple years and I am always pleased with the results. I have never been abel to get this intense of a red with any other brand or without bleaching first. I would recommend it to anyone who has dark hair and wants red red hair. I also love the name of this color.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders.easy to prepare and very easy to use.Color turned out just as it was shown on the container.&lt;br /&gt;No complications very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My hair is that dark brown almost black virgin hair and this did not stick to my hair as well as it promised. I would suggest using a darker color than this one. My hair is not dry though, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> price wise its just about the same as buying it at a store, they never have this color. Worth the price and got here promptly</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT VERY MUCH HOPE TO BUY SOME MORE AGAIN REALLY SOON THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH IM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Perfect condition and product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this color, i put it on and followed the directions perfectly. The color is NOT bright red or a red hot, it turned out more like a weird brick color, it was only slightly red( more of a weird brown-ish red color)  I can say that i will never buy this color again, and i really hope the collection isn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> When i hear red hot i think super bright red but no it came out dark i think it should be called deep red to be clear. So i got the hi lift highlight in red hoping it would help but  no that deep red is here to stay i hope it lightens over time but anyway if you want bright red get the hilight one in red.</li>
            <li> Loved using this I mixed it with the same.brand loreal hilights in red and.got a real nice red velvet color :)</li>
            <li> This is after 2 applications, the 1st washed out almost instantly (within a week). ALSO woman at Sally&#x27;s told me to only use a 10 developer because my roots would become way lighter than the rest of my hair she said. Its not as vibrant/bright red as I was hoping for. But I refuse to bleach my hair. I also use Wen by Chaz Dean which is great for retaining color. (Chaz actually did a segment on washing out red hair dye 20-30 times with Cleansing Conditioner vs. Shampoo &amp; you can guess whose hair still looked great.) Anyway, I will try again with the 30 developer now that my whole color is even, will update with more photos! (ALSO started on dark brown hair.)</li>
            <li> This is the best red I&#x27;ve used, ever. I used it with 30 volume developer. It burned, and it did leave a burn on my scalp because I left it in too long, but the color was perfect. Would recommend. The color is a deep red/brown.</li>
            <li> Although this did work, it was not as intense as i was expecting. It was not too bad, could be more red.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s compulsory to use this on bleached hair (if you have brown to black hair) for maximum vibrant results, else you will just end up with a typical dark shade that can only be seen under lights.</li>
            <li> So I had done loads and loads of research on how to get my hair from dark brown to bright red (well, deep red like Ariana Grande) and this product kept popping up everywhere. It had great reviews so I decided to get it, when I realized you can&#x27;t get it here in Ireland i ordered it. Now I knew a couple of people in reviews were saying that it doesnt really work on dyed brown hair but i thought, why not. My hair is naturally dark brown but i had ombre like a year ago so it has been dyed over with dark brown dye a couple of times. When I used this the first time, I can&#x27;t lie I was disappointed. It made my hair red, but not vibrant enough. It really will only be bright bright if your hair is virgin hair. Nonetheless, it is a great idea and a good product, you just have to make sure its going to work. I have another box here that probably will not be used.</li>
            <li> When i first used it i mixed the hi color highlights with this one and the roots were a brilliant red color , but my mid and ends were still dark,,, so i guess i have to use the hi color highlights alone first then use this beautiful red,,,, i am buying again definitely to keep my red</li>
            <li> I put this color on my dyed, medium-dark brown hair (5NW with some copper and gold tones added), hair that&#x27;s been dyed many times I might add, and it actually came out red!  Turned out way more than I expected.  The lady at Sallies even acted as though I was going to have to lift first, and NOPE.  Mixed dye with 30 developer and voila.  Redness.  Is a pretty, dark red, but definitely RED :)</li>
            <li> It works pretty well on relaxed hair its just that you shouldnt let it stay on ur roots for too long! It came out more of a magenta color</li>
            <li> I just love it. It´s the best hair color I ever had. I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> my hair dark and hard to work with but im sure this will work with someone with not too dark hair.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive review on this product i was very dissapointed. I have black asian hair with blonde highlights in it. I use hair developer vol 30 with this product. Results, can only see tint or red under the sun. Maybe vol 40 might work but i have read lots of remarks vol 40 will fry the hair...hrmm.. i might try again since there are several review stating that second time might work!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the brightest red possible, you should get Hicolor hilights. I mixed hicolor red hot w/hicolr highlights red for a medium &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking red.</li>
            <li> I love the hicolor line.</li>
            <li> beautiful color and it really doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> Took 3coats to actually be red</li>
            <li> This DOES work...that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> It says red hot but it actually comes out a dark red with purple undertons. So if your looking for bright red hair this is not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s a very pretty hair color it&#x27;s just not what I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money,it is a good choice for your colour hair.&lt;br /&gt;With a little money you will get a lot of satisfactions</li>
            <li> I bought this to do a bright streak in my hair and its perfect.  I just use the amount I want and no wastage.  Will be buying again</li>
            <li> I used this on my black hair, that has been dyed. Four tries and it was a dark red. But I would recommend using this on dark brown hair or virgin black hair.</li>
