            <li>/&gt;Recently, I began a search for a nice rose.</li>
            <li>I wanted a rose EDP that captured the Rosa Rugosa that run along the beaches in Maine&#x27;s coastal towns.</li>
            <li>So I began sampleing a number of rose scents including Annick Goutal&#x27;s Rose Absolue and CB</li>
            <li>guess because I searched for a rose perfume on Amazon,</li>
            <li>the Tea Rose Eau De Toilette popped up and I decided to take a look.</li>
            <li>Just rose.</li>
            <li>It lasts nicely.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you want a rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is the truest rose scent I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li>Lingering nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for tea rose fragrance for awhile.</li>
            <li>It was wonderful have always used it, but was getting it from another company, but you tea rose way better price, and I will continue to be your customer, thanks</li>
            <li>This smells incredible, at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>So she settled on Tea Rose and kept it for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is not strong very pleasant the price is very good</li>
            <li>Spray 2 to 3 sprays in a room for a great garden breeze right inside your home, but be warned, over 5 sprays in a room</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>Lovely scent</li>

            <li>I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Does not bother anyone around me, people notice light rose scent, and puppies seem to like it too :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume.  </li>
            <li>This, surely, must be what heaven smells like.</li>
            <li>probably my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance, well-packed and prompt.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m thinking now more to please us)  for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For many years I have applied this cologne after bath or shower....</li>
            <li>/&gt;have had many compliments from friends and acquaintances</li>
            <li>It was accurately described by the top reviews here, comes in a very large bottle, and is a great value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments since it isn&#x27;t very strong, but lasts and smells very fresh.....</li>
            <li>This scent smells like a true rose to me.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who liked it so much on me that she now uses it as well!!</li>
            <li>This is a simple, pure rose scent that smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>which is good for such strong rose scent.</li>
            <li>This is more of an absolute rose oil smell...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy on the nose.</li>
            <li>This is my very favorite perfume and I&#x27;m Sooo happy I found it here as it was becoming really hard to locate.</li>
            <li>The only cologne I use since it is great on me</li>
            <li>One spray and you have a very comforting rose perfume that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle of real tea rose oil</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect it would smell just like a real tea rose.</li>
            <li>Even though I love so many scents, every time I wear this I remember that if I had to live the rest of my life with only one, it would have to be this beautiful oldie-but-goodie.</li>
            <li>It is actually light &amp; true to scent.</li>
            <li>smell horrible..been using this for years and know what original scent smells like.</li>
            <li>let you know when we receive it, but I&#x27;m pretty optimistic. :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a potent Victorian rose smell like that of a candle or soap from back in the day.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell back then.</li>
            <li>I hope I can again purchase it as it is rare these days to find the genuine product.</li>
            <li>Must say because it&#x27;s true - my brothers and sisters</li>
            <li>(Dopey of us, even arrogant, but true.)  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t agree with the other reviews that say that this smells like a rose garden or a fresh rose.  </li>
            <li>Perfume is my indulgence the way other people love wine or nice</li>
            <li>The Perfumers Workshop Tea Rose does initially present with a burst of alcohol but it quickly dissipates within a few seconds and opens beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it for many years and the scent has never gotten old.</li>
            <li>Last all day use sparingly, can be used as nice bedroom freshener.</li>
            <li>It is not an overpowering scent, but more of soft fragrance as you pass by others.</li>
            <li>Those are fond memories and we laugh about it still after all these</li>
            <li>The effect is light and pleasant and above all very natural - the smell is just like that of a species of pink rose that I have grown at my house.</li>
            <li>This has a distinct rose scent that no other perfume seems to have and it does not fade very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very strong and one spray will be enough.</li>
            <li>Suitable for daily wear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller was very fast shipping it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fdipasq</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I ordered six bottles for gifts, they arrived on time and was exactly was i was expecting.  </li>
            <li>This is genuine and I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>To me it smells exactly like a Rosa Rugosa</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the staying power yet as I have just now received it and tried it on for the first time.</li>
            <li>I over sprayed it recently and my family was opening the door to air out the room because I love to use this as an air freshener</li>
            <li>Very relaxing!</li>
            <li>This is such a light and fresh spray.  </li>
            <li>I have worn it for four hours and still feel the scent is plenty strong enough.</li>
            <li>For me to love a perfume I have to like the top, middle and bottom notes and also love the the scent from opening to dry down.</li>
            <li>Both are beautiful perfumes and similar, the latter being less sweet.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I could use it as room spray I thought if I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>This really does smell like roses.</li>
            <li>really like the scent.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of real garden roses, this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the few cologne&#x27;s that make me smell nice</li>
            <li>Over the years, she had forgotten about this, but the smell of the Tea Rose came back to her in an instant</li>
            <li>Tea Rose bought this product at the suggestion of a friend, their packaging is classically simple in color but the color Inner packing parfum captivated me, count on the security of amazon delivery.</li>
            <li>The smell of this is much, much too strong and does not really smell like roses.  </li>
            <li>I first remember using this perfume when I was about 11yrs old.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Tea Rose\\&quot; has been my mother&#x27;s favorite perfume for more than 25 years and it has been harder and harder to find in local stores.</li>
            <li>I had paid 125.00 for this, I would have rated it 3.5 stars because of the alcohol and the slightly too strong silage but since the price is so reasonable and the quality so high, I rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>that I am older and a little less spray happy (who am I kidding?)</li>
            <li>It just arrived today and I am very pleaseantly surprised.</li>
            <li>prefer it to the much more costly perfums that are often heavy and overpowering.</li>
            <li>I found my new perfume.</li>
            <li>Strong and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>It smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li>If I remember correctly, it didn&#x27;t smell like anything else, and for the money, it was actually exceedingly pretty.  </li>
            <li>She wore Tea Rose back in the late 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts quite a while and the scent is not overpowering but lingers softly.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a try, as I was particularly looking for some rose-fragrance perfume, and actually this product just meets my need.</li>
            <li>I only experience one thing when I spray on this classic:</li>
            <li>It would have cost too much to return it, so I&#x27;m using it to spray near the area where the neighbors&#x27; dog defecates.</li>
            <li>The EDT has a strong silage so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I suspect in a blind test you could not tell the difference between this and the Goutal Rose Absolue.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing it for many years and though it is increasingly hard to find, neither I nor my family would recognize me in any other fragrance.</li>

            <li> If you like the smell of real garden roses, this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the few cologne&#x27;s that make me smell nice</li>
            <li> Over the years, she had forgotten about this, but the smell of the Tea Rose came back to her in an instant</li>
            <li> Tea Rose bought this product at the suggestion of a friend, their packaging is classically simple in color but the color Inner packing parfum captivated me, count on the security of amazon delivery.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is much, much too strong and does not really smell like roses.  </li>
            <li> I first remember using this perfume when I was about 11yrs old.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Tea Rose\\&quot; has been my mother&#x27;s favorite perfume for more than 25 years and it has been harder and harder to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> I had paid 125.00 for this, I would have rated it 3.5 stars because of the alcohol and the slightly too strong silage but since the price is so reasonable and the quality so high, I rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> that I am older and a little less spray happy (who am I kidding?)</li>
            <li> It just arrived today and I am very pleaseantly surprised.</li>
            <li> prefer it to the much more costly perfums that are often heavy and overpowering.</li>
            <li> I found my new perfume.</li>
            <li> Strong and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li> If I remember correctly, it didn&#x27;t smell like anything else, and for the money, it was actually exceedingly pretty.  </li>
            <li> She wore Tea Rose back in the late 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts quite a while and the scent is not overpowering but lingers softly.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a try, as I was particularly looking for some rose-fragrance perfume, and actually this product just meets my need.</li>
            <li> I only experience one thing when I spray on this classic:</li>
            <li> It would have cost too much to return it, so I&#x27;m using it to spray near the area where the neighbors&#x27; dog defecates.</li>
            <li> The EDT has a strong silage so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I suspect in a blind test you could not tell the difference between this and the Goutal Rose Absolue.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it for many years and though it is increasingly hard to find, neither I nor my family would recognize me in any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was entirely skeptical but the reviews were so positive and the price was so reasonable</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t last long at this price you could reapply.</li>
            <li> so will not last really long</li>
            <li> I Hate Perfume&#x27;s Tea Rose.  </li>
            <li> This batch of perfume not the original scent..must be a bad batch...or sitting in storage too long...</li>
            <li> I also wanted a soliflore because I do not like powdery scents or notes that are crowded out by other notes.</li>
            <li> and I sprayed our jackets down with this rosy perfume.</li>
            <li> and it did not die down at all, every time we put on those jackets she asked me,</li>
            <li> and I wondered why on earth did I spray them down like that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to quite a few fragrances but this has never once bothered me.</li>
            <li> just a few spritzers....</li>
            <li> Nothing weird here.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> One of my favorites! I&#x27;m allergic to quite a few fragrances but this has never once bothered me. I&#x27;ve worn it for many years and the scent has never gotten old. It&#x27;s light and easy on the nose. My teenage daughter even started using it when she smelled it on me. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Tea Rose\\&quot; has been my mother&#x27;s favorite perfume for more than 25 years and it has been harder and harder to find in local stores. This has a distinct rose scent that no other perfume seems to have and it does not fade very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> It is one of the few cologne&#x27;s that make me smell nice</li>
            <li> Smells like a combination of rotting fruit and mildew.  Threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent of roses! Last all day use sparingly, can be used as nice bedroom freshener. Very nice after baths.</li>
            <li> This is a simple, pure rose scent that smells wonderful. It was accurately described by the top reviews here, comes in a very large bottle, and is a great value. I&#x27;ve used it for months now and I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time. I remember this from when I was a teenager in the 1980s. I loved the smell back then. When I found it here on Amazon I jumped at the chance to order it. It smells exactly the same. &amp; I thought that the price was fair.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and delighted to now know where to purchase it again.  I ordered six bottles for gifts, they arrived on time and was exactly was i was expecting.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is such a light and fresh spray.  I have people telling me I smell as if I have roses on me.</li>
            <li> The only cologne I use since it is great on me &amp; I get compliments all the time from people. Also doesn&#x27;t seem to activate anyone&#x27;s allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very fast shipping it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fdipasq</li>
            <li> This is genuine and I was so surprised. It was my signature for many years and am so happy to retun to that beautiful smell my kids  who are adults now )associated with me.This is a heavenly scent that truly smells like tea roses. I hope I can again purchase it as it is rare these days to find the genuine product.I would recommend it ladies.. you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, I was and continue to be quite happy with it. It is just as described and a good bargain!</li>
            <li> The smell of this is much, much too strong and does not really smell like roses.  I had to wash my hands and wrist  several time to only lessen the smell, not remove it. It would have cost too much to return it, so I&#x27;m using it to spray near the area where the neighbors&#x27; dog defecates.</li>
            <li> Beautiful perfume. Love it....</li>
            <li> Mom who is going to be 97 this year, absolutely loved it.  Over the years, she had forgotten about this, but the smell of the Tea Rose came back to her in an instant and she couldn&#x27;t stop smiling.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am going to start by saying that I am a perfume snob. I read blogs, I order lots of samples, I spend months researching, I fantasize about Barney&#x27;s perfume counter, I visit perfume districts, anyway, you get the idea. Perfume is my indulgence the way other people love wine or nice automobiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I began a search for a nice rose. I wanted a rose EDP that captured the Rosa Rugosa that run along the beaches in Maine&#x27;s coastal towns. I also wanted a soliflore because I do not like powdery scents or notes that are crowded out by other notes. So I began sampleing a number of rose scents including Annick Goutal&#x27;s Rose Absolue and CB I Hate Perfume&#x27;s Tea Rose.  Both are beautiful perfumes and similar, the latter being less sweet. Both are pricey however, and both unfortunately only lasted a short time on my skin, so I decided to hold off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess because I searched for a rose perfume on Amazon, the Tea Rose Eau De Toilette popped up and I decided to take a look. I was entirely skeptical but the reviews were so positive and the price was so reasonable, I decided to roll the dice. I could use it as room spray I thought if I really didn&#x27;t like it. It just arrived today and I am very pleaseantly surprised. To me it smells exactly like a Rosa Rugosa and I suspect in a blind test you could not tell the difference between this and the Goutal Rose Absolue. For me to love a perfume I have to like the top, middle and bottom notes and also love the the scent from opening to dry down. The Perfumers Workshop Tea Rose does initially present with a burst of alcohol but it quickly dissipates within a few seconds and opens beautifully. I have worn it for four hours and still feel the scent is plenty strong enough. The EDT has a strong silage so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had paid 125.00 for this, I would have rated it 3.5 stars because of the alcohol and the slightly too strong silage but since the price is so reasonable and the quality so high, I rate it 5 stars., I rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find in any stores.  Lovely scent</li>
            <li> It was wonderful have always used it, but was getting it from another company, but you tea rose way better price, and I will continue to be your customer, thanks</li>
            <li> Perfumers Workshop does a good job with this fragrance. Every 2 years I replenish my aunt&#x27;s supply and she loves it. It is actually light &amp; true to scent. Nothing weird here. Just rose. I only put fragrance onto the inside fabric of my blouse. It lasts nicely. I recommend it if you want a rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> Strong and long lasting.  I can&#x27;t agree with the other reviews that say that this smells like a rose garden or a fresh rose.  This is more of an absolute rose oil smell...it&#x27;s a potent Victorian rose smell like that of a candle or soap from back in the day.</li>
            <li> This is the truest rose scent I have ever encountered. I have been wearing it for many years and though it is increasingly hard to find, neither I nor my family would recognize me in any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> This scent smells like a true rose to me. I don&#x27;t pick up on a lot of different notes, but I used to buy Jo Malone for $115 a bottle and this smells just like it. I found my new perfume. It is very strong and one spray will be enough. I don&#x27;t know about the staying power yet as I have just now received it and tried it on for the first time. Even if it doesn&#x27;t last long at this price you could reapply.</li>
            <li> Tea Rose bought this product at the suggestion of a friend, their packaging is classically simple in color but the color Inner packing parfum captivated me, count on the security of amazon delivery.</li>
            <li> This smells incredible, at a reasonable price.  Mmmmm....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years.  I wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it!  I have a friend who liked it so much on me that she now uses it as well!!</li>
            <li> Have used this sent for over 20 years. I have received many compliments. People have looked around for the bouquet of Roses, then I tell them it&#x27;s my cologne.</li>
            <li> This really does smell like roses. Not a hint of roses, but like you&#x27;re smelling a bouquet. I love it. I get many compliments on it. It is not an overpowering scent, but more of soft fragrance as you pass by others. Perfect, perfect, perfect!</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite perfume and I&#x27;m Sooo happy I found it here as it was becoming really hard to locate. It was a great price as well!!</li>
            <li> I first remember using this perfume when I was about 11yrs old. My mom and I went to J C Penny and I sprayed our jackets down with this rosy perfume. We loved the scent until we got into the car. Oh my did we both get a fragrant headache:)&lt;br /&gt;It lingered for MONTHS not weeks or days and it did not die down at all, every time we put on those jackets she asked me, and I wondered why on earth did I spray them down like that. Those are fond memories and we laugh about it still after all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am older and a little less spray happy (who am I kidding?) I over sprayed it recently and my family was opening the door to air out the room because I love to use this as an air freshener, it last like nothing else!&lt;br /&gt;I really like the scent. One spray and you have a very comforting rose perfume that lasts all day. Spray 2 to 3 sprays in a room for a great garden breeze right inside your home, but be warned, over 5 sprays in a room and you will be having to air out your home.&lt;br /&gt;100 rosebushes in every bottle!</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. I have a bottle of real tea rose oil and I can&#x27;t tell the difference. The scent brings back memories about my mom&#x27;s garden back in Ukraine. Didn&#x27;t expect it would smell just like a real tea rose. Pay attention it&#x27;s eau de toilette, not perfume so will not last really long which is good for such strong rose scent. Does not bother anyone around me, people notice light rose scent, and puppies seem to like it too :) Overall, it&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This batch of perfume not the original scent..must be a bad batch...or sitting in storage too long...smell horrible..been using this for years and know what original scent smells like. This is not it..</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong very pleasant the price is very good it makes it easier to afford.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume.  I&#x27;ve had many compliments since it isn&#x27;t very strong, but lasts and smells very fresh..... just like roses!</li>
            <li> Smells like a rose heaven!</li>
            <li> Great smelling perfume!</li>
            <li> Lingering nice scent.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a try, as I was particularly looking for some rose-fragrance perfume, and actually this product just meets my need. The effect is light and pleasant and above all very natural - the smell is just like that of a species of pink rose that I have grown at my house. Very relaxing! Suitable for daily wear.</li>
            <li> beautiul fragrance for those who like roses</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume!  I only experience one thing when I spray on this classic: an overwhelming enveloping of the most succulent, indulgent, decadent, delicious, luxurious roses I&#x27;ve ever smelled. This, surely, must be what heaven smells like. I have kept this beauty in my collection since I was a teenager, and can&#x27;t imagine going without it. Ever. Even though I love so many scents, every time I wear this I remember that if I had to live the rest of my life with only one, it would have to be this beautiful oldie-but-goodie.</li>
            <li> probably my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance, well-packed and prompt.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been looking for tea rose fragrance for awhile. The fragrance is just what I wanted. I&#x27;m very happy with my&lt;br /&gt;order and would tell anyone to order through this store. Thank You, I hope to order another&lt;br /&gt;fragrance soon. J. Bess</li>
            <li> Love it! It has been my signature scent for years.</li>
            <li> Must say because it&#x27;s true - my brothers and sisters and I have bought countless bottles of perfume for my mother over the years.  She wore Tea Rose back in the late 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s and I was always \\&quot;awed\\&quot; by how \\&quot;rosy\\&quot; it smelled.  If I remember correctly, it didn&#x27;t smell like anything else, and for the money, it was actually exceedingly pretty.  So she settled on Tea Rose and kept it for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we talked her into something more expensive for her.  (Dopey of us, even arrogant, but true.)  Then, she got countless bottles of Chanel, Estee Lauder, Lancome and just about anything you could image.  And wore them (I&#x27;m thinking now more to please us)  for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, she&#x27;s finally asserting herself again and when asked which perfume, she was quite clear:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wanted to smell like roses and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am.  I just ordered it today and if it smells anything like it did 20 years ago, my mothers is going to be one happy, cutie pie!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will let you know when we receive it, but I&#x27;m pretty optimistic. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my best friend for her birthday and she comes to work smelling like a rose!!!!!  She loved it!!!!!</li>
            <li> For many years I have applied this cologne after bath or shower....just a few spritzers....&lt;br /&gt;have had many compliments from friends and acquaintances how delightful and pleasant it is.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and truly a touch of roses.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer it to the much more costly perfums that are often heavy and overpowering.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of real garden roses, this is the one for you.  The bottle lasts quite a while and the scent is not overpowering but lingers softly.</li>
