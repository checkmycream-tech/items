    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>it is perfect!</li>
            <li>Best of all, it feels like you&#x27;re going au naturel and even after 24 hours I don&#x27;t stink at all.</li>
            <li>this is a great deal I think?!</li>
            <li>I purchase this deodorant because it is the very best for me out there.  </li>
            <li>If you have boils to contend with then this is the best deodorant avail beyond baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>This stuff works perfectly if used after bathing - it doesn&#x27;t work like soap to remove existing bacteria, or perfume to kill bacteria with alcohol (and attempt to mask what it doesn&#x27;t kill).</li>
            <li>After researching I found that moisture is perfect for bacteria growth and it will cause odor.  </li>
            <li>Once it dries I spray the salt spray and then u are good to go!!</li>
            <li>Great item!</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic but this spray works wonderfully as a deodorant when used after showering.</li>
            <li>Best value out there.</li>
            <li>no reaction to this product, and it works just great every day!</li>
            <li>works great!</li>
            <li>Best ever!</li>
            <li>Excellent nonirritating deodorant control under all circumstances.  </li>
            <li>The article speculated the greatest amount of toxins had come from the mother&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant products!</li>
            <li>Love this!!!!</li>
            <li>Crystal deodorant has been my best option.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crystal stones and sprays are GREAT!  </li>
            <li>It protects *perfectly* for about 4 hours -- after this, I need to spray it again.</li>
            <li>Very great advice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great anti-odorant (not deodorant, not anti-antiperspirant, this is preventative stuff here!)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s impressive considering I can start to smell just twenty minutes out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In order to get the best use out of this product I had to learn a couple of things.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Awesome product and a bit easier to use than the roll-on.</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>I am ineed impressed and understand why my aunt always used it.</li>
            <li>Been real happy with this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alternative for me was a spray which is perfect!</li>
            <li>very impressed.</li>
            <li>This product is organic and it works great!</li>
            <li>Best of all I have had no irritation.</li>
            <li>This is the best spray to help control jock itch.</li>
            <li>Salts are the best ingredient I have found for my odor control.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job for that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the best product if you happen to have a problem with the aerosol spray kind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL benefit!  </li>
            <li>But this handles the odor issue excellently!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s good for sweaty feet and stinky shoes too!</li>
            <li>I just purchased the roll-on, and initially loved it!</li>
            <li>But it works beautifully and in the Summer gives a bit of added strength to the product.</li>
            <li>Great item bought for me and my daughter</li>
            <li>Would be great if you wear shoes without socks.</li>

            <li>This is great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This worked great</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, just wish the spray was a bit</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Now I am happy to say I do not.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses this and it works great.</li>
            <li>Works great for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Great protection without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>This has been a great alternative to using antiperspirants and deodorants.  </li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>great too.</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>Crystal Body Deodorant spray is convenient absolutely great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works great.</li>
            <li>I found another great benefit.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It prays upon those who want to be healthy with lies!!  </li>
            <li>more!!  </li>
            <li>I love and swear by this product!!</li>
            <li>Very effective protection, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  </li>
            <li>It work as it says it does, it is very effective.</li>
            <li>a pack of six good-sized sprays was handy!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, I just loved it!!!</li>
            <li>I got the tip from one of the top reviewers, who said that was the best way to get the most out of the deodorant spray, and it works!</li>
            <li>I also gave it a good rating because I prefer this spray type of deodorant, because the tip of the product never comes in contact with my skin, so bacteria from my skin cannot get into the product.</li>
            <li>One of the line of BEST aluminum free deodorants that work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product is good.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s good until about 3PM.  </li>
            <li>The deodorant works great on it&#x27;s own before I add the oil in case you were wondering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say, it&#x27;s a good buy when using it for the application I described.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go all day with ZERO odor.  </li>
            <li>works good in those smelly shoes or sandals, kills the bacteria that causes odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I add a couple drops of lavender and tea tree oils to increase effectiveness (and tea tree is good for razor burn).</li>
            <li>The product had good reviews on EWG but it does not work...</li>
            <li>and I was good to do.</li>
            <li>I tried making my own (coconut &amp; baking soda) and I did not find that type of deodorant pleasant whatsoever.</li>
            <li>The cost is exceptional on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I added this product to my subscribe and save program - it&#x27;s a great deal for a safe, effective product.</li>
            <li>, you will smell more!</li>
            <li>This product is NOT Aluminum free!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t smell any odor from your pits any more!</li>
            <li>I love spray on crystal deodorant!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Anyway - I love the spray!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING..</li>
            <li>This six pack is also an amazing value.</li>
            <li>Great product and available in bulk on Amazon</li>
            <li>This is amazing spray.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting the Thai stick one that is amazing.</li>
            <li>Once I discovered that Amazon carries it and much cheaper than I can find locally, I am very happy.</li>
            <li>I think you would have to reapply quite often to be close to effective.</li>
            <li>In fact I think it might have it&#x27;s own antiperspirant</li>
            <li>It is quite effective for me though my daughters and granddaughter find it not as effective.</li>
            <li>Most, it seemed, loved the idea of a toxic-free product, but couldn&#x27;t get the odor control they craved.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t even use this as a deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that effective.</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s been THAT kind of day.</li>
            <li>Aluminum free healthy and a great price.  </li>
            <li>cloths.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and spray pump are of very good quality works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say that it has no known harmful chemicals or scent which means you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a fruit, a flower or  some hormonal animal.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>This is safe &amp; extremely effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best.</li>
            <li>but it does keep the odor at bay well and doesn&#x27;t need the kind of reapplying most do.</li>
            <li>It also washes off easily, too!</li>
            <li>and my daughter doesn&#x27;t like it either, but I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>As stated by a previous reviewer, it is not an antiperspirant (which is good since many believe that the aluminum chlorhydrate in those products can pose health risks), but it is a GREAT Deodorant!!  </li>
            <li>this is okay</li>
            <li>Have been using this for many years now....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t rate 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t 100% get rid of the smell, but does an OK job of it.</li>
            <li>You want to be able to sweat without the odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most deodorants, but this one works well.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for many years</li>
            <li>and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>This product is the best for deodorizing with out harmful chemicals and such.</li>
            <li>and I just love the product.  </li>
            <li>It is packed with chemicals, mostly water.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This does the job under most circumstances.  </li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love???</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>and I was odor free until I showered again tonight!</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>For 20 years I tried different deodorants looking for that perfect one.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Been using it for many years but my Healthfood store stop selling this item.  </li>
            <li>It was warm when I opened it so do not feel comfortable letting my kids use it.</li>
            <li>Love the product,  been buying it for years, the way amazon shipped it</li>
            <li>Ok, this deo is like water</li>
            <li>Yes, I use the sray and roll-on just to be on the safe side...</li>
            <li>the product arrived I was pleased with the amount-</li>
            <li>This one has no scent no residue which I love.</li>
            <li>But I love it</li>
            <li>I love crystal deodorants now.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I love also that this deodorant is safe for using anywhere you sweat.  </li>
            <li>This is not only the most affordable but the best product I have EVER used to combat odor!</li>
            <li>My search goes on for a healthy deodorant.</li>
            <li>I also have to reapply this one or two more times throughout the day.</li>
            <li>, I love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this product controls odor actually better than the deodorants w/antiperspirants</li>
            <li>I remember my aunt using this product when I was younger, and I was impressed.</li>
            <li>Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave the residue most deodorants leave.</li>
            <li>Love the product but wish I could order fewer at a time.</li>
            <li>But I trusted what I had read and hoped that it would get better.  </li>
            <li>stars in my opinion. :)</li>
            <li>Yes, the stone is better but the spray is more convenient...</li>
            <li>This was the best price I found and appreciate having several bottles on hand.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Had a more girlish smell to it than for a dude.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the roll on and even though it works too, this feels refreshing to me.</li>
            <li>No horrible chemicals and no awful stains on garments.</li>
            <li>Why would this be any better?</li>
            <li>I am glad I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Since it is a pump spray it does not have the irritants that most deodorant in the spray cans have (</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for from a deodorant?</li>
            <li>Still kinda in shock :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried baby powder on top of the deodorant...</li>
            <li>and I have yet to wear it with a sleeveless top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced that it will be that way even with a sleeveless top.</li>
            <li>For better results shave you under arms and don&#x27;t use a soap made with &amp;#34;Animal Fats&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>
            <li>Get this, also more exposure to harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am getting more.  </li>
            <li>This does a pretty good job of preventing wetness and concealing the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so excited for a product!</li>
            <li>Most stuff gives me rashes of redness,  but this stuff is great and natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried natural deodorant sticks, the roll-on kind, etc, and this is good.</li>
            <li>Very happy, performs better than expected.  </li>
            <li>I made sure I drenched my under arm as some said and wasn&#x27;t sparse, I made sure all clothes touching the under arm were drenched, I made sure I put it on right after hopping out of the shower, and it still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Due to my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; and the fact that I can&#x27;t easily get to run the stick under the faucet drip, I&#x27;ve discovered that spraying a squirt of this (mostly water) onto the stick, is perfect.  </li>
            <li>So I took a chance (based on so many positive reviews), and I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>It keeps me odor free for many hours.</li>
            <li>Add free shipping with prime and its even better.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more readily available in the store which it isn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li>My old speedstick was great</li>
            <li>If I make sure to do this before any BO starts, I&#x27;m stink free for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>I did not know there was a spray available at the time I purchased the rock (maybe there wasn&#x27;t?) - but was pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li>I also use this under the girls, and it surprisingly prevents them from sweating as much.  </li>
            <li>I was SO pleased to find that this product worked REALLY well!!!</li>
            <li>A very effective and natural product which does not use chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Easy and convenient, no over</li>
            <li>For some reason, I&#x27;ve also had a difficult time finding liquid crystal deodorant in stores, so this multi-pack was a welcome find, not to mention an excellent value.</li>
            <li>Never stains my clothing (that is your deodorant, not your sweat that causes stains, by the way), and easily lasts all day.</li>
            <li>You do need to make sure your pits are clean when you apply as this product inhibits bacteria growth....</li>
            <li>is that it washes out of clothes so easily.</li>
            <li>I also find it safe and effective to use in intimate areas.</li>
            <li>Very mild on skin.  </li>
            <li>OK, even if this is embarrassing I am going to be very honest hoping this will help someone who is going through the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>The product itself is amazing and REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>Pretty amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>Odor control average at best.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Thai Crystal usually works better for me but they are both great products!</li>
            <li>but once i apply it again, im fine.</li>
            <li>It keeps me smelling fresh and its very light.</li>
            <li>but if you are a heavy sweater forget it you will stink especially on a warm day</li>
            <li>This fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Remember, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, just a fragrance free deoderant.</li>
            <li>The Crystal spray is light and functional.  </li>
            <li>I think it is worth it to not have to use the more toxic products that are out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am allergic to traditional deodorants and this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>Keeps me smelling fresh most of the time.  </li>
            <li>While I still get the occasional one or two pimples, it does a great job of controlling breakouts.</li>
            <li>I use this spray along with regular deodorant and it works great.</li>
            <li>I also use it under my bits and bobs in summer for odor free days.</li>
            <li>Was so happy to get such a deal here on Amazon for a pack of 6!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh, and I&#x27;ve never had sweaty or smelly feet in my entire life, but as another joy of pregnancy, I&#x27;m dealing with that, too, and using the crystal spray on my feet and in my shoes</li>
            <li>Great product, use regularly.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked well, kept me stink free</li>
            <li>Out of all the natural types of deodorants, this seems the safest and most effective of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and so far so good</li>
            <li>So best applied straight out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work about 1/3 of the time.</li>
            <li>question)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HuffPo&#x27;s got a good breakdown of some alternative natural deoderants:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just have to make sure you put it on right after showering</li>
            <li>I love this stuff works better than any high priced deodorant</li>
            <li>Also, the clinical antiperspirant I used was so intense, it took intentional scrubbing to remove it from my skin during the shower, but this stuff washes off very easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li>I just discovered the wipes (see seperate review) which work just as well but are travel friendly.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product at a store that starts with the letter</li>
            <li>I recommend the spray as I didn&#x27;t love the roller application I first bought.</li>
            <li>I have experienced irritation with this, but only rarely.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice alternative to the more standard deodorants.  </li>
            <li>No terrible anti-perspirant to smother me, just a nice, simple, clean deodorant.</li>
            <li>Tossed my old stinky clothes and all my news ones are safe!</li>
            <li>It has no scent, but you stay feeling clean and fresh and odor free.</li>
            <li>From my own personal experience I can say that a little is good, and more is even better with this product.</li>
            <li>I also use it to freshen my clothes, much like most people use Febreeze.</li>
            <li>Although, like any anti-perspirant or deodorant I&#x27;ve tried it really needs to be cleaned and re-applied after profuse sweating to continue its magic.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I liked the fact that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>This creates a nice natural relaxing scent along with additional antibacterial and antimicrobial properties.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about the roll-on is that you can bring it on a plane.</li>
            <li>Works better than antiperspirant and is not unhealthy.  </li>
            <li>If you sweat a lot (which your body does to cool itself) and if it bothers you then you will want to address that separately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, quick and easy to apply and usually is effective.</li>
            <li>I hve been using it for two years and other than having to re-apply from time to time, to avert stress perspiration, it is great.</li>
            <li>A couple of sprays under each arm from about a foot away, dressed within a few minutes and good to go all day!</li>
            <li>And delivery was quick, too.</li>
            <li>Just to be fair, I gave this product a few more chances.</li>
            <li>Overall this product works exceptionally well</li>
            <li>product does not prevent wetness but works adequately against odor.</li>
            <li>most definitely plan on buying more of this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, feels good and keeps the smell down.  </li>
            <li>so I am very aware of the impact that smells might have on others.</li>
            <li>from what I&#x27;ve learned, once you hop out of the shower and dry off, hit up both of your pits with this spray and hit them good.  </li>
            <li>I think I could easily sell this to my friends because I believe in it so much.  </li>
            <li>great product, seriously works better than most natural deodorants</li>
            <li>and i love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy to be able to find it on Amazon, usually at a multi-pack pricing that&#x27;s really affordable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really sweat much and even when I do; it is very light odor my body produce.</li>
            <li>first, I apply the roll-on then the spray all over right out of the shower!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and it works great.  </li>
            <li>With the roll-on kind, I noticed that it would start turning yellow after a while, because my skin would come into contact with the product tip.</li>
            <li>I was on a quest to find a more natural deodorant</li>
            <li>I tried the solid version and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this deodorant in stores, as it&#x27;s the only kind that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction on me.</li>
            <li>I also spray it all over my body, fresh out of the shower before putting my clothes on.  </li>
            <li>This stuff prevents smelly armpits and it is a natural product. :)</li>
            <li>I love using an all natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>When applied, it does feel overly moist and sort of gross, but when it dries it proves effective and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&quot; all the time, but the lack of clothing stains, the lack of toxins, and the fact that this product keeps odor away, makes it all worth</li>
            <li>Lived in Florida for years and crystal kept me fresh</li>
            <li>It is effective, leaves no white residue and is odorless.  </li>
            <li>Stops odor, but the irritation isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Its worth it to me not having to worry about the crystal breaking over time.</li>
            <li>The effect does tend to wear off by the end of the day, but worth not using antiperspirant chemicals.</li>
            <li>May be just a bit pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all three application methods and the spray is by far the most convenient.</li>
            <li>Still works the same as far as being a great deodorant</li>
            <li>Great natural alternative to traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li>The spray is a nice size and can be carried in your purse for an instant freshen up!  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is not only all natural, but very effective at controlling bacterial colonies on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few years, pretty effective, and safe</li>
            <li>I put it on right after a shower.   </li>
            <li>What can you right about deodorant.</li>
            <li>I also always planned sex right after a shower, I didn&#x27;t want my g/f to have to smell my odor.  </li>
            <li>We have started giving the inside of her uniforms (and her) a good spray down before games and she stays fresh as a daisy throughout.  </li>
            <li>Small bottle is great for traveling.</li>
            <li>A really great alternative to the stick crystal, which would fall out of the container and usually break as it got closer to the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I find that using this spray product a minimum of twice a day is more effective than once a day, and the issue of reapplying bacteria from a solid stick is obviously removed.  </li>
            <li>It generally lasts me most of the day, I may reapply if I get a chance in the evening or</li>
            <li>I bought this spray and the roll-on kind as well, and I&#x27;ve found the most effective technique is to spray this on, then use the roll-on (because the roll-on needs to be dampened to be used, and it&#x27;s kind of annoying to use water, either on the crystal or directly on the skin).</li>
            <li>As previously stated, it is not an antiperspirant, but if one does suffer from persiration odor this is a good deterrant.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I am lucky to get it through the day, but this is not a problem, as I have a modern apparatus called shower.</li>
            <li>Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil to a bottle of liquid crystal deodorant to create your own custom deodorant!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first natural option I have really been pleased with.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the most effective natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>For the regular day, however, it is clean and  leaves me odor free.</li>
            <li>the only product that does NOT have carcinogens and is safe to use.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well!</li>
            <li>It was neither hot nor humid.</li>
            <li>I keep one in the car for hot summer day touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>This item worked pretty well</li>
            <li>My underarms feel so much better after I stopped using the commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li>This spray works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>and it get pretty hot and humid</li>
            <li>Thanks to all the reviewers who helped me decide to give it a try!</li>
            <li>I love knowing I&#x27;ve eliminated daily use of aluminum on my person.  </li>
            <li>and also I combine 91% or higher rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty stinky</li>
            <li>First and foremost</li>
            <li>so I have many left.  </li>
            <li>I found this to work best for me, and it usually works for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>I use this deodorant as in on my feet during winter time of wearing hot socks, or knee highs.</li>
            <li>Other deodorants irritate my skin, but I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I do put it on at night, too, but I really don&#x27;t get stinky!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I read their review before starting to use this)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m definitely doing better and like the results.</li>
            <li>I do not like to use antiperspirant any more than needed, especially in colder weather.</li>
            <li>I first used this product on Wednesday--5 sprays on each underarm.  </li>
            <li>This is the only deoderant I have been able to use in years, and I appreciate their quality products.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in the hot AZ (112 degrees) sun for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have a funny smell when wearing sleeveless shirts</li>
            <li>I am glad I made the decision to buy this after googling if anyone else had that same experience when wearing sleeveless tops and found that this is what people use!</li>
            <li>I was the first mate on a tourist ship in the gulf of mexico, sweating for 16 hours a day 6 days a week while providing 5 star service for people.</li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s a deodorant, NOT AN ANTI-PERSPIRANT.</li>
            <li>A useful tip is shower-up your under arms, spray the crystal body, let it dry, and spray your favorite cologne/perfume over it.</li>
            <li>I kept opening new ones in disbelief but maybe it&#x27;s true that stuff like this they dump on Amazon to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>Using this right out of the bath really works.</li>
            <li>I bought this after wanting to go the more natural route of deodorants, after reading about the dangers or normal products that I&#x27;ve used my whole life.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant does a pretty good job in controlling odor, but I do have to reapply several hours later.  </li>
            <li>A good producrt but the solid roll up is bette and last longer.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very hot and humid climate.  </li>
            <li>The main thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is that it has no scent whatsoever, and you have to put it on right after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>But I think I like the spray a bit better... strangely easier to manage maybe?  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d tried pretty much everything on the market from sephora and the organic markets</li>
            <li>fast ship, exactly as pictured</li>
            <li>(No I do not live in a super hot climate, I&#x27;m just special</li>
            <li>My husband and I have been using this for years and as long as you put it on right out of the shower you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>I apply, dry, and then apply my deodorant on top.</li>
            <li>Does not remove body odor 100%, but does remove it to a certain extent..</li>
            <li>I have large breast and have had odor underneath them.</li>
            <li>LOVE that this is not chock full of the same chemicals in standard deodorants!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spraying multiple times per day if it works, and I need a little more time before I am sure.  </li>
            <li>product works amazingly well and after a few days of use, there&#x27;s no body odor whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>only available in roll-on.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this deoderant for awhile now, and really like that</li>
            <li>This spray itself does not have much of a smell, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to the reviewer(s) who suggested spraying and then massaging it into your armpits a bit...</li>
            <li>I never had much odor to begin with</li>
            <li>Hypoallergenic, no odor, and it really works.  </li>
            <li>Product really stops the stink.  </li>
            <li>and it really does work for about 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>very minuscule odor on my underwear or cycling shorts.  </li>
            <li>I used to stink so much</li>
            <li>My whole family loves this product.</li>
            <li>It works very well and doesn&#x27;t contain anything harmful for your body in it.</li>
            <li>This product is excelent, really works.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>It works very well and has really helped her stay fresher.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy another deodorant because it leaves absolutely ZERO RESIDUE on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and it compliments deodorant very well.  </li>
            <li>stuff will work for a couple days straight.  </li>
            <li>Once you see the results you&#x27;ll then start to try to hone in how much you really&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a purple spray bottle that does not look very manly, you may have to compensate elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you see the results you&#x27;ll then start to try to hone in how much you really&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a purple spray bottle that does not look very manly, you may have to compensate elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose asking to shower twice a day is a bit much for some, but if you know the difference between Pima and Egyptian cotton, you will probably appreciate this deodorant.</li>
            <li>The combination of the two work really well.</li>
            <li>, I think I might stick to this AFTER the baby!&lt;br /&gt;Another real perk of using this</li>
            <li>This product keeps you from smelling and we really like the fact were not putting aluminum in our bodies.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really had that problem.</li>
            <li>It controls body odors very well.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for a few days now, so I feel like I can give it an honest review on the performance.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin and not only does this not bother me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear, not sticky and dries in a flash, so it&#x27;s not that big a deal for such a good product.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and normal deodorants irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Many are not aware of this product and it is getting harder to find as some drug stores (you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d know better as they are in the business to HELP people) have discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>but I do not think it is too large a price to pay for a clean alternative to traditional deodorants.</li>
            <li>and/or my hand and shatter easily, and picked up strange smells over the course of their lifespan.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I thought it was just water, but I was very surprised it worked and worked well.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find a deodorant that didn&#x27;t have aluminum and a bunch of other chemical ingredients,  but also worked.</li>
            <li>These crystal products prevent bacteria from growing any further - clean skin is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Firstly, this deodorant does what it is meant to do and does it well for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Being in liquid form and with the pump spray there is no mess or residue to deal with, and it does *</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re BO free all day long.  </li>
            <li>I was sensitive to all the commercial brands--even many of the hypoallergenic--but this is a completely reaction-free solution.</li>
            <li>only suggestion I have at this time is that it would be good if the product was also available in large single containers in order to recycle the spray bottles and reduce landfill waste.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than any other deodorant!</li>
            <li>I put it on  right after showering and it still doesn&#x27;t help even under normal daily activities let alone working out or hot days.</li>
            <li>I do have to use anti-perspirant from time to time if I&#x27;m going to be in a highly stressful situation, but I&#x27;m glad that my day to day isn&#x27;t the toxic mess that is modern day deodorants.</li>
            <li>I used crystal solids in the past and found them almost as effective as many of the stronger solid deodorants, but holding the same issue of transferring adhering bacteria.  </li>
            <li>Other natural deodorants feel better on the skin, but are very ineffective against odor.</li>
            <li>I do lightly pat myself dry with a towel after.</li>
            <li>The main reason she likes is because it doesn&#x27;t stain her blouses.</li>
            <li>But this does a decent job for me as a baseline...</li>
            <li>Only downside is after doing something physically demanding, you have to spray more on, or else you&#x27;ll start smelling again.</li>
            <li>While pregnant with my last baby, I came across an article about toxins in breastmilk.</li>
            <li>One other great feature, is no sweet smell and no aluminum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small inconvenience, but I am convinced that it&#x27;s still better than taxing my body with chemicals and subjecting myself to a higher risk of cancer.</li>
            <li>I am not so lucky in local</li>
            <li>The only drawback is its different consistency from mainstream products (doesn&#x27;t glide on) but just a couple sprays in the morning, and I&#x27;m good all day long.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this spray, it works so well.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, it deserves the highest rating.</li>
            <li>I have paid high dollar for clinical brands and even tried the sports version.  </li>
            <li>I can also add I put a few drops of tea tree oil to mine (also anti-fungal properties) and this not only gives it a soft, pleasant smell (if you like the smell of tea tree oil), but also amps up the deodorant quality a bit.</li>
            <li>In spite of the large number of bottles in the order, I returned to my old stand-by, Mitchum&#x27;s antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I found the spray to work a little better.  </li>
            <li>This product may not be as strong as other deodorants</li>
            <li>My Hubby prefers this spray verses the roll on and it keeps us all clean and dry.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to work outdoors and work up a sweat then you will need more of a deodorant but for normal everyday wear</li>
            <li>The aluminum chlorohydrate in normal deodorants irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>powering smell, works at blocking odor, had no negative results from using it yet.  </li>
            <li>am not the only one in our home with success.</li>
            <li>I used to use normal deodorant until I started getting rashes.</li>
            <li>but i find this one more convenient but it may not last quite as long.  </li>
            <li>I did try to spray extra when I found it wasn&#x27;t working, which just meant I had more of this liquid to dry up.  </li>
            <li>It works great and it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals and dangerous ingredients as many of the other brands sold in the stores.</li>
            <li>but my spouse also uses keeps us dry and cool.</li>
            <li>When you first spray, you may smell a slight sulfur smell but that quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li>I live in LA (as in Lower Alabama:&gt;)</li>
            <li>And I should also mention that I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and anti-persp.</li>
            <li>For those looking for natural deodorant, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can count, on my hand, the number of times where I had a faint odor- not bad for a hot and humid summer while pregnant!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, this is a deodorant only and does nothing (that I&#x27;m aware of anyway) to decrease the amount of perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>My husband has also tried this and so far no complaints from him as well!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>But Green Tidings; this the only natural deodorant that I have found effective....</li>
            <li>The liquid version of crystal-type deodorants solves just about all of the problems that I had with the actual crystals in the past: they were messy to apply properly (since they need to cover the entire underarm as well as a good portion of adjacent skin in order to be effective), tended to slip out of the container</li>
            <li>My confidence is back to normal!!  </li>
            <li>The way I figured, odor was less important than not-poisoning my baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin and cannot use most of the usual deodorants and antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>I normally have to keep switching, but this one controls odor very well, by the time i shower the next day, i am not stinky at all.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s a spray and goes on wet, but it dries quickly and keeps odor at bay.</li>
            <li>I only do 3 sprays to start because any more than that and the product will just drip down your sides.</li>
            <li>This was the best deal out there and less expensive than the supermarkets here.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have a lot of trouble sweating and a busy job, at times I am running up and down stairs for a good portion of my shift.</li>
            <li>I make sure I spray my armpits and the entire underside of my arms up to 4&amp;#34; above and below the armpits, and then I sort of rub my arms against my skin to help it dry.  </li>
            <li>This kind of stuff works well for me for 24 hours, including through a tough work-out.</li>
            <li>You need to apply it to clean dry skin, right after you exit the shower and leave your arms up for about half a minute to give it time to</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to find products MCS safe.</li>
            <li>Many reviews I read (on this and other sites) claimed the poster had to reapply at least once during the course of the day because they detected a mild odor.</li>
            <li>;  It does not stain my shirts and is clear.</li>
            <li>We decided we wanted to look for something natural, and we found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it because its completely natural, but it does have a couple flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Wow, wow,</li>
            <li>and I noticed that I&#x27;m not missing the antiperspirant at all.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrances and this has none.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Ultra Max Fresh (found at a dollar store) than Secret (either clinical or regular), but YMMV.</li>
            <li>Works well for myself and my 14 year old daughter, and I&#x27;m not worried about any aluminum or chemicals.</li>
            <li>Decided a while back to stop using aluminum-containing deodorants, and this has always worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>This is by far the cheapest price on this product.  </li>
            <li>(remember, if you are using the antiperspirant and then going into natural, your body will detox from all the junk you&#x27;ve been putting into it...as even your antiperspirant/deodorant DOES absorb through the skin)  </li>
            <li>Another thing I have noticed with switching to natural crystal deodorants, my clothing does not get stained.  </li>
            <li>It completely neutralized underarm odor and stays that way all day and night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For being natural and non-toxic, they deserve 10 stars.</li>
            <li>I have terribly sensitive skin on my underarms of all places, and was about to attempt going through life without deodorant at all when I discovered this stuff.</li>
            <li>whatever shirt will be directly against your pits) and give your pits another hit.  </li>
            <li>Feel like an old person sticking up for war time.</li>
            <li>How about adding a natural buffering ingredient to it?</li>
            <li>Not only in my armpits but in my intimate parts too.</li>
            <li>I am a very stinky sweater and this prevents odors far better than aluminum deodorants that just mix with BO and give me a worse smelling funk than BO alone.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter gets a spray on her feet too, those winter boots and socks had her feet smelling like chips and vinegar.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural deodorant</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive and I have had no irritation with this</li>
            <li>and so far he likes it a lot.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this works.</li>
            <li>This stuff still has &#x27;Alum&#x27; in it - a Potassium Aluminum salt, the &#x27;Natural Mineral&#x27; they are talking about here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using Crystal Body spray deodorant when no other deodorants seemed to live up to the job.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose, so I usually have to pre-treat the underarms of my shirts before laundering, because if any deodorant lingers on there through the wash, it smells gross on otherwise clean clothes, and that was a real problem with the organic deodorant.</li>
            <li>The spray version is only available at a couple of local retailers and their price is far more expensive than Amazon.  </li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use a crystal rock first, I have used vodka instead by just applying a small amount under the arms, rubbing it in first, and then add the crystal spray.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light and not overwhelming by any means.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a sweat machine in your normal day-to-day, i do not think this will be enough to keep your sweat in check, just the odor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not skip-a-day deodorant, no natural ones are as far as I&#x27;m aware, but it&#x27;s gotten the job done for me in different weather conditions.</li>
            <li>I find the spray much more convenient than the hard crystal and works equally as well.</li>
            <li>and once a few minutes later) and live with mild odor.</li>
            <li>I added a few drops of blood orange essential oil to it (orange oil curbs odor) just to give it a light scent and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use this deodorant - it is absolutely safe on delicate skin.</li>
            <li>You are still gonna sweat, but you generally won&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li>You really do not need a lot and it works very well.....</li>
            <li>The Crystal body spray not only fights the odor of sweat naturally</li>
            <li>daughter plays volleyball and there are times when she has more than one game per night.  </li>
            <li>It will feel wet, but will dry off quick enough</li>
            <li>The bottom line it really does the trick, it removes odors and prevents them extremely well.  </li>
            <li>So worth the little extra time to allow for drying because I NEVER deal with BO anymore.  </li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because I wouldn&#x27;t say it last a full 24hrs, and under physical activity I would say less than that.</li>
            <li>When traveling, I&#x27;ll bring the hard crystal through TSA, and apply it to wet armpits, and while at home, I&#x27;ll use the more convenient spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As many have stated, if you spray too much, it will end up running down your arm/chest which is irritating.  </li>
            <li>I AM curious about something similar for perspiration as this really mostly/only defeats odor.</li>
            <li>Keeps me socially acceptable.</li>
            <li>Additionally it can be used under breasts and roll directly onto private areas for extra odor control after showering.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical since I have tried many natural stick deodorants</li>
            <li>I have been using something with lavender and tea tree oil but had to apply frequently and it left white rings...</li>
            <li>have tried mentioning the wonderfulness of this product several times to my hubby, who suffers from stinky feet (as it is also advertised that this product is good for that as well).  </li>
            <li>This caused me to sweat very easily and uncomfortably around my rectum.  </li>
            <li>no more funny chemicals!</li>
            <li>Good price and less messy than the plain crystals.</li>
            <li>My family members with allergies use the Crystal Body Deodorant Spray to avoid certain compounds present in other spray deodorants.</li>
            <li>The packaging may be pink, but the male pictured front and center tells you exactly who this product is made for!</li>
            <li>I actually feel less sweaty, and I never smell like anything, not body odor and not fake masking aroma.</li>
            <li>I started using the solid crystal rock by the same company a couple of years ago, as part of a shift to using natural products whenever possible.  </li>
            <li>Until then, I purchased it to spray the inside of my clothes so that they remain fresh while enduring this unbelievable heat wave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that you can kill its ability to work by applying some deodorants/anti-perspirant after it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li>It keeps odor away for at least a full day.  </li>
            <li>On first few uses, my assessment is that this is not an optimal product for underarm use.  </li>
            <li>Even during heavy workouts and intense sweating, I do not stink!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a few days of stinkiness for the health benefits!</li>
            <li>I am a really really sweaty person I get pit stains pretty much any time of year although I&#x27;ve never been particularly prone to smelling bad.</li>
            <li>I have to spray a little and let it dry, then spray a little more.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the solid, dries quickly, works at least 12 hours to prevent odor.  </li>
            <li>and I paid nearly eight dollars for a single bottle of this!</li>
            <li>My husband developed a bad rash in his armpits, so we decided to try a more natural product while his skin healed.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> it is perfect!</li>
            <li> Best of all, it feels like you&#x27;re going au naturel and even after 24 hours I don&#x27;t stink at all.</li>
            <li> this is a great deal I think?!</li>
            <li> I purchase this deodorant because it is the very best for me out there.  </li>
            <li> If you have boils to contend with then this is the best deodorant avail beyond baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> This stuff works perfectly if used after bathing - it doesn&#x27;t work like soap to remove existing bacteria, or perfume to kill bacteria with alcohol (and attempt to mask what it doesn&#x27;t kill).</li>
            <li> After researching I found that moisture is perfect for bacteria growth and it will cause odor.  </li>
            <li> Once it dries I spray the salt spray and then u are good to go!!</li>
            <li> Great item!</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic but this spray works wonderfully as a deodorant when used after showering.</li>
            <li> Best value out there.</li>
            <li> no reaction to this product, and it works just great every day!</li>
            <li> works great!</li>

            <li> Excellent nonirritating deodorant control under all circumstances.  </li>
            <li> The article speculated the greatest amount of toxins had come from the mother&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant products!</li>
            <li> Love this!!!!</li>
            <li> Crystal deodorant has been my best option.</li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crystal stones and sprays are GREAT!  </li>
            <li> It protects *perfectly* for about 4 hours -- after this, I need to spray it again.</li>
            <li> Very great advice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great anti-odorant (not deodorant, not anti-antiperspirant, this is preventative stuff here!)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s impressive considering I can start to smell just twenty minutes out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In order to get the best use out of this product I had to learn a couple of things.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Awesome product and a bit easier to use than the roll-on.</li>
            <li> Perfect!</li>

            <li> very impressed.</li>
            <li> This product is organic and it works great!</li>
            <li> Best of all I have had no irritation.</li>
            <li> This is the best spray to help control jock itch.</li>
            <li> Salts are the best ingredient I have found for my odor control.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the best product if you happen to have a problem with the aerosol spray kind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for sweaty feet and stinky shoes too!</li>
            <li> I just purchased the roll-on, and initially loved it!</li>
            <li> But it works beautifully and in the Summer gives a bit of added strength to the product.</li>
            <li> Great item bought for me and my daughter</li>
            <li> Would be great if you wear shoes without socks.</li>
            <li> And great price too</li>

            <li> This is actually a great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sounded like a great product, so we both tried it as a body</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My husband uses this and it works great.</li>
            <li> Works great for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Great protection without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> This has been a great alternative to using antiperspirants and deodorants.  </li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> great too.</li>
            <li> It is great.</li>

            <li> I found another great benefit.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It prays upon those who want to be healthy with lies!!  </li>
            <li> more!!  </li>
            <li> I love and swear by this product!!</li>
            <li> Very effective protection, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  </li>
            <li> It work as it says it does, it is very effective.</li>
            <li> a pack of six good-sized sprays was handy!</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, I just loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I got the tip from one of the top reviewers, who said that was the best way to get the most out of the deodorant spray, and it works!</li>
            <li> I also gave it a good rating because I prefer this spray type of deodorant, because the tip of the product never comes in contact with my skin, so bacteria from my skin cannot get into the product.</li>
            <li> One of the line of BEST aluminum free deodorants that work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product is good.</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s good until about 3PM.  </li>
            <li> The deodorant works great on it&#x27;s own before I add the oil in case you were wondering.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say, it&#x27;s a good buy when using it for the application I described.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go all day with ZERO odor.  </li>
            <li> works good in those smelly shoes or sandals, kills the bacteria that causes odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add a couple drops of lavender and tea tree oils to increase effectiveness (and tea tree is good for razor burn).</li>
            <li> The product had good reviews on EWG but it does not work...</li>
            <li> and I was good to do.</li>
            <li> I tried making my own (coconut &amp; baking soda) and I did not find that type of deodorant pleasant whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The cost is exceptional on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I added this product to my subscribe and save program - it&#x27;s a great deal for a safe, effective product.</li>
            <li> , you will smell more!</li>
            <li> This product is NOT Aluminum free!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t smell any odor from your pits any more!</li>
            <li> I love spray on crystal deodorant!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Anyway - I love the spray!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> AMAZING..</li>
            <li> This six pack is also an amazing value.</li>
            <li> Great product and available in bulk on Amazon</li>
            <li> This is amazing spray.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting the Thai stick one that is amazing.</li>
            <li> Once I discovered that Amazon carries it and much cheaper than I can find locally, I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I think you would have to reapply quite often to be close to effective.</li>
            <li> In fact I think it might have it&#x27;s own antiperspirant</li>
            <li> It is quite effective for me though my daughters and granddaughter find it not as effective.</li>
            <li> Most, it seemed, loved the idea of a toxic-free product, but couldn&#x27;t get the odor control they craved.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t even use this as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that effective.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s been THAT kind of day.</li>
            <li> Aluminum free healthy and a great price.  </li>
            <li> cloths.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and spray pump are of very good quality works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say that it has no known harmful chemicals or scent which means you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a fruit, a flower or  some hormonal animal.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> This is safe &amp; extremely effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best.</li>
            <li> but it does keep the odor at bay well and doesn&#x27;t need the kind of reapplying most do.</li>
            <li> It also washes off easily, too!</li>
            <li> and my daughter doesn&#x27;t like it either, but I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> As stated by a previous reviewer, it is not an antiperspirant (which is good since many believe that the aluminum chlorhydrate in those products can pose health risks), but it is a GREAT Deodorant!!  </li>
            <li> this is okay</li>
            <li> Have been using this for many years now....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rate 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t 100% get rid of the smell, but does an OK job of it.</li>
            <li> You want to be able to sweat without the odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most deodorants, but this one works well.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for many years</li>
            <li> and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is the best for deodorizing with out harmful chemicals and such.</li>
            <li> and I just love the product.  </li>
            <li> It is packed with chemicals, mostly water.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This does the job under most circumstances.  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s not to love???</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> and I was odor free until I showered again tonight!</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> For 20 years I tried different deodorants looking for that perfect one.  </li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Been using it for many years but my Healthfood store stop selling this item.  </li>
            <li> It was warm when I opened it so do not feel comfortable letting my kids use it.</li>
            <li> Love the product,  been buying it for years, the way amazon shipped it</li>
            <li> Ok, this deo is like water</li>
            <li> Yes, I use the sray and roll-on just to be on the safe side...</li>
            <li> the product arrived I was pleased with the amount-</li>
            <li> This one has no scent no residue which I love.</li>
            <li> But I love it</li>
            <li> I love crystal deodorants now.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> I love also that this deodorant is safe for using anywhere you sweat.  </li>
            <li> This is not only the most affordable but the best product I have EVER used to combat odor!</li>
            <li> My search goes on for a healthy deodorant.</li>
            <li> I also have to reapply this one or two more times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> , I love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this product controls odor actually better than the deodorants w/antiperspirants</li>
            <li> I remember my aunt using this product when I was younger, and I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave the residue most deodorants leave.</li>
            <li> Love the product but wish I could order fewer at a time.</li>
            <li> But I trusted what I had read and hoped that it would get better.  </li>
            <li> stars in my opinion. :)</li>
            <li> Yes, the stone is better but the spray is more convenient...</li>
            <li> This was the best price I found and appreciate having several bottles on hand.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Had a more girlish smell to it than for a dude.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the roll on and even though it works too, this feels refreshing to me.</li>
            <li> No horrible chemicals and no awful stains on garments.</li>
            <li> Why would this be any better?</li>
            <li> I am glad I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Since it is a pump spray it does not have the irritants that most deodorant in the spray cans have (</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for from a deodorant?</li>
            <li> Still kinda in shock :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried baby powder on top of the deodorant...</li>
            <li> and I have yet to wear it with a sleeveless top</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that it will be that way even with a sleeveless top.</li>
            <li> For better results shave you under arms and don&#x27;t use a soap made with &amp;#34;Animal Fats&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works like magic.</li>
            <li> Get this, also more exposure to harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am getting more.  </li>
            <li> This does a pretty good job of preventing wetness and concealing the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so excited for a product!</li>
            <li> Most stuff gives me rashes of redness,  but this stuff is great and natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried natural deodorant sticks, the roll-on kind, etc, and this is good.</li>
            <li> Very happy, performs better than expected.  </li>
            <li> I made sure I drenched my under arm as some said and wasn&#x27;t sparse, I made sure all clothes touching the under arm were drenched, I made sure I put it on right after hopping out of the shower, and it still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Due to my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; and the fact that I can&#x27;t easily get to run the stick under the faucet drip, I&#x27;ve discovered that spraying a squirt of this (mostly water) onto the stick, is perfect.  </li>
            <li> So I took a chance (based on so many positive reviews), and I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> It keeps me odor free for many hours.</li>
            <li> Add free shipping with prime and its even better.</li>
            <li> Wish it was more readily available in the store which it isn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> My old speedstick was great</li>
            <li> If I make sure to do this before any BO starts, I&#x27;m stink free for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> I did not know there was a spray available at the time I purchased the rock (maybe there wasn&#x27;t?) - but was pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li> I also use this under the girls, and it surprisingly prevents them from sweating as much.  </li>
            <li> I was SO pleased to find that this product worked REALLY well!!!</li>
            <li> A very effective and natural product which does not use chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Easy and convenient, no over</li>
            <li> For some reason, I&#x27;ve also had a difficult time finding liquid crystal deodorant in stores, so this multi-pack was a welcome find, not to mention an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Never stains my clothing (that is your deodorant, not your sweat that causes stains, by the way), and easily lasts all day.</li>
            <li> You do need to make sure your pits are clean when you apply as this product inhibits bacteria growth....</li>
            <li> is that it washes out of clothes so easily.</li>
            <li> I also find it safe and effective to use in intimate areas.</li>
            <li> Very mild on skin.  </li>
            <li> OK, even if this is embarrassing I am going to be very honest hoping this will help someone who is going through the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing and REALLY works!  </li>
            <li> Pretty amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li> Odor control average at best.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Thai Crystal usually works better for me but they are both great products!</li>
            <li> but once i apply it again, im fine.</li>
            <li> It keeps me smelling fresh and its very light.</li>
            <li> but if you are a heavy sweater forget it you will stink especially on a warm day</li>
            <li> This fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Remember, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, just a fragrance free deoderant.</li>
            <li> The Crystal spray is light and functional.  </li>
            <li> I think it is worth it to not have to use the more toxic products that are out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am allergic to traditional deodorants and this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling fresh most of the time.  </li>
            <li> While I still get the occasional one or two pimples, it does a great job of controlling breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use this spray along with regular deodorant and it works great.</li>
            <li> I also use it under my bits and bobs in summer for odor free days.</li>
            <li> Was so happy to get such a deal here on Amazon for a pack of 6!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh, and I&#x27;ve never had sweaty or smelly feet in my entire life, but as another joy of pregnancy, I&#x27;m dealing with that, too, and using the crystal spray on my feet and in my shoes</li>
            <li> Great product, use regularly.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked well, kept me stink free</li>
            <li> Out of all the natural types of deodorants, this seems the safest and most effective of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and so far so good</li>
            <li> So best applied straight out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work about 1/3 of the time.</li>
            <li> question)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HuffPo&#x27;s got a good breakdown of some alternative natural deoderants:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just have to make sure you put it on right after showering</li>
            <li> I love this stuff works better than any high priced deodorant</li>
            <li> Also, the clinical antiperspirant I used was so intense, it took intentional scrubbing to remove it from my skin during the shower, but this stuff washes off very easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I just discovered the wipes (see seperate review) which work just as well but are travel friendly.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at a store that starts with the letter</li>
            <li> I recommend the spray as I didn&#x27;t love the roller application I first bought.</li>
            <li> I have experienced irritation with this, but only rarely.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to the more standard deodorants.  </li>
            <li> No terrible anti-perspirant to smother me, just a nice, simple, clean deodorant.</li>
            <li> Tossed my old stinky clothes and all my news ones are safe!</li>
            <li> It has no scent, but you stay feeling clean and fresh and odor free.</li>
            <li> From my own personal experience I can say that a little is good, and more is even better with this product.</li>
            <li> I also use it to freshen my clothes, much like most people use Febreeze.</li>
            <li> Although, like any anti-perspirant or deodorant I&#x27;ve tried it really needs to be cleaned and re-applied after profuse sweating to continue its magic.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I liked the fact that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> This creates a nice natural relaxing scent along with additional antibacterial and antimicrobial properties.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about the roll-on is that you can bring it on a plane.</li>
            <li> Works better than antiperspirant and is not unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> If you sweat a lot (which your body does to cool itself) and if it bothers you then you will want to address that separately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, quick and easy to apply and usually is effective.</li>
            <li> I hve been using it for two years and other than having to re-apply from time to time, to avert stress perspiration, it is great.</li>
            <li> A couple of sprays under each arm from about a foot away, dressed within a few minutes and good to go all day!</li>
            <li> And delivery was quick, too.</li>
            <li> Just to be fair, I gave this product a few more chances.</li>
            <li> Overall this product works exceptionally well</li>
            <li> product does not prevent wetness but works adequately against odor.</li>
            <li> most definitely plan on buying more of this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, feels good and keeps the smell down.  </li>
            <li> so I am very aware of the impact that smells might have on others.</li>
            <li> from what I&#x27;ve learned, once you hop out of the shower and dry off, hit up both of your pits with this spray and hit them good.  </li>
            <li> I think I could easily sell this to my friends because I believe in it so much.  </li>
            <li> great product, seriously works better than most natural deodorants</li>
            <li> and i love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m happy to be able to find it on Amazon, usually at a multi-pack pricing that&#x27;s really affordable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really sweat much and even when I do; it is very light odor my body produce.</li>
            <li> first, I apply the roll-on then the spray all over right out of the shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and it works great.  </li>
            <li> With the roll-on kind, I noticed that it would start turning yellow after a while, because my skin would come into contact with the product tip.</li>
            <li> I was on a quest to find a more natural deodorant</li>
            <li> I tried the solid version and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this deodorant in stores, as it&#x27;s the only kind that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction on me.</li>
            <li> I also spray it all over my body, fresh out of the shower before putting my clothes on.  </li>
            <li> This stuff prevents smelly armpits and it is a natural product. :)</li>
            <li> I love using an all natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> When applied, it does feel overly moist and sort of gross, but when it dries it proves effective and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &quot; all the time, but the lack of clothing stains, the lack of toxins, and the fact that this product keeps odor away, makes it all worth</li>
            <li> Lived in Florida for years and crystal kept me fresh</li>
            <li> It is effective, leaves no white residue and is odorless.  </li>
            <li> Stops odor, but the irritation isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Its worth it to me not having to worry about the crystal breaking over time.</li>
            <li> The effect does tend to wear off by the end of the day, but worth not using antiperspirant chemicals.</li>
            <li> May be just a bit pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all three application methods and the spray is by far the most convenient.</li>
            <li> Still works the same as far as being a great deodorant</li>
            <li> Great natural alternative to traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li> The spray is a nice size and can be carried in your purse for an instant freshen up!  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is not only all natural, but very effective at controlling bacterial colonies on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years, pretty effective, and safe</li>
            <li> I put it on right after a shower.   </li>
            <li> What can you right about deodorant.</li>
            <li> I also always planned sex right after a shower, I didn&#x27;t want my g/f to have to smell my odor.  </li>
            <li> We have started giving the inside of her uniforms (and her) a good spray down before games and she stays fresh as a daisy throughout.  </li>
            <li> Small bottle is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> A really great alternative to the stick crystal, which would fall out of the container and usually break as it got closer to the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I find that using this spray product a minimum of twice a day is more effective than once a day, and the issue of reapplying bacteria from a solid stick is obviously removed.  </li>
            <li> It generally lasts me most of the day, I may reapply if I get a chance in the evening or</li>
            <li> I bought this spray and the roll-on kind as well, and I&#x27;ve found the most effective technique is to spray this on, then use the roll-on (because the roll-on needs to be dampened to be used, and it&#x27;s kind of annoying to use water, either on the crystal or directly on the skin).</li>
            <li> As previously stated, it is not an antiperspirant, but if one does suffer from persiration odor this is a good deterrant.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I am lucky to get it through the day, but this is not a problem, as I have a modern apparatus called shower.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil to a bottle of liquid crystal deodorant to create your own custom deodorant!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first natural option I have really been pleased with.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most effective natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> For the regular day, however, it is clean and  leaves me odor free.</li>
            <li> the only product that does NOT have carcinogens and is safe to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well!</li>
            <li> It was neither hot nor humid.</li>
            <li> I keep one in the car for hot summer day touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> This item worked pretty well</li>
            <li> My underarms feel so much better after I stopped using the commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li> This spray works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> and it get pretty hot and humid</li>
            <li> Thanks to all the reviewers who helped me decide to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love knowing I&#x27;ve eliminated daily use of aluminum on my person.  </li>
            <li> and also I combine 91% or higher rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty stinky</li>
            <li> First and foremost</li>
            <li> so I have many left.  </li>
            <li> I found this to work best for me, and it usually works for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> I use this deodorant as in on my feet during winter time of wearing hot socks, or knee highs.</li>
            <li> Other deodorants irritate my skin, but I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I do put it on at night, too, but I really don&#x27;t get stinky!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I read their review before starting to use this)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely doing better and like the results.</li>
            <li> I do not like to use antiperspirant any more than needed, especially in colder weather.</li>
            <li> I first used this product on Wednesday--5 sprays on each underarm.  </li>
            <li> This is the only deoderant I have been able to use in years, and I appreciate their quality products.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in the hot AZ (112 degrees) sun for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have a funny smell when wearing sleeveless shirts</li>
            <li> I am glad I made the decision to buy this after googling if anyone else had that same experience when wearing sleeveless tops and found that this is what people use!</li>
            <li> I was the first mate on a tourist ship in the gulf of mexico, sweating for 16 hours a day 6 days a week while providing 5 star service for people.</li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s a deodorant, NOT AN ANTI-PERSPIRANT.</li>
            <li> A useful tip is shower-up your under arms, spray the crystal body, let it dry, and spray your favorite cologne/perfume over it.</li>
            <li> I kept opening new ones in disbelief but maybe it&#x27;s true that stuff like this they dump on Amazon to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Using this right out of the bath really works.</li>
            <li> I bought this after wanting to go the more natural route of deodorants, after reading about the dangers or normal products that I&#x27;ve used my whole life.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant does a pretty good job in controlling odor, but I do have to reapply several hours later.  </li>
            <li> A good producrt but the solid roll up is bette and last longer.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very hot and humid climate.  </li>
            <li> The main thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is that it has no scent whatsoever, and you have to put it on right after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> But I think I like the spray a bit better... strangely easier to manage maybe?  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d tried pretty much everything on the market from sephora and the organic markets</li>
            <li> fast ship, exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> (No I do not live in a super hot climate, I&#x27;m just special</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this for years and as long as you put it on right out of the shower you should be fine.  </li>
            <li> I apply, dry, and then apply my deodorant on top.</li>
            <li> Does not remove body odor 100%, but does remove it to a certain extent..</li>
            <li> I have large breast and have had odor underneath them.</li>
            <li> LOVE that this is not chock full of the same chemicals in standard deodorants!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spraying multiple times per day if it works, and I need a little more time before I am sure.  </li>
            <li> product works amazingly well and after a few days of use, there&#x27;s no body odor whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> only available in roll-on.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this deoderant for awhile now, and really like that</li>
            <li> This spray itself does not have much of a smell, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviewer(s) who suggested spraying and then massaging it into your armpits a bit...</li>
            <li> I never had much odor to begin with</li>
            <li> Hypoallergenic, no odor, and it really works.  </li>
            <li> Product really stops the stink.  </li>
            <li> and it really does work for about 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> very minuscule odor on my underwear or cycling shorts.  </li>
            <li> I used to stink so much</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this product.</li>
            <li> It works very well and doesn&#x27;t contain anything harmful for your body in it.</li>
            <li> This product is excelent, really works.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> It works very well and has really helped her stay fresher.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy another deodorant because it leaves absolutely ZERO RESIDUE on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and it compliments deodorant very well.  </li>
            <li> stuff will work for a couple days straight.  </li>
            <li> Once you see the results you&#x27;ll then start to try to hone in how much you really&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a purple spray bottle that does not look very manly, you may have to compensate elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you see the results you&#x27;ll then start to try to hone in how much you really&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a purple spray bottle that does not look very manly, you may have to compensate elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose asking to shower twice a day is a bit much for some, but if you know the difference between Pima and Egyptian cotton, you will probably appreciate this deodorant.</li>
            <li> The combination of the two work really well.</li>
            <li> , I think I might stick to this AFTER the baby!&lt;br /&gt;Another real perk of using this</li>
            <li> This product keeps you from smelling and we really like the fact were not putting aluminum in our bodies.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really had that problem.</li>
            <li> It controls body odors very well.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a few days now, so I feel like I can give it an honest review on the performance.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin and not only does this not bother me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear, not sticky and dries in a flash, so it&#x27;s not that big a deal for such a good product.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and normal deodorants irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Many are not aware of this product and it is getting harder to find as some drug stores (you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d know better as they are in the business to HELP people) have discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> but I do not think it is too large a price to pay for a clean alternative to traditional deodorants.</li>
            <li> and/or my hand and shatter easily, and picked up strange smells over the course of their lifespan.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I thought it was just water, but I was very surprised it worked and worked well.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a deodorant that didn&#x27;t have aluminum and a bunch of other chemical ingredients,  but also worked.</li>
            <li> These crystal products prevent bacteria from growing any further - clean skin is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Firstly, this deodorant does what it is meant to do and does it well for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Being in liquid form and with the pump spray there is no mess or residue to deal with, and it does *</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re BO free all day long.  </li>
            <li> I was sensitive to all the commercial brands--even many of the hypoallergenic--but this is a completely reaction-free solution.</li>
            <li> only suggestion I have at this time is that it would be good if the product was also available in large single containers in order to recycle the spray bottles and reduce landfill waste.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than any other deodorant!</li>
            <li> I put it on  right after showering and it still doesn&#x27;t help even under normal daily activities let alone working out or hot days.</li>
            <li> I do have to use anti-perspirant from time to time if I&#x27;m going to be in a highly stressful situation, but I&#x27;m glad that my day to day isn&#x27;t the toxic mess that is modern day deodorants.</li>
            <li> I used crystal solids in the past and found them almost as effective as many of the stronger solid deodorants, but holding the same issue of transferring adhering bacteria.  </li>
            <li> Other natural deodorants feel better on the skin, but are very ineffective against odor.</li>
            <li> I do lightly pat myself dry with a towel after.</li>
            <li> The main reason she likes is because it doesn&#x27;t stain her blouses.</li>
            <li> But this does a decent job for me as a baseline...</li>
            <li> Only downside is after doing something physically demanding, you have to spray more on, or else you&#x27;ll start smelling again.</li>
            <li> While pregnant with my last baby, I came across an article about toxins in breastmilk.</li>
            <li> One other great feature, is no sweet smell and no aluminum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small inconvenience, but I am convinced that it&#x27;s still better than taxing my body with chemicals and subjecting myself to a higher risk of cancer.</li>
            <li> I am not so lucky in local</li>
            <li> The only drawback is its different consistency from mainstream products (doesn&#x27;t glide on) but just a couple sprays in the morning, and I&#x27;m good all day long.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this spray, it works so well.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, it deserves the highest rating.</li>
            <li> I have paid high dollar for clinical brands and even tried the sports version.  </li>
            <li> I can also add I put a few drops of tea tree oil to mine (also anti-fungal properties) and this not only gives it a soft, pleasant smell (if you like the smell of tea tree oil), but also amps up the deodorant quality a bit.</li>
            <li> In spite of the large number of bottles in the order, I returned to my old stand-by, Mitchum&#x27;s antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I found the spray to work a little better.  </li>
            <li> This product may not be as strong as other deodorants</li>
            <li> My Hubby prefers this spray verses the roll on and it keeps us all clean and dry.  </li>
            <li> If you are going to work outdoors and work up a sweat then you will need more of a deodorant but for normal everyday wear</li>
            <li> The aluminum chlorohydrate in normal deodorants irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> powering smell, works at blocking odor, had no negative results from using it yet.  </li>
            <li> am not the only one in our home with success.</li>
            <li> I used to use normal deodorant until I started getting rashes.</li>
            <li> but i find this one more convenient but it may not last quite as long.  </li>
            <li> I did try to spray extra when I found it wasn&#x27;t working, which just meant I had more of this liquid to dry up.  </li>
            <li> It works great and it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals and dangerous ingredients as many of the other brands sold in the stores.</li>
            <li> but my spouse also uses keeps us dry and cool.</li>
            <li> When you first spray, you may smell a slight sulfur smell but that quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li> I live in LA (as in Lower Alabama:&gt;)</li>
            <li> And I should also mention that I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and anti-persp.</li>
            <li> For those looking for natural deodorant, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can count, on my hand, the number of times where I had a faint odor- not bad for a hot and humid summer while pregnant!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, this is a deodorant only and does nothing (that I&#x27;m aware of anyway) to decrease the amount of perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> My husband has also tried this and so far no complaints from him as well!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> But Green Tidings; this the only natural deodorant that I have found effective....</li>
            <li> The liquid version of crystal-type deodorants solves just about all of the problems that I had with the actual crystals in the past: they were messy to apply properly (since they need to cover the entire underarm as well as a good portion of adjacent skin in order to be effective), tended to slip out of the container</li>
            <li> My confidence is back to normal!!  </li>
            <li> The way I figured, odor was less important than not-poisoning my baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and cannot use most of the usual deodorants and antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> I normally have to keep switching, but this one controls odor very well, by the time i shower the next day, i am not stinky at all.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a spray and goes on wet, but it dries quickly and keeps odor at bay.</li>
            <li> I only do 3 sprays to start because any more than that and the product will just drip down your sides.</li>
            <li> This was the best deal out there and less expensive than the supermarkets here.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have a lot of trouble sweating and a busy job, at times I am running up and down stairs for a good portion of my shift.</li>
            <li> I make sure I spray my armpits and the entire underside of my arms up to 4&amp;#34; above and below the armpits, and then I sort of rub my arms against my skin to help it dry.  </li>
            <li> This kind of stuff works well for me for 24 hours, including through a tough work-out.</li>
            <li> You need to apply it to clean dry skin, right after you exit the shower and leave your arms up for about half a minute to give it time to</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find products MCS safe.</li>
            <li> Many reviews I read (on this and other sites) claimed the poster had to reapply at least once during the course of the day because they detected a mild odor.</li>
            <li> ;  It does not stain my shirts and is clear.</li>
            <li> We decided we wanted to look for something natural, and we found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it because its completely natural, but it does have a couple flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Wow, wow,</li>
            <li> and I noticed that I&#x27;m not missing the antiperspirant at all.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and this has none.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Ultra Max Fresh (found at a dollar store) than Secret (either clinical or regular), but YMMV.</li>
            <li> Works well for myself and my 14 year old daughter, and I&#x27;m not worried about any aluminum or chemicals.</li>
            <li> Decided a while back to stop using aluminum-containing deodorants, and this has always worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> This is by far the cheapest price on this product.  </li>
            <li> (remember, if you are using the antiperspirant and then going into natural, your body will detox from all the junk you&#x27;ve been putting into it...as even your antiperspirant/deodorant DOES absorb through the skin)  </li>
            <li> Another thing I have noticed with switching to natural crystal deodorants, my clothing does not get stained.  </li>
            <li> It completely neutralized underarm odor and stays that way all day and night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For being natural and non-toxic, they deserve 10 stars.</li>
            <li> I have terribly sensitive skin on my underarms of all places, and was about to attempt going through life without deodorant at all when I discovered this stuff.</li>
            <li> whatever shirt will be directly against your pits) and give your pits another hit.  </li>
            <li> Feel like an old person sticking up for war time.</li>
            <li> How about adding a natural buffering ingredient to it?</li>
            <li> Not only in my armpits but in my intimate parts too.</li>
            <li> I am a very stinky sweater and this prevents odors far better than aluminum deodorants that just mix with BO and give me a worse smelling funk than BO alone.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter gets a spray on her feet too, those winter boots and socks had her feet smelling like chips and vinegar.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural deodorant</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive and I have had no irritation with this</li>
            <li> and so far he likes it a lot.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this works.</li>
            <li> This stuff still has &#x27;Alum&#x27; in it - a Potassium Aluminum salt, the &#x27;Natural Mineral&#x27; they are talking about here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using Crystal Body spray deodorant when no other deodorants seemed to live up to the job.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose, so I usually have to pre-treat the underarms of my shirts before laundering, because if any deodorant lingers on there through the wash, it smells gross on otherwise clean clothes, and that was a real problem with the organic deodorant.</li>
            <li> The spray version is only available at a couple of local retailers and their price is far more expensive than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use a crystal rock first, I have used vodka instead by just applying a small amount under the arms, rubbing it in first, and then add the crystal spray.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light and not overwhelming by any means.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a sweat machine in your normal day-to-day, i do not think this will be enough to keep your sweat in check, just the odor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not skip-a-day deodorant, no natural ones are as far as I&#x27;m aware, but it&#x27;s gotten the job done for me in different weather conditions.</li>
            <li> I find the spray much more convenient than the hard crystal and works equally as well.</li>
            <li> and once a few minutes later) and live with mild odor.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of blood orange essential oil to it (orange oil curbs odor) just to give it a light scent and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use this deodorant - it is absolutely safe on delicate skin.</li>
            <li> You are still gonna sweat, but you generally won&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> You really do not need a lot and it works very well.....</li>
            <li> The Crystal body spray not only fights the odor of sweat naturally</li>
            <li> daughter plays volleyball and there are times when she has more than one game per night.  </li>
            <li> It will feel wet, but will dry off quick enough</li>
            <li> The bottom line it really does the trick, it removes odors and prevents them extremely well.  </li>
            <li> So worth the little extra time to allow for drying because I NEVER deal with BO anymore.  </li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because I wouldn&#x27;t say it last a full 24hrs, and under physical activity I would say less than that.</li>
            <li> When traveling, I&#x27;ll bring the hard crystal through TSA, and apply it to wet armpits, and while at home, I&#x27;ll use the more convenient spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As many have stated, if you spray too much, it will end up running down your arm/chest which is irritating.  </li>
            <li> I AM curious about something similar for perspiration as this really mostly/only defeats odor.</li>
            <li> Keeps me socially acceptable.</li>
            <li> Additionally it can be used under breasts and roll directly onto private areas for extra odor control after showering.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical since I have tried many natural stick deodorants</li>
            <li> I have been using something with lavender and tea tree oil but had to apply frequently and it left white rings...</li>
            <li> have tried mentioning the wonderfulness of this product several times to my hubby, who suffers from stinky feet (as it is also advertised that this product is good for that as well).  </li>
            <li> This caused me to sweat very easily and uncomfortably around my rectum.  </li>
            <li> no more funny chemicals!</li>
            <li> Good price and less messy than the plain crystals.</li>
            <li> My family members with allergies use the Crystal Body Deodorant Spray to avoid certain compounds present in other spray deodorants.</li>
            <li> The packaging may be pink, but the male pictured front and center tells you exactly who this product is made for!</li>
            <li> I actually feel less sweaty, and I never smell like anything, not body odor and not fake masking aroma.</li>
            <li> I started using the solid crystal rock by the same company a couple of years ago, as part of a shift to using natural products whenever possible.  </li>
            <li> Until then, I purchased it to spray the inside of my clothes so that they remain fresh while enduring this unbelievable heat wave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that you can kill its ability to work by applying some deodorants/anti-perspirant after it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> It keeps odor away for at least a full day.  </li>
            <li> On first few uses, my assessment is that this is not an optimal product for underarm use.  </li>
            <li> Even during heavy workouts and intense sweating, I do not stink!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a few days of stinkiness for the health benefits!</li>
            <li> I am a really really sweaty person I get pit stains pretty much any time of year although I&#x27;ve never been particularly prone to smelling bad.</li>
            <li> I have to spray a little and let it dry, then spray a little more.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the solid, dries quickly, works at least 12 hours to prevent odor.  </li>
            <li> and I paid nearly eight dollars for a single bottle of this!</li>
            <li> My husband developed a bad rash in his armpits, so we decided to try a more natural product while his skin healed.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and now that I&#x27;m pregnant and my hormones are going crazy, I&#x27;m more sweaty and stinky than usual, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year-old man who&#x27;s somewhat active and most commercial \\&quot;guys\\&quot; deodorants (think Axe or Old Spice, etc..) leave me stinky or just smell weird by the end of the day</li>
            <li> Now if I drink coffee or heavy caffeine or eat certain foods, then I might not last that long.</li>
            <li> Actually, I do add in a few drops of essential oils (usually lavender &amp; bergamot) into a new bottle and shake it up first.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is natural but it does not prevent odor so not much use!</li>
            <li> While other natural deodorants either work by (unsuccessfully) just trying to cover up the smell of body odor, or contain toxic antibacterial agents like triclosan, Crystal Essence works by &amp;#34;salting the earth,&amp;#34; so to speak.</li>
            <li> Out of all the other natural deodorants this tops our list.</li>
            <li> Long story short, after many failed DIY deodorants, I read about the Crystal sticks and sprays</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like I smell (as I have felt with other natural brands).  </li>
            <li> So I switched to Tom&#x27;s of Maine (because it said it was natural and aluminum-free), which worked extremely well until they updated their formula to make it &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34;; I then noticed burning and discoloration.</li>
            <li> And I recommend the spray vs the rock form as I found that after a while, the rock developed sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is my clothes don&#x27;t reek when I take them off, even if I wear black in this extreme, summer heat or after being in the hot sun, sweating for hours while walking or playing.  </li>
            <li> In the past, these would leave me REALLY stinky (we are talking BO with a definite capital</li>
            <li> True to the product&#x27;s claims, I&#x27;ve found it to be long-lasting (up to 24 hours), non-staining and it leaves no white residue behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants in the past few years due to my desire to stay away from the chemicals in almost ALL woman&#x27;s deodorants (there has been research connecting these chemicals to breast cancer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have much body odor</li>
            <li> Personally, I like using the harder natural crystal &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34; after a shower, while I am still wet.  </li>
            <li> The bottles last a surprisingly long time, too.</li>
            <li> gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because the spray bottles did not last very long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using just a couple of short sprays, letting it dry, and using another &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; but</li>
            <li> I did notice that natural fibers have much less stink at the end of the day then polyester fibers.</li>
            <li> You will still sweat, but you won&#x27;t stink if applied properly and allowed to dry.</li>
            <li> am perimenopausal (sorry to get all &amp;#34;womanly&amp;#34; on the guys reading this!), and one of the side effects of that is the lovely &amp;#34;hot flush&amp;#34;, which I experience several times a day.  </li>
            <li> But my health is worth the small inconvenience!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for 20 + years, it is hard to find the spray in the stores, so purchasing from Amazon is very convenient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Don&#x27;t be afraid to really spray it on there when you&#x27;re first trying this out.  </li>
            <li> Only a bit more inconvenient as you had to wet the block before use.</li>
            <li> The sprays had a strange odor.</li>
            <li> I spent over $200.00 in two weeks just trying different types of deodorants, antiperspirants and body sprays.</li>
            <li> After a long day at work I could notice it before getting home, even quicker if it was a hot-summer day.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the long term stains from the deodorant that would build up on my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long time user of the product.  </li>
            <li> For that reason alone I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars all day long.</li>
            <li> Something strange of product, noticed weeks after using product.</li>
            <li> and it works for long days.</li>
            <li> I get boils in my arm pits and even though I stopped using an antiperspirant, and switched to an antibacterial soap, it didn&#x27;t hit me for a long time that the stick deodorant I was applying was spreading bacteria, so my problem was never-ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years and it gets harder &amp; harder to find locally.</li>
            <li> After using for about a week have developed red irritating skin under one underarm, which has happened with just about every natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Good grief</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant, so I wanted to switch to products with less chemicals, and that unfortunately included my FAVORITE clinical antiperspirant, which is chock-full of aluminum and such.&lt;br /&gt;I tried some organic deodorants, and was so not impressed: they aren&#x27;t antiperspirant, and they smell funky while only partially masking body odor.</li>
            <li> My partner and I bought this because we had read an article on what regular deoderant has in it; parabens and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> I had originally thought it will feel weird on my hands for some reason</li>
            <li> I will continue to re-purchase this as long as it is manufactured!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, and they are just slimy, waxy or starchy, and they end up making me stink, sweat and just feel gross.  </li>
            <li> I wont ever go back to that other slimy / waxy deodorant / anti-antiperspirant with perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things</li>
            <li> There is one thing that this product does extremely well--it does not promote the development of yellow armpit stains.</li>
            <li> used to use this stuff but am switching since I&#x27;m still concerned about whatever this Potassium Aluminum is, even if a somewhat different compound than the other anti-persperent Aluminum compounds.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can think of is that after your pores are closed off, your body absorbs only the amount of spray that is needed and the rest rolls down your body.  </li>
            <li> It does not have any actual fragrance, which I like, because many fragrances are neurotoxic and bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> Shower and dry your body except the arm pits.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, even in the dry, winter weather and it feels almost like you&#x27;re just spraying water on you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I get out of the shower, (and my underarms are dry)</li>
            <li> Then I go about the rest of my after shower tasks (brushing my teeth, applying my face and body lotion, etc..), to allow my underarms to dry again.</li>
            <li> With this product, he can apply, dry and go.</li>
            <li> I use 4 or 5 sprays under each arm after my morning shower and let it drip dry.  </li>
            <li> I allow this to dry.  </li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t have to wait to dry before putting on your shirt).&lt;br /&gt;Now, put on your undershirt (or</li>
            <li> Try to dry the water from your pits before spraying this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It will not keep your underarms dry from sweat.</li>
            <li> I spray it on, let it dry and spray again.</li>
            <li> down my side, back, everywhere.  </li>
            <li> You sort of have to keep it in an upright position so that it sprays down to the last drop.  </li>
            <li> and if you need/want to supplement with an anti-perspirant or commercial deodorant, maybe you&#x27;d need them less.  </li>
            <li> However, since I am not keen on blocking my body&#x27;s natural processes, this does not bother me since usually when I am sweating due to heat someone else is as well.</li>
            <li> Also, I will say your armpits may feel just a tiny bit sticky, but just a little.</li>
            <li> Horrified, I did some more research and was shocked at what I found-</li>
            <li> so be careful, and dont try to use this if you are already smelly</li>
            <li> Sounds like a lot of work, but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> Same stuff and saves me the trouble of driving around looking for it.</li>
            <li> should have known spray would stay wet and run</li>
            <li> but I could tell my safety net was fading because I could smell the deodorant after a few hours (even if it was unscented) and</li>
            <li> Without getting too personal, my skin finds regular deodorant too irritating, but at the same time, going without anything can get funky.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatley I just have to kiss that money I spent on it</li>
            <li> (I use the rock version that you wet)</li>
            <li> After showing I spray it on my back and after a few days I noticed it was drying out and clearing up my acne.</li>
            <li> I was wearing a sleeveless Ann Taylor shirt at work in an air conditioned office, and just regular wear throughout the day, just a few hours into the morning</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be a lifelong customer for this product.</li>
            <li> This product leaves we wet and does not prevent from b.o.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the nozzle temporarily jams or stops working completely if you spray in a downward motion or upside down (usually happens when I spray my back).  </li>
            <li> I bought this in bulk because I usually think it&#x27;s great,but this is a watered down old smelling product..that I will throw away.</li>
            <li> I usually use the stick, and you have to run a little bit of water over it or apply directly to still-moist skin.  </li>
            <li> Normally deodorants fail me, but this one is still working months later.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but desperate, so tried this and were thrilled!  </li>
            <li> Maybe the solid crystal would be less messy.  </li>
            <li> My son is allergic to metals and can&#x27;t use anything but this and one other.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but after trying this product, I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it works very well!  </li>
            <li> Other deodorants mask odor, this one supposedly prevents odors from happening because of the salt content.</li>
            <li> I tried  the other crystal spray</li>
            <li> It is suppose to be healthier for you than other.</li>
            <li> This Crystal Spray is one of two USA sold deodorant products that I can use without extreme redness, burning, and irritation.  </li>
            <li> but I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum or other chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I have odor issues due to the MCS, this works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to other types of deodorant.</li>
            <li> One other review I read suggests spraying onto your skin as well as the armpits of the garment you will be wearing.</li>
            <li> This works in other areas that sweat and smell, if I&#x27;m going to sweat a lot</li>
            <li> I use the stone for the armpits and use the spray for other body parts.</li>
            <li> other reviews must be plants.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented, so you can use it with any other product line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to be expected since this stuff is watered down to make the spray.  </li>
            <li> and if you are physically active.</li>
            <li> This prevents any odour at all, I seem to sweat less, my armpits are less dry and irritated than they were before</li>
            <li> goal of this is to get the active ingredient (read as salt) where you sweat so that bacteria cant have a festival of stench.(Nobody</li>
            <li> COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores locally</li>
            <li> Usually by the time I get home from work, I have sweated a bit through the day and can have a little odor, but only if you shove your nose in there.  </li>
            <li> It is a little weird at first, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Basically, prevent having a bad experience by trying to cheap out with two spritz.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Basically, prevent having a bad experience by trying to cheap out with two spritz.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> We use this all Winter because it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant, so at least 1/2 of the year we are not getting that aluminum that is in regular deodorant.  </li>
            <li> all six bottles had a thick white coating settled on the bottom.</li>
            <li> down there.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat as much down there</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it forms into droplets that run down my sides and away from the armpit.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Spray version leaves product running down your arm or body,  unlike the roll-on.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, it works every time I spray it on!</li>
            <li> I am going to look into their other products as the result of this WINNER!</li>
            <li> He purchased a small hair dryer to dry his arm pits before leaving.</li>
            <li> Efficacy is less than I hoped for, but I am not writing it off yet.  </li>
            <li> Lost probably half a bottle between the 6 leaking</li>
            <li> As for clothing, often odor in your clothes is locked in there by previous antiperspirant products.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying several at a time as it became difficult to find locally.</li>
            <li> I dropped it a couple of times, which caused cracks and chips that were pretty sharp and unpleasant until they got worn down again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very active and use vibrams fivefingers...</li>
            <li> No stains or mess on clothing.</li>
            <li> No irritation or mess</li>
            <li> The first few days were pretty awful.  </li>
            <li> I usually \\&quot;wash\\&quot; with the wet crystal rock before I get out of the shower, then follow up with the spray, then spray again after I put my shirt on.  </li>
            <li> so I just spray a little on the shoes...</li>
            <li> so you may sweat a little</li>
            <li> My husband spent the summer working hard on the family farm-</li>
            <li> Needless to say, some of the young ladies get a little \\&quot;ripe\\&quot; before that last game.  </li>
            <li> i also did not appreciate that the spray knob gives trouble after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Been using the roll-on for a few years now and it works well for me.  </li>
            <li> the bottles came missing their caps and leaking all over the inside of the box.</li>
            <li> This item works all day with just a few sprays.</li>
            <li> I figured I would just do what a few of the reviewers suggested (one review said that reapplying mid-day was helpful, one review mentioned spraying once after a shower</li>
            <li> I tossed one in my labor bag, and had a few in our drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a few nights where I would smell a bit, but those were during a week of postpartum night-sweats, and I haven&#x27;t had an issue</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Being a heavy woman I think makes this an issue.</li>
            <li> It is the only deodorant that I have found that I can use without irritating my underarms.</li>
            <li> , it was a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my mom and a few sites online suggested I try the crystal deodorants, and I have to say,</li>
            <li> Try it and give it a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Dove, Ban, Suave, Degree, Secret to Teen Spirit.</li>
            <li> and you get that &#x27;damp&#x27; feeling and the slight odor (not overly offensive) but still of arm pit :-/</li>
            <li> I work out at least every other day with Jillian Michaels DVDs, 5&#x27; 7&amp;#34; 120 pounds, so I sweat out a lot of toxins, and not a lot of fat with toxins creeping out in my sweat, eat almost all organic non gmo, don&#x27;t eat a lot of sugars, no sodas, vegetarian for years, don&#x27;t profusely perspire, or have stinky sweat, and I&#x27;m a girl...</li>
            <li> Use it all over, no strong smell, not sticky or waxy.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter who was having bad night sweats and hot flashes after undergoing cancer surgery.  </li>
            <li> and it can smell pretty bad IMO, but</li>
            <li> I love &#x27;natural&#x27; products, and I hate leaving bad reviews</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the product dripping down their body</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the rock version, because the rock can be dropped and once it is broken it is hard to use and has to be replaced, because it can actually scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> People at work complained and made fun of me; the bullies in the front office started a smell chart and sent everyone an email asking them to report every time I smelled bad.</li>
            <li> I like that it is very little ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I had actually been avoiding this deoderant because I was so skeptical.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they were past their expiration date.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure it can handle summertime, underarm odor.  </li>
            <li> so I am not challenging</li>
            <li> I have been paying over $4 for years for the the 4 ounce bottle but no more.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have sweating issues I am not sure how well it works.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought the big pack</li>
            <li> However, my being spoiled by the chemical stuff, I have 2 small \\&quot;cons\\&quot;:&lt;br</li>
            <li> and once I reapply, the smell usually disappears.</li>
            <li> This is no better than water.  </li>
            <li> No more BO.</li>
            <li> and I have not had luck in the past with those.  </li>
            <li> every single bottle sprayer actually goes bad before you can finish this product.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with other deodorants irritating you, this is the deodorant you need.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to people with bad body</li>
            <li> this is an update it does not last a year thats a plain blatant lie!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s only because i am still nursing and my left armpit stinks worse than a construction worker (secret clinical strength did nothing for me and was just clogging my pores with chemicals anyways).</li>
            <li> No more stinky shirts, no more embarrassing stink!  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible thing for someone with a strong sense of smell.</li>
            <li> Tried changing my diet and it has decreased a little bit</li>
            <li> I use my broken crystal stones and dump them in the spray bottles for a little added boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the prissy purple bottle fool you; I just bought 12 bottles here on Amazon</li>
            <li> you are concerned about the negative impact of aluminum in your deodorant, try this one.</li>
            <li> Wanted a lighter deodorant that did not leave thick residue under my arms.</li>
            <li> and I stunk PRETTY BAD!  </li>
            <li> and I do mean ALL OVER.</li>
            <li> when I say this didn&#x27;t work for my body, that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you.  </li>
            <li> I have used these sprays in the past from Walgreens and never experienced this.</li>
            <li> I have tried medicated kinds, prescription strength but all of these make a mess of my expensive clothes.</li>
            <li> he would be outside working in over 100 degree heat, and he NEVER smelled bad at all.</li>
            <li> the crystal can get uneven and uncomfortable to apply and c)</li>
            <li> was in the third trimester, and SUPER sweaty, and mentally prepped for the worst (to be a nasty smelling lady!!).</li>
            <li> BUT I have worked hard and been outdoors for hours with this product and returned home with NO smell!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> but it was really tough to wash off.</li>
            <li> and I mean NOTHING works like this!</li>
            <li> NO.. every time i reach about 3/4 bottle i have to just dab the liquid on under my arms.. really frustrating...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know because delivered behind a post at the front entrance which is 600 feet away.  </li>
            <li> and I swear they make you smell worse.</li>
            <li> ie none of the irritating propellants).  </li>
            <li> We never use conventional deodorant because of all the bad things and aluminum in it.  </li>
            <li> I hated having to wet the rock before using, and also found the rock to be too delicate -</li>
            <li> Was unable to purchase in retail stores...</li>
            <li> Sorry, but it failed each time.  </li>
            <li> I smelled like bug spray and worse!  </li>
            <li> The requirement to buy 6 bottles at a time gives me lots of time, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately if I do strenuous activity, it does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> The recent change in labeling was shocking -- consult your doctor if you have kidney disease?!?!?!?</li>
            <li> I sprayed this onto my airpits and hated the way it ran down my body.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> Did not keep us from smelling bad at all.</li>
            <li> I tend to be heavy-handed with the spray, but I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions or anything from it at all.</li>
            <li> , I smelled really bad within an hour or two of using this.  </li>
            <li> I almost wonder if people don&#x27;t leave bad reviews because they don&#x27;t want people thinking they are overly toxic or stinky.</li>
            <li> But I learned this is really bad for your health.</li>
            <li> By afternoon I always had that bad under arm smell.  </li>
            <li> and I hate how they feel all gooey in my pits.</li>
            <li> So, I hate the delivery method.  </li>
            <li> The aluminum crap doesn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> Works without the bad stuff!</li>
            <li> but it keeps me from getting painful bumps from shaving!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this after trying EO deodorant body spray and being very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HAD terrible body odor problems.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived on schedule.  This is my second order of this product.  It works!</li>
            <li> this is okay but if you are a heavy sweater forget it you will stink especially on a warm day and if you are physically active. it works for me cuz i dont do much physical but when i did do it i gave a scent so be careful, and dont try to use this if you are already smelly, you will smell more! i also did not appreciate that the spray knob gives trouble after a few uses. this is an update it does not last a year thats a plain blatant lie! one bottle will last about 4-5weeks if you use it daily  ....i just want to update this every single bottle sprayer actually goes bad before you can finish this product. the sprayer knob is a No NO.. every time i reach about 3/4 bottle i have to just dab the liquid on under my arms.. really frustrating...</li>
            <li> Have been using this for many years now.... the only product that does NOT have carcinogens and is safe to use. Also comes as a roll on and as a rock to rub on.  Many are not aware of this product and it is getting harder to find as some drug stores (you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d know better as they are in the business to HELP people) have discontinued it.  If you are going to work outdoors and work up a sweat then you will need more of a deodorant but for normal everyday wear it is perfect!</li>
            <li> Most stuff gives me rashes of redness,  but this stuff is great and natural.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Great item bought for me and my daughter but my spouse also uses keeps us dry and cool. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for a dependable deodorant for ... years.  This is it - and it&#x27;s so simple.  The only drawback is its different consistency from mainstream products (doesn&#x27;t glide on) but just a couple sprays in the morning, and I&#x27;m good all day long.  PLUS you&#x27;re not putting all of those chemicals on your body!  I really like it.</li>
            <li> We have used this for years!  We never use conventional deodorant because of all the bad things and aluminum in it.  My son is allergic to metals and can&#x27;t use anything but this and one other.  My Hubby prefers this spray verses the roll on and it keeps us all clean and dry.  No tacky feeling, no odors and not going to kill my family!</li>
            <li> Using this right out of the bath really works. As previously stated, it is not an antiperspirant, but if one does suffer from persiration odor this is a good deterrant. In fact, I spray it all over my body and rub it in. It keeps me odor free for many hours. I also use it to freshen my clothes, much like most people use Febreeze. It works there too without the added scent of Febreeze. I prefer this to the rock version, because the rock can be dropped and once it is broken it is hard to use and has to be replaced, because it can actually scratch your skin. I also like Amazon&#x27;s price, so I plan on stocking up while I can afford it.</li>
            <li> Took a while for my body to respond to this stuff, but once it did I&#x27;m almost 100% off of traditional deodorants.  I do have to use anti-perspirant from time to time if I&#x27;m going to be in a highly stressful situation, but I&#x27;m glad that my day to day isn&#x27;t the toxic mess that is modern day deodorants.</li>
            <li> I am careful about what I put on my sensitive skin, and tried this out. This does a pretty good job of preventing wetness and concealing the smell. It does not have any actual fragrance, which I like, because many fragrances are neurotoxic and bad for your skin. Out of all the natural types of deodorants, this seems the safest and most effective of the ones I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve tried natural deodorant sticks, the roll-on kind, etc, and this is good. I didn&#x27;t rate 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t 100% get rid of the smell, but does an OK job of it. I also gave it a good rating because I prefer this spray type of deodorant, because the tip of the product never comes in contact with my skin, so bacteria from my skin cannot get into the product. With the roll-on kind, I noticed that it would start turning yellow after a while, because my skin would come into contact with the product tip.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well! I was a bit skeptical at first, but after trying this product, I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
            <li> I spray this on the bottom of my feet and inside my Vibram FiveFingers before workouts and it keeps them from smelling for months on end without having to wash them. Would be great if you wear shoes without socks. I also use it on my hands in my workout gloves because they start to smell too.  You want to be able to sweat without the odor.</li>
            <li> One of the line of BEST aluminum free deodorants that work. Others include the rock and stick forms</li>
            <li> Was unable to purchase in retail stores...only available in roll-on.  I&#x27;ve used this for 4 years, since radiologist recommended it.  It works for me and I&#x27;m not adding chemicals into/onto my body.</li>
            <li> I like that this is natural but it does not prevent odor so not much use! I put it on  right after showering and it still doesn&#x27;t help even under normal daily activities let alone working out or hot days.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. Shower and dry your body except the arm pits. Spray deodorant under arms while arm pits are still damp but water is not dripping. Works for me. No smell.</li>
            <li> Good! And great price too</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most effective natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. While other natural deodorants either work by (unsuccessfully) just trying to cover up the smell of body odor, or contain toxic antibacterial agents like triclosan, Crystal Essence works by &amp;#34;salting the earth,&amp;#34; so to speak. Using non-toxic mineral salts it turns your armpits into surfaces on which odor-causing bacteria can&#x27;t grow. True to the product&#x27;s claims, I&#x27;ve found it to be long-lasting (up to 24 hours), non-staining and it leaves no white residue behind. It&#x27;s also not tested on animals, contains no aluminum and is endorsed by Cancer Treatment Centers. Honestly, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m a 30 year-old man who&#x27;s somewhat active and most commercial \\&quot;guys\\&quot; deodorants (think Axe or Old Spice, etc..) leave me stinky or just smell weird by the end of the day and I hate how they feel all gooey in my pits. Other natural deodorants feel better on the skin, but are very ineffective against odor. My wife bought me a bottle of this stuff on a whim and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else again! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, even in the dry, winter weather and it feels almost like you&#x27;re just spraying water on you. Best of all, it feels like you&#x27;re going au naturel and even after 24 hours I don&#x27;t stink at all. It&#x27;s good for sweaty feet and stinky shoes too! Don&#x27;t let the prissy purple bottle fool you; I just bought 12 bottles here on Amazon and I should be set for the next year!</li>
            <li> I have been using this deoderant for awhile now, and really like that its crystal based without chemicals or Alum. Once I discovered that Amazon carries it and much cheaper than I can find locally, I am very happy. Add free shipping with prime and its even better.</li>
            <li> Wanted a lighter deodorant that did not leave thick residue under my arms. This fit the bill. It keeps me smelling fresh and its very light.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this for years and as long as you put it on right out of the shower you should be fine.  Out of all the other natural deodorants this tops our list.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most deodorants, but this one works well.  I have used this for many years (I&#x27;m over 80!) and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it works very well!  Just have to make sure you put it on right after showering and you&#x27;re BO free all day long.  I don&#x27;t get itchy irritated arm pits like when using \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorants.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT Aluminum free!!  It prays upon those who want to be healthy with lies!!  Read here: http://healthwyze.org/index.php/component/content/article/327-beware-of-deodorants-especially-the-safe-and-all-natural-ones.html</li>
            <li> My partner and I bought this because we had read an article on what regular deoderant has in it; parabens and other chemicals. We decided we wanted to look for something natural, and we found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works &#x27;well&#x27;. I have found towards the end of the day the smell of body odor will begin to seap through. This spray itself does not have much of a smell, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is good. I like it because its completely natural, but it does have a couple flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is the best for deodorizing with out harmful chemicals and such. Great price too. A+ Yes Amen !</li>
            <li> I have used the Crystal for over. 10 years and I just love the product.  No smell, no white residue and no rings on my shirts</li>
            <li> My wife found this stuff years ago and she loves it. Small bottle is great for traveling. The main reason she likes is because it doesn&#x27;t stain her blouses.</li>
            <li> Aluminum free healthy and a great price.  I hve been using it for two years and other than having to re-apply from time to time, to avert stress perspiration, it is great.</li>
            <li> Been using the roll-on for a few years now and it works well for me.  But I think I like the spray a bit better... strangely easier to manage maybe?  Thanks to the reviewer(s) who suggested spraying and then massaging it into your armpits a bit... I feel that this gives great coverage. I had originally thought it will feel weird on my hands for some reason but it&#x27;s fine and I just wash it off.  This kind of stuff works well for me for 24 hours, including through a tough work-out. Now if I drink coffee or heavy caffeine or eat certain foods, then I might not last that long. But on sweat alone, this keeps my pits in check.  I never had much odor to begin with but as my body has changed, so too has that. But this does a decent job for me as a baseline...and if you need/want to supplement with an anti-perspirant or commercial deodorant, maybe you&#x27;d need them less.  I AM curious about something similar for perspiration as this really mostly/only defeats odor. But it&#x27;s not too bad. If you&#x27;re a sweat machine in your normal day-to-day, i do not think this will be enough to keep your sweat in check, just the odor. YMMV  ps. this is a great deal I think?! 14 for 6pack!</li>
            <li> have a lot of trouble sweating and a busy job, at times I am running up and down stairs for a good portion of my shift. I have tried medicated kinds, prescription strength but all of these make a mess of my expensive clothes. the spray keeps me from smelling like I&#x27;ve run a marathon. I like that it is very little ingredients.</li>
            <li> I think you would have to reapply quite often to be close to effective. I don&#x27;t have that time during the day. Odor control average at best.</li>
            <li> I discovered the spray, after using the \\&quot;block\\&quot; for several years.  Hypoallergenic, no odor, and it really works.  Just 2 sprays lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this in bulk because I usually think it&#x27;s great,but this is a watered down old smelling product..that I will throw away.I kept opening new ones in disbelief but maybe it&#x27;s true that stuff like this they dump on Amazon to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I purchase this deodorant because it is the very best for me out there.  Although, like any anti-perspirant or deodorant I&#x27;ve tried it really needs to be cleaned and re-applied after profuse sweating to continue its magic.  For the regular day, however, it is clean and  leaves me odor free.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for me. It&#x27;s lightweight, scent-free, and not sticky. Other deodorants mask odor, this one supposedly prevents odors from happening because of the salt content. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to prevent perspiring, so you&#x27;ll want something else if you&#x27;re looking to prevent sweating. I put it on right after a shower.   Also, don&#x27;t think that this is a chemical-free deodorant option. It is packed with chemicals, mostly water.</li>
            <li> I like it. I use it. It works for me. And delivery was quick, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I liked the fact that it&#x27;s natural. I tried  the other crystal spray and I needed another one so I thought \\&quot;why not try something else?\\&quot; I should have stayed with what worked. The Thai stone and pump spray works. This products did not last one hour and I was outside reading the newspaper. It was neither hot nor humid. There&#x27;s  your sign! I  followed directions. Just to be fair, I gave this product a few more chances. Sorry, but it failed each time.  Going back to what worked.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great product. I was on a quest to find a more natural deodorant and I&#x27;d tried pretty much everything on the market from sephora and the organic markets and I had actually been avoiding this deoderant because I was so skeptical. I am a really really sweaty person I get pit stains pretty much any time of year although I&#x27;ve never been particularly prone to smelling bad. This prevents any odour at all, I seem to sweat less, my armpits are less dry and irritated than they were before and it doesn&#x27;t leave horrid white marks all over my clothes. I love this product.</li>
            <li> As a Breast Cancer survivor this was the type of product I was recommended to use.  This does the job under most circumstances.  Remember, it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, just a fragrance free deoderant.</li>
            <li> Does the job. I can&#x27;t have chemicals on my body or use any thing but a spray lotion. If you have boils to contend with then this is the best deodorant avail beyond baby shampoo. Wish it was more readily available in the store which it isn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> A very effective and natural product which does not use chemicals.  It is easy to use and very effective.  This will still allow you to sweat but controls odor.</li>
            <li> What can you right about deodorant. This stuff is great and lasts forever. I even have my hubby using it so it must work well. It is suppose to be healthier for you than other. Good price and less messy than the plain crystals. Give it a try</li>
            <li> My daughter and I get - let&#x27;s just say it - stinky when we get warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounded like a great product, so we both tried it as a body spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No effect whatsoever on either of us.  Did not keep us from smelling bad at all.</li>
            <li> A really great alternative to the stick crystal, which would fall out of the container and usually break as it got closer to the bottom.  I keep one in the car for hot summer day touch-ups.  I&#x27;ve reordered this product again twice now.</li>
            <li> This item worked pretty well, I didn&#x27;t have a problem with odor while using it. The main thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is that it has no scent whatsoever, and you have to put it on right after you get out of the shower. I prefer something with a scent that I can apply at any time.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. This Crystal Spray is one of two USA sold deodorant products that I can use without extreme redness, burning, and irritation.  Fortunately, I do not have much of a problem with perspiration or odor. The Crystal spray is light and functional.  I have experienced irritation with this, but only rarely.  The spray version is only available at a couple of local retailers and their price is far more expensive than Amazon.  I can get Amazon home delivery AND save petrol and money!</li>
            <li> Product really stops the stink.  I live in LA (as in Lower Alabama:&gt;) and the humidity is unreal at times.  You will still sweat, but you won&#x27;t stink.  I reapply a couple times a day if I am out and about and even apply to my undershirts and t-shirts with no stains or damage to them.  I think it is worth it to not have to use the more toxic products that are out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter plays volleyball and there are times when she has more than one game per night.  That means sweating for awhile, then sitting around for awhile in a sweaty uniform, then playing again.  Needless to say, some of the young ladies get a little \\&quot;ripe\\&quot; before that last game.  We have started giving the inside of her uniforms (and her) a good spray down before games and she stays fresh as a daisy throughout.  No damage to the uniforms at all.  And again, I don&#x27;t have to worry about what the toxins in regular deodorants may be doing to her health.  This is great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: MAY, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still love this stuff!  I have yet to have a bottle that lasted for a year though:&gt;)  I tend to be heavy-handed with the spray, but I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions or anything from it at all. A bottle last for about two months per person in my household. We use it all over and I do mean ALL OVER. Spray it anywhere you have a problem with sweat odor (or think you possibly will).  You will still sweat, but you will not stink!</li>
            <li> The sprays had a strange odor. I have used these sprays in the past from Walgreens and never experienced this. Perhaps they were past their expiration date.</li>
            <li> The aluminum chlorohydrate in normal deodorants irritate my skin. I tried the solid version and liked it a lot. Once I discovered the spray version I switched because of its convenience.</li>
            <li> Annihilates Keeps sweat-induced BO on any area I choose to use it!  Is a hassle for air travel &#x3D; I just discovered the wipes (see seperate review) which work just as well but are travel friendly.  I will continue to re-purchase this as long as it is manufactured!  No skin irritation (I will use my blow-dryer to speed up the drying process - like for 15 seconds), its inexpensive, it WORKS &#x3D; what&#x27;s not to love???</li>
            <li> fast ship, exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> I recently stopped using commercial deodorants in December 2014. I tried making my own (coconut &amp; baking soda) and I did not find that type of deodorant pleasant whatsoever. Long story short, after many failed DIY deodorants, I read about the Crystal sticks and sprays so I thought I would try those out. I did not like the sticks but I did like the sprays. I spray 3 layers on every morning at 7:30am and It&#x27;s good until about 3PM.  Then I will need to spritz again. My underarms feel so much better after I stopped using the commercial deodorants. The skin there used to itch with commercial deodorants. Ever since I started using the Crystal deodorant spray, my skin has been softer and it doesn&#x27;t get itchy anymore.</li>
            <li> This spray works exactly as described.  Easy and convenient, no over powering smell, works at blocking odor, had no negative results from using it yet.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I started using Crystal Body spray deodorant when no other deodorants seemed to live up to the job.  This worked great and I didn&#x27;t have the white tell tale signs of deodorant in my underarms, along with no stains on my shirts.  Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to find in stores locally my Amazon order was processed and delivered within a week. I will definitely save time in the future by ordering online.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after trying EO deodorant body spray and being very disappointed. I have used this for a few days now, so I feel like I can give it an honest review on the performance. Wow, wow, wow! I cannot believe how well this works! There are only like 4 ingredients in this spray?! I showered last night at about 7 pm before going out to dinner and I was odor free until I showered again tonight! Even my husband couldn&#x27;t believe how there was literally zero smell under my arms. And I should also mention that I live in Florida and it get pretty hot and humid here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I apply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I get out of the shower, (and my underarms are dry) I spray under each arm 3 times. Then I go about the rest of my after shower tasks (brushing my teeth, applying my face and body lotion, etc..), to allow my underarms to dry again. Then I spray twice under each arm and I&#x27;m done! Sounds like a lot of work, but it&#x27;s really not. I got the tip from one of the top reviewers, who said that was the best way to get the most out of the deodorant spray, and it works! I only do 3 sprays to start because any more than that and the product will just drip down your sides. Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an excellent and healthy find!!! Thanks to all the reviewers who helped me decide to give it a try!</li>
            <li> The packaging may be pink, but the male pictured front and center tells you exactly who this product is made for!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff works better than any high priced deodorant</li>
            <li> I used to buy this deodorant in stores, as it&#x27;s the only kind that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction on me. After moving from NYC to the midwest, I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores around here, so I started ordering it in bulk on Amazon. Same stuff and saves me the trouble of driving around looking for it. Arrived in a timely fashion without any damage.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I use it for my underarms and feet and it works quite well. Thai Crystal usually works better for me but they are both great products!</li>
            <li> I like this product and it really does work for about 24 hours.  The only issue that I have with it is when I spray it under my arms, it runs all over the place...down my side, back, everywhere.  I&#x27;ve tried using just a couple of short sprays, letting it dry, and using another &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; but it still runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, it does work, keeps the &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; away and I noticed that I&#x27;m not missing the antiperspirant at all.  In fact I think it might have it&#x27;s own antiperspirant properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, just wish the spray was a bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again....definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t uses this as underarm deodorant (yet), but will perhaps give it a go during the winter months (I&#x27;m not sure it can handle summertime, underarm odor.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try it for that intended use on a weekend to find out?  Until then, I purchased it to spray the inside of my clothes so that they remain fresh while enduring this unbelievable heat wave.  I also spray it all over my body, fresh out of the shower before putting my clothes on.  This was cheaper than the Crystal Essence spray deodorant, which seems to be the same stuff, made by the same people, but in a variety of fragrances, whereas this is &#x27;unscented&#x27;.  I added a few drops of blood orange essential oil to it (orange oil curbs odor) just to give it a light scent and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the nozzle temporarily jams or stops working completely if you spray in a downward motion or upside down (usually happens when I spray my back).  You sort of have to keep it in an upright position so that it sprays down to the last drop.  This could be a problem created by the addition of the oil though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is my clothes don&#x27;t reek when I take them off, even if I wear black in this extreme, summer heat or after being in the hot sun, sweating for hours while walking or playing.  The deodorant works great on it&#x27;s own before I add the oil in case you were wondering.  I&#x27;d say, it&#x27;s a good buy when using it for the application I described.  I will update when I get the courage to try it as an underam deodorant.  Many reviews I read (on this and other sites) claimed the poster had to reapply at least once during the course of the day because they detected a mild odor.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works!  My husband has sensitive skin and cannot use most of the usual deodorants and antiperspirants.  Found this after researching numerous options.  Was skeptical but desperate, so tried this and were thrilled!  This is not an antiperspirant, as you note, strictly deodorant, but it truly works for him -- and he is &amp;#34;manly,&amp;#34; works out, sweats a lot, etc.  Can also be used on feet, etc., which is a plus.</li>
            <li> The liquid version of crystal-type deodorants solves just about all of the problems that I had with the actual crystals in the past: they were messy to apply properly (since they need to cover the entire underarm as well as a good portion of adjacent skin in order to be effective), tended to slip out of the container and/or my hand and shatter easily, and picked up strange smells over the course of their lifespan. For some reason, I&#x27;ve also had a difficult time finding liquid crystal deodorant in stores, so this multi-pack was a welcome find, not to mention an excellent value. (Tip: Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil to a bottle of liquid crystal deodorant to create your own custom deodorant!)</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. I find the spray much more convenient than the hard crystal and works equally as well.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant. I am sensitive to fragrances and this has none. It is quite effective for me though my daughters and granddaughter find it not as effective. I don&#x27;t usually have much body odor so I am not challenging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are concerned about the negative impact of aluminum in your deodorant, try this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff works perfectly if used after bathing - it doesn&#x27;t work like soap to remove existing bacteria, or perfume to kill bacteria with alcohol (and attempt to mask what it doesn&#x27;t kill). These crystal products prevent bacteria from growing any further - clean skin is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that you can kill its ability to work by applying some deodorants/anti-perspirant after it&#x27;s dried. I live in the desert and anti-persp. is a must. I&#x27;ve had better luck with Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Ultra Max Fresh (found at a dollar store) than Secret (either clinical or regular), but YMMV.</li>
            <li> Does not remove body odor 100%, but does remove it to a certain extent.. Feels &amp; Smells like water. Fragrance-free. I&#x27;ve tasted it. and its tastes like water/salt mix , nothing else. lol.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this deodorant does what it is meant to do and does it well for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Being in liquid form and with the pump spray there is no mess or residue to deal with, and it does *not* burn one&#x27;s skin!  When applied it just feels like spraying on water.  It does *not* discolor cloths.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and spray pump are of very good quality works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say that it has no known harmful chemicals or scent which means you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a fruit, a flower or  some hormonal animal.  One should not need to have the people one visits remember one by the lingering scent of one&#x27;s deodorant or the lack there of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I have at this time is that it would be good if the product was also available in large single containers in order to recycle the spray bottles and reduce landfill waste. Not to mention reduce cost.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have super sensitive skin and normal deodorants irritate my skin.  This stuff prevents smelly armpits and it is a natural product. :)</li>
            <li> I do not use Crystal on my body instead I spray inside my Keen Newport sandals since I always wear Keens Newports with no socks. I use baking soda inside my shoes but for sandals baking soda does not work as well as Crystal Spray.</li>
            <li> I love knowing I&#x27;ve eliminated daily use of aluminum on my person.  Very happy, performs better than expected.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a deodorant that didn&#x27;t have aluminum and a bunch of other chemical ingredients,  but also worked.</li>
            <li> should have known spray would stay wet and run&lt;br /&gt;works well, though</li>
            <li> OK, even if this is embarrassing I am going to be very honest hoping this will help someone who is going through the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;All my life I never had any problems with ANY deodorants….ever. But when I started going through menopause all deodorants and antiperspirants turned on me! I literally went through every brand at Walmart and beyond, only to have the same thing happen. I smelled like bug spray and worse!  People at work complained and made fun of me; the bullies in the front office started a smell chart and sent everyone an email asking them to report every time I smelled bad. NOT KIDDING! I tried everything I could think of!!! Believe me EVERYTHING! I spent over $200.00 in two weeks just trying different types of deodorants, antiperspirants and body sprays. It was a living hell.&lt;br /&gt;I found one product in a Health Food Store in San Diego, and that worked for about a year and that is Liquid Rock by Kiss My Face (is a very good product) but I could tell my safety net was fading because I could smell the deodorant after a few hours (even if it was unscented) and that’s how it all started I could smell it and then it soon turned to a bug spray smell!&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to go through that again I started looking for another product, I took a chance with this one. When I first used it I thought it was just water, but I was very surprised it worked and worked well. I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and so far so good and I am hoping it stays that way because I am running out of products to try! Good grief what a girl has to go through! Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I was always self-conscious of my body odor......down there.  After a long day at work I could notice it before getting home, even quicker if it was a hot-summer day.  I also always planned sex right after a shower, I didn&#x27;t want my g/f to have to smell my odor.  Part of it may be because of my diet, ie: red meat, spicy and greasy foods.  This caused me to sweat very easily and uncomfortably around my rectum.  After researching I found that moisture is perfect for bacteria growth and it will cause odor.  Tried changing my diet and it has decreased a little bit but I could still smell it enough.  Now that I&#x27;m cycling alot and I do use a chamois creme the smell is still there or back to where it was before changing my diet.  I found this product and thank god because it works!!  I use it on my underarms and rectum.  I don&#x27;t sweat as much down there but now I can go to work then ride 40miles before I start to get a hint of odor, very minuscule odor on my underwear or cycling shorts.  My confidence is back to normal!!  I will keep buying this product!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores anymore. I am allergic to traditional deodorants and this stuff works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Such a fan of this product.. I&#x27;ve been using for over 5 years! I not only use under arms but spray all over even in bikini area believe it or not but it helps with odor there too!! Something about salt preventing bacterial growth which causes odor. When I sweat I noticed I had a metal type odor (my body odor) so with this product and also I combine 91% or higher rubbing alcohol w decolorized iodine aka yodo blanco. I pour about 1 1/2 tablespoons in a bottle of alcohol then mix and pour into a spray bottle. After shower I spray that all over upper body. Obviously not your face and hair or bikini area! Once it dries I spray the salt spray and then u are good to go!! Odorless ALL DAY!! Even in the hottest weather. I hope this helps trust me I was thankful when someone shared this with me!</li>
            <li> Ok...so I&#x27;m a big guy and I sweat a lot.  For 20 years I tried different deodorants looking for that perfect one.  There are plenty out there that worked, but I always felt greasy or slimy when I put them on.  Not to mention the long term stains from the deodorant that would build up on my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more!!  This stuff is amazing.  I do 4 or 5 sprays on each arm in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go all day with ZERO odor.  Keep in mind, this is a deodorant only and does nothing (that I&#x27;m aware of anyway) to decrease the amount of perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also works good in those smelly shoes or sandals, kills the bacteria that causes odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they make this forever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I also used the mineral looking crystal blocks before this liquid and it worked just as well.  Only a bit more inconvenient as you had to wet the block before use.</li>
            <li> Great item! Works well for myself and my 14 year old daughter, and I&#x27;m not worried about any aluminum or chemicals. I always keep these stocked up.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic but this spray works wonderfully as a deodorant when used after showering. I was sensitive to all the commercial brands--even many of the hypoallergenic--but this is a completely reaction-free solution. Love it...</li>
            <li> My husband developed a bad rash in his armpits, so we decided to try a more natural product while his skin healed.  We both switched to the Crystal Spray and I have to say I like it.  It keeps odor away for at least a full day.  Usually by the time I get home from work, I have sweated a bit through the day and can have a little odor, but only if you shove your nose in there.  My husband says he can&#x27;t smell me and I don&#x27;t feel like I smell (as I have felt with other natural brands).  It is a little weird at first, but you get used to it.  I did notice that natural fibers have much less stink at the end of the day then polyester fibers.</li>
            <li> I have large breast and have had odor underneath them. I tried everything nothing worked until I found this product.  I love it. I spray it under my breast and there is zero odor even in the summer time after working out!</li>
            <li> Normally deodorants fail me, but this one is still working months later. I normally have to keep switching, but this one controls odor very well, by the time i shower the next day, i am not stinky at all.</li>
            <li> I used to stink so much I offended myself.  Now I am happy to say I do not.  My husband has also tried this and so far no complaints from him as well!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it works but i need to apply every 2 hours. if i forget, then i stink but once i apply it again, im fine.</li>
            <li> Decided a while back to stop using aluminum-containing deodorants, and this has always worked really well for me. Never stains my clothing (that is your deodorant, not your sweat that causes stains, by the way), and easily lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Been using it for many years but my Healthfood store stop selling this item.  After searching drugstores and Walmarts looking to buy this item I finally found it on Amazon.  Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Best value out there.</li>
            <li> Final opinion is pending.  On first few uses, my assessment is that this is not an optimal product for underarm use.  I recently decided to switch to spray, as I perceive that solid deodorants hold bacteria on the head that one inadvertently reapplies to underarms.  I find that using this spray product a minimum of twice a day is more effective than once a day, and the issue of reapplying bacteria from a solid stick is obviously removed.  I used crystal solids in the past and found them almost as effective as many of the stronger solid deodorants, but holding the same issue of transferring adhering bacteria.  I was hoping for that efficacy in this spray.  Efficacy is less than I hoped for, but I am not writing it off yet.  I don&#x27;t mind spraying multiple times per day if it works, and I need a little more time before I am sure.  The requirement to buy 6 bottles at a time gives me lots of time, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> We use these on our under arms. My hubby can not use deodorants because he gets rashes. With this product, he can apply, dry and go. He purchased a small hair dryer to dry his arm pits before leaving. He used to stink after working out. Now he can go all day without being stinky... Even after swimming at lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this too. I tried this alone and it did not work for me. I&#x27;m stinkier than my husband. However, it would work for me if I reapplied it often... I don&#x27;t have time to do that. It does help extend my deodorant for the day. I apply, dry, and then apply my deodorant on top.</li>
            <li> I love using an all natural deodorant.  Unfortunately if I do strenuous activity, it does not work for me.  So for work, i use regular deodorant.  On the weekend I use crystal.</li>
            <li> Works well, but how about a TSA-compliant size?</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and it works great. I use the same, but in the roll on. It works great and it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals and dangerous ingredients as many of the other brands sold in the stores. We couldn&#x27;t find the spray in the drug store so we ordered it thru amazon.</li>
            <li> Without getting too personal, my skin finds regular deodorant too irritating, but at the same time, going without anything can get funky. This deodorant is not only all natural, but very effective at controlling bacterial colonies on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same stuff as those crystal rocks you can find in health food stores. It&#x27;s basically the alum mineral which has a lot of uses. When traveling, I&#x27;ll bring the hard crystal through TSA, and apply it to wet armpits, and while at home, I&#x27;ll use the more convenient spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no fragrance, doesn&#x27;t irritate, and is very simple in its composure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty stinky so I use regular deo on my pits and this everywhere else! Works great for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing and REALLY works!  I&#x27;ve been using the stick version since I was a teenager and thought I would try the spray.  I found the spray to work a little better.  When applied, it does feel overly moist and sort of gross, but when it dries it proves effective and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because the spray bottles did not last very long.  The ones I received either didn&#x27;t spray at all or they stopped spraying after a short time, so I had to douse it onto my armpits until I bought a spray bottle and poured them all into that.</li>
            <li> I only use this deodorant - it is absolutely safe on delicate skin. My skin was getting irritated with almost anything else which is on the market. I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know because delivered behind a post at the front entrance which is 600 feet away.  left there all day.  I would not have known it was delivered at all had I not followed up on the Amazon.  It was warm when I opened it so do not feel comfortable letting my kids use it.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to any product with aluminum in it...no reaction to this product, and it works just great every day!</li>
            <li> Long time user of the product.  Great protection without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love the product,  been buying it for years, the way amazon shipped it the bottles came missing their caps and leaking all over the inside of the box. Lost probably half a bottle between the 6 leaking</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it&#x27;s the only one that I do not have any reaction to. I have used others that did not give me a rash but did not last all day. This item works all day with just a few sprays. The cost is exceptional on Amazon. I have been paying over $4 for years for the the 4 ounce bottle but no more.</li>
            <li> works great! doesn&#x27;t stain and i wear silk all the time. only issue is i have to reapply mid day and that&#x27;s only because i am still nursing and my left armpit stinks worse than a construction worker (secret clinical strength did nothing for me and was just clogging my pores with chemicals anyways). LOVE that this is not chock full of the same chemicals in standard deodorants!</li>
            <li> Ok, this deo is like water so I thought \\&quot;it won&#x27;t work\\&quot; BUT I am a believer! All day, no smell! Here is how I apply it...first, I apply the roll-on then the spray all over right out of the shower! Yes, I use the sray and roll-on just to be on the safe side...no smell...finally, my cologne. works like a champ! ....no more funny chemicals!</li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling fresh most of the time.  You can use it anywhere - in your shoes, feet, bra - anywhere you sweat!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Best ever!</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this product. It works very well and doesn&#x27;t contain anything harmful for your body in it. We prefer the spray to the roll on since all of us use it. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent nonirritating deodorant control under all circumstances.  Only takes a couple of spritzes and your done for the day. Recommend</li>
            <li> It works without perfumes.</li>
            <li> This product is excelent, really works. I use it every day and I am very satisfied. Very good price too.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine actually recommended this for me, so I guess I was kinda smelly. I ordered them online and used it as soon as it came in. It really does make a difference. You can&#x27;t smell any odor from your pits any more! And my friend said it even works in shoes! Only downside is after doing something physically demanding, you have to spray more on, or else you&#x27;ll start smelling again. But other than that, it works every time I spray it on!</li>
            <li> While pregnant with my last baby, I came across an article about toxins in breastmilk. The article speculated the greatest amount of toxins had come from the mother&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant products! Horrified, I did some more research and was shocked at what I found- my husband and I knew we would need to change and get away from our traditional store-bought antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shopped around on Amazon and read reviews, and what I read was essentially a mix. Most, it seemed, loved the idea of a toxic-free product, but couldn&#x27;t get the odor control they craved. I figured I would just do what a few of the reviewers suggested (one review said that reapplying mid-day was helpful, one review mentioned spraying once after a shower and once a few minutes later) and live with mild odor. The way I figured, odor was less important than not-poisoning my baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived I was pleased with the amount- a pack of six good-sized sprays was handy! I tossed one in my labor bag, and had a few in our drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the third trimester, and SUPER sweaty, and mentally prepped for the worst (to be a nasty smelling lady!!). I was SO pleased to find that this product worked REALLY well!!! I can count, on my hand, the number of times where I had a faint odor- not bad for a hot and humid summer while pregnant! After the baby was born I was unsure if it would work as well, as my body chemistry changed, but it did! I had a few nights where I would smell a bit, but those were during a week of postpartum night-sweats, and I haven&#x27;t had an issue since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not the only one in our home with success. My husband has NEVER had an odor problem while using the Crystal Body Spray! My husband spent the summer working hard on the family farm- he would be outside working in over 100 degree heat, and he NEVER smelled bad at all. It took a week to get used to not feeling \\&quot;dry\\&quot; all the time, but the lack of clothing stains, the lack of toxins, and the fact that this product keeps odor away, makes it all worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use the product just after toweling off from the shower, and we have not had any complaints!</li>
            <li> This is so incredibly convenient for those &amp;#34;don&#x27;t want to bother much&amp;#34; days.  I usually use the stick, and you have to run a little bit of water over it or apply directly to still-moist skin.  Due to my &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; and the fact that I can&#x27;t easily get to run the stick under the faucet drip, I&#x27;ve discovered that spraying a squirt of this (mostly water) onto the stick, is perfect.  Yes, I&#x27;m lazy. But it works beautifully and in the Summer gives a bit of added strength to the product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the cheapest price on this product.  This product may not be as strong as other deodorants but I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum or other chemicals.  It&#x27;s simple, quick and easy to apply and usually is effective.</li>
            <li> I used to use normal deodorant until I started getting rashes. So I switched to Tom&#x27;s of Maine (because it said it was natural and aluminum-free), which worked extremely well until they updated their formula to make it &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34;; I then noticed burning and discoloration. So I took a chance (based on so many positive reviews), and I am in love with this product! Yes it&#x27;s a spray and goes on wet, but it dries quickly and keeps odor at bay. Personally I sweat a ton, so some days I find myself re-applying but it&#x27;s not much of a hassle. Overall this product works exceptionally well and i love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> When applied liberally, you will not have BO!!!  No more stinky shirts, no more embarrassing stink!  I use 4 or 5 sprays under each arm after my morning shower and let it drip dry.  So worth the little extra time to allow for drying because I NEVER deal with BO anymore.  Tossed my old stinky clothes and all my news ones are safe!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter who was having bad night sweats and hot flashes after undergoing cancer surgery.  It works very well and has really helped her stay fresher.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really sweat much and even when I do; it is very light odor my body produce. This one has no scent no residue which I love. Since I don&#x27;t have sweating issues I am not sure how well it works. But I love it I wouldn&#x27;t buy another deodorant because it leaves absolutely ZERO RESIDUE on my clothes. I recommend you give a try once.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this. I sweat and smell if I wear this product. Unfortunatley I just have to kiss that money I spent on it goodbye!!</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! Highly recommended. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING out there for deodorant. nothing has worked except this! It&#x27;s not toxic like regular deodorant, I have MCS so it&#x27;s hard to find products MCS safe. I have odor issues due to the MCS, this works like a charm. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works without the bad stuff!</li>
            <li> I love spray on crystal deodorant! I add a couple drops of lavender and tea tree oils to increase effectiveness (and tea tree is good for razor burn). I definitely prefer the spray over the crystal because a) there&#x27;s no risk of contamination b) the crystal can get uneven and uncomfortable to apply and c) I can add EOs to the spray. You do need to make sure your pits are clean when you apply as this product inhibits bacteria growth.... So best applied straight out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work about 1/3 of the time. But I just use a sprayer from another bottle since I buy these in bulk.</li>
            <li> I know everyone is different, so when I say this didn&#x27;t work for my body, that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you.  First and foremost, I smelled really bad within an hour or two of using this.  It was as though I wasn&#x27;t wearing deodorant at all.  I did try re-applying it during the day, but one I smelled, I smelled.  It just wasn&#x27;t working.  So let&#x27;s say it might work for you.  There is still the problem of application.  I sprayed this onto my airpits and hated the way it ran down my body.  I did try to spray extra when I found it wasn&#x27;t working, which just meant I had more of this liquid to dry up.  So, I hate the delivery method.  Maybe the solid crystal would be less messy.  I&#x27;ll never know since I can&#x27;t depend of this to keep away my body odor.  Unfortunately I bought the big pack so I have many left.  I hope I can sell the unused ones for $1 at my garage sale.</li>
            <li> This has been a great alternative to using antiperspirants and deodorants.  I have tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, and they are just slimy, waxy or starchy, and they end up making me stink, sweat and just feel gross.  Crystal deodorant has been my best option. Although this does not stop the perspiration, after time, it does lessen the amount you do sweat.  I love crystal deodorants now.  It took a bit of a learning curve and detox period!  (remember, if you are using the antiperspirant and then going into natural, your body will detox from all the junk you&#x27;ve been putting into it...as even your antiperspirant/deodorant DOES absorb through the skin)  Personally, I like using the harder natural crystal &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34; after a shower, while I am still wet.  I allow this to dry.  Then I use the spray crystal deodorant.  Actually, I do add in a few drops of essential oils (usually lavender &amp; bergamot) into a new bottle and shake it up first.  This creates a nice natural relaxing scent along with additional antibacterial and antimicrobial properties.  I found this to work best for me, and it usually works for the entire day.  As others have mentioned, do not be skimpy on application.  Sometimes, I do apply the crystal spray twice a day.  I make sure I spray my armpits and the entire underside of my arms up to 4&amp;#34; above and below the armpits, and then I sort of rub my arms against my skin to help it dry.  I do lightly pat myself dry with a towel after. Even during heavy workouts and intense sweating, I do not stink!  &#x3D;)  Another thing I have noticed with switching to natural crystal deodorants, my clothing does not get stained.  I love also that this deodorant is safe for using anywhere you sweat.  I also use this under the girls, and it surprisingly prevents them from sweating as much.  When I don&#x27;t use a crystal rock first, I have used vodka instead by just applying a small amount under the arms, rubbing it in first, and then add the crystal spray.  It works great too.rks great too.</li>
            <li> Works well. Keeps me socially acceptable.</li>
            <li> I had a radical mastectomy &amp; can not wear regular deodorants. This is safe &amp; extremely effective. No stains or mess on clothing. Works even while working out.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t even use this as a deodorant. (I use the rock version that you wet) I use this to control the acne on my back! Because I noticed that salt water from the ocean clears up my back acne, maybe this product would too since it&#x27;s made of mineral salt. It worked! After showing I spray it on my back and after a few days I noticed it was drying out and clearing up my acne. While I still get the occasional one or two pimples, it does a great job of controlling breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and it compliments deodorant very well.  I would definitely recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market and I have FINALLY found the WINNER!!! This is not only the most affordable but the best product I have EVER used to combat odor! It completely neutralized underarm odor and stays that way all day and night. This is without question....AMAZING.. I am going to look into their other products as the result of this WINNER!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how or why, but this works for me. Doesn&#x27;t stop sweat, but stops BO. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this spray, it works so well.  When you first spray, you may smell a slight sulfur smell but that quickly goes away.  The bottom line it really does the trick, it removes odors and prevents them extremely well.  One other great feature, is no sweet smell and no aluminum.</li>
            <li> The product had good reviews on EWG but it does not work... it actually made me smell. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than any other deodorant! I used to use the roll-on but then found the spray. You really do not need a lot and it works very well.....&amp;#34;naturally.&amp;#34;  It does not stain my shirts and is clear. It also washes off easily, too! My old speedstick was great but it was really tough to wash off. This six pack is also an amazing value. The only good thing about the roll-on is that you can bring it on a plane. For home, I will continue to us this!</li>
            <li> The bottle I received could not spray at all. Just like you need to rub a deodorant stick on your clothes, I had to sprinkle my clothes with this liquid as the spraying mechanism(I don&#x27;t know if it even existed for the batch of bottles I got)  was not working. I did not expect this when a bottle is advertised as a spray deodorant in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot.. This is a terrible thing for someone with a strong sense of smell. I use this spray along with regular deodorant and it works great. I also use it under my bits and bobs in summer for odor free days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for years and I won&#x27;t change to the regular stuff on the market.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff will work for a couple days straight.  It works on feet as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if it lasted longer than 2 days like the crystal stone does.  It&#x27;s to be expected since this stuff is watered down to make the spray.  I use my broken crystal stones and dump them in the spray bottles for a little added boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal stones and sprays are GREAT!  They pull off the job regular commercial brands couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This deodorant so does not work. I love &#x27;natural&#x27; products, and I hate leaving bad reviews but this one simply doesn&#x27;t work. I almost wonder if people don&#x27;t leave bad reviews because they don&#x27;t want people thinking they are overly toxic or stinky. I work out at least every other day with Jillian Michaels DVDs, 5&#x27; 7&amp;#34; 120 pounds, so I sweat out a lot of toxins, and not a lot of fat with toxins creeping out in my sweat, eat almost all organic non gmo, don&#x27;t eat a lot of sugars, no sodas, vegetarian for years, don&#x27;t profusely perspire, or have stinky sweat, and I&#x27;m a girl...sooo? what&#x27;s the deal? I made sure I drenched my under arm as some said and wasn&#x27;t sparse, I made sure all clothes touching the under arm were drenched, I made sure I put it on right after hopping out of the shower, and it still didn&#x27;t work. I tried it for 4-5 months, bought it back in the summer. I was wearing a sleeveless Ann Taylor shirt at work in an air conditioned office, and just regular wear throughout the day, just a few hours into the morning and you get that &#x27;damp&#x27; feeling and the slight odor (not overly offensive) but still of arm pit :-/ Ugh! So it wasn&#x27;t like I was overly stinky but it&#x27;s the same smell there always is if I forget my deodorant. I might as well have been spraying water on there. My search goes on for a healthy deodorant.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the drugstore deodorants with the crazy-high percentage of the toxic aluminum compound because I sweat a lot and need a lot of protection. But I learned this is really bad for your health. The recent change in labeling was shocking -- consult your doctor if you have kidney disease?!?!?!? That did it, and I switched to these crystal deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being natural and non-toxic, they deserve 10 stars. However, my being spoiled by the chemical stuff, I have 2 small \\&quot;cons\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;- I have to spray a little and let it dry, then spray a little more. Otherwise, it forms into droplets that run down my sides and away from the armpit.&lt;br /&gt;- I also have to reapply this one or two more times throughout the day. Being a heavy woman I think makes this an issue. It protects *perfectly* for about 4 hours -- after this, I need to spray it again. This means carrying one of these bottles with me throughout the day, AND remembering to reapply BEFORE I notice a smell. It&#x27;s a small inconvenience, but I am convinced that it&#x27;s still better than taxing my body with chemicals and subjecting myself to a higher risk of cancer. This is why I gave this product 5 stars. Yes, it&#x27;s not as convenient as the toxic, drugstore stuff. But my health is worth the small inconvenience!!</li>
            <li> I got a wonderful buy on this great product.  I prefer this to other types of deodorant. It is also easier on my skin than the crystal form, and doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li> I have terribly sensitive skin on my underarms of all places, and was about to attempt going through life without deodorant at all when I discovered this stuff. I have tried both the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; version and the spray and I quite prefer the spray. From my own personal experience I can say that a little is good, and more is even better with this product. One other review I read suggests spraying onto your skin as well as the armpits of the garment you will be wearing. Very great advice. I can also add I put a few drops of tea tree oil to mine (also anti-fungal properties) and this not only gives it a soft, pleasant smell (if you like the smell of tea tree oil), but also amps up the deodorant quality a bit. Keep in mind, this product does nothing for sweating, it is not an antiperspirant. However, since I am not keen on blocking my body&#x27;s natural processes, this does not bother me since usually when I am sweating due to heat someone else is as well.</li>
            <li> Very effective protection, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and would recommend to anyone.  Lived in Florida for years and crystal kept me fresh, I love it</li>
            <li> HERE STARTS THE WALL OF TEXT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great anti-odorant (not deodorant, not anti-antiperspirant, this is preventative stuff here!) once you learn to use it.  I highly recommend it to people with bad body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to sweat a lot and it can smell pretty bad IMO, but when using this I could probably go two days without smelling!  That&#x27;s impressive considering I can start to smell just twenty minutes out of the shower.  (No I do not live in a super hot climate, I&#x27;m just special that way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So from what I&#x27;ve learned, once you hop out of the shower and dry off, hit up both of your pits with this spray and hit them good.  It will feel wet, but will dry off quick enough (don&#x27;t have to wait to dry before putting on your shirt).&lt;br /&gt;Now, put on your undershirt (or whatever shirt will be directly against your pits) and give your pits another hit.  At this point both your pit and the shirt in your pit will be moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of this is to get the active ingredient (read as salt) where you sweat so that bacteria cant have a festival of stench.(Nobody likes this kinda festival)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the biggest thing I learned while using this, even though I sprayed  my pits well, I would end up smelling.  However when taking off my shirt I started to realize it was my shirt that carried the stench and not me.  Thus, spray the shirt too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I hope this helps people.  I wont ever go back to that other slimy / waxy deodorant / anti-antiperspirant with perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note:&lt;br /&gt;- This prevents the bacteria from getting out of hand and multiplying, so if you already stink, spraying this on will only prevent additional stink.  Take a shower!&lt;br /&gt;- Try to dry the water from your pits before spraying this.&lt;br /&gt;- This works in other areas that sweat and smell, if I&#x27;m going to sweat a lot I&#x27;ll sometimes hit my chest too&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t be afraid to really spray it on there when you&#x27;re first trying this out.  Once you see the results you&#x27;ll then start to try to hone in how much you really&lt;br /&gt; need.  Basically, prevent having a bad experience by trying to cheap out with two spritz.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s in a purple spray bottle that does not look very manly, you may have to compensate elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good day and smell well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERE ENDS THE WALL OF TEXTce you see the results you&#x27;ll then start to try to hone in how much you really&lt;br /&gt; need.  Basically, prevent having a bad experience by trying to cheap out with two spritz.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s in a purple spray bottle that does not look very manly, you may have to compensate elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good day and smell well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERE ENDS THE WALL OF TEXT</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at a store that starts with the letter U. You may have heard of this beauty store and I paid nearly eight dollars for a single bottle of this! Was so happy to get such a deal here on Amazon for a pack of 6!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to get the best use out of this product I had to learn a couple of things.&lt;br /&gt;1. You need to apply it to clean dry skin, right after you exit the shower and leave your arms up for about half a minute to give it time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. You will still sweat, but you won&#x27;t stink if applied properly and allowed to dry. It will not keep your underarms dry from sweat. If you want that, keep looking for an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this product controls odor actually better than the deodorants w/antiperspirants I used to use, but if you sweat a lot, you might need something that will reduce sweating and should look into a different product that contains antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a fragrance allergy and since this is basically salt water, it does not interfere with my ability to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a lifelong customer for this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years, pretty effective, and safe</li>
            <li> There is one thing that this product does extremely well--it does not promote the development of yellow armpit stains. For that reason alone I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars all day long. Does it last 48 hours? Hell no. Sometimes I am lucky to get it through the day, but this is not a problem, as I have a modern apparatus called shower. I suppose asking to shower twice a day is a bit much for some, but if you know the difference between Pima and Egyptian cotton, you will probably appreciate this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Something strange of product, noticed weeks after using product. all six bottles had a thick white coating settled on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as I would like.  In spite of the large number of bottles in the order, I returned to my old stand-by, Mitchum&#x27;s antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and a bit easier to use than the roll-on. I use this deodorant as in on my feet during winter time of wearing hot socks, or knee highs. Just spray and go. It is great. Crystal Body Deodorant spray is convenient absolutely great. Additionally it can be used under breasts and roll directly onto private areas for extra odor control after showering. Perfect! No irritation or mess and it works for long days.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Other deodorants irritate my skin, but I love this stuff!  Great product and available in bulk on Amazon</li>
            <li> GET RID OF THE BRAND NAME STICKS, ETC. THIS SPRAY WILL NOT ELIMINATE SWEAT, BUT THERE IS NO ODOR...AMAZING PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I remember my aunt using this product when I was younger, and I was impressed. After using numerous valued deodorants, I decided to give this one a try. I am ineed impressed and understand why my aunt always used it. Only 4 stars because I wouldn&#x27;t say it last a full 24hrs, and under physical activity I would say less than that. A useful tip is shower-up your under arms, spray the crystal body, let it dry, and spray your favorite cologne/perfume over it. You will smell cologne/perfume through the day.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with other deodorants irritating you, this is the deodorant you need.  It is effective, leaves no white residue and is odorless.  It is the only deodorant that I have found that I can use without irritating my underarms.</li>
            <li> Been real happy with this.  Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave the residue most deodorants leave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant, so I wanted to switch to products with less chemicals, and that unfortunately included my FAVORITE clinical antiperspirant, which is chock-full of aluminum and such.&lt;br /&gt;I tried some organic deodorants, and was so not impressed: they aren&#x27;t antiperspirant, and they smell funky while only partially masking body odor. Oh, and now that I&#x27;m pregnant and my hormones are going crazy, I&#x27;m more sweaty and stinky than usual, so, it was a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my mom and a few sites online suggested I try the crystal deodorants, and I have to say, I&#x27;m impressed. I bought this spray and the roll-on kind as well, and I&#x27;ve found the most effective technique is to spray this on, then use the roll-on (because the roll-on needs to be dampened to be used, and it&#x27;s kind of annoying to use water, either on the crystal or directly on the skin). The combination of the two work really well. Oh, and I&#x27;ve never had sweaty or smelly feet in my entire life, but as another joy of pregnancy, I&#x27;m dealing with that, too, and using the crystal spray on my feet and in my shoes has completed solved that problem. I actually feel less sweaty, and I never smell like anything, not body odor and not fake masking aroma. It&#x27;s so nice, I think I might stick to this AFTER the baby!&lt;br /&gt;Another real perk of using this is that it washes out of clothes so easily. I have a very sensitive nose, so I usually have to pre-treat the underarms of my shirts before laundering, because if any deodorant lingers on there through the wash, it smells gross on otherwise clean clothes, and that was a real problem with the organic deodorant. Also, the clinical antiperspirant I used was so intense, it took intentional scrubbing to remove it from my skin during the shower, but this stuff washes off very easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Love the product but wish I could order fewer at a time. Feel like an old person sticking up for war time.</li>
            <li> I bought this after wanting to go the more natural route of deodorants, after reading about the dangers or normal products that I&#x27;ve used my whole life.  I was pretty skeptical at first when seeing the ingredients.  How would that actually do anything?  Well, I tried it anyway.  The first few days were pretty awful.  Supposedly your body rids itself of crud that it couldn&#x27;t before and I stunk PRETTY BAD!  But I trusted what I had read and hoped that it would get better.  And surprise surprise, it did!  I do put it on at night, too, but I really don&#x27;t get stinky!  Try it and give it a few days.  It&#x27;s worth a few days of stinkiness for the health benefits!</li>
            <li> I get boils in my arm pits and even though I stopped using an antiperspirant, and switched to an antibacterial soap, it didn&#x27;t hit me for a long time that the stick deodorant I was applying was spreading bacteria, so my problem was never-ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So something not passing the bacteria is necessary and this fits the bill without using an aerosol that adds to our ozone issues.  It&#x27;s unscented which is another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stops the odor on your skin and can be used anywhere on the outside of your body.  It will not prevent an odor from bacteria starting on your clothing, so as someone else suggested (and I&#x27;m glad I read their review before starting to use this) give your clothing a spray as well in those area, such as your armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely doing better and like the results.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the roll-on, and initially loved it! After about a week bacteria gets inside the roll on and it no longer works, it actually does the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alternative for me was a spray which is perfect! It works well and I&#x27;m happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars in my opinion. :)</li>
            <li> After using for about a week have developed red irritating skin under one underarm, which has happened with just about every natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used. Stops odor, but the irritation isn&#x27;t worth it. How about adding a natural buffering ingredient to it?</li>
            <li> This product keeps you from smelling and we really like the fact were not putting aluminum in our bodies. I used to use the roll on crystal but i find this one more convenient but it may not last quite as long.  Its worth it to me not having to worry about the crystal breaking over time.</li>
            <li> My family members with allergies use the Crystal Body Deodorant Spray to avoid certain compounds present in other spray deodorants. I have tried this product, too, although I prefer a stick deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not prevent wetness but works adequately against odor. My husband uses 2 shpritzes under each arm. Except in the hottest part of the summer he was odor-free at the end of the day and did not require reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump bottle although sometimes the nozzle clogs. A rinsing with water clears up the clog.</li>
            <li> Wow! very impressed. I have both the crystal stone and recently acquired this spray version. I HAD terrible body odor problems. Not only in my armpits but in my intimate parts too. I tried EVERYTHING even purchased chlorophyll which was supposed to help, but nothing. I use the stone for the armpits and use the spray for other body parts. Yes, the stone is better but the spray is more convenient... If i use the stone on the armpits I don&#x27;t feel like using it around the vaginal area. The spray allows me to use it everywhere. I&#x27;m also very active and use vibrams fivefingers... sometimes they get smelly so I just spray a little on the shoes... I&#x27;m telling you this is a miracle.</li>
            <li> Does not work if you tend to sweat even moderately.</li>
            <li> I am a very stinky sweater and this prevents odors far better than aluminum deodorants that just mix with BO and give me a worse smelling funk than BO alone.  I usually \\&quot;wash\\&quot; with the wet crystal rock before I get out of the shower, then follow up with the spray, then spray again after I put my shirt on.  If I make sure to do this before any BO starts, I&#x27;m stink free for the rest of the day.  The aluminum crap doesn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! It works. I added some lavendar oil, and spray it underarms, feet, and underwear. My 3 year old daughter gets a spray on her feet too, those winter boots and socks had her feet smelling like chips and vinegar. Now they smell like kissable toes.</li>
            <li> This mineral deodorant works well, as well as anything of a similar type. I do not like to use antiperspirant any more than needed, especially in colder weather. The effect does tend to wear off by the end of the day, but worth not using antiperspirant chemicals. This can also be used on feet. This was the best price I found and appreciate having several bottles on hand.</li>
            <li> We use this all Winter because it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant, so at least 1/2 of the year we are not getting that aluminum that is in regular deodorant.  You can even skip a day..it&#x27;s that effective.</li>
            <li> This product is organic and it works great! It is easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, I just loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural deodorant and so I tried this assuming that it was some hippy type deodorant that was going to leave me stinky... it works great. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t work all day for my husband, but for me it works all day.</li>
            <li> Use it all over, no strong smell, not sticky or waxy. May be just a bit pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> For those looking for natural deodorant, I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s simple, truly unscented, and just works. It&#x27;s not skip-a-day deodorant, no natural ones are as far as I&#x27;m aware, but it&#x27;s gotten the job done for me in different weather conditions.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with deodorant. They irritated my skin. The Crystal body spray not only fights the odor of sweat naturally, it also helped me fight foot odor.  Best of all I have had no irritation. I found another great benefit. This is the best spray to help control jock itch. This is amazing spray. Salts are the best ingredient I have found for my odor control.</li>
            <li> Was just not me. Had a more girlish smell to it than for a dude. I did not put it on though so you may want to test yourself. I ended up getting the Thai stick one that is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it&#x27;s very hard to find in the stores. It broke my husband out and my daughter doesn&#x27;t like it either, but I love, love, love it! I definitely will be purchasing again through Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried the roll on and even though it works too, this feels refreshing to me.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does but apply it soon as you get out the shower</li>
            <li> Very simply put, it works. No horrible chemicals and no awful stains on garments. I&#x27;ve tried all three application methods and the spray is by far the most convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to get into details but I love this stuff! I was skeptical since I have tried many natural stick deodorants and I swear they make you smell worse. Why would this be any better? I am glad I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. This stuff is fantastic! Some people complained about the product dripping down their body but I haven&#x27;t really had that problem. A couple of sprays under each arm from about a foot away, dressed within a few minutes and good to go all day!</li>
            <li> Now, I do want to stress that this is a DEODORANT--it is NOT going to prevent you from sweating, but it DOES keep you from having that stinky pitted out smell!  I first used this product on Wednesday--5 sprays on each underarm.  Thursday, I experimented with 3 sprays each underarm, and then since then, I have done just 2 sprays per underarm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am perimenopausal (sorry to get all &amp;#34;womanly&amp;#34; on the guys reading this!), and one of the side effects of that is the lovely &amp;#34;hot flush&amp;#34;, which I experience several times a day.  In the past, these would leave me REALLY stinky (we are talking BO with a definite capital B!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have still been sweaty, but I do not stink.  There has been no irritation to my underarms (either itchiness or redness, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried mentioning the wonderfulness of this product several times to my hubby, who suffers from stinky feet (as it is also advertised that this product is good for that as well).  Myself, I don&#x27;t have that problem, so I can&#x27;t test that out, but I am thinking, based on how well it works on my pits, that it would also work on stinky feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most definitely plan on buying more of this product</li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to the more standard deodorants.  Since it is a pump spray it does not have the irritants that most deodorant in the spray cans have (ie none of the irritating propellants).  My skin is fairly sensitive and I have had no irritation with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and not overwhelming by any means.  I work in a health clinic so I am very aware of the impact that smells might have on others.</li>
            <li> My favaorite deodorant to use. This was the best deal out there and less expensive than the supermarkets here.&lt;br /&gt;I am supplied for awhile.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was concerned about the mainstream deodorants and how they affect the body.  I found this product via amazon and decided to try based on reviews.  I spray this immediately when I get out of the shower before I put on clothes.  As many have stated, if you spray too much, it will end up running down your arm/chest which is irritating.  The only thing I can think of is that after your pores are closed off, your body absorbs only the amount of spray that is needed and the rest rolls down your body.  I find that I need to reapply every 3-4 hours (in the summer months anyway) and once I reapply, the smell usually disappears. It is sometimes an inconvenience but I do not think it is too large a price to pay for a clean alternative to traditional deodorants.</li>
            <li> Spray version leaves product running down your arm or body,  unlike the roll-on.  Therefore, wish I would have stuck with the roll-on. Still works the same as far as being a great deodorant but now I am stuck with several bottles of the spray.</li>
            <li> Great natural alternative to traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son-in-law who is allergic to the aluminum in regular anti-perspirant  and so far he likes it a lot.  He is no longer breaking out.</li>
            <li> Works better than antiperspirant and is not unhealthy.  I spray it on, let it dry and spray again.</li>
            <li> Great product, use regularly.</li>
            <li> I started using the solid crystal rock by the same company a couple of years ago, as part of a shift to using natural products whenever possible.  I did not know there was a spray available at the time I purchased the rock (maybe there wasn&#x27;t?) - but was pleased with the performance.  I hated having to wet the rock before using, and also found the rock to be too delicate - I dropped it a couple of times, which caused cracks and chips that were pretty sharp and unpleasant until they got worn down again.  Anyway - I love the spray!  Works just as well as the solid, dries quickly, works at least 12 hours to prevent odor.  It does NOT stop wetness, and will NOT stop odor once it&#x27;s started.  I added this product to my subscribe and save program - it&#x27;s a great deal for a safe, effective product.</li>
            <li> It prefer the solid. This product leaves we wet and does not prevent from b.o. By the end of the day as well.  I will stick with solid version from now on.</li>
            <li> I use this as opposed to a traditional deodorant and have for years. It doesn&#x27;t stop the perspiration, but keeps it from developing an odor. It does an excellent job for that.</li>
            <li> This is the only deoderant I have been able to use in years, and I appreciate their quality products.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this works. It has no scent, but you stay feeling clean and fresh and odor free.</li>
            <li> If you are allergic to perfumes, this is what you should be using under your arms. It controls body odors very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, feels good and keeps the smell down.  What more could you ask for from a deodorant?</li>
            <li> I can always count on getting this product through Amazon.Com.  I am not so lucky in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best product if you happen to have a problem with the aerosol spray kind.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, it deserves the highest rating.</li>
            <li> great product, seriously works better than most natural deodorants</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and it works great.  I have the most sensitive skin and not only does this not bother me but it keeps me from getting painful bumps from shaving!  WONDERFUL benefit!  I also find it safe and effective to use in intimate areas. UNLIKE another reviewer, I find that this DOES work even if there is already some odor present as it kills the bacteria.  As for clothing, often odor in your clothes is locked in there by previous antiperspirant products. I have tried also spraying the clothes themselves and found that on darker fabric, it will leave a white outline (salt.)  And I recommend the spray vs the rock form as I found that after a while, the rock developed sharp edges.  As stated by a previous reviewer, it is not an antiperspirant (which is good since many believe that the aluminum chlorhydrate in those products can pose health risks), but it is a GREAT Deodorant!!  If you sweat a lot (which your body does to cool itself) and if it bothers you then you will want to address that separately. But this handles the odor issue excellently!  I recommend buying several at a time as it became difficult to find locally. (And that saves gas, footwork and time.)  UPDATE: my last order only contained 1 item, not 6.  I am trying to contact someone.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing stuff.  It was in the office where I got a mammogram.  I have been using something with lavender and tea tree oil but had to apply frequently and it left white rings... this spray is invisible and once it dries, it works!  I&#x27;ve been using it in the hot AZ (112 degrees) sun for about 2 weeks and I can say, it totally does the job.  Still kinda in shock :)</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!!!! I have tried them all, believe me!  I have paid high dollar for clinical brands and even tried the sports version.  By afternoon I always had that bad under arm smell.  Not with this product!! I think I could easily sell this to my friends because I believe in it so much.  I bought the 6 pack and I have given 3 bottles to friends and family members.  Now they are believers too!! So simple. So inexpensive. Just order it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Dove, Ban, Suave, Degree, Secret to Teen Spirit. I&#x27;ve tried solid sticks, gel, clinical strength and aerosol spray deodorant. I&#x27;ve even tried baby powder on top of the deodorant...NOTHING and I mean NOTHING works like this! I bought this product because I have a funny smell when wearing sleeveless shirts and I have yet to wear it with a sleeveless top BUT I have worked hard and been outdoors for hours with this product and returned home with NO smell! I&#x27;m convinced that it will be that way even with a sleeveless top. I am glad I made the decision to buy this after googling if anyone else had that same experience when wearing sleeveless tops and found that this is what people use! I&#x27;ve never been so excited for a product! Also, I will say your armpits may feel just a tiny bit sticky, but just a little. This will be my staple deodorant. It&#x27;s by far the best. I even purchased the stick for future use.</li>
            <li> This deodorant does a pretty good job in controlling odor, but I do have to reapply several hours later.  I appreciate that it does not leave any stains or smells in my clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for 20 + years, it is hard to find the spray in the stores, so purchasing from Amazon is very convenient. It work as it says it does, it is very effective.</li>
            <li> I was the first mate on a tourist ship in the gulf of mexico, sweating for 16 hours a day 6 days a week while providing 5 star service for people. This stuff worked well, kept me stink free, I just applied it twice a day and I was good to do. No terrible anti-perspirant to smother me, just a nice, simple, clean deodorant. The bottle lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!! I never write reviews because I have an infant and a toddler and I am a school principal so I have no time.  But in this case I had to speak up.  This is no better than water.  I was tempted to taste it to see if in fact it is water.  Does not work.....other reviews must be plants.  But Green Tidings; this the only natural deodorant that I have found effective....it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> excellent products and excellent seller</li>
            <li> This stuff still has &#x27;Alum&#x27; in it - a Potassium Aluminum salt, the &#x27;Natural Mineral&#x27; they are talking about here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out this link for a discussion:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.peoplespharmacy.com/2012/02/06/are-natural-alum-crystal-deodorants-safe/&lt;br /&gt;(might be biased since they also sell a deoderant, though still valid question)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HuffPo&#x27;s got a good breakdown of some alternative natural deoderants:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-shapley/9-green-deodorants-that-a_b_247638.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use this stuff but am switching since I&#x27;m still concerned about whatever this Potassium Aluminum is, even if a somewhat different compound than the other anti-persperent Aluminum compounds.</li>
            <li> A good producrt but the solid roll up is bette and last longer.  For better results shave you under arms and don&#x27;t use a soap made with &amp;#34;Animal Fats&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the greatest body spray on earth!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;Use it EVERYwhere in the summer...!</li>
            <li> Works like magic. Tested it in the hottest conditions. No more BO. Get this, also more exposure to harmful chemicals. Love it!</li>
            <li> My order arrived in a timely manner and the product is just as described in the offering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works amazingly well and after a few days of use, there&#x27;s no body odor whatsoever.  Whenever I start to sweat or just feel funky in-between showers, I spritz my underarms, body, clothes, and hair.  The spray is a nice size and can be carried in your purse for an instant freshen up!  I love and swear by this product!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS and it works!  I live in a very hot and humid climate.  I can run and heat up and still it does the job!  Very mild on skin.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have used it for several years and it gets harder &amp; harder to find locally. So I&#x27;m happy to be able to find it on Amazon, usually at a multi-pack pricing that&#x27;s really affordable.  About the stuff itself: First off, it&#x27;s a deodorant, NOT AN ANTI-PERSPIRANT. You are still gonna sweat, but you generally won&#x27;t stink. It&#x27;s unscented, so you can use it with any other product line. There&#x27;s no alcohol burn, even if my skin is irritated. It doesn&#x27;t affect my multiple skin allergies or cause ingrown / inflamed hair &amp; sweat glands (hidradinitis).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only down-side? it&#x27;s NOT one of those 24-hour, clinical-strength products. If you need morning to night coverage, you will probably need to re-apply. it&#x27;s clear, not sticky and dries in a flash, so it&#x27;s not that big a deal for such a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants in the past few years due to my desire to stay away from the chemicals in almost ALL woman&#x27;s deodorants (there has been research connecting these chemicals to breast cancer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first natural option I have really been pleased with. It is NOT an anti-perspirant so you may sweat a little but it does keep the odor at bay well and doesn&#x27;t need the kind of reapplying most do. It generally lasts me most of the day, I may reapply if I get a chance in the evening or if it&#x27;s been THAT kind of day. I recommend the spray as I didn&#x27;t love the roller application I first bought. The spray just feels &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for me.  I was looking for something I could spray on.  I was concerned since it is only a deodorant and not an antiperspirant and I have not had luck in the past with those.  But this has worked well for me.  I am getting more.  The bottles last a surprisingly long time, too.</li>
