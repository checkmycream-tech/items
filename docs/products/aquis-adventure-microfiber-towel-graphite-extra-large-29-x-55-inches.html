            <li>I take this and the Medium Aquis Towel with me to the gym each day and they both work great...</li>
            <li>It works great, is absorbent to the nth degree.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for laying on it.</li>
            <li>I use this towel at the gym and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Someone reccomended these towels for my husbands deployment on the USS Nimitz, and I am so happy they did.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very nice and come with a travel bag.  </li>
            <li>good quality with a very nice compact case.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for superior absorbency these are for you.</li>
            <li>&quot; that a good towell has.  </li>
            <li>This graphite color is really nice, and the loop (has a snap on it) is great.</li>
            <li>I am getting one for my mom and spreading the love!</li>
            <li>Now that we take lengthier trips in our travel trailer, I purchased two more Aquis Adventure towels in the XL size, just to \\&quot;spoil\\&quot; ourselves!  </li>
            <li>I mentioned before, I just LOVE these towels!  </li>
            <li>Although this is a nice towel and quality is great (love the handy carrying pouch)</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This towel is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again just because I don&#x27;t think I can justify $20+ for a towel AGAIN, but it was nice to try one.</li>
            <li>yet did not do as an effective job at drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice to have a non bulky but fully functional towel.</li>
            <li>Nice towel..</li>
            <li>Also liked the zip bag it came in, as well as the hang loop</li>
            <li>I really liked this towel, is quite practical</li>
            <li>The REI one isn&#x27;t as plastic-y feeling, but it isn&#x27;t as nice as this one.</li>
            <li>Very great quality and have held up like new for 5+ years.</li>
            <li>This towel is super absorbant and not bulky which makes it great for travel and storing.</li>
            <li>as far as quality -- just the best.</li>
            <li>this thing is perfect for whatever your needs are as far as a towel..</li>
            <li>Dries very quick!</li>
            <li>but it is pretty great still.</li>
            <li>I guess they win pretty</li>
            <li>This towel does really good, as good as normal</li>
            <li>I ordered more for the RV and for additional bathrooms.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aquis and Amazon for a great advance in towelage.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the smallest, most compact bath-sheet (29*55) sized towel to take on my adventures overseas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Egyptian cotton and Turkish cotton and although they may be more plush and luxurious I have to say Aquis towels are infinitely more absorbent.</li>
            <li>I really love these Aquis Towels.</li>
            <li>These Graphites don&#x27;t bleed, pills or fuzzes after many washers and driers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>doggies also love them when I used it as a blanket.</li>
            <li>Favorite towel to carry to the swimming pool.  </li>
            <li>I love these towels.  </li>
            <li>wish they could have more color choices&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love these towels.  </li>
            <li>We love these towels for camping.</li>
            <li>fast shipment, and this product is great.</li>
            <li>The more I use this towel, the more I dislike it.  </li>
            <li>The Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel seemed to get better reviews</li>
            <li>so I bought one and have been incredibly pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Nice light weight &amp; compact.  </li>
            <li>So I do more blotting with this towel than I do</li>
            <li>I love these and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Great for drying fast and shorter time in the dryer to save electricity.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and the size it perfect to wrap around my body and the material is soft.</li>
            <li>Great product, Super fast shipment</li>
            <li>I have other microfiber towels and this one has the best texture.</li>
            <li>After use it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It admittedly doesn&#x27;t work as well as a standard bath towel on the first use, but if you have to deal with humid environments or don&#x27;t want to have to wash it often, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>extra large is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>This is my third order of these great towels.</li>
            <li>It has a dual purpose and is great for overall drying.</li>
            <li>They are also light but prefect weight.</li>
            <li>We wanted a towel that was absorbent, but light weight;This towel fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much because, unlike most &amp;#34;super-absorbent&amp;#34; towels, this one feels like cloth, not some kind of strange chamois cloth that smears the water around.</li>
            <li>My friend has a small Aquis towel and it works great!</li>
            <li>The towel is light, compact, and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>About a year ago, I finally decided to start bringing it to the Y (our Y doesn&#x27;t supply towels, which I think is WISE) to use as my primary post-swim workout towel -- ditching the bulkier terry variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very fast delivery, love the towel, dries very quick, no mold smell, we leave in Hawaii, towels get moldy over night, but not this one, now i use only this one after shower, i sure will get more.</li>
            <li>It folds very small and light, perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>The sizes are great and they dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Super absorbent, fast drying and very light.</li>
            <li>This towel is great for curly hair - drying or using with wet hair while conditioning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true believer in microfiber towels</li>
            <li>Okay, let&#x27;s get it straight</li>
            <li>The material is soft and nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>Basically I bought two full sets for the bathroom:&lt;br /&gt;Bath</li>
            <li>I love these so much that I won&#x27;t get a shower without trying to find my towel.</li>
            <li>dries relatively quickly and it is lightweight.  </li>
            <li>AND dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries my skin and hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a quick drying towel I would recommend these even over the RAT towel because I like the texture.</li>
            <li>dries quickly after use.</li>
            <li>extra large is perfect for full body coverage and so far its survived the washer and dryer..</li>
            <li>Love this towel and highly recommend it to service members going overseas.</li>
            <li>They have more texture than the RAT towel but are very soft as well.  </li>
            <li>Simply put, I LOVE these towels!  </li>
            <li>Light weight, compact, SUPER absorbent, fast drying, and durable.  </li>
            <li>The little snap tab on the towel is great for hanging when a clothes line is not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good towel if you are traveling and won&#x27;t have a towel to use, but it&#x27;s definitely not extra large.</li>
            <li>The storage pouches are handy, and have been equally durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt; These towels may seem a bit pricey, but they are well worth it for their compact size, performance, and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was pricey, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Really nice, surprisingly big.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several travel towels out there and this is by far the best one because it actually feels more like a real towel.</li>
            <li>Nice and big and helps wick the water away.</li>
            <li>thing dries so quickly and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>it wicks away water quickly and feels like a real towel.  </li>
            <li>It is very absorbent though and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It warm enough cool nights and cool enough for hot summer nights here in S. Cal.</li>
            <li>The main problem is that it isn&#x27;t soft to the touch or satisfying to use.  </li>
            <li>Go with a more standard</li>
            <li>These towels texture seem more like a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; towel - they are definitely not the chamois feel.</li>
            <li>i keep it in my gym bag because of its compact size and it dries better than any regular bath</li>
            <li>Very convienent carrying case as well!</li>
            <li>is exactly what you want.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a pretty flexible product.</li>
            <li>Most on the market are on the smaller side, but not this one.</li>
            <li>I bought an REI travel towel a few years ago as a backup, and it doesn&#x27;t come close to as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Love this towels, they don&#x27;t occupy too much space, dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>worth noting is that this particular towel is not the same&lt;br /&gt;superfuzzy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Our four towels have endured many, many camping trips and washing cycles, yet they are not the least bit worn or tatty.  </li>
            <li>Great for vacations to the tropics, where cotton&lt;br /&gt;can take a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li>is hardly a positive feature.  </li>
            <li>but i have had a smaller Aquis microfiber towel for more than ten years that i primarily use for travel.</li>
            <li>easy dry right</li>
            <li>so light, dry  super fast</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s rather large</li>
            <li>So far the cases that the towels come in are very handy, but question how long the zippers will last...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several travel towels out there and this is by far the best one because is soft, thin, light and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbent and dries fast.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t occupy much space @</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>really recommend this item</li>
            <li>We have a beach bag ready to go</li>
            <li>I really like the graphite color and convenient zipper pouch</li>
            <li>Do not take up much space, they come in a traveling pouch.</li>
            <li>real beauty in Aquis towels is that they are well made and that they soak up water like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li>These towels are great for travel or everyday use - soft, absorbant, and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I washed the towel only once so far (when I first got it) and with only one washing it is soft and feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>They dry very quickly too.</li>
            <li>They absorb a lot of water and dry very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The carrying case is nice to use around the house for other things but is impractical to keep putting the towel back into after the first washing.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as a regular towel.</li>
            <li>My family has been using these towels all over the world in our travels and they work great, standing up to harsh conditions without a single issue.</li>
            <li>The bonus is they dry quick!  </li>
            <li>They look, feel, and perform, just as they did when they were new!  </li>
            <li>Soaks up water much better than a standard terry cloth towel, dries faster, and packs smaller.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit big for backpacking, but it is nice to have the extra large size for drying off in mountain streams and even on regular days at the beach.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>The towel dries my dogs after swimming quickly, and the towels dry fast too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Liked the towel so much that when I came home I ditched my regular cotton large poofy towels which took up so much room</li>
            <li>They are very absorbent and soft.</li>
            <li>In fact, I like it so much that I have bought several more of these same towels in the smaller size so that I can stuff it in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size to cover half the body for me and dries faster than other towels</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>My son have them in college because they dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice item for the pool with enough space to accomodate a few extras, like my suit and swim mp3.</li>
            <li>These are thirsty towels that soak up moisture and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>and you can dry up quickly with it</li>
            <li>You only need to easily pat your self dry with none of the old buffing and wiping involved.</li>
            <li>this towel is definitely larger than the average towel and is more than sufficient ...</li>
            <li>I purchased 4 of them in the large size several YEARS ago - for use in our travels while car/tent camping, and for kayak camping.  </li>
            <li>I bought the extra large size (29\\&quot;</li>
            <li>They give the feeling of a soft cotton towel, vs. drying yourself with a pair of 1970&#x27;s polyester slacks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have the complete set</li>
            <li>It lacks the thickness and soft \\&quot;poofiness\\</li>
            <li>I do my makeup with my hair in the towel, and when I&#x27;m finished with the makeup, my hair is so much dryer than it would be with a traditional towel.</li>
            <li>Even though it is thin, the towel absorbs moisture quickly, drys quickly, and is soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>The size large towels have always been adequate to dry the average sized adult.  </li>
            <li>And still, after countless uses, and washings, they still look and feel brand new!  </li>
            <li>The comparable EMS towel is the same size, but thinner and the carrying pouch is about 1/3 the size of this particular towel.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this thing dries so quickly and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>I love how small and low profile it is, yet it is so easy to dry off with and extremely convenient to tuck into a gym bag.</li>
            <li>Regular towels tend to not dry my hair very well and tend to take out the curls.  </li>
            <li>These towels are only mildly grabby, and once they start absorbing water, that slight tacky feel totally disappears.  </li>
            <li>Hang up the towel at night and  its bone dry in the AM, ready to be used again.</li>
            <li>Dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also recommend the Extra Large size as it&#x27;s the only one you can actually tie around your body when you get out of</li>
            <li>I have no regrets purchasing these towels.  </li>
            <li>Also found that when used if hung immediatly the towel dries extremely fast and does not leave that wet smell or any trace of it.</li>
            <li>I have other quick dry travel towels</li>
            <li>These were the only items that came back  in like new condition.  </li>
            <li>It is small and compact, but super absorbent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to properly dry off, is very absorbent, and doesn&#x27;t stay wet very long.</li>
            <li>It really cuts down the blowdrying time and also decreases the damage from blowdrying for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The extra large size is big enough for me to wrap around my body and tie like a normal towel, but it&#x27;s thin enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up much additional space in my bag.</li>
            <li>The towel is thin and easily packed not taking up any space at all.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing the Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel I read a lot of reviews about travel towels and many consumers complained that these towels, although they were compact and dried quickly, were too scratchy, stuck to your wet skin, and were not particularly comfortable to use.  </li>

            <li> If you are a swimmer then these are perfect.</li>
            <li> these towels are ideal for traveling - they&#x27;re lightweight</li>
            <li> Great investment.</li>
            <li> Great towel.  </li>
            <li> this is a great towel if you are traveling.  </li>
            <li> use for swimming.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great item.  </li>
            <li> I throw this towel in with my gym bag for the gyms I visit that don&#x27;t offer towels, and it works great.</li>
            <li> It worked great in a dorm setting where the bathroom saw five showers a day, and in Southeast Asia during monsoon season.  </li>
            <li> have to say, this thing is GREAT.  </li>
            <li> These are great for travel.</li>
            <li> Great value for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great towel if you are looking for something for your gym bag.</li>
            <li> I take this and the Medium Aquis Towel with me to the gym each day and they both work great...</li>
            <li> It works great, is absorbent to the nth degree.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for laying on it.</li>
            <li> I use this towel at the gym and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Someone reccomended these towels for my husbands deployment on the USS Nimitz, and I am so happy they did.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very nice and come with a travel bag.  </li>
            <li> good quality with a very nice compact case.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for superior absorbency these are for you.</li>
            <li> &quot; that a good towell has.  </li>
            <li> This graphite color is really nice, and the loop (has a snap on it) is great.</li>
            <li> I am getting one for my mom and spreading the love!</li>
            <li> Now that we take lengthier trips in our travel trailer, I purchased two more Aquis Adventure towels in the XL size, just to \\&quot;spoil\\&quot; ourselves!  </li>
            <li> I mentioned before, I just LOVE these towels!  </li>
            <li> Although this is a nice towel and quality is great (love the handy carrying pouch)</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This towel is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again just because I don&#x27;t think I can justify $20+ for a towel AGAIN, but it was nice to try one.</li>
            <li> yet did not do as an effective job at drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice to have a non bulky but fully functional towel.</li>
            <li> Nice towel..</li>
            <li> Also liked the zip bag it came in, as well as the hang loop</li>
            <li> I really liked this towel, is quite practical</li>
            <li> The REI one isn&#x27;t as plastic-y feeling, but it isn&#x27;t as nice as this one.</li>
            <li> Very great quality and have held up like new for 5+ years.</li>
            <li> This towel is super absorbant and not bulky which makes it great for travel and storing.</li>
            <li> as far as quality -- just the best.</li>
            <li> this thing is perfect for whatever your needs are as far as a towel..</li>
            <li> Dries very quick!</li>
            <li> but it is pretty great still.</li>
            <li> I guess they win pretty</li>
            <li> This towel does really good, as good as normal</li>
            <li> I ordered more for the RV and for additional bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Thanks Aquis and Amazon for a great advance in towelage.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the smallest, most compact bath-sheet (29*55) sized towel to take on my adventures overseas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Egyptian cotton and Turkish cotton and although they may be more plush and luxurious I have to say Aquis towels are infinitely more absorbent.</li>
            <li> I really love these Aquis Towels.</li>
            <li> These Graphites don&#x27;t bleed, pills or fuzzes after many washers and driers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> doggies also love them when I used it as a blanket.</li>
            <li> Favorite towel to carry to the swimming pool.  </li>
            <li> I love these towels.  </li>
            <li> wish they could have more color choices&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love these towels.  </li>
            <li> We love these towels for camping.</li>
            <li> fast shipment, and this product is great.</li>
            <li> The more I use this towel, the more I dislike it.  </li>
            <li> The Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel seemed to get better reviews</li>
            <li> so I bought one and have been incredibly pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Nice light weight &amp; compact.  </li>
            <li> So I do more blotting with this towel than I do</li>
            <li> I love these and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Great for drying fast and shorter time in the dryer to save electricity.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and the size it perfect to wrap around my body and the material is soft.</li>
            <li> Great product, Super fast shipment</li>
            <li> I have other microfiber towels and this one has the best texture.</li>
            <li> After use it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> It admittedly doesn&#x27;t work as well as a standard bath towel on the first use, but if you have to deal with humid environments or don&#x27;t want to have to wash it often, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> extra large is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of these great towels.</li>
            <li> It has a dual purpose and is great for overall drying.</li>
            <li> They are also light but prefect weight.</li>
            <li> We wanted a towel that was absorbent, but light weight;This towel fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much because, unlike most &amp;#34;super-absorbent&amp;#34; towels, this one feels like cloth, not some kind of strange chamois cloth that smears the water around.</li>
            <li> My friend has a small Aquis towel and it works great!</li>
            <li> The towel is light, compact, and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> About a year ago, I finally decided to start bringing it to the Y (our Y doesn&#x27;t supply towels, which I think is WISE) to use as my primary post-swim workout towel -- ditching the bulkier terry variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very fast delivery, love the towel, dries very quick, no mold smell, we leave in Hawaii, towels get moldy over night, but not this one, now i use only this one after shower, i sure will get more.</li>
            <li> It folds very small and light, perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li> The sizes are great and they dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Super absorbent, fast drying and very light.</li>
            <li> This towel is great for curly hair - drying or using with wet hair while conditioning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true believer in microfiber towels</li>
            <li> Okay, let&#x27;s get it straight</li>
            <li> The material is soft and nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> Basically I bought two full sets for the bathroom:&lt;br /&gt;Bath</li>
            <li> I love these so much that I won&#x27;t get a shower without trying to find my towel.</li>
            <li> dries relatively quickly and it is lightweight.  </li>
            <li> AND dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries my skin and hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a quick drying towel I would recommend these even over the RAT towel because I like the texture.</li>
            <li> dries quickly after use.</li>
            <li> extra large is perfect for full body coverage and so far its survived the washer and dryer..</li>
            <li> Love this towel and highly recommend it to service members going overseas.</li>
            <li> They have more texture than the RAT towel but are very soft as well.  </li>
            <li> Simply put, I LOVE these towels!  </li>
            <li> Light weight, compact, SUPER absorbent, fast drying, and durable.  </li>
            <li> The little snap tab on the towel is great for hanging when a clothes line is not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good towel if you are traveling and won&#x27;t have a towel to use, but it&#x27;s definitely not extra large.</li>
            <li> The storage pouches are handy, and have been equally durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt; These towels may seem a bit pricey, but they are well worth it for their compact size, performance, and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was pricey, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Really nice, surprisingly big.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several travel towels out there and this is by far the best one because it actually feels more like a real towel.</li>
            <li> Nice and big and helps wick the water away.</li>
            <li> thing dries so quickly and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> it wicks away water quickly and feels like a real towel.  </li>
            <li> It is very absorbent though and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It warm enough cool nights and cool enough for hot summer nights here in S. Cal.</li>
            <li> The main problem is that it isn&#x27;t soft to the touch or satisfying to use.  </li>
            <li> Go with a more standard</li>
            <li> These towels texture seem more like a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; towel - they are definitely not the chamois feel.</li>
            <li> i keep it in my gym bag because of its compact size and it dries better than any regular bath</li>
            <li> Very convienent carrying case as well!</li>
            <li> is exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a pretty flexible product.</li>
            <li> Most on the market are on the smaller side, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I bought an REI travel towel a few years ago as a backup, and it doesn&#x27;t come close to as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Love this towels, they don&#x27;t occupy too much space, dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> worth noting is that this particular towel is not the same&lt;br /&gt;superfuzzy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Our four towels have endured many, many camping trips and washing cycles, yet they are not the least bit worn or tatty.  </li>
            <li> Great for vacations to the tropics, where cotton&lt;br /&gt;can take a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> is hardly a positive feature.  </li>
            <li> but i have had a smaller Aquis microfiber towel for more than ten years that i primarily use for travel.</li>
            <li> easy dry right</li>
            <li> so light, dry  super fast</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s rather large</li>
            <li> So far the cases that the towels come in are very handy, but question how long the zippers will last...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several travel towels out there and this is by far the best one because is soft, thin, light and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absorbent and dries fast.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t occupy much space @</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> really recommend this item</li>
            <li> We have a beach bag ready to go</li>
            <li> I really like the graphite color and convenient zipper pouch</li>
            <li> Do not take up much space, they come in a traveling pouch.</li>
            <li> real beauty in Aquis towels is that they are well made and that they soak up water like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> These towels are great for travel or everyday use - soft, absorbant, and dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I washed the towel only once so far (when I first got it) and with only one washing it is soft and feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> They dry very quickly too.</li>
            <li> They absorb a lot of water and dry very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The carrying case is nice to use around the house for other things but is impractical to keep putting the towel back into after the first washing.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as a regular towel.</li>
            <li> My family has been using these towels all over the world in our travels and they work great, standing up to harsh conditions without a single issue.</li>
            <li> The bonus is they dry quick!  </li>
            <li> They look, feel, and perform, just as they did when they were new!  </li>
            <li> Soaks up water much better than a standard terry cloth towel, dries faster, and packs smaller.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit big for backpacking, but it is nice to have the extra large size for drying off in mountain streams and even on regular days at the beach.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> The towel dries my dogs after swimming quickly, and the towels dry fast too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Liked the towel so much that when I came home I ditched my regular cotton large poofy towels which took up so much room</li>
            <li> They are very absorbent and soft.</li>
            <li> In fact, I like it so much that I have bought several more of these same towels in the smaller size so that I can stuff it in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size to cover half the body for me and dries faster than other towels</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> My son have them in college because they dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice item for the pool with enough space to accomodate a few extras, like my suit and swim mp3.</li>
            <li> These are thirsty towels that soak up moisture and dry quickly.</li>
            <li> and you can dry up quickly with it</li>
            <li> You only need to easily pat your self dry with none of the old buffing and wiping involved.</li>
            <li> this towel is definitely larger than the average towel and is more than sufficient ...</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 of them in the large size several YEARS ago - for use in our travels while car/tent camping, and for kayak camping.  </li>
            <li> I bought the extra large size (29\\&quot;</li>
            <li> They give the feeling of a soft cotton towel, vs. drying yourself with a pair of 1970&#x27;s polyester slacks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have the complete set</li>
            <li> It lacks the thickness and soft \\&quot;poofiness\\</li>
            <li> I do my makeup with my hair in the towel, and when I&#x27;m finished with the makeup, my hair is so much dryer than it would be with a traditional towel.</li>
            <li> Even though it is thin, the towel absorbs moisture quickly, drys quickly, and is soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> The size large towels have always been adequate to dry the average sized adult.  </li>
            <li> And still, after countless uses, and washings, they still look and feel brand new!  </li>
            <li> The comparable EMS towel is the same size, but thinner and the carrying pouch is about 1/3 the size of this particular towel.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing dries so quickly and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I love how small and low profile it is, yet it is so easy to dry off with and extremely convenient to tuck into a gym bag.</li>
            <li> Regular towels tend to not dry my hair very well and tend to take out the curls.  </li>
            <li> These towels are only mildly grabby, and once they start absorbing water, that slight tacky feel totally disappears.  </li>
            <li> Hang up the towel at night and  its bone dry in the AM, ready to be used again.</li>
            <li> Dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also recommend the Extra Large size as it&#x27;s the only one you can actually tie around your body when you get out of</li>
            <li> I have no regrets purchasing these towels.  </li>
            <li> Also found that when used if hung immediatly the towel dries extremely fast and does not leave that wet smell or any trace of it.</li>
            <li> I have other quick dry travel towels</li>
            <li> These were the only items that came back  in like new condition.  </li>
            <li> It is small and compact, but super absorbent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to properly dry off, is very absorbent, and doesn&#x27;t stay wet very long.</li>
            <li> It really cuts down the blowdrying time and also decreases the damage from blowdrying for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The extra large size is big enough for me to wrap around my body and tie like a normal towel, but it&#x27;s thin enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up much additional space in my bag.</li>
            <li> The towel is thin and easily packed not taking up any space at all.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing the Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel I read a lot of reviews about travel towels and many consumers complained that these towels, although they were compact and dried quickly, were too scratchy, stuck to your wet skin, and were not particularly comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> only reason this is 2 stars instead of 1 is that the towel does in fact work; it holds enough water to dry you off.  </li>
            <li> I like the grey color (shows less dirt), but I was surprised by how big this one was.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(including Aquis&#x27;s) that have become more common of late.  </li>
            <li> After I use it as a turban, there&#x27;s enough dry area on the towel to further dry my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they dry any faster then my regular beach towels.  </li>
            <li> I am currently deployed and was in need of an additional towel as laundry service here is limited.</li>
            <li> and they are the only dry off towels I use on my swimming dogs!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, it will not have the same feel as stepping into a fluffy bath towel just out of the shower but on the road, having a dry towel that&#x27;s ready to go at a moment&#x27;s notice and pack down into no space at all</li>
            <li> , I use it when I go to the gym, so I can get dry fast and it doesn&#x27;t require as much space as my other bulky towels, tough it is not really</li>
            <li> It folds down to a tiny burrito size, takes up no room in your bag, weighs next to nothing, but dries you off in one wipe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not only was it lightweight and compact, but after I showered long hair and all, it probably could have been used for one other person.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve found the bag pretty useless, but I guess you could hook it to side of your gym bag and keep the wet towel from getting everything else</li>
            <li> Dry yourself after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A towel which can be dry</li>
            <li> This towel takes longer than a day to dry (in Thailand).</li>
            <li> that I had just washed in the sink to soak up excess water before I hung them up to dry.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the fabric</li>
            <li> I use it on my horse to dry her coat in the winter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would not necessarily recommend these for use at home since the texture is less luxurious (not exactly abrasive but not soft/fuzzy either) than a traditional bath towel.</li>
            <li> When I step out of a shower and use the towel to dry off, I will hold it in two hands and rub down myself front and back.</li>
            <li> Even after two weeks of heavy use (2 showers daily), it stayed dry and did not smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You either have a dry but smelly body, or use other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready for microfiber underwear.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, we had expected a somewhat darker color.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to big fluffy towels that absorb 90% of the water off your body upon contact, this won&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> It feels too rough, like carpet.  </li>
            <li> I never really used it, thinking it was just to keep in the car for an emergency.  </li>
            <li> recomend it to take it to the gym, on a picnic or even to an amusement park where you can get wet.</li>
            <li> really wondered if it was only my problem, so I googled &amp;#34;Aquis Adventure smell&amp;#34; and found some similar unpleasant</li>
            <li> We use them for camping, hiking, going to the beach, and all other outdoor activities.</li>

            <li> It is a little sticky when drying off, but it does its job drying you off</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my third order of these great towels. Very great quality and have held up like new for 5+ years. I ordered more for the RV and for additional bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I like cotton a lot.  I&#x27;m not ready for microfiber underwear.&lt;br /&gt;But these towels are ideal for traveling - they&#x27;re lightweight&lt;br /&gt;and dry quickly.  Great for vacations to the tropics, where cotton&lt;br /&gt;can take a long time to dry.  Pool owners will also find them valuable.&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting is that this particular towel is not the same&lt;br /&gt;superfuzzy weave you may be used to from the smaller microfiber towels&lt;br /&gt;(including Aquis&#x27;s) that have become more common of late.  Believe it or not, it feels something like suede.  Thanks Aquis and Amazon for a great advance in towelage.</li>
            <li> We had a small microfiber towel that we used to wipe down the tile after a shower. We wanted a larger one. This towel is all that we expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, we had expected a somewhat darker color.</li>
            <li> My friend has a small Aquis towel and it works great! So, because I travel a lot I thought this would be the best thing to take along. It&#x27;s absorbent and dries fast.Thank you Aquis. mzdangler.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair and like to keep the curls when it&#x27;s dry.  Regular towels tend to not dry my hair very well and tend to take out the curls.  This towel is great for curly hair - drying or using with wet hair while conditioning.  I know it&#x27;s rather large but I like that.  After I use it as a turban, there&#x27;s enough dry area on the towel to further dry my hair so it&#x27;s perfect for drying with a diffuser.  I have not found a product even close to this in excellence.  I highly recommend it for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this towel is bath size so it can be used as a regular towel, not just for hair.  It has a dual purpose and is great for overall drying.</li>
            <li> Great investment. This towel is super absorbant and not bulky which makes it great for travel and storing. I am getting one for my mom and spreading the love!</li>
            <li> These towels are great! so light, dry  super fast and it doesn&#x27;t occupy much space @ all in your backpack!</li>
            <li> These towels can&#x27;t be beat for absorbency and durability - have been using them forever.  Luv them!!</li>
            <li> Great towel.  In hindsight, seems very expensive.</li>
            <li> This towel is amazing. I love how small and low profile it is, yet it is so easy to dry off with and extremely convenient to tuck into a gym bag. I was very skeptical to spend $20 on 1 towel but it is pretty great still. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again just because I don&#x27;t think I can justify $20+ for a towel AGAIN, but it was nice to try one. If the price was lowered I would probably stock up on a few of them.</li>
            <li> Love this towels, they don&#x27;t occupy too much space, dry quickly.  We take them for the trips on our boat.  My son have them in college because they dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Simply put, I LOVE these towels!  I purchased 4 of them in the large size several YEARS ago - for use in our travels while car/tent camping, and for kayak camping.  They suited our needs perfectly.  Light weight, compact, SUPER absorbent, fast drying, and durable.  The little snap tab on the towel is great for hanging when a clothes line is not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the texture of these towels.....  Many microfiber towels have that awful \\&quot;grabby\\&quot; feeling on the hands.......  These towels are only mildly grabby, and once they start absorbing water, that slight tacky feel totally disappears.  They give the feeling of a soft cotton towel, vs. drying yourself with a pair of 1970&#x27;s polyester slacks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our four towels have endured many, many camping trips and washing cycles, yet they are not the least bit worn or tatty.  They look, feel, and perform, just as they did when they were new!  The storage pouches are handy, and have been equally durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The size large towels have always been adequate to dry the average sized adult.  I have extremely long thick hair as well, and these towels soak up the water like sponges.  Now that we take lengthier trips in our travel trailer, I purchased two more Aquis Adventure towels in the XL size, just to \\&quot;spoil\\&quot; ourselves!  Our collection of 6 towels packs away compactly in our camper, hardly taking the space of ONE standard sized bath towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These towels may seem a bit pricey, but they are well worth it for their compact size, performance, and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2014:&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned before, I just LOVE these towels!  For the past two years I&#x27;ve been staying in our camper on-site as we build our cabin.  I&#x27;ve used these towels every day.  And still, after countless uses, and washings, they still look and feel brand new!  (I&#x27;ve owned the size lg. towels for 12 years, and the XL for 3 years)  I have no regrets purchasing these towels.  If they made &#x27;em in colors to match our cabin d&amp;eacute;cor, I&#x27;d have them in the house as well!r cabin d&amp;eacute;cor, I&#x27;d have them in the house as well!</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely fashion.  It folds very small and light, perfect for travel.  I have not used it yet, but it seems perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Even though it is thin, the towel absorbs moisture quickly, drys quickly, and is soft to the touch.  I&#x27;m a true believer in microfiber towels and I would highly recommend it to anyone because you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  In fact, I like it so much that I have bought several more of these same towels in the smaller size so that I can stuff it in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very nice and come with a travel bag.  The one tiny objection is why have a hard plastic snap on a towel?  No big deal to cut if off.  They didn&#x27;t have to try so hard.</li>
            <li> Okay, let&#x27;s get it straight, what do you want to do with a travel towel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Dry yourself after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES. This towel does really good, as good as normal towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. A towel which can be dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO. This towel takes longer than a day to dry (in Thailand). As a side note, weather today: Sunny. 75 degrees F (or 24 degrees C), humidity 89%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. A towel which doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY A TERRIBLE NO! This towel does smell, and it smells so awful and terrible that I could only give it one star. I have other quick dry travel towels and I compared them, this one smells, others don&#x27;t. One day I put this Aquis Adventure towel in a hotel room in Bangkok, when I came back, the whole room smelled like having ten dead rats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wondered if it was only my problem, so I googled &amp;#34;Aquis Adventure smell&amp;#34; and found some similar unpleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You either have a dry but smelly body, or use other product.</li>
            <li> I personally like the darker color for my muddy dogs (and keep the red for myself!) These towels are great for travel or everyday use - soft, absorbant, and dry quickly.</li>
            <li> My family has been using these towels all over the world in our travels and they work great, standing up to harsh conditions without a single issue. We use them for camping, hiking, going to the beach, and all other outdoor activities. They are a bit big for backpacking, but it is nice to have the extra large size for drying off in mountain streams and even on regular days at the beach. The carrying case is nice to use around the house for other things but is impractical to keep putting the towel back into after the first washing. We use the carrying case for rags and they work perfect.</li>
            <li> very fast delivery, love the towel, dries very quick, no mold smell, we leave in Hawaii, towels get moldy over night, but not this one, now i use only this one after shower, i sure will get more. Thank you...</li>
            <li> I was looking for the smallest, most compact bath-sheet (29*55) sized towel to take on my adventures overseas. Although this is a nice towel and quality is great (love the handy carrying pouch) it is double the size and triple the thickness of the comparable (XL) EMS towel. The thickness is what makes it too big-the size of the carrying pouch is not noted in the product description and neither is the thickness. The comparable EMS towel is the same size, but thinner and the carrying pouch is about 1/3 the size of this particular towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Egyptian cotton and Turkish cotton and although they may be more plush and luxurious I have to say Aquis towels are infinitely more absorbent. Amazing. If you&#x27;re looking for superior absorbency these are for you. They dry very quickly too.</li>
            <li> The material is soft and nice on the skin. I have other microfiber towels and this one has the best texture. It&#x27;s a good size to cover half the body for me and dries faster than other towels it&#x27;s size. It also has a loop in the corner so you can hang it off something.</li>
            <li> I really love these Aquis Towels. They are very absorbent and soft. They are also light but prefect weight. These Graphites don&#x27;t bleed, pills or fuzzes after many washers and driers.&lt;br /&gt;I would use them for hair and body but also sew few together as a small blanket. It warm enough cool nights and cool enough for hot summer nights here in S. Cal. You can use them anywhere. I have them in the bathroom, makeshift blanket, couple in the car and couple in doggies tote bag in case they get into a mess.&lt;br /&gt;My doggies also love them when I used it as a blanket. We would fight over them. I guess they win pretty all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they even have Doggie🐶 Aguis Towels with doggie paws in blue and red. My Aquis won&#x27;t be taken over from my doggies. I guess I will make doggie blanket for eat of them too.  :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquis get 5🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾paws&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> this is a great towel if you are traveling.  it wicks away water quickly and feels like a real towel.  dries relatively quickly and it is lightweight.  this towel is definitely larger than the average towel and is more than sufficient ...</li>
            <li> Favorite towel to carry to the swimming pool.  Not heavy.  Not bulky.  Dries fast.</li>
            <li> I love these towels.  I have the complete set and I use them for travel, camping and sports.  Super absorbent, fast drying and very light.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a camping trip and I was the only one who thought of bringing a towel. Not only was it lightweight and compact, but after I showered long hair and all, it probably could have been used for one other person. It was pricey, but well worth the money. I hope Aquis continues making quality towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked the towel so much that when I came home I ditched my regular cotton large poofy towels which took up so much room yet did not do as an effective job at drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Absorbant AND dries quickly. It is a little sticky when drying off, but it does its job drying you off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra large is the perfect size. Definitely a must</li>
            <li> Wonderful towel! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> use for swimming.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great item.  easy dry right weight!&lt;br /&gt;I wish they could have more color choices&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this item</li>
            <li> I do not like the chemical smell that these towels have.  I don&#x27;t think they dry any faster then my regular beach towels.  I would not buy again for this price.</li>
            <li> This towel gets you dry almost as well as a typical bath towel, but it is less than 25% of the size when folded up. I especially like the mesh bag it comes in- perfect for not getting nasty when it sits in your bag all day after the gym. Hang up the towel at night and  its bone dry in the AM, ready to be used again.</li>
            <li> This is a good towel if you are traveling and won&#x27;t have a towel to use, but it&#x27;s definitely not extra large. It is very absorbent though and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love these towels.  They absorb a lot of water and dry very quickly.  I wish Aquis would continue making this style towel.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Used it while on my trip to Europe. Compact but also does it&#x27;s job drying.</li>
            <li> I throw this towel in with my gym bag for the gyms I visit that don&#x27;t offer towels, and it works great. It is small and compact, but super absorbent. The extra large size is big enough for me to wrap around my body and tie like a normal towel, but it&#x27;s thin enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up much additional space in my bag. Perfect for my uses.</li>
            <li> This was bought for a daughter who will be in Asia for quite a while.  We wanted a towel that was absorbent, but light weight;This towel fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I bought this towel to replace my standard bathroom towels and for use while traveling. It admittedly doesn&#x27;t work as well as a standard bath towel on the first use, but if you have to deal with humid environments or don&#x27;t want to have to wash it often, it is perfect. It worked great in a dorm setting where the bathroom saw five showers a day, and in Southeast Asia during monsoon season.  Even after two weeks of heavy use (2 showers daily), it stayed dry and did not smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is because of its somewhat lackluster initial absorbency. If you&#x27;re used to big fluffy towels that absorb 90% of the water off your body upon contact, this won&#x27;t compare. But try using that towel again in the next 12 hours and you&#x27;ll be out of luck; that&#x27;s why you&#x27;d buy this microfiber towel.</li>
            <li> We love these towels for camping.</li>
            <li> fast shipment, and this product is great.</li>
            <li> Bought these for our camper in Graphite and Blueberry. The sizes are great and they dry quickly. Basically I bought two full sets for the bathroom:&lt;br /&gt;Bath 29x55&lt;br /&gt;Hand 15x29&lt;br /&gt;Wash Cloth 10x14</li>
            <li> The more I use this towel, the more I dislike it.  The main problem is that it isn&#x27;t soft to the touch or satisfying to use.  It feels too rough, like carpet.  It lacks the thickness and soft \\&quot;poofiness\\&quot; that a good towell has.  It feels like it isn&#x27;t drying you off well, even though it is.  Overall very annoying.  It also smells bad, after only a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this is 2 stars instead of 1 is that the towel does in fact work; it holds enough water to dry you off.  But don&#x27;t be fooled by the fancy talk of \\&quot;microfibers\\&quot;--this is hardly a positive feature.  Go with a more standard towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several travel towels out there and this is by far the best one because is soft, thin, light and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;This thing dries so quickly and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Keep in mind, it will not have the same feel as bath towel just out of the shower but on the road. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing the Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel I read a lot of reviews about travel towels and many consumers complained that these towels, although they were compact and dried quickly, were too scratchy, stuck to your wet skin, and were not particularly comfortable to use.  The Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel seemed to get better reviews so I bought one and have been incredibly pleased with it.  It has all of the positives and none of the negatives I read about.  The towel is light, compact, and dries quickly.  I washed the towel only once so far (when I first got it) and with only one washing it is soft and feels good on my skin.  It dries my skin and hair quickly.  I also used the towel to roll clothing (socks, t-shirts, etc.) that I had just washed in the sink to soak up excess water before I hung them up to dry.  I bought the extra large size (29\\&quot; x 55\\&quot;).  It folds into an accompanying mesh pouch, all of which measures 10\\&quot; x 10\\&quot; x 1\\&quot; (depth).  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife bought a small version of the Aquis Microfiber towel for me as a gift about 5 years ago.  I never really used it, thinking it was just to keep in the car for an emergency.  About a year ago, I finally decided to start bringing it to the Y (our Y doesn&#x27;t supply towels, which I think is WISE) to use as my primary post-swim workout towel -- ditching the bulkier terry variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, this thing is GREAT.  It folds down to a tiny burrito size, takes up no room in your bag, weighs next to nothing, but dries you off in one wipe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subsequently bought my wife two of these, including this larger size. She loves having a body towel and a hair towel, whereas she would have never wanted to bring two regular towels to the gym before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are great for travel. We have a beach bag ready to go and I got this to keep in there at all times.  Nice to have a non bulky but fully functional towel.</li>
            <li> Nice towel..good quality with a very nice compact case.Nice item for the pool with enough space to accomodate a few extras, like my suit and swim mp3. Great value for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product, Super fast shipment</li>
            <li> These towels texture seem more like a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; towel - they are definitely not the chamois feel. They have more texture than the RAT towel but are very soft as well.  If you are looking for a quick drying towel I would recommend these even over the RAT towel because I like the texture.</li>
            <li> This is a great towel if you are looking for something for your gym bag. It&#x27;s large enough to properly dry off, is very absorbent, and doesn&#x27;t stay wet very long.</li>
            <li> The towel dries my dogs after swimming quickly, and the towels dry fast too. I have 2 and they are the only dry off towels I use on my swimming dogs!</li>
            <li> I really like the graphite color and convenient zipper pouch it comes in for travel. If you&#x27;ve never used one of these microfiber towels, here&#x27;s how it works. You only need to easily pat your self dry with none of the old buffing and wiping involved. After use it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> These towels are perfect for traveling.  Do not take up much space, they come in a traveling pouch. The bonus is they dry quick!  They will be perfect for camping!</li>
            <li> Nice light weight &amp; compact.  Dried quickly.  Like the texture too.</li>
            <li> I take this and the Medium Aquis Towel with me to the gym each day and they both work great... So far the cases that the towels come in are very handy, but question how long the zippers will last...</li>
            <li> I have the white version of this product. It&#x27;s not called an Adventure towel, and there are a couple of differences: The white lisse crepe (or whatever it&#x27;s called) doesn&#x27;t have the loop for hanging that the Adventure towel has, and it doesn&#x27;t have the bag. So far I&#x27;ve found the bag pretty useless, but I guess you could hook it to side of your gym bag and keep the wet towel from getting everything else wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as far as quality -- just the best. These are thirsty towels that soak up moisture and dry quickly. I NEVER use fabric softener on these because I want them to stay as they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you should know that this is very different from a traditional bath towel in both the way it feels and the way it functions. When I step out of a shower and use the towel to dry off, I will hold it in two hands and rub down myself front and back. With a fluffy towel, that would work really well. With this towel, it is just weird because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; back and forth. So I do more blotting with this towel than I do rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real beauty in Aquis towels is that they are well made and that they soak up water like nobody&#x27;s business. They are absolutely wonderful for hair. I prefer this size to their smaller hair towel. I love these so much that I won&#x27;t get a shower without trying to find my towel. After the shower, I wrap my hair in this towel. I do my makeup with my hair in the towel, and when I&#x27;m finished with the makeup, my hair is so much dryer than it would be with a traditional towel. It really cuts down the blowdrying time and also decreases the damage from blowdrying for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I love these and will be purchasing more. This graphite color is really nice, and the loop (has a snap on it) is great. My only request to the company would be to make some even bigger size towels. And washcloths. And robes. Try it. You&#x27;ll see why I&#x27;m addicted. The fabric is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and practical travel towel with a case and hook loop to hang. Great for drying fast and shorter time in the dryer to save electricity. Not glamorous but efficient.</li>
            <li> excellent product. i keep it in my gym bag because of its compact size and it dries better than any regular bath towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I bought this towel as a gift but i have had a smaller Aquis microfiber towel for more than ten years that i primarily use for travel. It absorbs well, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as a regular towel. Love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect towel! Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the fabric dries quickly after use. Very convienent carrying case as well!</li>
            <li> Dries very quick! I use it on my horse to dry her coat in the winter. Also liked the zip bag it came in, as well as the hang loop/snap. I want another!</li>
            <li> I really liked this towel, is quite practical and you can dry up quickly with it, I use it when I go to the gym, so I can get dry fast and it doesn&#x27;t require as much space as my other bulky towels, tough it is not really cosy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it to take it to the gym, on a picnic or even to an amusement park where you can get wet.</li>
            <li> Perfect gym towel.  Has a strap so I can hang it on the hook.  It dries quickly and the size it perfect to wrap around my body and the material is soft.</li>
            <li> I am currently deployed and was in need of an additional towel as laundry service here is limited. I ordered this towel based on previous reviews. The towel is thin and easily packed not taking up any space at all. Also found that when used if hung immediatly the towel dries extremely fast and does not leave that wet smell or any trace of it. Love this towel and highly recommend it to service members going overseas.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t travel without it. Seriously, this thing dries so quickly and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Keep in mind, it will not have the same feel as stepping into a fluffy bath towel just out of the shower but on the road, having a dry towel that&#x27;s ready to go at a moment&#x27;s notice and pack down into no space at all is exactly what you want. This is that towel. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Really nice, surprisingly big.  I use it as a work out towel to cover the various benches and seats of work out equipment.  It works great, is absorbent to the nth degree.</li>
            <li> About 8 years ago, I bought the smaller, white version at a camping store. I loved it so much because, unlike most &amp;#34;super-absorbent&amp;#34; towels, this one feels like cloth, not some kind of strange chamois cloth that smears the water around. I bought an REI travel towel a few years ago as a backup, and it doesn&#x27;t come close to as good as this one. The REI one isn&#x27;t as plastic-y feeling, but it isn&#x27;t as nice as this one. I travel a lot, and brought this towel with me on every trip because it isn&#x27;t fluffy, and packs small. My wife let some visitors borrow it and they lost it, so I wanted to replace it. I like the grey color (shows less dirt), but I was surprised by how big this one was. So I cut it into three equal parts, hemmed along the edge so it wouldn&#x27;t fray, and now have three great towels!</li>
            <li> this thing is perfect for whatever your needs are as far as a towel..extra large is perfect for full body coverage and so far its survived the washer and dryer.. I WOULD recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several travel towels out there and this is by far the best one because it actually feels more like a real towel. I also recommend the Extra Large size as it&#x27;s the only one you can actually tie around your body when you get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty flexible product. I use it as a beach towel as well and it&#x27;s great for laying on it.</li>
            <li> I use this towel at the gym and it&#x27;s great.  Soaks up water much better than a standard terry cloth towel, dries faster, and packs smaller.  Easy to clean.  Comes with a built in / sewn on clip for hanging in a locker room or wherever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not necessarily recommend these for use at home since the texture is less luxurious (not exactly abrasive but not soft/fuzzy either) than a traditional bath towel.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a microfiber towel to aid in the drying process of dreadlocks. Most on the market are on the smaller side, but not this one. Nice and big and helps wick the water away.</li>
            <li> Someone reccomended these towels for my husbands deployment on the USS Nimitz, and I am so happy they did.  These were the only items that came back  in like new condition.  If you are a swimmer then these are perfect.</li>
