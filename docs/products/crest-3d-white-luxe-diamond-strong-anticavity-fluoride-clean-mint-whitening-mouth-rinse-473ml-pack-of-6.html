            <li>He wants me to buy more!</li>
            <li>The Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong Mouthwash was a welcome addition to my oral routine.</li>
            <li>I am a coffee drinker and was distrustful of any product that advertised that it could make teeth whiter, but this product did accomplish what it says the very first time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that I can whiten my teeth, freshen breath and remove plaque all at the same time with one product.  </li>
            <li>When using the mouthwash, I had a great white foam immediately.....</li>
            <li>This leaves a &#x27;secure&#x27; feel.</li>

            <li>The mouthwash makes breath fresh!</li>
            <li>:Well Worth It!</li>
            <li>I did notice a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter and they feel so clean after I use the mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Clean, minty taste is what I am after in a mouthwash.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>The flavor is not too strong but leaves your breath minty fresh.</li>
            <li>Swishing this in your mouth and through your teeth creates a mouth full of bubbles which makes everything feel clean, your gums, your teeth, your breath.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth bright and white.</li>
            <li>This product really cleans out and freshens your mouth beautifully for several hours.</li>
            <li>Upon using it, my teeth and mouth feel different, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>But I did enjoy the fresh feeling it leaves in your mouth.</li>
            <li>The mint was refreshing, not too intense.</li>
            <li>the rinse wasn&#x27;t overpowering and i could really feel it cleaning and refreshing my mouth.</li>
            <li>The taste is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:Clean and fresh</li>
            <li>The taste is fresh and clean tasting.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already starting to notice a difference after only a couple uses and the best part is, I don&#x27;t have to rinse a yucky film off my teeth!!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this mouthwash more so than traditional ones.</li>
            <li>It had a great minty taste that lasted a long period of time and made my whole mouth feel clean and tingly.</li>
            <li>very effective with positive results left mouth feeling fresh and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li>From first use until now, which is my 7th day, my teeth have never felt cleaner and my breath has never been so fresh!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what makes me come back for more!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using the Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong with Fluoride Mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling very clean and didn&#x27;t have a too strong taste.</li>
            <li>I am starting to see amazing results within 10 days of using the product.</li>
            <li>Overall it makes a nice mouthwash/freshener.</li>
            <li>and it makes my mouth feel really fresh.</li>
            <li>Made my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m a four cup a day coffee drinker, I need something stronger to whiten my smile.</li>
            <li>I definitely felt like it was effective and worth purchasing again.</li>
            <li>It has a great taste with no strong alcohol burn.</li>
            <li>it was a bit better than most other brands.</li>
            <li>however, it really didn&#x27;t seem to significantly brighten my smile.  </li>
            <li>The rinse tastes good, like other mouthwash.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel cleaner by each use and the flavor (mint) is just right for me.</li>
            <li>This is such a new an inventive way to keep your mouth healthy.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my mouth feel clean</li>
            <li>The thing I noticed the first morning was my mouth felt so fresh.  </li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling minty fresh and I am confident my teeth will be whiter.</li>
            <li>The one problem was that it made my mouth and gums feel hot after it had been in my mouth for about 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Since then I have been able to tolerate the strength of Crest 3D White and have noticed whiter teeth</li>
            <li>At first the taste and foam distract you, but after repeated use the product does freshen your breath and my teeth appeared whiter.</li>
            <li>While this mouthwash was minty and refreshing, I didn&#x27;t notice any obvious whitening effect.</li>
            <li>and it really is maintaining my teeth&#x27;s whiteness!</li>
            <li>How many products make that same claim?  </li>
            <li>but it sure keeps them white.</li>
            <li>In love with the Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-cavaty Whitening Mouth Rinse.  </li>
            <li>I like the convenience of having a whitening product in the mouthwash and felt the foaming quality of this product would help get the whitening power more evenly distributed throughout my entire mouth.</li>
            <li>After using twice a day as directed after brushing I found the mouthwash actually brightened my teeth some, had a great taste and left your mouth feeling refreshed with no strong burning, Nice flavor.</li>
            <li>It is clear and tastes like clean freshness.</li>
            <li>It was safe to use daily and easy to incorporate into my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I found less plaque formation and love the cool taste.</li>
            <li>My first time trying the Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong with Fluoride Mouthwash</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth becoming any whiter.</li>
            <li>Instead of the normal morning breath that you think you have, regardless of whether you do or not, my mouth was really fresh.  </li>
            <li>Plus I have such fresh, clean breath after use.</li>
            <li>The Crest 3D white brightened my teeth and made my mouth feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Left my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>;  could be a little more sweet, though.  </li>
            <li>one interesting thing though is that if you use this for a very long time, it can alter your sense of taste.  </li>
            <li>I liked the results of slightly whiter and brighter teeth</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong with Fluoride Mouthwash twice a day for about a week now</li>
            <li>The flavor alone would convince me to continue using Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong Fluoride Mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Many whitening products leave a gooey film on your teeth but this left my mouth with a fresh and crisp clean,just as it was a regular mouthwash, yet with the added benefit of whitening!!</li>
            <li>I found that I really like using this product.</li>
            <li>Overall whitening is not noticeable, however I enjoy it as a mouthwash.</li>
            <li>The product really works.</li>
            <li>I do not feel it whitened my teeth a whole lot</li>
            <li>I did give it four stars as it really burns my tongue.</li>
            <li>I would rinse my mouth out, so I don&#x27;t know if its really going to work as a tooth whitener</li>
            <li>I did not notice any real tooth whitening, though.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the milk like texture</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I found this product really helpful and it does work.</li>
            <li>It really whitens your teeth if you use it as instructed.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other fluoride mouthwashes, and was pleasantly surprised by the refreshing taste of Crest 3D!</li>
            <li>using twice a day is unnecessary and more of a sales promo to get us to use more.  </li>
            <li>This mouthwash was a double whammy where it kept my mouth very fresh without any burn and helped to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>but if it cost a lot more than other products, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to whiten all that</li>
            <li>I enjoyed product-testing this new dental rinse, but I did not particularly care for the taste.  </li>
            <li>The swishing actually makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>I also like the fresh taste it left in your mouth and how easy it was to follow instructions and to open the cap on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>the clean feeling enough to switch to this product</li>
            <li>Despite being a whitening product, it did make my teeth sensitive at all which is very unusual.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how the product made my teeth look the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge level of whitening, but I only used it for about a week so far.</li>
            <li>I was never able to swish it around for the full minute, but I did enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>And at one point my gums felt a tiny bit agitated but that went away quickly.</li>
            <li>it left my mouth feeling very refreshed and most importantly very cleaning felling and after a few uses i did notice a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who want to be rid of &amp;#34;morning mouth&amp;#34;, and have whiter teeth...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get a definite foaming, cleansing action while rinsing and the clean, freshness lasts over night until I brush again in the morning.</li>
            <li>It not only made my teeth look whiter but also kept my breath fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Also, the addition of fluoride is becoming more of a turn-off to consumers, so it is unlikely that I would purchase the product even as a non-whitening mouthwash.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful mouthwash that actually lives up to the advertising!</li>
            <li>Although this mouthwash is not an &amp;#34;instant fix&amp;#34; as far as whiteners go, it does help your mouth to feel clean and fresh, and I found that it does make my teeth appear a little brighter.</li>
            <li>After brushing [using Crest Bake/w peroxide] the 3D left a very clean feel for a long time afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really liked the noticeable but subtle whitening results I got too.</li>
            <li>flavor is a little strong (maybe that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>,it left my mouth feeling cleaner, fresher and it really makes the stains on your teeth disappear .</li>
            <li>It has also made my teeth appear to be much whiter so this is definitely a win-win.</li>
            <li>I used the entire bottle but didn&#x27;t really noticed any whitening of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I believe that this 3D White Luxe is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the taste.</li>
            <li>The Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-cavity Fluoride mouthwash really works.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Crest 3D White Luxe Mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I had a wow reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>I found this mouth wash to be less stingy than other mouth washes while providing a clean and fresh rinse.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but I enjoy the taste and the clean feeling it leaves in your mouth.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and compared to other mouth</li>
            <li>It is fresh, long lasting and does make a difference in appearance and health of your mouth.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t care for mouthwash because they always taste like medicine, but then I tried Crest 3D white</li>
            <li>The taste is strong and swishing for one minute is hard.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was that it had a stinging sensation; but other than that, it did a very good job!</li>
            <li>If you are going to try a new mouth wash, make it Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-Cavity with Fluoride!</li>
            <li>I felt it was working well to fight bad breath and provide a clean, fresh smile.</li>
            <li>The instructions were clear and simple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for three days so far, but I can tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>It was not strong tasting and did not have that powerful alcohol taste that a lot of mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li>Like that this contains no alcohol and therefore no dry mouth afterwards.</li>
            <li>On my first use of the product I was a little taken aback with the foaming that occurs when using this product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The taste wasn&#x27;t too strong and it was easy to use.  </li>

            <li> He wants me to buy more!</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong Mouthwash was a welcome addition to my oral routine.</li>
            <li> I am a coffee drinker and was distrustful of any product that advertised that it could make teeth whiter, but this product did accomplish what it says the very first time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that I can whiten my teeth, freshen breath and remove plaque all at the same time with one product.  </li>
            <li> When using the mouthwash, I had a great white foam immediately.....</li>
            <li> This leaves a &#x27;secure&#x27; feel.</li>

            <li> :Well Worth It!</li>

            <li> My teeth are whiter and they feel so clean after I use the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Clean, minty taste is what I am after in a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> The flavor is not too strong but leaves your breath minty fresh.</li>
            <li> Swishing this in your mouth and through your teeth creates a mouth full of bubbles which makes everything feel clean, your gums, your teeth, your breath.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth bright and white.</li>
            <li> This product really cleans out and freshens your mouth beautifully for several hours.</li>
            <li> Upon using it, my teeth and mouth feel different, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> But I did enjoy the fresh feeling it leaves in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The mint was refreshing, not too intense.</li>
            <li> the rinse wasn&#x27;t overpowering and i could really feel it cleaning and refreshing my mouth.</li>
            <li> The taste is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :Clean and fresh</li>
            <li> The taste is fresh and clean tasting.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already starting to notice a difference after only a couple uses and the best part is, I don&#x27;t have to rinse a yucky film off my teeth!!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this mouthwash more so than traditional ones.</li>
            <li> It had a great minty taste that lasted a long period of time and made my whole mouth feel clean and tingly.</li>
            <li> very effective with positive results left mouth feeling fresh and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li> From first use until now, which is my 7th day, my teeth have never felt cleaner and my breath has never been so fresh!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what makes me come back for more!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using the Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong with Fluoride Mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling very clean and didn&#x27;t have a too strong taste.</li>
            <li> I am starting to see amazing results within 10 days of using the product.</li>
            <li> Overall it makes a nice mouthwash/freshener.</li>
            <li> and it makes my mouth feel really fresh.</li>
            <li> Made my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m a four cup a day coffee drinker, I need something stronger to whiten my smile.</li>
            <li> I definitely felt like it was effective and worth purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It has a great taste with no strong alcohol burn.</li>
            <li> it was a bit better than most other brands.</li>
            <li> however, it really didn&#x27;t seem to significantly brighten my smile.  </li>
            <li> The rinse tastes good, like other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel cleaner by each use and the flavor (mint) is just right for me.</li>
            <li> This is such a new an inventive way to keep your mouth healthy.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my mouth feel clean</li>
            <li> The thing I noticed the first morning was my mouth felt so fresh.  </li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling minty fresh and I am confident my teeth will be whiter.</li>
            <li> The one problem was that it made my mouth and gums feel hot after it had been in my mouth for about 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> Since then I have been able to tolerate the strength of Crest 3D White and have noticed whiter teeth</li>
            <li> At first the taste and foam distract you, but after repeated use the product does freshen your breath and my teeth appeared whiter.</li>
            <li> While this mouthwash was minty and refreshing, I didn&#x27;t notice any obvious whitening effect.</li>
            <li> and it really is maintaining my teeth&#x27;s whiteness!</li>
            <li> How many products make that same claim?  </li>
            <li> but it sure keeps them white.</li>
            <li> In love with the Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-cavaty Whitening Mouth Rinse.  </li>
            <li> I like the convenience of having a whitening product in the mouthwash and felt the foaming quality of this product would help get the whitening power more evenly distributed throughout my entire mouth.</li>
            <li> After using twice a day as directed after brushing I found the mouthwash actually brightened my teeth some, had a great taste and left your mouth feeling refreshed with no strong burning, Nice flavor.</li>
            <li> It is clear and tastes like clean freshness.</li>
            <li> It was safe to use daily and easy to incorporate into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I found less plaque formation and love the cool taste.</li>
            <li> My first time trying the Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong with Fluoride Mouthwash</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth becoming any whiter.</li>
            <li> Instead of the normal morning breath that you think you have, regardless of whether you do or not, my mouth was really fresh.  </li>
            <li> Plus I have such fresh, clean breath after use.</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D white brightened my teeth and made my mouth feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Left my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> ;  could be a little more sweet, though.  </li>
            <li> one interesting thing though is that if you use this for a very long time, it can alter your sense of taste.  </li>
            <li> I liked the results of slightly whiter and brighter teeth</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong with Fluoride Mouthwash twice a day for about a week now</li>
            <li> The flavor alone would convince me to continue using Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong Fluoride Mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Many whitening products leave a gooey film on your teeth but this left my mouth with a fresh and crisp clean,just as it was a regular mouthwash, yet with the added benefit of whitening!!</li>
            <li> I found that I really like using this product.</li>
            <li> Overall whitening is not noticeable, however I enjoy it as a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The product really works.</li>
            <li> I do not feel it whitened my teeth a whole lot</li>
            <li> I did give it four stars as it really burns my tongue.</li>
            <li> I would rinse my mouth out, so I don&#x27;t know if its really going to work as a tooth whitener</li>
            <li> I did not notice any real tooth whitening, though.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the milk like texture</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I found this product really helpful and it does work.</li>
            <li> It really whitens your teeth if you use it as instructed.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other fluoride mouthwashes, and was pleasantly surprised by the refreshing taste of Crest 3D!</li>
            <li> using twice a day is unnecessary and more of a sales promo to get us to use more.  </li>
            <li> This mouthwash was a double whammy where it kept my mouth very fresh without any burn and helped to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> but if it cost a lot more than other products, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to whiten all that</li>
            <li> I enjoyed product-testing this new dental rinse, but I did not particularly care for the taste.  </li>
            <li> The swishing actually makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> I also like the fresh taste it left in your mouth and how easy it was to follow instructions and to open the cap on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> the clean feeling enough to switch to this product</li>
            <li> Despite being a whitening product, it did make my teeth sensitive at all which is very unusual.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how the product made my teeth look the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge level of whitening, but I only used it for about a week so far.</li>
            <li> I was never able to swish it around for the full minute, but I did enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> And at one point my gums felt a tiny bit agitated but that went away quickly.</li>
            <li> it left my mouth feeling very refreshed and most importantly very cleaning felling and after a few uses i did notice a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who want to be rid of &amp;#34;morning mouth&amp;#34;, and have whiter teeth...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get a definite foaming, cleansing action while rinsing and the clean, freshness lasts over night until I brush again in the morning.</li>
            <li> It not only made my teeth look whiter but also kept my breath fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Also, the addition of fluoride is becoming more of a turn-off to consumers, so it is unlikely that I would purchase the product even as a non-whitening mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful mouthwash that actually lives up to the advertising!</li>
            <li> Although this mouthwash is not an &amp;#34;instant fix&amp;#34; as far as whiteners go, it does help your mouth to feel clean and fresh, and I found that it does make my teeth appear a little brighter.</li>
            <li> After brushing [using Crest Bake/w peroxide] the 3D left a very clean feel for a long time afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really liked the noticeable but subtle whitening results I got too.</li>
            <li> flavor is a little strong (maybe that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> ,it left my mouth feeling cleaner, fresher and it really makes the stains on your teeth disappear .</li>
            <li> It has also made my teeth appear to be much whiter so this is definitely a win-win.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle but didn&#x27;t really noticed any whitening of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I believe that this 3D White Luxe is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the taste.</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-cavity Fluoride mouthwash really works.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Crest 3D White Luxe Mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I had a wow reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I found this mouth wash to be less stingy than other mouth washes while providing a clean and fresh rinse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but I enjoy the taste and the clean feeling it leaves in your mouth.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh and compared to other mouth</li>
            <li> It is fresh, long lasting and does make a difference in appearance and health of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t care for mouthwash because they always taste like medicine, but then I tried Crest 3D white</li>
            <li> The taste is strong and swishing for one minute is hard.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was that it had a stinging sensation; but other than that, it did a very good job!</li>
            <li> If you are going to try a new mouth wash, make it Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-Cavity with Fluoride!</li>
            <li> I felt it was working well to fight bad breath and provide a clean, fresh smile.</li>
            <li> The instructions were clear and simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for three days so far, but I can tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> It was not strong tasting and did not have that powerful alcohol taste that a lot of mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li> Like that this contains no alcohol and therefore no dry mouth afterwards.</li>
            <li> On my first use of the product I was a little taken aback with the foaming that occurs when using this product.</li>
            <li> When I first began using Crest 3D White I found it to be a little harsh</li>
            <li> I did feel a little stinging in my mouth the first few times and could not keep it my mouth for the directed time.</li>
            <li> and i could see the whitening effects as long as you use it twice a day as directed.</li>
            <li> I used it for several weeks and never really did notice any whitening (although when I started using the product I literally had just been to the dentist for my 6 month cleaning).  </li>
            <li> The mouthwash is long lasting - it made my mouth feel fresher and cleaner longer than any other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> i tried this product thinking it would be the same as other brands.</li>
            <li> I think it left my mouth feeling cleaner than any other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any whitening yet, but I haven&#x27;t been using it very long.</li>
            <li> I was unable to rinse for the full amount of time because of this.  </li>
            <li> A few days before finishing the bottle, I went to the dentist for my regular 6-month check and asked him about these products.  </li>
            <li> Eliminate bad breath better than other mouthwash brands.</li>
            <li> I understand 15 minutes but 30 is a long time since half the usage is in the morning.</li>
            <li> However, I notice a brilliance and Whiteness to my teeth after only a few days of using it 2X/day!</li>
            <li> Not sure yet whether it is whitening as have only used for 4 days.</li>
            <li> at least whitens and freshens at the same time.</li>
            <li> The only negative was the bottle was a little hard to open.</li>
            <li> My mouth seems cleaner in the morning, however there is a slight peroxide aftertaste.</li>
            <li> and I do see a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that my teeth are slightly whiter since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that burning feeling like I did with other whitening products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> but I found that towards the end of the rinsing, it became a little to foamy and was a little over powering at that point.</li>
            <li> It tastes a little like medicine with a heavy mint taste.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have noticed since using this, I do not like the taste of peppermint hard candies (like candy canes or the hard candy mints).  </li>
            <li> It is light in taste and when you finish it does not leave a lasting nasty taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth look whiter just in the few weeks</li>
            <li> Not a strong taste or flavor.  </li>
            <li> Was not easy swishing between teeth for 60 seconds as directed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked mouthwash that either (i) burned when I used it; (ii) tasted like alcohol; or (iii) overwhelmed my senses!</li>
            <li> I have had problems with whitening products causing irritation in the past, but had NO problems or sensitivity with this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this for the past week, and can see a difference...</li>
            <li> Not particularly fond of the taste which made it a little difficult to go the recommended 1 minute.</li>
            <li> He stated that he has never seen any dramatic results from over the counter whiteners, and that hydrogen peroxide loses its effectiveness after about half a bottle.  </li>
            <li> So, this is an expensive mouthwash that produces very little, if any, whitening of the teeth.</li>
            <li> When first using this mouthwash, I found the taste wasn&#x27;t bad, but after I spit it out the taste got to be annoying.</li>
            <li> Â &lt;br /&gt;I am always skeptical when a product claims to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> a weird aftertaste</li>
            <li> but i was very wrong indeed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works good, cleans well too, you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. It not only made my teeth look whiter but also kept my breath fresh all day. I found less plaque formation and love the cool taste. Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve  tried yet.</li>
            <li> This  is the best oral rinse on the market, it foams up great to clean all around your teeth and has just the right amount of sting to let you know its killing germs.</li>
            <li> I have tried other fluoride mouthwashes, and was pleasantly surprised by the refreshing taste of Crest 3D! I enjoyed the taste and the fresh feel of my mouth!</li>
            <li> The thing I noticed the first morning was my mouth felt so fresh.  Instead of the normal morning breath that you think you have, regardless of whether you do or not, my mouth was really fresh.  Swishing this in your mouth and through your teeth creates a mouth full of bubbles which makes everything feel clean, your gums, your teeth, your breath.  The only thing I have noticed since using this, I do not like the taste of peppermint hard candies (like candy canes or the hard candy mints).  I drink a lot of coffee, 2-3 cups a day and I noticed an improvement within 10 days of brighter looking teeth.</li>
            <li> My first time trying the Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong with Fluoride Mouthwash and I have to say this product is amazing,it left my mouth feeling cleaner, fresher and it really makes the stains on your teeth disappear .</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t care for mouthwash because they always taste like medicine, but then I tried Crest 3D white and I finally found one that I like. This is very refreshing and it makes my mouth feel like it really is clean. It has also made my teeth appear to be much whiter so this is definitely a win-win.</li>
            <li> On my first use of the product I was a little taken aback with the foaming that occurs when using this product. I can definitely tell it is working. I have used this product for several days and can tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this mouthwash. My teeth feel clean, my breath is great, but I see no difference in whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I found that I really like using this product. It makes my teeth feel cleaner by each use and the flavor (mint) is just right for me.</li>
            <li> Actually works! Not a big fan of the taste but you only have to deal with it for 60 seconds. Actually does whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash had a really nice after taste after using it. The one problem was that it made my mouth and gums feel hot after it had been in my mouth for about 20 seconds. I was never able to swish it around for the full minute, but I did enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Works excellent and doesn&#x27;t harm gums since it is alcohol free. I don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t eat or drink anything for 30 minutes after use. I understand 15 minutes but 30 is a long time since half the usage is in the morning.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle but didn&#x27;t really noticed any whitening of my teeth. It has a nice minty taste but I don&#x27;t care for the peroxide aftertaste. It continues to foam a bit in your mouth after you spit the rinse out.  Overall it makes a nice mouthwash/freshener.</li>
            <li> This does help whiten teeth somewhat.  The taste isn&#x27;t the greatest though!</li>
            <li> Great product and no harsh chemical taste whatsoever.  I used the cap as a cup to try and guess how much I was using but after a few months of use I had no problems with the product and can recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Like The Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-cavity Fluoride Mouth wash!  Not a strong taste or flavor.  Noticed whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong with Fluoride Mouthwash twice a day for about a week now and I have to say I&#x27;m really impressed by the results so far. My teeth are whiter and they feel so clean after I use the mouthwash. Plus I have such fresh, clean breath after use. I don&#x27;t get that burning feeling like I did with other whitening products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I found that the mouthwash gave me brighter, whiter teeth AND it reduced my sensitivity! It also made my teeth feel like I had just stepped out of the dentist chair. Loved this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I finished off a bottle of this and could tell no difference in the appearance of my teeth.  A few days before finishing the bottle, I went to the dentist for my regular 6-month check and asked him about these products.  He stated that he has never seen any dramatic results from over the counter whiteners, and that hydrogen peroxide loses its effectiveness after about half a bottle.  So, this is an expensive mouthwash that produces very little, if any, whitening of the teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought it was great. Was able to gargle for a full minute. Keeps my teeth bright and white. Keeps the tea stains off.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t Burn</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly impressed with this product. Many whitening products leave a gooey film on your teeth but this left my mouth with a fresh and crisp clean,just as it was a regular mouthwash, yet with the added benefit of whitening!! I&#x27;m already starting to notice a difference after only a couple uses and the best part is, I don&#x27;t have to rinse a yucky film off my teeth!! Great, crisp and effective product that I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> You always see whitening toothpaste and now this great new mouthwash add additional whitening power!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash works great! From first use until now, which is my 7th day, my teeth have never felt cleaner and my breath has never been so fresh! You get a definite foaming, cleansing action while rinsing and the clean, freshness lasts over night until I brush again in the morning. I only gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth becoming any whiter.</li>
            <li> I found this mouth wash to be less stingy than other mouth washes while providing a clean and fresh rinse. My mouth seems cleaner in the morning, however there is a slight peroxide aftertaste. Overall whitening is not noticeable, however I enjoy it as a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The product really works. My teeth look so much better than they did. I use it everyday. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> After reading the label I was already sold on the many benefits and then when I tried it and loved the after taste and the refreshing way my mouth tasted a d how clean it felt -- I just wanted to lick my teeth!</li>
            <li> After using twice a day as directed after brushing I found the mouthwash actually brightened my teeth some, had a great taste and left your mouth feeling refreshed with no strong burning, Nice flavor.</li>
            <li> Not only did I test this product before it came out on the market but I am also still using it! I use this in conjunction with the toothpaste &amp; the results have been amazing. I will continue to use the product to reap the rewards &amp; because there is no tooth sensitivity!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It is clear and tastes like clean freshness. I like that it is refreshing and easy to use any time of day.</li>
            <li> I like how clean your mouth feels, but the aftertaste of the mouthwash isn&#x27;t as refreshing as I&#x27;d like. Clean, minty taste is what I am after in a mouthwash. That&#x27;s what makes me come back for more!</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White, I love it improved on my dazzling smile, made my teeth feel just as refreshed and clean as when I used ACT.  It gives you  a fizzy mouth freshening feel and i could see the whitening effects as long as you use it twice a day as directed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked mouthwash that either (i) burned when I used it; (ii) tasted like alcohol; or (iii) overwhelmed my senses! This one does none of those things. My mouth feels clean and refreshed. The swishing actually makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> This is a pleasant alternative to stronger tasting mouthwashes that can be overwhelming. I seldom use mouthwash because it is so strong, but I like the flavor of this one.</li>
            <li> I really liked the taste in my mouth and the freshness I felt after using this product. I felt it was working well to fight bad breath and provide a clean, fresh smile. I do not feel it whitened my teeth a whole lot but did have my son use it and his teeth did whiten up quite well. He wants me to buy more!</li>
            <li> This fluoride mouth rinse was very refreshing. The flavor is not too strong but leaves your breath minty fresh. The instructions were clear and simple.</li>
            <li> Both myself and my fiancÃ© used the product for a week. I can visibly see the difference on his whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has a great minty taste. Despite being a whitening product, it did make my teeth sensitive at all which is very unusual. I did give it four stars as it really burns my tongue. And after spitting it out, it continues to foam. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s the peroxide doing it&#x27;s job?</li>
            <li> When I first began using Crest 3D White I found it to be a little harsh, it made my tongue burn. Since then I have been able to tolerate the strength of Crest 3D White and have noticed whiter teeth and it makes my mouth feel really fresh.</li>
            <li> The flavor alone would convince me to continue using Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong Fluoride Mouthwash. However, I notice a brilliance and Whiteness to my teeth after only a few days of using it 2X/day!</li>
            <li> very effective with positive results left mouth feeling fresh and rejuvenating. I recommend trying it out for yourslf</li>
            <li> This is a great mouthwash, it leaves your mouth feeling clean fresh and invigorated.It has a great taste with no strong alcohol burn. The taste is a longer than normal and very effective&lt;br /&gt;Headline:Clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using the Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong with Fluoride Mouthwash.  The taste wasn&#x27;t too strong and it was easy to use.  I also like the fresh taste it left in your mouth and how easy it was to follow instructions and to open the cap on the bottle.  I am starting to see amazing results within 10 days of using the product.</li>
            <li> It was a good taste and wasn&#x27;t too intense. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge level of whitening, but I only used it for about a week so far.</li>
            <li> Â &lt;br /&gt;I am always skeptical when a product claims to whiten teeth. This product, however, has made me rethink my position. I believe that this 3D White Luxe is the real deal. Upon using it, my teeth and mouth feel different, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> The mouthwash grows on you over time. At first the taste and foam distract you, but after repeated use the product does freshen your breath and my teeth appeared whiter.</li>
            <li> Made my mouth feel fresh. Was not easy swishing between teeth for 60 seconds as directed. But to use as an occasional mouthwash I would recommend. It was not strong tasting and did not have that powerful alcohol taste that a lot of mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is great. I could see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after a few uses. It had a great minty taste that lasted a long period of time and made my whole mouth feel clean and tingly. The only negative was the bottle was a little hard to open.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash makes teeth sparkle and helps whiten them. The mouthwash makes breath fresh!</li>
            <li> This product has a very strong taste. It tastes a little like medicine with a heavy mint taste. I was surprised by the taste. Not sure yet whether it is whitening as have only used for 4 days. Great breath freshener.</li>
            <li> When first using this mouthwash, I found the taste wasn&#x27;t bad, but after I spit it out the taste got to be annoying. I would rinse my mouth out, so I don&#x27;t know if its really going to work as a tooth whitener</li>
            <li> While this mouthwash was minty and refreshing, I didn&#x27;t notice any obvious whitening effect. Also, the addition of fluoride is becoming more of a turn-off to consumers, so it is unlikely that I would purchase the product even as a non-whitening mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I  was sent the Crest Diamond Mouthwash  free from Shopper&#x27;s Army try and review  mission, I loved the taste of the mouthwash and felt its&#x27; effects of having a clean and refreshed feeling. I use this now as a part of my dental routine, and only do so from having tried this before buying it from the store. i would recommend the Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-cavity Fluoride Mouthwash. It is refreshing and helps in promoting a more whiter, and cleaner mouth.</li>
            <li> I love this product, It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean.  The bubbles make your mouth feel refreshed sparkling clean!</li>
            <li> Eliminate bad breath better than other mouthwash brands.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this I liked the results of slightly whiter and brighter teeth but the flavor was off for me. a weird aftertaste</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong Mouthwash was a welcome addition to my oral routine. It left my mouth feeling minty fresh and I am confident my teeth will be whiter. The fluoride will help keep my teeth strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> Awesome, instant results with this product!  In fact, it is so good that I found my husband sneaking into my bathroom to use it~!  We are into beautiful smiles!  This is easy to use and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for three days so far, but I can tell it&#x27;s working. The taste isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> love that it dsnt have alcohol.  flouride is always good for my teeth. flavor is a little strong (maybe that&#x27;s good0  but not objectionable;  could be a little more sweet, though.  using twice a day is unnecessary and more of a sales promo to get us to use more.  overpriced-  think that it would be a better buy at $3-4.</li>
            <li> Like that this contains no alcohol and therefore no dry mouth afterwards. Also like that my teeth look whiter after just four to five uses. It&#x27;s great that I can whiten my teeth, freshen breath and remove plaque all at the same time with one product.  I have been using the product for a while now and it really is maintaining my teeth&#x27;s whiteness!</li>
            <li> Although this mouthwash is not an &amp;#34;instant fix&amp;#34; as far as whiteners go, it does help your mouth to feel clean and fresh, and I found that it does make my teeth appear a little brighter. Mostly, I feel it working to keep my teeth strong and healthy, which is the most important thing!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is the BEST! It not only whitens your teeth, it freshens your breath and just makes your whole mouth feel and smell great!  I would suggest this product for anyone that is looking for great results!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed product-testing this new dental rinse, but I did not particularly care for the taste.  I was unable to rinse for the full amount of time because of this.  I did not notice any real tooth whitening, though.  However, I did like the fact that this rinse is supposed to strengthen tooth enamel.  How many products make that same claim?  I have purchased it for my family in the hopes that it will improve our dental health.</li>
            <li> I found that the mouthwash did whiten my teeth some. The taste is strong and swishing for one minute is hard. Kind of burns mouth. I don&#x27;t know if I believe that it is strengthening enamel which would be the most important thing to me. Does not come with a measuring cup which would be nice to ensure correct amount is being used.</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful user of ACT (as our well water is not fluoridated) upon our dentist&#x27;s suggestion.  This is just as refreshing and provides all the elements of ACT, but is also a whitener.  I like the fizzing, bubbling, and cleansing sensation I get with this Crest product and feel these actions are an indication of the product&#x27;s effectiveness.  I am now a faithful customer.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful mouthwash that actually lives up to the advertising! It is fresh, long lasting and does make a difference in appearance and health of your mouth. It tastes great and leaves a super fresh feeling and confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Headline:Well Worth It!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product. I like to use mouthwash after brushing my teeth and this one was really good. It had a great taste and was very easy to use. I thought it was great being able to just swish the product around for a minute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and I do see a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and clean. I don&#x27;t really like the milk like texture I would like it to be thinner.</li>
            <li> I found that it did noticeably whiten my teeth, without any sensitivity. I have had problems with whitening products causing irritation in the past, but had NO problems or sensitivity with this product.</li>
            <li> This product really helped whiten my teeth and make them feel fresh!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and liked it very much good step in the 21st century</li>
            <li> Pleasant taste, easy to use. I did feel a little stinging in my mouth the first few times and could not keep it my mouth for the directed time. After I got use to it . The feeling was fine. Took about a week before I noticed the whitening working.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash was a double whammy where it kept my mouth very fresh without any burn and helped to whiten my teeth. It was safe to use daily and easy to incorporate into my daily routine. I love it</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s not perfect, but I enjoy the taste and the clean feeling it leaves in your mouth. I hadn&#x27;t noticed (in only 1 week) any whitening effect. And at one point my gums felt a tiny bit agitated but that went away quickly. I&#x27;m guessing my mouth &amp;#34;adjusted&amp;#34; to some ingredient I wasn&#x27;t used to using.  I used it for several weeks and never really did notice any whitening (although when I started using the product I literally had just been to the dentist for my 6 month cleaning).  Depending on price I would buy and use this product again.  I like the taste enough and the clean feeling enough to switch to this product but if it cost a lot more than other products, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to whiten all that well, I wouldn&#x27;t spend the extra money.  But I did enjoy the fresh feeling it leaves in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a great maintenance program. It does not make them whiter but it sure keeps them white.</li>
            <li> Have used this for the past week, and can see a difference...my teeth are whiter! The taste is fresh and clean tasting. I have confidence that my teeth are becoming stronger and the fluoride is working as stated. In love with the Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-cavaty Whitening Mouth Rinse.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who want to be rid of &amp;#34;morning mouth&amp;#34;, and have whiter teeth...</li>
            <li> This is a great mouthwash. It left my mouth feeling very clean and didn&#x27;t have a too strong taste. I have not noticed any whitening yet, but I haven&#x27;t been using it very long. I will continue to use this and hope for the added benefit of whitening along with a cleaner healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of having a whitening product in the mouthwash and felt the foaming quality of this product would help get the whitening power more evenly distributed throughout my entire mouth. The mint was refreshing, not too intense. I really liked the noticeable but subtle whitening results I got too.</li>
            <li> this product made my mouth feel cleaner and my teeth had an awesome feel to it after using this product</li>
            <li> I found this product really helpful and it does work. My mouth felt clean and fresh. My teeth felt cleaner and stayed cleaner even after drinking coffee,,&lt;br /&gt;Headline:great taste, great feeling and it works</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my teeth once I have finished with the mouthwash. Use after brushing and flossing, the foam is great.</li>
            <li> The mouth rinse claims to aid in whitening and strengthening (via fluoride) of teeth. Having used it twice a day â€‹for over a month, I am able to say my teeth do appear whiter.  The rinse tastes good, like other mouthwash. One does have the great sense of a clean mouth and breath.  Stronger teeth is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Wow...what can I say but, this product does what it says it does. I noticed my teeth look whiter just in the few weeks it&#x27;s been used. My mouth feels fresh and compared to other mouth wash this one at least whitens and freshens at the same time.</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-cavity Fluoride mouthwash really works.  It really whitens your teeth if you use it as instructed.  I took a photograph of my teeth before using this and took another after.  I did notice a significant difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  Especially since I am a coffee drinker.  It is able to take of years of coffee stains on your teeth.  The taste is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one interesting thing though is that if you use this for a very long time, it can alter your sense of taste.  I recommend using it until your teeth are white, then take a break until you need it again.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Luxe Diamond Strong with Flouride Mouthwash is great! I love the way it tastes and how it feels in my mouth when using. My mouth feels cleaner, my breath fells fresher, and I am noticing a brightness to my teeth that was not there before.</li>
            <li> i tried this product thinking it would be the same as other brands. but i was very wrong indeed. it was a bit better than most other brands. the rinse wasn&#x27;t overpowering and i could really feel it cleaning and refreshing my mouth. it left my mouth feeling very refreshed and most importantly very cleaning felling and after a few uses i did notice a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how the product made my teeth look the first time I used it. I am a coffee drinker and was distrustful of any product that advertised that it could make teeth whiter, but this product did accomplish what it says the very first time!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this mouthwash more so than traditional ones. It is light in taste and when you finish it does not leave a lasting nasty taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Crest 3D rinse helped to brighten my teeth. It has flouride to help prevent cavities. I feel in time my teeth will become whiter with the use of this rinse.</li>
            <li> I really like the Crest 3D White Luxe Mouthwash. It really makes my mouth feel clean and I noticed that my teeth are slightly whiter since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> When using the mouthwash, I had a great white foam immediately.....however, it really didn&#x27;t seem to significantly brighten my smile.  Because I&#x27;m a four cup a day coffee drinker, I need something stronger to whiten my smile.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it tasted, It has a pleasant taste. It did whiten my teeth some but I found that towards the end of the rinsing, it became a little to foamy and was a little over powering at that point.</li>
            <li> The Crest 3D white brightened my teeth and made my mouth feel fresh and clean.  I highly recommend trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;It freshens your breath while making your teeth whiter.  It is especially good for coffee and tea drinkers by keeping your teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;Try it today and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reached an age and condition [lots of medications] where I take extra attention to my teeth and oral care.  After brushing [using Crest Bake/w peroxide] the 3D left a very clean feel for a long time afterwards. This leaves a &#x27;secure&#x27; feel.</li>
            <li> Good tasting mouthwash that leaves a clean feeling in my mouth. As for teeth whitening, it looks like there was some whitening. I an tell how affective the product was for cavity prevention. As for an improvment. I assume the cap is meant to be a cup.  It would be good if there was a mark to show the correct dosage.</li>
            <li> Left my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I had a wow reaction to this product. I definitely felt like it was effective and worth purchasing again. I think it left my mouth feeling cleaner than any other mouthwash. I like the idea of restoring my gum tissue also. My teeth are brighter for use of it.  I think it lives up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. My mouth feels better and the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling lasts longer than just toothpaste. I believe it has helped with my overall oral health.  This is such a new an inventive way to keep your mouth healthy.  Thanks Crest for an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this Crest product. It feels so good swishing around the mouth. No burning just cleaning. You can feel it working as it is going through your teeth pulling out the micro pieces stuck there. In a matter of three uses I saw my teeth getting whiter and whiter. If you are going to try a new mouth wash, make it Crest 3D White Luxe Anti-Cavity with Fluoride!</li>
            <li> The mouthwash is long lasting - it made my mouth feel fresher and cleaner longer than any other mouthwash. Not particularly fond of the taste which made it a little difficult to go the recommended 1 minute. After 3 weeks of use, there was some noticeable whitening. I would recommend the product, but wish the price was lower.</li>
            <li> This product really cleans out and freshens your mouth beautifully for several hours. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was that it had a stinging sensation; but other than that, it did a very good job!</li>
