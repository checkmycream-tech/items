            <li>The perfect color for me.  </li>
            <li>The brow mascara is great!</li>
            <li>GREAT GREAT choice for me</li>

            <li>Happy with the results and the price.</li>

            <li>Very nice product</li>
            <li>When your eyebrows begin to become scarce, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>My brows look really good.</li>
            <li>Like this pencil combo...the color for me is good; I have  medium brown hair</li>
            <li>Gee, I just love saving all the money I used to spend and getting a better, more functional, pencil with matching eye brow gel with brush, too!!!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Great quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The gel end of the eyebrow pencil will shape the eyebrows you have and spread the eyebrow pencil nicely.  </li>
            <li>The pencil in this duo is nice but the gel isnt.</li>
            <li>A very easy transaction.</li>
            <li>Feels good... goes on easy &amp; blends nicely :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and nice but lighter than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Love this Brow pencil.</li>
            <li>Revlon has just moved into number one for eyebrow and lipstick quality/price values for me!!!!!  :-)</li>
            <li>Having them combined is truly ingenious.</li>
            <li>This has a much more neutral tone to it.</li>
            <li>This is ok.  </li>
            <li>Love the hold in place gel as well.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to see it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I do like the way it applies, but rubs off easily...</li>
            <li>The pencil color was fine, but the gel coat gave me a rash and itched and then peeled for a week after use.</li>
            <li>color is great and super natural for light brown eyebrows</li>
            <li>I bought the light brown color.</li>
            <li>and i believe for everybody who likes to have light eyebrow and match with the hair color....</li>
            <li>The pencil was too light.  </li>
            <li>I was greatly surprised how good product was keeps my unruly brows tamed&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pencil color is useful, but the gel is horrendous.</li>
            <li>only downside is the color light brown was too light for my complextion</li>
            <li>I always use this product and color, so I know it is exactly what I am getting.</li>
            <li>The product is not bad, just too light for my eyebrows, especially the mascara part.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead and very particular about the color of mt brows.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what i asked for &amp; in no time at all, thanks I looked everywhere for this product &amp; eventually found it on your site Thanks</li>
            <li>It really has added ease to my makeup routine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and this seller!  </li>
            <li>I really needed a neutral color for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>So I have to really fill in my eyebrows to look like I have some.  </li>
            <li>I thought the brush delivered too much of the gel</li>
            <li>This might work really well for blondes, though.</li>
            <li>The reason I did not give it five stars is because the color in pencil is  a medium brown which I like but the liquid side is too light,  closer to a blonde.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>Really like this when you apply it it look natural as if it not pencil</li>
            <li>It is PERFECT for people who have that awkward barely brown hair color.</li>
            <li>$15/mo to refill from Macy&#x27;s stores, to this new Revlon Brow Fantasy pencil.  </li>
            <li>Opt for a clear gel instead!</li>
            <li>Looks natural....</li>
            <li>BUT overall, it works really well</li>
            <li>This color works really well and seems to blend very well with the dark of my eyebrows (what&#x27;s left of them).</li>
            <li>and I can shape my brows and fill in where old age has thinned them out and turned the hairs white.</li>
            <li>but it has like no pigmentation in it, barely shows up</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like it generally, but I expected it to be a little darker.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought the light brown color. It is PERFECT for people who have that awkward barely brown hair color. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this Brow pencil. Looks natural.... which is always a plus. Feels good... goes on easy &amp; blends nicely :)</li>
            <li> I always use this product and color, so I know it is exactly what I am getting. Like the product a lot.</li>
            <li> The pencil color is useful, but the gel is horrendous. One of my friends thought I had mud on my eyebrows. Opt for a clear gel instead!</li>
            <li> i didnt like it at all</li>
            <li> Color was as expected.</li>
            <li> Great quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> GREAT GREAT choice for me and i believe for everybody who likes to have light eyebrow and match with the hair color.... luvvvv itttt!!!</li>
            <li> Not the best quality but it will do</li>
            <li> not obvious when apply the gel on brow</li>
            <li> I found this a while back in the store, and then ran out and couldn&#x27;t find it again.  I love it!  I am in my late 40s and am losing my brow hair in addition to it turning white.  This not only fills in the sparse areas, but also colors the white brow hair.  I am glad to see it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The pencil was too light.  Even though I am a brunette, I should have chosen the next darker shade.  I may order another.</li>
            <li> I was greatly surprised how good product was keeps my unruly brows tamed&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the color light brown was too light for my complextion</li>
            <li> Actually switched from lifelong Estee Lauder dark brown eye pencil, approx. $15/mo to refill from Macy&#x27;s stores, to this new Revlon Brow Fantasy pencil.  Gee, I just love saving all the money I used to spend and getting a better, more functional, pencil with matching eye brow gel with brush, too!!! Wow!!! Revlon has just moved into number one for eyebrow and lipstick quality/price values for me!!!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I had been using just a plain ole brush and a separate pencil.  Having them combined is truly ingenious. Also, the brush adds some color, which for me at age 53, is a great thing.  It really has added ease to my makeup routine. Highly recommend this product and this seller!  A very easy transaction.</li>
            <li> So bad ,my order light brown .don&#x27;t clear and not light brown color .I am very disappointment for this item</li>
            <li> When your eyebrows begin to become scarce, this is a good product.  The gel end of the eyebrow pencil will shape the eyebrows you have and spread the eyebrow pencil nicely.  Best product I have found for this.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what i need for my eye brow. too bad the pencil is too short.</li>
            <li> The perfect color for me.  I can now throw out about 15 brow pencils.</li>
            <li> The pencil in this duo is nice but the gel isnt. There is like no color to it, and I&#x27;ve had a problem with is flaking off. Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I really needed a neutral color for my eyebrows. I did NOT want a red or yellow undertone. This has a much more neutral tone to it. I had used the dark brown and it was too dark for me. My eyebrows are actually dark but I have blonde hair. This color works really well and seems to blend very well with the dark of my eyebrows (what&#x27;s left of them). The one problem I have with the product is that it isn&#x27;t waterproof and sometimes it&#x27;s a little waxy. BUT overall, it works really well and I can shape my brows and fill in where old age has thinned them out and turned the hairs white. My brows look really good.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. I&#x27;ve ordered several times.</li>
            <li> color is great and super natural for light brown eyebrows</li>
            <li> Gel goes on a little thick, but it&#x27;s great for a defined, dramatic brow. Go a shade darker, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and nice but lighter than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This is ok.  I am a red head and have blonde eyebrows, which I hate.  So I have to really fill in my eyebrows to look like I have some.  I thought the brush delivered too much of the gel and it was difficult to get it to look natural.</li>
            <li> I like it generally, but I expected it to be a little darker. This one looks like a dark blond.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a brow pencil that works for me and doesn&#x27;t look so fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and fits my standard makeup pencil sharpener. Happy with the results and the price.</li>
            <li> The pencil color was fine, but the gel coat gave me a rash and itched and then peeled for a week after use.</li>
            <li> I would try a darker color next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead and very particular about the color of mt brows.  This works for me.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I bought it in brown color and when I employed that I don&#x27;t see any color. It&#x27;s same no color.</li>
            <li> The brow mascara is great! I wish the pencil was just a little bit softer. It&#x27;s a bit difficult to coax onto my skin. I have oily skin, typically so this may be a contributor to this problem.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what i asked for &amp; in no time at all, thanks I looked everywhere for this product &amp; eventually found it on your site Thanks</li>
            <li> Really like this when you apply it it look natural as if it not pencil&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> The product is not bad, just too light for my eyebrows, especially the mascara part. This might work really well for blondes, though.</li>
            <li> I do like the way it applies, but rubs off easily...after 2 hours I reapplied again:( I think I&#x27;ll continue using &amp;#34;Wunderbrow&amp;#34; it&#x27;s expensive but lasts for 3 days.</li>
            <li> The reason I did not give it five stars is because the color in pencil is  a medium brown which I like but the liquid side is too light,  closer to a blonde.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. I thought I&#x27;d like this a lot but it has like no pigmentation in it, barely shows up and the crayon is way too gel like</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking ffor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it especially the brow gel. Not recommended.  Thumbs down</li>
            <li> The brow gel is not the great</li>
            <li> Like this pencil combo...the color for me is good; I have  medium brown hair and it doesn&#x27;t make my brows too dark.  Love the hold in place gel as well.  Will keep buying this one</li>
            <li> Very nice product i recommend it</li>
