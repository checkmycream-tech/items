    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great!  </li>
            <li>Purchasing it online was a perfect way to get it for his birthday.</li>
            <li>this is some good stuff !</li>
            <li>Very Good Lather, Great Scent,</li>
            <li>Great product according to them</li>
            <li>soap bar - great for the gym bag &amp; for travel.</li>
            <li>Great smell and intoxicating.</li>
            <li>It was a great gift for my hubby.</li>
            <li>soap is one of the best ways to keep that Clubman scent (it is so close as to be indistinguishable) integrity through the shaving process, though it functions better in the shower than it does on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Price is fair if you shop around.</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>Any man, and lots of women, would love this soap!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SOAP..!</li>
            <li>THIS SOAP IS REALLY NICE.</li>
            <li>The bars are chunky and a great buy and the scent is true Brut.</li>
            <li>You get the same great Brut smell that you love in the Aftershave and cologne lines and you get a great cleaning lather from this soap.</li>
            <li>Great classic Brut soap,classic smell and does a good job of getting you clean as well.</li>
            <li>I love Brut</li>
            <li>so I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this one for years until it fell off the planet.  </li>
            <li>The scent is what I love about this soap.  </li>
            <li>A quality bar soap should have not only a great scent, but a good lather.</li>
            <li>Many of us have grown accustomed to using body washes, so a bar soap may seem old-fashioned.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, I&#x27;m Totally Happy.  </li>
            <li>To top things off, I get the constant wonderful smell of Brut in my shower.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed with how great this bar of soap smells, the smell of freshness stays on for hours, I thought it was pricey at first, but when I received the soaps I was blown away by how huge these soaps are, if your having doubts I can assure you</li>
            <li>From a home made soap makers perspective, this is a pretty good bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>Great value soap that lathers well, rinses well, and worth the refreshing scent of Classic Brut.</li>
            <li>(you won&#x27;t fit this in a soapdish any more than you&#x27;d fit a football in one...</li>
            <li>Works fine when I cut it in two, and each piece lasts for a while.  </li>
            <li>; great scent- does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough for the shower and smells great!  </li>
            <li>scent, huge bar</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and smells great.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and it smells great</li>
            <li>It is a deodorizing soap, and has the clean, fresh scent of the original Brut scent.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THE BRUT SOAP CLASSIC BAR</li>
            <li>Not as many additives as most commercial soaps.</li>
            <li>I HAVE ALLWAY LOVE BRUT ORIGINAL FRAGRANCE FROM MY YOUNG DAYS</li>
            <li>Just as described; awesome fresh, clean , long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great with the deodorant and cologne for everyday use</li>
            <li>Same good scent, but not the same melting material as most.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>And now, rarely use.  </li>
            <li>Price Was Right Too.  </li>
            <li>A real waker-upper!  </li>
            <li>(so you get the same amount of soap in the more manageable 3.5 oz.</li>
            <li>I recently became re-acquainted with Brut when I fell in love with Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I seem to remember some of the cheaper brands having a good lather a few decades ago, but maybe my memory is a bit fuzzy in that regard.</li>
            <li>OK, it isn&#x27;t as big as a football, but it is very big).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be sure, this always led me to fall back to that other green, much cheaper bar soap, that, while it smells great, it is missing what this Brut bar soap contains: a great lather.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer than regular commercial soaps and nicely scented.  </li>
            <li>Shipping &amp; delivery a little slow from Pharmapacks but still a really great price!</li>
            <li>These bars are about 1 1/2 times the size of an Ivory bath bar of soap and they last and don&#x27;t dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li>It is nearly double the size of many down-sized bar soaps, and will last 3-4 times longer, at  a lower per ounce price!  </li>
            <li>Soap bar lasts a normal amount of time.</li>
            <li>The soap&#x27;s color is the same as Brut&#x27;s dark-green packaging -- it&#x27;s color makes you stare when you see it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>First of all head the other reviews when they say this bar is bigger than your average soap bar, but thats a good thing because you know it&#x27;s gonna last!</li>
            <li>Brut is a classic scent that takes my husband and I back to high school.  </li>
            <li>The soap lathers well and rinses clean with little effort.  </li>
            <li>It came back after several years new and improved.  </li>
            <li>But, this is a man-size bar, a full 7 oz., is hard milled, meaning it will last far longer than soaps which are not.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer it to the several name brands of body washes of other men&#x27;s colognes I have.  </li>
            <li>My parents are so set in their ways and I&#x27;ve been looking high and low for this brand &amp; came up empty handed until I found it here on amazon!</li>

            <li> Also tends to discolor when left in a wet soap dish.</li>
            <li> I have never seen this in any store, though I have been looking for something like it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I started using Brut when Joe Namath was promoting it back in the late 60&#x27;s early 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The reason for four stars instead of five is the size - just a bit too big for my average hands.  </li>

            <li> This one looks dark green and somewhat clear.  </li>
            <li> like it more at a lower price, but $4.50 for a brand scented bar isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Very large bar, a little difficult to handle.</li>
            <li> I do wish the scent was a little stronger though.</li>
            <li> It seems a little &#x27;Off&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good size for little hands.  </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> There is HARDLY ANY Brut scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in drug stores and retailers.</li>
            <li> The product was poorly packed, and no protection for the shipment.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just as described; awesome fresh, clean , long lasting scent. We love it!</li>
            <li> I love Brut so I love this soap.  It lasts a long time and smells great.  I do wish the scent was a little stronger though.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s used this for years and now I&#x27;ve taken it for those summer showers where I want to feel refreshed and not perfumed.  ...it&#x27;s time to &#x27;share&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My parents are so set in their ways and I&#x27;ve been looking high and low for this brand &amp; came up empty handed until I found it here on amazon! Great product according to them &amp; it seems like they won&#x27;t be changing brands any time soon either! Shipping &amp; delivery a little slow from Pharmapacks but still a really great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Brut products for 47 years.  Tried others in my &amp;#34;youth&amp;#34; always came back to BRUT.  I don&#x27;t see it as often as I used to, so stocking up via on-line only made sense.</li>
            <li> The best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever used. And the big bar lasts along time.</li>
            <li> Very large bar, a little difficult to handle. Also tends to discolor when left in a wet soap dish. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this one for years until it fell off the planet.  It came back after several years new and improved.  Same good scent, but not the same melting material as most.

It&#x27;s great with the deodorant and cologne for everyday use ( I do have the more expensive brands too). I started using Brut when Joe Namath was promoting it back in the late 60&#x27;s early 70&#x27;s and I probably was wearing it when I met my wife in 72!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE BRUT SOAP CLASSIC BAR I HAVE ALLWAY LOVE BRUT ORIGINAL FRAGRANCE FROM MY YOUNG DAYS THIS SOAP IS REALLY NICE.</li>
            <li> First of all head the other reviews when they say this bar is bigger than your average soap bar, but thats a good thing because you know it&#x27;s gonna last! You get the same great Brut smell that you love in the Aftershave and cologne lines and you get a great cleaning lather from this soap. I your a Brut man you have to have this!</li>
            <li> I was amazed with how great this bar of soap smells, the smell of freshness stays on for hours, I thought it was pricey at first, but when I received the soaps I was blown away by how huge these soaps are, if your having doubts I can assure you it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The scent is what I love about this soap.  Soap bar lasts a normal amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have always been partial to Brut&#x27;s deodorant smell, as it is, of course, the &amp;#34;Essence of Man.&amp;#34; I have searched for a variety of this soap before but there wasn&#x27;t anything on the market that I could find, and the conventional selection of the local supermarket bar soap wasn&#x27;t getting it done. A quality bar soap should have not only a great scent, but a good lather. I seem to remember some of the cheaper brands having a good lather a few decades ago, but maybe my memory is a bit fuzzy in that regard. To be sure, this always led me to fall back to that other green, much cheaper bar soap, that, while it smells great, it is missing what this Brut bar soap contains: a great lather. The obvious kicker here is that you are paying a premium for this. I don&#x27;t know if I will continually buy it at this price for continual, year-round use, but for now, it works like a boss. But don&#x27;t just take the words of an Internet poster, be a man and order this bar soap today.</li>
            <li> The smell is not the same with the cologne. It seems a little &#x27;Off&#x27;. The product was poorly packed, and no protection for the shipment. I have 3 out of 6 damaged items. I cannot present this as a gift in the condition it arrived inside the box.  I will not be purchasing this any longer.</li>
            <li> Many of us have grown accustomed to using body washes, so a bar soap may seem old-fashioned.  But, this is a man-size bar, a full 7 oz., is hard milled, meaning it will last far longer than soaps which are not.  The soap lathers well and rinses clean with little effort.  A bar can and does literally last for months.  It is a deodorizing soap, and has the clean, fresh scent of the original Brut scent.  It is nearly double the size of many down-sized bar soaps, and will last 3-4 times longer, at  a lower per ounce price!  I look forward to showering with it every morning!  A real waker-upper!  Great!  I much prefer it to the several name brands of body washes of other men&#x27;s colognes I have.  And now, rarely use.  I&#x27;ll be using Brut products for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> My dad loves Brut. It&#x27;s very hard to find in drug stores and retailers. Purchasing it online was a perfect way to get it for his birthday. I buy all of his Brut stuff online.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loves it. Brut is an oldie but a goodie and he always receives compliments when he wears this scent. The bars are chunky and a great buy and the scent is true Brut.</li>
            <li> From a home made soap makers perspective, this is a pretty good bar of soap.  Lasts longer than regular commercial soaps and nicely scented.  Not as many additives as most commercial soaps.</li>
            <li> Not what it is advertised to be. I received 12 bars of 3.5oz. Soap</li>
            <li> PLEASE Brut don&#x27;t stop making this product</li>
            <li> Great value soap that lathers well, rinses well, and worth the refreshing scent of Classic Brut. My shipment came as a 6 - pack of 2 x 3.5 oz. bars (so you get the same amount of soap in the more manageable 3.5 oz. soap bar - great for the gym bag &amp; for travel.</li>
            <li> Great smell and intoxicating. Love this soap.</li>
            <li> Any man, and lots of women, would love this soap!  It&#x27;s large enough for the shower and smells great!  Try it!</li>
            <li> I recently became re-acquainted with Brut when I fell in love with Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is one of the best ways to keep that Clubman scent (it is so close as to be indistinguishable) integrity through the shaving process, though it functions better in the shower than it does on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine scent, huge bar (you won&#x27;t fit this in a soapdish any more than you&#x27;d fit a football in one...OK, it isn&#x27;t as big as a football, but it is very big).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like it more at a lower price, but $4.50 for a brand scented bar isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t buy the 6 pack.  There is HARDLY ANY Brut scent.  The soap is a glycerin type and doesn&#x27;t lather.. not a problem but in the end this soap has nothing to give.  I can&#x27;t even give it away so it will sit until I am out of everything else.</li>
            <li> Great classic Brut soap,classic smell and does a good job of getting you clean as well.Recommended if you like Brut products.Get the shave cream and aftershave balm and spray cologne too.</li>
            <li> Brut is a classic scent that takes my husband and I back to high school.  It was a great gift for my hubby.</li>
            <li> this is some good stuff ! it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and it smells great</li>
            <li> I have never seen this in any store, though I have been looking for something like it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Sent as 12-3.5 oz. bars; great scent- does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Very Good Lather, Great Scent, What&#x27;s Not To Like?  Price Was Right Too.  Fast Shipping, I&#x27;m Totally Happy.  If You Like The Scent Of Brut, Buy This , You Wont Regret It</li>
            <li> A 7 oz bar of soap, is a big bar of soap...  It&#x27;s not a good size for little hands.  The soap&#x27;s color is the same as Brut&#x27;s dark-green packaging -- it&#x27;s color makes you stare when you see it for the first time.  To top things off, I get the constant wonderful smell of Brut in my shower.  I LOVE THIS SOAP..!</li>
