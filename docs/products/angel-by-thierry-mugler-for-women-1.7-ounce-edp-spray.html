            <li>My wife loved the smell of this on a friend of ours, and couldn&#x27;t stop praising it.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a good reason ...&lt;</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>People on the street have asked me what perfume I was wearing that smells so good.</li>
            <li>a good seller.</li>
            <li>The result is a very unique blend that smells incredible.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my amazon purchase and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>This is a great fragrance, possibly my favorite scent when on my lady.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;am very pleased with this product,</li>
            <li>Most importantly, this is the scent that my husband likes best!</li>
            <li>It is best when applied lightly and the fragrance is best after an hour or two, so apply it early.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely in LOVE with it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is one of the favorite perfumes in our family!  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>again though, I love the fragrance!</li>
            <li>The bottle came exactly as shown, and the perfume smells great!  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes, EVER!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>The smell is very powerful, the container is beautiful.</li>
            <li>exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be but a lot cheaper than in the store!!!!  </li>
            <li>but it has been taken care of after the fact  you do a great and huge job</li>
            <li>Amazon handled this amazingly as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light scent, Great product - however, seller sent me an opened/used product.</li>
            <li>While i thought I liked this fragrance on me, after wearing it i realized i did not like it.</li>
            <li>It is the kind of scent that you don&#x27;t forget.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite, ive been wearing this for about 5years now, the price is great, i will order this again for sure</li>
            <li>which I found amusing.</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>: Go try it in a store to see if it works on you as well as it does on the person you smelled it on when you thought you liked</li>
            <li>Angel just does not smell nice on me.  </li>
            <li>Now she can smell nice once again.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best ever.</li>
            <li>Once she realized how much I liked it, she continued to branch out to the shower gels and body lotions too.</li>
            <li>: Beautiful &amp; unique scent, along with a very unique perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>I always find a good deal on this on amazon, and have not been able to find it in stores for a better price (not even for the refills on the 1.7 oz i have)</li>
            <li>If I would have sampled it, I would not have bought it, very very strong.</li>
            <li>Very strong.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li>So, I always figured I had pretty good taste in fragrances!</li>
            <li>One of the best gifts I&#x27;ve given thus far.</li>
            <li>this is by far one of the best fragrances I have ever worn!</li>
            <li>As far as the scent goes..this perfume is superb.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The scent is not that great when you first spray it on.</li>
            <li>That is how I first experienced \\&quot;Angel\\&quot; perfume.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>This is a very warm, sexy scent that seems so classy to me, and the star bottle is just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I wish my other great smelling perfumes came this big\\&quot;, no angel thierry do not smell good!</li>
            <li>, you ask?&lt;br /&gt;Because of their great reputation, having loads of positive feedback and being Google trustworthy.</li>
            <li>and I love the price</li>
            <li>What I received was not the authentic Angel Perfume.</li>
            <li>The description of the fragrance is refreshing, oriental and woody with touches of vanilla, sandalwood, and patchouli.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Who knew you had so many varitys of things?</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I filed a claim with Amazon and will be contacting the Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li>we both absolutely love it..</li>
            <li>Is it safe to use this product?  </li>
            <li>You will love your Angel Spray.....</li>

            <li>what attention I received was birds more s***ty birds!\\&quot;</li>

            <li>Just in love with this fragrance.</li>

            <li>and I got the best buy on it and a larger size,</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love the fragrance:)</li>
            <li>My wife loves this sent, and I love it on her.  </li>
            <li>this is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and she has people ask her what she&#x27;s wearing all the time.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite, probably mine too.  </li>
            <li>he&#x27;ll/she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>OMG i love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Granted, I knew this was one of her favorite fragrances, if not her favorite.  </li>
            <li>But, I decided to give it a chance to work with my body chemistry, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it smells much better now than it did when I applied</li>
            <li>sure you get the one in the star-shaped bottle.</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>For years, this has been my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I usally order this from Amazon and love it</li>
            <li>I have been using this perfume for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this brand for many years and this is the easiest and the cheapest way for me to get it.</li>
            <li>The perfumes I wear most these days are Pleasures, Chanel Chance Eau Tendre, Coach, Cloe, Body, and Angel.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I usally wear this and love it</li>
            <li>so I got it. :-)</li>
            <li>Guess it is the combination of the citrus and vanilla scents, maybe mostly the vanilla</li>
            <li>, that are so darned appealing to me.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance of Angel and have had compliments on the smell and that&#x27;s all I have to say now</li>
            <li>Love, love it.</li>
            <li>I know the perfume is authentic, so i cant complain about that.. $63 vs $100 or more at department stores is a pretty good deal, i think.</li>
            <li>For me, the patchouli is breathtakingly strong at first whiff, but then I&#x27;m hit with a beautiful blend of honey, berries, chocolate, and sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li>plus, the scent conforms to your body chemistry, so it makes it unique to you!</li>
            <li>Worth it!!</li>
            <li>NOW I CAN ENJOY MY FAVORITE PERFUME</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;ANGEL is a sophisticated, light, unobtrusive fragrance, with lemony undertones.</li>
            <li>but this I bought from Amazon was very discolored and the scent was not as strong and good as I like.</li>
            <li>It is a very rich scent filled with hints of chocolate.</li>
            <li>That is the single best way to ensure you&#x27;re getting a genuine product.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend, if you love this as much as I do, to not wait till you are empty, and order from amazon for the best price on this amazing scent.</li>
            <li>Two other colleagues have adopted the scent so our office corridor smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Amazon gave me full credit when I called and told them it&#x27;s all alcohol!</li>
            <li>All of these notes create the most unique scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>I love Angel&#x27;s unique scent.</li>
            <li>This is a unique perfume that you will love.</li>
            <li>so go easy until you figure what works for you.</li>
            <li>I Love this perfume so much,I got such a great deal on it.</li>
            <li>otherwise it smells too strong.</li>
            <li>, the fragrance is way too strong.  </li>
            <li>At first spray, I didn&#x27;t think I liked this fragrance...</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is that if you are interested in this perfume, wear a sample because it is one of those fragrances that does not smell equally delicious on everyone.</li>
            <li>all was done fine</li>
            <li>I am a huge patchouli fan, so if you are too, this will be your go to perfume.</li>
            <li>I think both &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; are accurate descriptors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>such a great price on amazon too</li>
            <li>I have worn this since receiving it as a gift many years ago (smile).</li>
            <li>But after a few minutes it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and floral without being over powering.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance of &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; is light yet lingering.  </li>
            <li>I come back home from work smelling great.</li>
            <li>Always smells great and is a definite head turner.</li>
            <li>I was happy when I received the package (which was delivered in a short time)</li>
            <li>It looked as if someome took the Angel star bottle and crammed it in the box crushing the cardboard.</li>
            <li>We contacted Amazon for a refund and, surprisingly, one was given--though not without considerable haggling with a computer.</li>
            <li>and I found out that one of her old favorites was also one that I loved smelling.</li>
            <li>Even many of the ones I like on other people don&#x27;t smell good on me, but Angel by Thierry Mugler is one that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>But if you want to expand your perfume repertoire then this is surely a step in the right</li>
            <li>It is a clean, bright scent that is never heavy.</li>
            <li>Actually, it is probably the great combination of the fragrance as worn by the woman I love and have been married to for a couple decades now.</li>
            <li>My new favorite scent!</li>
            <li>It is the original perfume and it is not defective in any way.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased the perfume from another vendor but it broke during shipping and the fragrance evaporated.</li>
            <li>But beware.. if you plan on using that unique code..</li>
            <li>The bottle seemed original, but the liquid seemed like it was diluted.</li>
            <li>I think it smells really sensual on my wife, more importantly, she loves it.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly, way before her bday, and the price was very reasonable, cheaper than most vendors.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance and the positive feedback is just the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>The &#x27;special code&#x27; found on all the boxes which Angel is packaged in had its code cut out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not know what it is about Thierry Mugler Angel products that makes them so special, but man-o-man do I like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>&quot; or \\&quot;Hanae Mori\\&quot; you&#x27;ll love this smell...and it last all day on u, its VERY strong, so u wont need much...and its so distinctive that everyone will know u have \\&quot;Angel\\</li>
            <li>I first heard of it from a woman that I worked with, I liked it so much that I decided to ask her what it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky about perfumes and there aren&#x27;t many that I like.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I ever bought perfume for full price at Macys or Sephora before.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments from both men &amp; women when wearing it, I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li>Musky &amp; sweet&#x27; not a scent I wanted lingering stuck on me</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much pricier than some scents I like quite a bit more.</li>
            <li>cool bottle too</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a gift for the lady in your life (or your sweet man) go for it</li>
            <li>Arrived in true speedy fashion as Amazon is noted for.</li>
            <li>if u like sweet smells like \\&quot;Lolita Lempicka\\&quot; and \\&quot;Curve Crush\\</li>
            <li>This is one of those perfumes that really gets better on me, the longer it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>I know that the TRUE Angel packaging company would NOT let this leave the their plant this way...</li>
            <li>It was the real thing, and I scored major &#x27;good and thoughtful husband&#x27; points on this gift!&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>and she was happy to receive it for Christmas, among other things of course.</li>
            <li>I sure could get more work done if she would only stop wearing Angel</li>
            <li>Quickly delivered.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice the sandalwood fragrance most and the vanilla second most.  </li>
            <li>The patchouli, to me, is mild, but the blend of fragrances works well together.  </li>
            <li>Original Item, super fast shipping thank you, It was a gift!</li>
            <li>One of my ex GF&#x27;s wore it once, and it reminded me so much of her!!</li>
            <li>Whenever spraying a new bottle, I always give it a few pumps to spray the alcohol off before the delicious mist.</li>
            <li>I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE PACKING A PRICEY LARGE BOTTLE IN MY CHECKED LUGGAGE.....</li>
            <li>Not me smile  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money since it stays and doesn&#x27;t disappear.</li>
            <li>It has a soft and sexy aroma to it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s well worth your time and money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is nice to get quality and performance in the same package!</li>
            <li>the name Angel did put a smile on my face.[[ASIN:B000C21BT0 Angel by Thierry Mugler for Women - 1.7 Ounce EDP Spray]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting it for her for a while now and have been present when she has been told how nice it smells</li>
            <li>Soft yet sexy attention getter type fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m especially grateful to those responsible for the superior care in the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy scent, I am able to wear this every day.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t refillable, but for convenience and price, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Neither of us are particularly enamored with most perfume, the majority of which I fond distracting (not in a good way) or just plain pungent.</li>
            <li>all 3 people agreed my right wrist smelled like bug spray.</li>
            <li>It was very strong and harsh when first applied, for lack of better terms, and it contained an undertone I didn&#x27;t care for.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so crisp and fresh smelling but</li>
            <li>Apparently you are better off getting a refillable bottle.</li>
            <li>While I still don&#x27;t receive the same number of compliments as when I&#x27;m wearing certain perfume oils, the enthusiasms seems to be greater on average lol.</li>
            <li>It is the type of scent that will become part of your skin; goes on slightly strong but becomes soft immediately.</li>
            <li>thank you for correcting the original order and it was delivered just fine the second time  </li>
            <li>Also the shipper sent it me very fast without paying for faster services.</li>
            <li>, I cannot say I like the smell very much</li>
            <li>Pretty large size, but worth the price.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t exactly explain why?</li>
            <li>Whenever I&#x27;m wearing it, even after several hours I still notice it and love the smell of it in my hair or on my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you spray it on your pulse points you&#x27;ll still be able to smell it 8 or 9 hours later.</li>
            <li>The star shaped bottle is really pretty too.</li>
            <li>The one thing you should be sure to do before purchasing any perfume, go to an actual store and try it on first.</li>
            <li>(but I don&#x27;t want her to, really!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same as what you get at a department store or reputable retailer.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, I received the package today as \\&quot;undeliverable\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I looked around and couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive it was, Amazon has the best prices around!</li>
            <li>Later that year I tried Womanity and also fell in love with it...</li>
            <li>my oh my... First off being Thierry Mugler, it LASTS forever.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure buy the smaller size</li>
            <li>It was my first time.  </li>
            <li>I finally got my Thierry Mugler Angel :)</li>
            <li>I sampled it first</li>
            <li>In the first 5 minutes, I was overwhelmed by the piercing scent that is almost akin to ammonia, which the Angel fragrance.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite perfume that i have ever smelled, and i also like \\&quot;Alien\\&quot; by this same designer...</li>
            <li>is unfortunately not a Thierry Mugler authorized retailer.  </li>
            <li>I just could not get enough of this lovely, long-lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Knowing how scents alter with a person&#x27;s chemistry, I determined to try it first.  </li>
            <li>I imagine this would smell appropriate on a WNBA player or maybe a female construction worker.</li>
            <li>This is the first time this has ever  happened to me and am hoping it doesn&#x27;t happen again.  </li>
            <li>IT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENTS.</li>
            <li>But in about 30 seconds, it totally changed into something super unique.</li>
            <li>yet it attracts positive attention towards you.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and I have been wearing it a long time.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something different and special, then is the perfume for you!  </li>
            <li>Since they can sometimes be tough to find in the store, we are very glad that they are readily available</li>
            <li>I had no clue about it and what to do but with a little help from my husband I was able to find my favorit perfum and did not have to go to the mall!  </li>
            <li>I must stress that it is not a bad fragrance but certain elements does not mess well at all.  </li>
            <li>Smells like patchouly and some cocconut now, when it was really strong earlier in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>Do you know how it is when you&#x27;re just drawn to a certain fragrance</li>
            <li>but this time it was very discolored almost yellow in color and the scent was not as strong as I like.  </li>
            <li>Products that are sold through distribution channels which are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer are often times replication of the original products with chemical ingredients that may not have been tested by laboratories, or expired products from foreign markets.  </li>
            <li>thing about this eau de parfum spray is that it is fairly intense.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves when I put this on..</li>
            <li>I really dont care to wear another..totally sold on Angel in Montana!!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I was very please with the product.  </li>
            <li>I will order again  thanks.</li>
            <li>It is overpowering however, and can make me develop a tickle in my throat if too much is applied.</li>
            <li>In awe at how much money</li>
            <li>It smelled like a cheap, watery, and nauseating version of the actual Angel I&#x27;ve smelled in stores.&lt;br /&gt;In stores it smelt fresher, spicier and softer.</li>
            <li>It really lasts all day and I get compliments every day I have it on.  </li>
            <li>This odor of \\&quot;Angel\\&quot; was saturated throughout the purse and was very offensive.</li>
            <li>I really wanted that Coach purse, but even after 2 days of hanging the purse outdoors in sun and breezes, it still retained the odor.</li>
            <li>This one I just purchased doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making me the winner this anniversary.</li>
            <li>It was much too musty and powdery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came fast and as described.</li>
            <li>Regardless of what I like, I&#x27;ll assume Angel just works really well with my body</li>
            <li>My man absolutely loves when I spray this on in the morning, heading out to work.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve loved every Mugler scent I&#x27;ve smelled and they always last for 8+ hours on my skin, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to all.</li>
            <li>A few years ago my wife was given a gift of the Angel perfume and she really liked it.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>This product is completely authentic, not unlike other products you might buy from online discounters.</li>
            <li>the unique code that is located on the inner part of the box has been cut out?</li>
            <li>Original perfume with lasting smell.</li>
            <li>likely, the product that you purchased was originally acquired on the Gray Market.</li>
            <li>It is not a male friendly scent.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance; however, I can&#x27;t lay the bottle down like it&#x27;s suppose to or it leaks.  </li>
            <li>This is an imitation, It is not the original product!</li>
            <li>and I get so many complaiments on it,I tell all my friends about Angel,its the only one I only wear.</li>
            <li>larger bottles of designer perfumes are the most likely ones to be counterfeited.  </li>
            <li>and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND people NOT to purchase anything from this BOGUS COMPANY.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thierry Mugler products are high quality.</li>
            <li>One caution, this scent is *STRONG*, so a little goes a long way, you can easily overdose on this</li>
            <li>but this is not the real Angel, or it is so old it gas lost its scent</li>
            <li>recently was hugged by a person whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in years who gave me compliment on my perfume which is a rare occasion these days .</li>
            <li>Im so thrilled,made my day,small things like this makes me smile as i have been in tears recently as i lost my sister and my mom</li>
            <li>The scent is so fresh and last ALL DAY!!!  </li>
            <li>The next best one I Love is Coco mad by Chanel,But Angel number 1 hands down</li>
            <li>I will think again before I place a new order with Amazon.</li>
            <li>Perfume is in a new sealed box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?  </li>
            <li>It was cheaper for me to buy this as a brand new bottle than it was to go into a store and refill the refillable bottle the wife owns.  </li>
            <li>Hi, my name is Tina I am 60 years young and have been wearing Angel perfume for years many of them ,it&#x27;s not a cheap perfume on my budget.  </li>
            <li>O bought this year&#x27;s ago when it first came out,it&#x27;s the only perfume I&#x27;m not allergic to.</li>
            <li>It was definitely not authentic like many of the customers stated here.</li>
            <li>As expected, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I first tested this at a department store because I constantly see this fragrance at a discount store I frequent.  </li>
            <li>Would prefer something that isn&#x27;t so strong for everyday.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of the original Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Alien, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Prada, etc., you will love this scent as well.</li>
            <li>You can take that code and &#x27;refill&#x27; your bottle on the  Thierry Mugler web site and get all sorts of little free things.  </li>
            <li>This code was clearly cut out.</li>
            <li>This scent is light &amp; feminine without being heavy &amp; overly flowery.  </li>
            <li>It looks like it is old /  and or the prodcut was frozen.  </li>
            <li>: I ordered this as an xmas gift for my mother this year and was pleasantly surprised by the affordable price attached to the item.</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, after some cursory inspection, we discover that it absolutely was NOT the same perfume.</li>
            <li>I think I received an old bottle.</li>
            <li>The smell lasts all day yet is surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li>Smells like 90 yr old woman.  </li>
            <li>However, because of this, the bottle will last you much longer.</li>
            <li>so it has been very hard,and something so simple But also</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try, and once I allowed it to mix with my natural scent</li>
            <li>Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
            <li>it is an old bottle...</li>
            <li>My husband asked me why I smell like a mildewy old lady. . .</li>
            <li>This by far is one of the sexiest purfumes out.</li>
            <li>Sweet, spicy, and long lasting</li>
            <li>Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  </li>
            <li>I normally choose whatever is most expensive, because I assume it MUST be great if it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously... going back to my high school days of Cool Water, Hugo Boss, Pleasures (still), CKOne, and whatever else... I never received a single compliment on my scent when wearing regular perfume until I found Angel.</li>
            <li>This magic potion is just so sexy, and men go crazy over it!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not the same as having people rave about (or drool over) a particular fragrance.</li>
            <li>Please know that only brand new, unused, and unwrapped items may be returned.</li>
            <li>What can I say about such a classy product that&#x27;s made by Thierry Mugler?!</li>
            <li>I fell drop dead in love with Alien about a year ago when my aunt was wearing it, and my compliments were so much</li>
            <li>(Plus, major perfume designers don&#x27;t want to disappoint their consumer, because they are creating a fantasy and must create a product that lives up to that image).</li>
            <li>&quot; on, cuz it smells like no other perfume....</li>
            <li>but, this one has ALWAYS been my favorite (and believe me, I am VERY hard to please when it comes to scents).</li>
            <li>I was only missing the original Angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted, I&#x27;ve gotten the general \\&quot;You</li>
            <li>It made me smell like an old lady (and i&#x27;m only 23).</li>
            <li>One of my favourite scents!&lt;br /&gt;However, the package comes with cut off code, so if you want to use it for further offers from Thierry Mugler, you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>So far, Angel has been the only one that received the \\&quot;OMG!</li>
            <li>After reading some of the other reviews, I was nervous that I might get a Knock-off of the real Angel.  </li>
            <li>Left wrist with Macy&#x27;s Angel perfume and right wrist with Dead Sea Beauty perfume and</li>
            <li>Probably but hope the next one is new and not old!</li>
            <li>So glad I did, wore a VERY small amount (compared to what I use with other fragrances) and</li>
            <li>It is true that you only need to spray a very small amount</li>
            <li>Angel is one of those rare finds that is so extreme it draws very extreme reactions</li>
    </ol>

            <li> there&#x27;s a good reason ...&lt;</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> People on the street have asked me what perfume I was wearing that smells so good.</li>
            <li> a good seller.</li>
            <li> The result is a very unique blend that smells incredible.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my amazon purchase and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance, possibly my favorite scent when on my lady.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am very pleased with this product,</li>
            <li> Most importantly, this is the scent that my husband likes best!</li>
            <li> It is best when applied lightly and the fragrance is best after an hour or two, so apply it early.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely in LOVE with it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the favorite perfumes in our family!  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> again though, I love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> The bottle came exactly as shown, and the perfume smells great!  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, EVER!  </li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> The smell is very powerful, the container is beautiful.</li>
            <li> exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be but a lot cheaper than in the store!!!!  </li>
            <li> but it has been taken care of after the fact  you do a great and huge job</li>
            <li> Amazon handled this amazingly as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light scent, Great product - however, seller sent me an opened/used product.</li>
            <li> While i thought I liked this fragrance on me, after wearing it i realized i did not like it.</li>
            <li> It is the kind of scent that you don&#x27;t forget.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, ive been wearing this for about 5years now, the price is great, i will order this again for sure</li>
            <li> which I found amusing.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> : Go try it in a store to see if it works on you as well as it does on the person you smelled it on when you thought you liked</li>
            <li> Angel just does not smell nice on me.  </li>
            <li> Now she can smell nice once again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best ever.</li>
            <li> Once she realized how much I liked it, she continued to branch out to the shower gels and body lotions too.</li>
            <li> : Beautiful &amp; unique scent, along with a very unique perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> I always find a good deal on this on amazon, and have not been able to find it in stores for a better price (not even for the refills on the 1.7 oz i have)</li>
            <li> If I would have sampled it, I would not have bought it, very very strong.</li>
            <li> Very strong.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li> So, I always figured I had pretty good taste in fragrances!</li>
            <li> One of the best gifts I&#x27;ve given thus far.</li>
            <li> this is by far one of the best fragrances I have ever worn!</li>
            <li> As far as the scent goes..this perfume is superb.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The scent is not that great when you first spray it on.</li>
            <li> That is how I first experienced \\&quot;Angel\\&quot; perfume.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li> This is a very warm, sexy scent that seems so classy to me, and the star bottle is just gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I wish my other great smelling perfumes came this big\\&quot;, no angel thierry do not smell good!</li>
            <li> , you ask?&lt;br /&gt;Because of their great reputation, having loads of positive feedback and being Google trustworthy.</li>
            <li> and I love the price</li>
            <li> What I received was not the authentic Angel Perfume.</li>
            <li> The description of the fragrance is refreshing, oriental and woody with touches of vanilla, sandalwood, and patchouli.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Who knew you had so many varitys of things?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> I filed a claim with Amazon and will be contacting the Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li> we both absolutely love it..</li>
            <li> Is it safe to use this product?  </li>
            <li> You will love your Angel Spray.....</li>
            <li> This is her favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance .Many</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in plastic wrapping, and what seemed like an authentic box.</li>

            <li> Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love the way this perfume smells.</li>
            <li> it was just a shame that it wasn&#x27;t perfect for the Christmas present</li>
            <li> Love it, much better priced versus retail stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on the scent and more than</li>
            <li> Many layers of scents and tones.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>

            <li> I receive so many compliments when I wear this scent.</li>
            <li> Angel is like an acquired taste for me (and for many people I think).</li>
            <li> what attention I received was birds more s***ty birds!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like a cheap barroom floozy this is your scent!  </li>
            <li> Love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Just in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> always use love the scent now for 25+ years</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> but i promise you will all love it as i do,</li>
            <li> and I got the best buy on it and a larger size,</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love the fragrance:)</li>
            <li> My wife loves this sent, and I love it on her.  </li>
            <li> this is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and she has people ask her what she&#x27;s wearing all the time.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite, probably mine too.  </li>
            <li> he&#x27;ll/she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> OMG i love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Granted, I knew this was one of her favorite fragrances, if not her favorite.  </li>
            <li> But, I decided to give it a chance to work with my body chemistry, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it smells much better now than it did when I applied</li>
            <li> sure you get the one in the star-shaped bottle.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> For years, this has been my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I usally order this from Amazon and love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this brand for many years and this is the easiest and the cheapest way for me to get it.</li>
            <li> The perfumes I wear most these days are Pleasures, Chanel Chance Eau Tendre, Coach, Cloe, Body, and Angel.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I usally wear this and love it</li>
            <li> so I got it. :-)</li>
            <li> Guess it is the combination of the citrus and vanilla scents, maybe mostly the vanilla</li>
            <li> , that are so darned appealing to me.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance of Angel and have had compliments on the smell and that&#x27;s all I have to say now</li>
            <li> Love, love it.</li>
            <li> I know the perfume is authentic, so i cant complain about that.. $63 vs $100 or more at department stores is a pretty good deal, i think.</li>
            <li> For me, the patchouli is breathtakingly strong at first whiff, but then I&#x27;m hit with a beautiful blend of honey, berries, chocolate, and sweet vanilla.</li>
            <li> plus, the scent conforms to your body chemistry, so it makes it unique to you!</li>
            <li> Worth it!!</li>
            <li> NOW I CAN ENJOY MY FAVORITE PERFUME</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;ANGEL is a sophisticated, light, unobtrusive fragrance, with lemony undertones.</li>
            <li> but this I bought from Amazon was very discolored and the scent was not as strong and good as I like.</li>
            <li> It is a very rich scent filled with hints of chocolate.</li>
            <li> That is the single best way to ensure you&#x27;re getting a genuine product.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend, if you love this as much as I do, to not wait till you are empty, and order from amazon for the best price on this amazing scent.</li>
            <li> Two other colleagues have adopted the scent so our office corridor smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Amazon gave me full credit when I called and told them it&#x27;s all alcohol!</li>
            <li> All of these notes create the most unique scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> I love Angel&#x27;s unique scent.</li>
            <li> This is a unique perfume that you will love.</li>
            <li> so go easy until you figure what works for you.</li>
            <li> I Love this perfume so much,I got such a great deal on it.</li>
            <li> otherwise it smells too strong.</li>
            <li> , the fragrance is way too strong.  </li>
            <li> At first spray, I didn&#x27;t think I liked this fragrance...</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is that if you are interested in this perfume, wear a sample because it is one of those fragrances that does not smell equally delicious on everyone.</li>
            <li> all was done fine</li>
            <li> I am a huge patchouli fan, so if you are too, this will be your go to perfume.</li>
            <li> I think both &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; are accurate descriptors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> such a great price on amazon too</li>
            <li> I have worn this since receiving it as a gift many years ago (smile).</li>
            <li> But after a few minutes it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and floral without being over powering.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance of &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; is light yet lingering.  </li>
            <li> I come back home from work smelling great.</li>
            <li> Always smells great and is a definite head turner.</li>
            <li> I was happy when I received the package (which was delivered in a short time)</li>
            <li> It looked as if someome took the Angel star bottle and crammed it in the box crushing the cardboard.</li>
            <li> We contacted Amazon for a refund and, surprisingly, one was given--though not without considerable haggling with a computer.</li>
            <li> and I found out that one of her old favorites was also one that I loved smelling.</li>
            <li> Even many of the ones I like on other people don&#x27;t smell good on me, but Angel by Thierry Mugler is one that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> But if you want to expand your perfume repertoire then this is surely a step in the right</li>
            <li> It is a clean, bright scent that is never heavy.</li>
            <li> Actually, it is probably the great combination of the fragrance as worn by the woman I love and have been married to for a couple decades now.</li>
            <li> My new favorite scent!</li>
            <li> It is the original perfume and it is not defective in any way.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased the perfume from another vendor but it broke during shipping and the fragrance evaporated.</li>
            <li> But beware.. if you plan on using that unique code..</li>
            <li> The bottle seemed original, but the liquid seemed like it was diluted.</li>
            <li> I think it smells really sensual on my wife, more importantly, she loves it.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, way before her bday, and the price was very reasonable, cheaper than most vendors.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance and the positive feedback is just the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> The &#x27;special code&#x27; found on all the boxes which Angel is packaged in had its code cut out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not know what it is about Thierry Mugler Angel products that makes them so special, but man-o-man do I like this fragrance.</li>
            <li> &quot; or \\&quot;Hanae Mori\\&quot; you&#x27;ll love this smell...and it last all day on u, its VERY strong, so u wont need much...and its so distinctive that everyone will know u have \\&quot;Angel\\</li>
            <li> I first heard of it from a woman that I worked with, I liked it so much that I decided to ask her what it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about perfumes and there aren&#x27;t many that I like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I ever bought perfume for full price at Macys or Sephora before.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments from both men &amp; women when wearing it, I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> Musky &amp; sweet&#x27; not a scent I wanted lingering stuck on me</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much pricier than some scents I like quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> cool bottle too</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a gift for the lady in your life (or your sweet man) go for it</li>
            <li> Arrived in true speedy fashion as Amazon is noted for.</li>
            <li> if u like sweet smells like \\&quot;Lolita Lempicka\\&quot; and \\&quot;Curve Crush\\</li>
            <li> This is one of those perfumes that really gets better on me, the longer it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> I know that the TRUE Angel packaging company would NOT let this leave the their plant this way...</li>
            <li> It was the real thing, and I scored major &#x27;good and thoughtful husband&#x27; points on this gift!&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> and she was happy to receive it for Christmas, among other things of course.</li>
            <li> I sure could get more work done if she would only stop wearing Angel</li>
            <li> Quickly delivered.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice the sandalwood fragrance most and the vanilla second most.  </li>
            <li> The patchouli, to me, is mild, but the blend of fragrances works well together.  </li>
            <li> Original Item, super fast shipping thank you, It was a gift!</li>
            <li> One of my ex GF&#x27;s wore it once, and it reminded me so much of her!!</li>
            <li> Whenever spraying a new bottle, I always give it a few pumps to spray the alcohol off before the delicious mist.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE PACKING A PRICEY LARGE BOTTLE IN MY CHECKED LUGGAGE.....</li>
            <li> Not me smile  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money since it stays and doesn&#x27;t disappear.</li>
            <li> It has a soft and sexy aroma to it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s well worth your time and money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is nice to get quality and performance in the same package!</li>
            <li> the name Angel did put a smile on my face.[[ASIN:B000C21BT0 Angel by Thierry Mugler for Women - 1.7 Ounce EDP Spray]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting it for her for a while now and have been present when she has been told how nice it smells</li>
            <li> Soft yet sexy attention getter type fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m especially grateful to those responsible for the superior care in the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy scent, I am able to wear this every day.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t refillable, but for convenience and price, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Neither of us are particularly enamored with most perfume, the majority of which I fond distracting (not in a good way) or just plain pungent.</li>
            <li> all 3 people agreed my right wrist smelled like bug spray.</li>
            <li> It was very strong and harsh when first applied, for lack of better terms, and it contained an undertone I didn&#x27;t care for.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so crisp and fresh smelling but</li>
            <li> Apparently you are better off getting a refillable bottle.</li>
            <li> While I still don&#x27;t receive the same number of compliments as when I&#x27;m wearing certain perfume oils, the enthusiasms seems to be greater on average lol.</li>
            <li> It is the type of scent that will become part of your skin; goes on slightly strong but becomes soft immediately.</li>
            <li> thank you for correcting the original order and it was delivered just fine the second time  </li>
            <li> Also the shipper sent it me very fast without paying for faster services.</li>
            <li> , I cannot say I like the smell very much</li>
            <li> Pretty large size, but worth the price.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t exactly explain why?</li>
            <li> Whenever I&#x27;m wearing it, even after several hours I still notice it and love the smell of it in my hair or on my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you spray it on your pulse points you&#x27;ll still be able to smell it 8 or 9 hours later.</li>
            <li> The star shaped bottle is really pretty too.</li>
            <li> The one thing you should be sure to do before purchasing any perfume, go to an actual store and try it on first.</li>
            <li> (but I don&#x27;t want her to, really!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as what you get at a department store or reputable retailer.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, I received the package today as \\&quot;undeliverable\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I looked around and couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive it was, Amazon has the best prices around!</li>
            <li> Later that year I tried Womanity and also fell in love with it...</li>
            <li> my oh my... First off being Thierry Mugler, it LASTS forever.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure buy the smaller size</li>
            <li> It was my first time.  </li>
            <li> I finally got my Thierry Mugler Angel :)</li>
            <li> I sampled it first</li>
            <li> In the first 5 minutes, I was overwhelmed by the piercing scent that is almost akin to ammonia, which the Angel fragrance.  </li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume that i have ever smelled, and i also like \\&quot;Alien\\&quot; by this same designer...</li>
            <li> is unfortunately not a Thierry Mugler authorized retailer.  </li>
            <li> I just could not get enough of this lovely, long-lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Knowing how scents alter with a person&#x27;s chemistry, I determined to try it first.  </li>
            <li> I imagine this would smell appropriate on a WNBA player or maybe a female construction worker.</li>
            <li> This is the first time this has ever  happened to me and am hoping it doesn&#x27;t happen again.  </li>
            <li> IT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENTS.</li>
            <li> But in about 30 seconds, it totally changed into something super unique.</li>
            <li> yet it attracts positive attention towards you.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I have been wearing it a long time.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something different and special, then is the perfume for you!  </li>
            <li> Since they can sometimes be tough to find in the store, we are very glad that they are readily available</li>
            <li> I had no clue about it and what to do but with a little help from my husband I was able to find my favorit perfum and did not have to go to the mall!  </li>
            <li> I must stress that it is not a bad fragrance but certain elements does not mess well at all.  </li>
            <li> Smells like patchouly and some cocconut now, when it was really strong earlier in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Do you know how it is when you&#x27;re just drawn to a certain fragrance</li>
            <li> but this time it was very discolored almost yellow in color and the scent was not as strong as I like.  </li>
            <li> Products that are sold through distribution channels which are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer are often times replication of the original products with chemical ingredients that may not have been tested by laboratories, or expired products from foreign markets.  </li>
            <li> thing about this eau de parfum spray is that it is fairly intense.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves when I put this on..</li>
            <li> I really dont care to wear another..totally sold on Angel in Montana!!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I was very please with the product.  </li>
            <li> I will order again  thanks.</li>
            <li> It is overpowering however, and can make me develop a tickle in my throat if too much is applied.</li>
            <li> In awe at how much money</li>
            <li> It smelled like a cheap, watery, and nauseating version of the actual Angel I&#x27;ve smelled in stores.&lt;br /&gt;In stores it smelt fresher, spicier and softer.</li>
            <li> It really lasts all day and I get compliments every day I have it on.  </li>
            <li> This odor of \\&quot;Angel\\&quot; was saturated throughout the purse and was very offensive.</li>
            <li> I really wanted that Coach purse, but even after 2 days of hanging the purse outdoors in sun and breezes, it still retained the odor.</li>
            <li> This one I just purchased doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making me the winner this anniversary.</li>
            <li> It was much too musty and powdery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came fast and as described.</li>
            <li> Regardless of what I like, I&#x27;ll assume Angel just works really well with my body</li>
            <li> My man absolutely loves when I spray this on in the morning, heading out to work.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve loved every Mugler scent I&#x27;ve smelled and they always last for 8+ hours on my skin, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> A few years ago my wife was given a gift of the Angel perfume and she really liked it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> This product is completely authentic, not unlike other products you might buy from online discounters.</li>
            <li> the unique code that is located on the inner part of the box has been cut out?</li>
            <li> Original perfume with lasting smell.</li>
            <li> likely, the product that you purchased was originally acquired on the Gray Market.</li>
            <li> It is not a male friendly scent.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance; however, I can&#x27;t lay the bottle down like it&#x27;s suppose to or it leaks.  </li>
            <li> This is an imitation, It is not the original product!</li>
            <li> and I get so many complaiments on it,I tell all my friends about Angel,its the only one I only wear.</li>
            <li> larger bottles of designer perfumes are the most likely ones to be counterfeited.  </li>
            <li> and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND people NOT to purchase anything from this BOGUS COMPANY.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thierry Mugler products are high quality.</li>
            <li> One caution, this scent is *STRONG*, so a little goes a long way, you can easily overdose on this</li>
            <li> but this is not the real Angel, or it is so old it gas lost its scent</li>
            <li> recently was hugged by a person whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in years who gave me compliment on my perfume which is a rare occasion these days .</li>
            <li> Im so thrilled,made my day,small things like this makes me smile as i have been in tears recently as i lost my sister and my mom</li>
            <li> The scent is so fresh and last ALL DAY!!!  </li>
            <li> The next best one I Love is Coco mad by Chanel,But Angel number 1 hands down</li>
            <li> I will think again before I place a new order with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Perfume is in a new sealed box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?  </li>
            <li> It was cheaper for me to buy this as a brand new bottle than it was to go into a store and refill the refillable bottle the wife owns.  </li>
            <li> Hi, my name is Tina I am 60 years young and have been wearing Angel perfume for years many of them ,it&#x27;s not a cheap perfume on my budget.  </li>
            <li> O bought this year&#x27;s ago when it first came out,it&#x27;s the only perfume I&#x27;m not allergic to.</li>
            <li> It was definitely not authentic like many of the customers stated here.</li>
            <li> As expected, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I first tested this at a department store because I constantly see this fragrance at a discount store I frequent.  </li>
            <li> Would prefer something that isn&#x27;t so strong for everyday.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of the original Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Alien, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Prada, etc., you will love this scent as well.</li>
            <li> You can take that code and &#x27;refill&#x27; your bottle on the  Thierry Mugler web site and get all sorts of little free things.  </li>
            <li> This code was clearly cut out.</li>
            <li> This scent is light &amp; feminine without being heavy &amp; overly flowery.  </li>
            <li> It looks like it is old /  and or the prodcut was frozen.  </li>
            <li> : I ordered this as an xmas gift for my mother this year and was pleasantly surprised by the affordable price attached to the item.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, after some cursory inspection, we discover that it absolutely was NOT the same perfume.</li>
            <li> I think I received an old bottle.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts all day yet is surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li> Smells like 90 yr old woman.  </li>
            <li> However, because of this, the bottle will last you much longer.</li>
            <li> so it has been very hard,and something so simple But also</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try, and once I allowed it to mix with my natural scent</li>
            <li> Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
            <li> it is an old bottle...</li>
            <li> My husband asked me why I smell like a mildewy old lady. . .</li>
            <li> This by far is one of the sexiest purfumes out.</li>
            <li> Sweet, spicy, and long lasting</li>
            <li> Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  </li>
            <li> I normally choose whatever is most expensive, because I assume it MUST be great if it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously... going back to my high school days of Cool Water, Hugo Boss, Pleasures (still), CKOne, and whatever else... I never received a single compliment on my scent when wearing regular perfume until I found Angel.</li>
            <li> This magic potion is just so sexy, and men go crazy over it!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not the same as having people rave about (or drool over) a particular fragrance.</li>
            <li> Please know that only brand new, unused, and unwrapped items may be returned.</li>
            <li> What can I say about such a classy product that&#x27;s made by Thierry Mugler?!</li>
            <li> I fell drop dead in love with Alien about a year ago when my aunt was wearing it, and my compliments were so much</li>
            <li> (Plus, major perfume designers don&#x27;t want to disappoint their consumer, because they are creating a fantasy and must create a product that lives up to that image).</li>
            <li> &quot; on, cuz it smells like no other perfume....</li>
            <li> but, this one has ALWAYS been my favorite (and believe me, I am VERY hard to please when it comes to scents).</li>
            <li> I was only missing the original Angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, I&#x27;ve gotten the general \\&quot;You</li>
            <li> It made me smell like an old lady (and i&#x27;m only 23).</li>
            <li> One of my favourite scents!&lt;br /&gt;However, the package comes with cut off code, so if you want to use it for further offers from Thierry Mugler, you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> So far, Angel has been the only one that received the \\&quot;OMG!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was nervous that I might get a Knock-off of the real Angel.  </li>
            <li> Left wrist with Macy&#x27;s Angel perfume and right wrist with Dead Sea Beauty perfume and</li>
            <li> Probably but hope the next one is new and not old!</li>
            <li> So glad I did, wore a VERY small amount (compared to what I use with other fragrances) and</li>
            <li> It is true that you only need to spray a very small amount</li>
            <li> Angel is one of those rare finds that is so extreme it draws very extreme reactions</li>
            <li> the real thing at half the cost of retail!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too, so you really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one was just loud and made me want to barf.&lt;br /&gt;While I couldn&#x27;t return it, because it was &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;, I was extremely dissatisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is different on each individual, it is not a loud scent</li>
            <li> The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> The scent does last a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it mixed funny with my pheremones, but it was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> it was a little too masculine for me.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> It lasts long too for 8 hours or so.</li>
            <li> read tons of reviews where women hate it (one for 20 years) and then one day tried it and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> Vendor removes the Thierry Mugler Inner circle codes from inside the box (the codes give access to promotions, new fragrances and refill discounts) and is unresponsive to complaint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very different from all of the other Perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> Plus, it lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> The other (square/oblong) one is entirely different.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but I have never found a fragrance I like more.  </li>
            <li> I tried this in the mall a very long time ago (over 10 years ago) and it has been \\&quot;my\\&quot; perfume ever since.</li>
            <li> And it stays very long on my skin</li>
            <li> The scent is different from previous bottles I have gotten in the retail store as well.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this product at local mall previously.  </li>
            <li> Big mess up in shipping.</li>
            <li> A heavy scent, but very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> little spritz is enough</li>
            <li> It is brown (supposed to be light blue) and smells bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I used to change between a few different fragrances, since I discovered this one</li>
            <li> fakkkkkkkkkkkke and was not a real angel.</li>
            <li> the smell wore off instantly and the color was green.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago she began occasionally wearing Angel.</li>
            <li> I have spent over $20 in postage fees, time in phone calls and emails with no resolution or refund.</li>
            <li> Warning: Absolutely NOT Angel by Thierry Mugler perfume.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected nor is it the way it smells in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you decide to try a third-party seller instead of Amazon, please read the seller feedback carefully before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious as to why the registration number on the bottle was removed that I got my wife for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I did complain to Amazon about this, and they gave me a partial credit since I could not return the perfume itself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong smelling, but yet it last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Im disabled and i was down to my last drop,I treated myself to my Angel perfume</li>
            <li> But be warned, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had 3 other people smell my wrists.  </li>
            <li> it only takes a small amount and lasts for hours..</li>
            <li> yet not a copycat of other scents .I</li>
            <li> A few drops of it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Please also note this product must be shipped by ground, depending on size, due to federal regulations regarding flammable material.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed by this lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> There are notes of vanilla, sandalwood, patchouli, and some other things I can&#x27;t identify.</li>
            <li> The box and wrapping were the same as what I have seen with all my purchases in the past from Macy&#x27;s, etc..  </li>
            <li> Maybe this Angel perfume was just old or plain old fake.</li>
            <li> perfumes are loud and to irritating to me or even other people with allergies or asthma if you work in a close area .</li>
            <li> Apply the perfume to your inner wrist, let it sit for at least 20 minutes, and then smell it.</li>
            <li> the perfum is not the real its fake the smell and color</li>
            <li> What smells good in the bottle or on someone else, may smell horrible on you.</li>
            <li> : you either love this scent or really, really hate it.</li>
            <li> On the down side, my box did not have the official Angel number inside the box to receive credit...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a half trust for FRAGRANCENET, without having bought any of their merchandise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typically, you find one that smells heavenly</li>
            <li> However, the perfume bottle was not full.</li>
            <li> Package was crushed, small amount of liquid was spilled.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less pricey</li>
            <li> Not sure if this due to the fact it is not a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> But, a little too pricy for me.  </li>
            <li> I had the sales associate spray one wrist with Angel and the other wrist with Alien, also by Thierry Mugler.  </li>
            <li> not original</li>
            <li> As it dried down and attempted to mesh with my body chemistry, it smelled like stale cigarettes, a$$, and old mocha coffee on me.  </li>
            <li> Was afraid it would not be the real stuff</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I don&#x27;t want it to be too heavy, I&#x27;ll just spray it into the air and walk into the mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the response I received from DEAD SEA BEAUTY regarding my request to obtain a refund from them:    </li>
            <li> The odor was actually worse than White Shoulders fragrance.  </li>
            <li> for everyday wear...</li>
            <li> A few people, without knowing the name, have even said \\&quot;you smell like an</li>
            <li> Authentication code missing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING ANGEL FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND HAVE NOT GROWN TIRED OF IT AND CONTINUE TO GET COMPLIMENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was slightly damaged, not sure if this was a tester bottle</li>
            <li> Subtle, delicate and lasting.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Angel perfume, however this perfume I purchased was a knock off version, which smelled awful!  </li>
            <li> Their (Dead Sea Beauty) bottle smells like BUG SPRAY!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the liquid was yellow brown and had floating things in it.  </li>
            <li> Thinking that this was merely the exception to the rule, I ordered another bottle from the same seller.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a chocolate base!?</li>
            <li> If that ur taste it sure to hate this!</li>
            <li> Me and my wife were reminiscing about colognes and perfumes from years past</li>
            <li> Its smell is not an ordinary one.</li>
            <li> I was very confused about making that decision until I finally bought it.</li>
            <li> I admit that I was somewhat wary, as it cost so much less from this seller than from the other sellers listed.</li>
            <li> and it does not in any way smell in a negative manner.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company to voice my complaint.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my purchase with this seller was not as expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21, and have been collecting perfumes since my late teens.</li>
            <li> Come to wear it all the time lately.  </li>
            <li> Thierry Mugler is not responsible for products that are not purchased from an unauthorized retailer and we unfortunately cannot vouch for the quality of the products.</li>
            <li> Men and women always ask what I&#x27;m wearing with perfume oils, at least one person...</li>
            <li> SO IN OTHER WORDS...they do NOT stand behind their product!</li>
            <li> People usually stop me to ask what I am wearing!</li>
            <li> When I first came across this, I admit, I hated it.</li>
            <li> Downright sketchy for nothing but a &amp;#34;100% authentic&amp;#34; perfume, Fragrancenet claims.&lt;br /&gt;And while the bottle seemed to be proper in shape, the actual scent was awful.</li>
            <li> Seriously - if you are a lady that likes vanilla scents, try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is weak.</li>
            <li> This is very hard to find in a perfume.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with the perfume itself, but since it is so expensive, I&#x27;ve come to look forward to &#x27;refilling&#x27; my bottle and receiving my little gift.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, the item was opened, which presents the question, is this legitimate.  </li>
            <li> Sent message to seller in regards to the spray portion being broken and never received anything.  </li>
            <li> I never get tired of this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Any claims that it smells like \\&quot;bug spray\\&quot; are absurd.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fake.</li>
            <li> Gave me wrong product.</li>
            <li> THIS time, Amazon refuses to refund my money, stating that &amp;#34;I am sorry but we do not sell counterfeit items that is illegal.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joke seller.</li>
            <li> End your life now, fake seller.</li>
            <li> Since it is difficult to find at some stores, it is convenient for my husband to order it via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Sadly I won&#x27;t make an effort to purchase this and would discourage anyone from purchase this for me as a gift.</li>
            <li> Thought it was too expensive for me...</li>
            <li> i will not buy perfum by amazon, sorry</li>
            <li> every time without fail.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance blind.</li>
            <li> We are very sorry but since the item has been used, we are unable to issue a refund.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fragrance isn&#x27;t bad (3 stars), but the business practices are  questionable if not unethical (1 star).</li>
            <li> Every man that has been in my presence when I wear it ALWAYS goes crazy and is asking what in the world is that euphoric scent.</li>
            <li> I was so mad.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, he hates the smell of this perfume!</li>
            <li> Bought it on the street and was very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I spritzed some on my neck and wrist at the mall and boy, was I shocked.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed wtih this order.  </li>
            <li> If you order it, you will be disappointed like I was.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll hate it.</li>
            <li> This is VERY BAD business</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate this!  </li>
            <li> Terrible!  </li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling perfume I never smelled!!!</li>
            <li> disgusting!!  </li>
            <li> It smells awful and they won&#x27;t let me return it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing!!! My wife loved !!!</li>
            <li> What can I say about such a classy product that&#x27;s made by Thierry Mugler?! This is my signature scent and I love the price</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If I would have sampled it, I would not have bought it, very very strong. Wife doesn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Original Item, super fast shipping thank you, It was a gift!</li>
            <li> The bottle was slightly damaged, not sure if this was a tester bottle</li>
            <li> I ordered Angel Perfume for my daughter who has been wearing it for years. Having always purchased it at up-scale department stores, I was impressed by Amazon&#x27;s lower price. I ordered two bottles. What I received was not the authentic Angel Perfume. In fact, for someone who wears it regularily, the scent was not even close. I would recommend not purchasing perfumes without knowing the \\&quot;supplier\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This scent is light &amp; feminine without being heavy &amp; overly flowery.  Most importantly, this is the scent that my husband likes best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about perfumes and there aren&#x27;t many that I like. Even many of the ones I like on other people don&#x27;t smell good on me, but Angel by Thierry Mugler is one that I absolutely love. Whenever I put it on it just makes me feel good. The description of the fragrance is refreshing, oriental and woody with touches of vanilla, sandalwood, and patchouli. I guess I would agree with that description although it doesn&#x27;t totally describe it. Do you know how it is when you&#x27;re just drawn to a certain fragrance and you can&#x27;t exactly explain why? Whenever I&#x27;m wearing it, even after several hours I still notice it and love the smell of it in my hair or on my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about this eau de parfum spray is that it is fairly intense. If you spray it on your pulse points you&#x27;ll still be able to smell it 8 or 9 hours later. Sometimes when I don&#x27;t want it to be too heavy, I&#x27;ll just spray it into the air and walk into the mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I used to change between a few different fragrances, since I discovered this one it&#x27;s the only one I wear. Nothing else seems to come close. The star shaped bottle is really pretty too. The photo here doesn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Angel perfume, however this perfume I purchased was a knock off version, which smelled awful!  Lost 75.oo on this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been an Angel wearer for over 8 years now. It is the only perfume that I wear. I get compliments from men and women whenever I wear it.     My only suggestion is that if you are interested in this perfume, wear a sample because it is one of those fragrances that does not smell equally delicious on everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Angel for 14 years now. I get so many compliments on it. It works well for day or night. All it takes is one spray on the wrist, and then I rub it on my neck and chest. The fragrance lasts all day long. This product is completely authentic, not unlike other products you might buy from online discounters. I am very pleased with my amazon purchase and will be purchasing again. The one thing you should be sure to do before purchasing any perfume, go to an actual store and try it on first. Apply the perfume to your inner wrist, let it sit for at least 20 minutes, and then smell it. Each perfume will work differently with your body chemistry. What smells good in the bottle or on someone else, may smell horrible on you.</li>
            <li> Hi, my name is Tina I am 60 years young and have been wearing Angel perfume for years many of them ,it&#x27;s not a cheap perfume on my budget.  I had a knee replacement in January and would be out a while so some co/worker of mine decided to give me a amazon.com gift card  instead of flowers.  This introduced me to your amazone.com sight.  I had no clue about it and what to do but with a little help from my husband I was able to find my favorit perfum and did not have to go to the mall!  I will be useing you again.  Who knew you had so many varitys of things? Not me smile  Happy to say I will be using this sight a gain!!!    You can call me Angel.  Dont speel and see  that good but I smell good!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.  such a great price on amazon too</li>
            <li> 5:53pm August 22, 2011    WOW!!! Here&#x27;s the response I received from DEAD SEA BEAUTY regarding my request to obtain a refund from them:    Dear Customer,    Thank you for the email. From the comment we can see this item has been used, is that correct? Please know that only brand new, unused, and unwrapped items may be returned. Please know you received the correct spray and it does not in any way smell in a negative manner. It is the original perfume and it is not defective in any way. Any claims that it smells like \\&quot;bug spray\\&quot; are absurd. As per our return policy, used items may not be returned or exchanged. We are very sorry but since the item has been used, we are unable to issue a refund. Thank you.    SO IN OTHER WORDS...they do NOT stand behind their product! So how was I to smell the perfume, thorough the box?    I filed a claim with Amazon and will be contacting the Better Business Bureau.  I know what this perfume is SUPPOSED to smell like, I have a bottle of it left over which I purchased in person at Macy&#x27;s.  This is VERY BAD business and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND people NOT to purchase anything from this BOGUS COMPANY.      I received the 1.7 oz bottle of Angel perfume. Mind you I still have some left over from the bottle I purchased from Macy&#x27;s.  Their (Dead Sea Beauty) bottle smells like BUG SPRAY! I had 3 other people smell my wrists.  Left wrist with Macy&#x27;s Angel perfume and right wrist with Dead Sea Beauty perfume and all 3 people agreed my right wrist smelled like bug spray.</li>
            <li> Have wanted this perfume for years and received as a gift for Christmas.  A heavy scent, but very long lasting.  Very nice winter-time scent.  Well worth the money since it stays and doesn&#x27;t disappear.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Spray spottle and recieved the refillable bottle. The scent is different from previous bottles I have gotten in the retail store as well. Not sure if this due to the fact it is not a spray bottle.  I have contacted the seller and I am waiting for a response. I will update once I have heard from them. In the meantime, you may want to consider another seller.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased Angel by Thiery Mugler for me for Christmas last year..never having smelled it just based on the reviews written...we both absolutely love it..I puchased for him all the men&#x27;s colognes but we are both in agreement ..there is no scent that compares to the womens...it is heady, sensual,sexy, and makes you feel beautiful even when you&#x27;re 60+ years..My husband absolutely loves when I put this on..it only takes a small amount and lasts for hours..I have had many people, men and women comment on the wonderful scent of Angel,and ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing...thank you for this wonderful fragrance..I wish it was a little less pricey I would buy all products in it..I really dont care to wear another..totally sold on Angel in Montana!!![[ASIN:B000C21BT0 Angel by Thierry Mugler for Women - 1.7 Ounce EDP Spray]]</li>
            <li> While i thought I liked this fragrance on me, after wearing it i realized i did not like it. I don&#x27;t know if it mixed funny with my pheremones, but it was not pleasant. It made me smell like an old lady (and i&#x27;m only 23). I will not be buying this fragrance again.</li>
            <li> I received the package in a timely fashion, but had reservations about the item itself.  The package was sent with plastic bags you use receive from a grocery store as packing material.  I still have the plastic bag to prove it.  To make matters worse, the item was opened, which presents the question, is this legitimate.  This is for a birthday present for my children&#x27;s mother, so my concern is related to her health.  Is it safe to use this product?  I would like a response from the company guaranteeing that the item is legitimate.  Otherwise, I would like to return the item.&lt;br /&gt;My concern is not about the product, for I have purchased similar Angel items for her without any issue, but with the company fulfilling the order I placed on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This perfume doesn&#x27;t smell like the Angel I&#x27;ve  purchased at department stores!!!!  This smells weaker than Avon.  Won&#x27;t purchase here again!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I was very please with the product.  Also the shipper sent it me very fast without paying for faster services. I will order again  thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice smelling and not overpowering fragrance.  As always Amazon delivers!</li>
            <li> Wife loves. Was afraid it would not be the real stuff but it is</li>
            <li> When I am wearing this, people *constantly* ask me what I am wearing...if you like vanilla, chocolate, or patchouli, you need this fragrance! One caution, this scent is *STRONG*, so a little goes a long way, you can easily overdose on this so go easy until you figure what works for you.</li>
            <li> fakkkkkkkkkkkke and was not a real angel. the smell wore off instantly and the color was green. never buy from these people</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance, possibly my favorite scent when on my lady. It is overpowering however, and can make me develop a tickle in my throat if too much is applied. It is best when applied lightly and the fragrance is best after an hour or two, so apply it early. I can always tell when a woman is wearing this.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Where I work there is a very nice and attractive woman in a nearby office. Whenever I see her my spirits are always lifted.  A few weeks ago she began occasionally wearing Angel. Now, when she passes by on the days that she is wearing this scent I find that lose my concentration and I cannot get her off of my mind.      I sure could get more work done if she would only stop wearing Angel (but I don&#x27;t want her to, really!).</li>
            <li> You will love your Angel Spray.....It has a soft and sexy aroma to it. A lot of compliments you will receive.Buy and you will be in for a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fake. It&#x27;s not the same as what you get at a department store or reputable retailer. It gave me and my husband an instant headache. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have purchased this for my wife. This is her favorite fragrance. On her, it takes on a smell of honey, which on her is a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume was definitely not the Angel by Thierry Mugler which I have purchased over the years in Retail Stores e.g., Macy&#x27;s, Nordstroms and the like. I contacted the company to voice my complaint. I was given an address to which I should return it so that I could be refunded my money. I sent the package out at a cost of $10 only to have it returned for \\&quot;no such address\\&quot;. I immediately called to have the address verified and got the same address, so I re-sent it at the same cost. Sure enough, I received the package today as \\&quot;undeliverable\\&quot;. I have spent over $20 in postage fees, time in phone calls and emails with no resolution or refund. I have lost all faith in this company and what they say they represent.    I recommend that if you want \\&quot;real\\&quot; perfume, you stay away from this company.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance .Many perfumes are loud and to irritating to me or even other people with allergies or asthma if you work in a close area . 1 little spritz is enough it&#x27;s so crisp and fresh smelling but yet not a copycat of other scents .I recently was hugged by a person whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in years who gave me compliment on my perfume which is a rare occasion these days .</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as a Christmas gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a half trust for FRAGRANCENET, without having bought any of their merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;Why, you ask?&lt;br /&gt;Because of their great reputation, having loads of positive feedback and being Google trustworthy. I would often find myself by my computer on their website, looking at a world of discounted perfume. In awe at how much money I&#x27;d save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you: you get what you pay for. I received the so-called &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; perfume by Theirry Mugler from Fragrancenet.&lt;br /&gt;It came in plastic wrapping, and what seemed like an authentic box. When I opened this box, things started to get sketchy. Supposedly with every Thierry Mugler perfume, you&#x27;re supposed to receive a code printed on the upper inside portion of the box. This code was clearly cut out. Also what was the &amp;#34;Made in France&amp;#34; label on the side of the box was also cut out. Downright sketchy for nothing but a &amp;#34;100% authentic&amp;#34; perfume, Fragrancenet claims.&lt;br /&gt;And while the bottle seemed to be proper in shape, the actual scent was awful. It smelled like a cheap, watery, and nauseating version of the actual Angel I&#x27;ve smelled in stores.&lt;br /&gt;In stores it smelt fresher, spicier and softer. This one was just loud and made me want to barf.&lt;br /&gt;While I couldn&#x27;t return it, because it was &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;, I was extremely dissatisfied with my purchase. Maybe this Angel perfume was just old or plain old fake. Will never buy from Fragrancenet again. Period.&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra $$$, it&#x27;s well worth your time and money.</li>
            <li> The Perfume arrived on time.  It is brown (supposed to be light blue) and smells bad.  This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume for 10 years, so we know what it is supposed to smell like.  It looks like it is old /  and or the prodcut was frozen.  Have contacted seller several times to return at their expense.  Not responsive.  Do not do business with this group.</li>
            <li> I have worn this since receiving it as a gift many years ago (smile). It is the type of scent that will become part of your skin; goes on slightly strong but becomes soft immediately. Lasts all day. People usually stop me to ask what I am wearing!</li>
            <li> Do not buy angel from this seller.  It has no scent.  Angel is a great colgne but this is not the real Angel, or it is so old it gas lost its scent</li>
            <li> I love this scent, I get so many compliments! I first heard of it from a woman that I worked with, I liked it so much that I decided to ask her what it was. Once I found out I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it. I looked around and couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive it was, Amazon has the best prices around! I am 28 and think this scent would work for just about anyone no matter what age. It is the kind of scent that you don&#x27;t forget.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a spray bottle but it was actually a refill bottle.  Wife wasn&#x27;t happy had to then go and buy a spray bottle..  Pain in the butt.  Gave me wrong product.</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume! It really lasts all day and I get compliments every day I have it on.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. The scent is not that great when you first spray it on. But after a few minutes it smells wonderful! The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I ever bought perfume for full price at Macys or Sephora before.</li>
            <li> Parfum arrived on time and they even typed a letter from my mom for my birthday.  Unfortunately the liquid was yellow brown and had floating things in it.  The smell was nothing like it should be.  Amazon helped me get my money back.</li>
            <li> I received the perfume and saw that the code inside the box was taken out....The smell of the perfume seemed different also...so I was going to return it and found out that the perfume could not be returned........</li>
            <li> Great perfume..use it a lot and the price is great.  Bought it on the street and was very expensive.  Amazon&#x27;s price is great and I have used this perfume for years.</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful, all day smell. I get a lot of compliments when wearing it. It&#x27;s a daily wear fragrance.</li>
            <li> This scent is wonderful. I am complemented on how I smell on a regular basis. Two other colleagues have adopted the scent so our office corridor smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Coach purse and it was drenched in this odious obnoxious \\&quot;smell\\&quot;.  The odor was actually worse than White Shoulders fragrance.  This odor of \\&quot;Angel\\&quot; was saturated throughout the purse and was very offensive. I really wanted that Coach purse, but even after 2 days of hanging the purse outdoors in sun and breezes, it still retained the odor. I had to send it back to seller. That is how I first experienced \\&quot;Angel\\&quot; perfume. I find it thoroughly un-acceptable and would not ever wear it on a bet let alone to enhance  a man.  EWWW ! ! !  It is like this Thierry Mugler hates women and makes them Stink.[[ASIN:B000C21BT0 Angel by Thierry Mugler for Women - 1.7 Ounce EDP Spray]]</li>
            <li> Warning: Absolutely NOT Angel by Thierry Mugler perfume.&lt;br /&gt;How do I know?: I ordered this as an xmas gift for my mother this year and was pleasantly surprised by the affordable price attached to the item. Lo and behold, after some cursory inspection, we discover that it absolutely was NOT the same perfume. We contacted Amazon for a refund and, surprisingly, one was given--though not without considerable haggling with a computer. Thinking that this was merely the exception to the rule, I ordered another bottle from the same seller. Well guess the f*** what? Same s***, different day. THIS time, Amazon refuses to refund my money, stating that &amp;#34;I am sorry but we do not sell counterfeit items that is illegal.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joke seller. Joke consumer service. Joke perfume. End your life now, fake seller.</li>
            <li> O bought this year&#x27;s ago when it first came out,it&#x27;s the only perfume I&#x27;m not allergic to.Who doesn&#x27;t love a chocolate base!?</li>
            <li> I love the way this perfume smells. I still recommend trying it out in the store before buying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mom for her bday. I had originally purchased the perfume from another vendor but it broke during shipping and the fragrance evaporated. I took a risk by purchasing on Amazon again but was very happy with this vendor. The product came quickly, way before her bday, and the price was very reasonable, cheaper than most vendors. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> thank you for correcting the original order and it was delivered just fine the second time  all was done fine it was just a shame that it wasn&#x27;t perfect for the Christmas present but it has been taken care of after the fact  you do a great and huge job</li>
            <li> So, i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because for some reason.. the unique code that is located on the inner part of the box has been cut out? I know the perfume is authentic, so i cant complain about that.. $63 vs $100 or more at department stores is a pretty good deal, i think. But beware.. if you plan on using that unique code..</li>
            <li> Is my favorite!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle and amazing scent. Gave this as a gift and she LOVED it. Will buy again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR A GIFT THE GIRL I GAVE IT TO,  WAS IMPRESSED SHE LOVED THIS PERFUME. EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> Love it, much better priced versus retail stores. I would get the refillable bottle to save on your next purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume and I just discovered my bottle is refillable.  I get many compliments on the scent and more than once I have been told that it doesn&#x27;t smell like this on them....so it definitely reacts differently on each person&#x27;s skin.  It&#x27;s light and floral without being over powering.  Many layers of scents and tones.  Love it.  On the down side, my box did not have the official Angel number inside the box to receive credit...</li>
            <li> Have purchased this product at local mall previously.  Unfortunately, my purchase with this seller was not as expected.  Sent message to seller in regards to the spray portion being broken and never received anything.  Just wanted to exchange item for a working one.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This has become my fragrance! Subtle, delicate and lasting. Absolutely love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I think I received an old bottle. Whenever spraying a new bottle, I always give it a few pumps to spray the alcohol off before the delicious mist. Amazon gave me full credit when I called and told them it&#x27;s all alcohol!</li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite perfume and she was happy to receive it for Christmas, among other things of course.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite perfume! It is true that you only need to spray a very small amount otherwise it smells too strong. The smell lasts all day yet is surprisingly soft. I would suggest spritzing it on to test because it smells different when you actually wear it (don&#x27;t go by sample cards!). I get so many compliments from both men &amp; women when wearing it, I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> I hate this!  Terrible!  Smells like 90 yr old woman.  I like things like Ralph by Ralph Lauren, VS heavenly, Tease, Brit by Burberry, Armani Code for women....  If that ur taste it sure to hate this!</li>
            <li> Great product. the real thing at half the cost of retail! Def would recommend. I love this smell.</li>
            <li> It is the only perfume that my wife will wear, and it&#x27;s scent is wonderful. It does not bring tears to your eyes or attack your olifactory like some lesser products seem to do.</li>
            <li> It is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and the size it&#x27;s so convenient to put in purse.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, ive been wearing this for about 5years now, the price is great, i will order this again for sure</li>
            <li> The fragrance of &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; is light yet lingering.  Makes me smell like an angel but feel like a siren.  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> It was definitely not authentic like many of the customers stated here. The bottle seemed original, but the liquid seemed like it was diluted. The bottle was scratched and used. I asked for a refund immediately!</li>
            <li> I never get tired of this fragrance. I receive so many compliments when I wear this scent. But be warned, a little goes a long way. Especially with the EDP. However, because of this, the bottle will last you much longer. If you are a fan of the original Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Alien, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Prada, etc., you will love this scent as well. I am a huge patchouli fan, so if you are too, this will be your go to perfume. It is amazing!</li>
            <li> Angel is like an acquired taste for me (and for many people I think). I fell drop dead in love with Alien about a year ago when my aunt was wearing it, and my compliments were so much and so often, she gave me her bottle. Later that year I tried Womanity and also fell in love with it... I was only missing the original Angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it and got it delivered home. When I tried it I almost fainted! One of my ex GF&#x27;s wore it once, and it reminded me so much of her!! ugh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought to myself I&#x27;ll give it a go, and if I don&#x27;t like it I&#x27;ll just gift it to someone. So glad I did, wore a VERY small amount (compared to what I use with other fragrances) and my oh my... First off being Thierry Mugler, it LASTS forever. But also, Angel keeps changing as the day progresses. Smells like patchouly and some cocconut now, when it was really strong earlier in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read tons of reviews where women hate it (one for 20 years) and then one day tried it and absolutely loved it. Think it has to do with receptors, but also with PH and horomone balance. Absolutely in LOVE with it! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume thinking I was going to be smell of all smells&#x27; meaning good &amp; men flocking &amp; falling over me? what attention I received was birds more s***ty birds!\\&quot; The glass star shaped bottle the size is impressive&#x27; I wish my other great smelling perfumes came this big\\&quot;, no angel thierry do not smell good! Musky &amp; sweet&#x27; not a scent I wanted lingering stuck on me all day\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! She says nothing else comes close to smelling like it does. I must admit , it does smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling perfume I never smelled!!! disgusting!!  I  can&#x27;t even believe people think this smells good!! If you want to smell like a cheap barroom floozy this is your scent!  If I could give a zero star I would!</li>
            <li> As expected, arrived quickly. This is my go to scent. My absolute favorite. The price is unbeatable. Retail of this size goes for anywhere from 90 to 120.</li>
            <li> Vendor removes the Thierry Mugler Inner circle codes from inside the box (the codes give access to promotions, new fragrances and refill discounts) and is unresponsive to complaint. Amazon handled this amazingly as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance isn&#x27;t bad (3 stars), but the business practices are  questionable if not unethical (1 star).</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. I received it as a gift.  I always get lots of compliments  when I wear it.  But, a little too pricy for me.  for everyday wear...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume before and loved it.  This one I just purchased doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing.  The smell is weak.</li>
            <li> Just in love with this fragrance. Get compliments all the time and people are always me what it is. Love it!</li>
            <li> I get stopped by people in the mall to find out what I&#x27;m wearing!! This fragrance is a HIT! My new favorite scent!</li>
            <li> I  receive many compliments on how wonderful this scent is. It&#x27;s very different from all of the other Perfumes out there. When you are wearing &amp;#34;ANGEL&amp;#34; people know what you are wearing! It&#x27;s a one of a kind!</li>
            <li> always use love the scent now for 25+ years</li>
            <li> This is one of the favorite perfumes in our family!  It is nice to get quality and performance in the same package!</li>
            <li> I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE PACKING A PRICEY LARGE BOTTLE IN MY CHECKED LUGGAGE.....THIS SIZE IS PERFECT FOR MY CARRY ON BAG.... NOW I CAN ENJOY MY FAVORITE PERFUME WHEN I TRAVEL BY AIR WITHOUT THE FEAR OF IT BEING HIJACKED FROM MY CHECKED BAGS.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. It is a clean, bright scent that is never heavy. It is not the easiest to find so thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried this in the mall a very long time ago (over 10 years ago) and it has been \\&quot;my\\&quot; perfume ever since. Every time I have it on, I get compliments. A few people, without knowing the name, have even said \\&quot;you smell like an Angel\\&quot;  which I found amusing. I always find a good deal on this on amazon, and have not been able to find it in stores for a better price (not even for the refills on the 1.7 oz i have) I would recommend, if you love this as much as I do, to not wait till you are empty, and order from amazon for the best price on this amazing scent.</li>
            <li> I Love this perfume so much,I got such a great deal on it.The next best one I Love is Coco mad by Chanel,But Angel number 1 hands down and I get so many complaiments on it,I tell all my friends about Angel,its the only one I only wear.If you aren&#x27;t sure buy the smaller size but i promise you will all love it as i do,Im disabled and i was down to my last drop,I treated myself to my Angel perfume and I got the best buy on it and a larger size,Im so thrilled,made my day,small things like this makes me smile as i have been in tears recently as i lost my sister and my mom so it has been very hard,and something so simple But also the name Angel did put a smile on my face.[[ASIN:B000C21BT0 Angel by Thierry Mugler for Women - 1.7 Ounce EDP Spray]]</li>
            <li> I was happy with the speedy delivery. However, the perfume bottle was not full. The box smelled of perfume and it either leaked out or was used prior to my purchase. I will think again before I place a new order with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Original perfume with lasting smell. Love, Love, Love the fragrance:) Pretty large size, but worth the price. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> My Mother loves this scent and so does everyone around her. She receives compliments often with this parfume. Try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Me and my wife were reminiscing about colognes and perfumes from years past and I found out that one of her old favorites was also one that I loved smelling. Angel is the scent. It is a very rich scent filled with hints of chocolate. I think it smells really sensual on my wife, more importantly, she loves it. It is surely a beautiful smell but I would recommend that you sample it in person because the chocolate notes may not be to your taste. But if you want to expand your perfume repertoire then this is surely a step in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Beautiful &amp; unique scent, along with a very unique perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged.  Quickly delivered.  Perfume is in a new sealed box.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the fragrance is way too strong.  It is not what I expected nor is it the way it smells in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I have to take it outside to use it.  I spray some into the air and walk into it.  Otherwise, I would not be able to wear it at all.&lt;br /&gt;People would wonder if I bathed in it!!!</li>
            <li> this is the only perfume I wear and I receive compliments from people I don&#x27;t even know!  Great price</li>
            <li> My wife loves this sent, and I love it on her.  They it would be delivered in 4 days, I got it the next day.  THANKS</li>
            <li> this is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and she has people ask her what she&#x27;s wearing all the time. I&#x27;ve been getting it for her for a while now and have been present when she has been told how nice it smells</li>
            <li> One of my favourite scents!&lt;br /&gt;However, the package comes with cut off code, so if you want to use it for further offers from Thierry Mugler, you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My mother in her mid 50&#x27;s loves this scent. I&#x27;m not a huge fan. It&#x27;s much pricier than some scents I like quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> Sweet, spicy, and long lasting</li>
            <li> The smell is very powerful, the container is beautiful. Would prefer something that isn&#x27;t so strong for everyday.</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume at all times!!</li>
            <li> Angel is one of those rare finds that is so extreme it draws very extreme reactions: you either love this scent or really, really hate it. Luckily, I LOVE it! For me, the patchouli is breathtakingly strong at first whiff, but then I&#x27;m hit with a beautiful blend of honey, berries, chocolate, and sweet vanilla. All of these notes create the most unique scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled. This is a very warm, sexy scent that seems so classy to me, and the star bottle is just gorgeous. So far I&#x27;ve loved every Mugler scent I&#x27;ve smelled and they always last for 8+ hours on my skin, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> I love Angel&#x27;s unique scent. I am always complimented when I wear it! Since it is difficult to find at some stores, it is convenient for my husband to order it via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21, and have been collecting perfumes since my late teens. I&#x27;ve had all the best brands (Juicy, Dior, Dolce &amp; Gabanna, Vera Wang) but, this one has ALWAYS been my favorite (and believe me, I am VERY hard to please when it comes to scents). This magic potion is just so sexy, and men go crazy over it! Every man that has been in my presence when I wear it ALWAYS goes crazy and is asking what in the world is that euphoric scent. When I first came across this, I admit, I hated it. I normally choose whatever is most expensive, because I assume it MUST be great if it&#x27;s so expensive (Plus, major perfume designers don&#x27;t want to disappoint their consumer, because they are creating a fantasy and must create a product that lives up to that image). I decided to give it a try, and once I allowed it to mix with my natural scent I was *instantly* hooked! Plus, it lasts all day long! This is very hard to find in a perfume. Typically, you find one that smells heavenly but then it fades within an hour. The bottle is also VERY beautiful, more so even in person! If you want to have that extra \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;, that extra dash of undeniable confidence, you NEED to buy this! Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Loved it and arrived faster than I thought it would.  Would def. use amazon again.  It was my first time.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Defective!!! Authentication code missing</li>
            <li> This is a unique perfume that you will love. It is different on each individual, it is not a loud scent yet it attracts positive attention towards you. You will get lots of complements just so you know. If you are looking for something different and special, then is the perfume for you!  And the bottle is beautiful as well.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice. Apparently you are better off getting a refillable bottle. I heard that you can get it refilled at Boscov&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I finally got my Thierry Mugler Angel :) I have been wanting to buy it for over 3 years now. I was very confused about making that decision until I finally bought it. It lives up to all the hype. The scent does last a long time. You don&#x27;t wanna overspray it. A few drops of it lasts me a long time. I come back home from work smelling great. One happy customer.</li>
            <li> The ad said that it was 1.7 spray. was not a spray and the bottle did not look anything like I received. Was disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000C21BT0 Angel by Thierry Mugler for Women - 1.7 Ounce EDP Spray]]</li>
            <li> In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?  Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
            <li> Well known fragrance and this comes at a price you could not get elsewhere. Beware of counterfeits in some online stores.</li>
            <li> I must stress that it is not a bad fragrance but certain elements does not mess well at all.  I first tested this at a department store because I constantly see this fragrance at a discount store I frequent.  Thank goodness I sampled it first or I would have gifted it to my best friend.  I don&#x27;t smoke at all but I do eat a moderate amount of spicy foods.  So this might have some effect on the fragrance.  But during that week I sampled this, I didn&#x27;t consume any spicy foods.  I had the sales associate spray one wrist with Angel and the other wrist with Alien, also by Thierry Mugler.  In the first 5 minutes, I was overwhelmed by the piercing scent that is almost akin to ammonia, which the Angel fragrance.  As it dried down and attempted to mesh with my body chemistry, it smelled like stale cigarettes, a$$, and old mocha coffee on me.  Sadly I won&#x27;t make an effort to purchase this and would discourage anyone from purchase this for me as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite!  I&#x27;ve been using Angel for about 3 years now. I get a lot of compliments whenever wearing this.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my grandaughter.  She loves it.  Good value.</li>
            <li> If you have never smelled angel before you should give it a try... My wife has been using it for a few years now and absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li> got this for my mom and she loved it. cool bottle too</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite, probably mine too.  Maybe it just reminds me of her, but maybe I&#x27;d like it if it didn&#x27;t smell like her.  If you&#x27;re looking for a gift for the lady in your life (or your sweet man) go for it he&#x27;ll/she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> size much bigger than picture shows.  I knew the smell before I bought it so no surprise I love it. Soft yet sexy attention getter type fragrance. Come to wear it all the time lately.  Arrived in true speedy fashion as Amazon is noted for. Thank you amazon for wonderful products and great service.</li>
            <li> Thought it was too expensive for me...but so happy I splurged!  I get a lot of compliments...Oooh...you smell good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could become my SIGNATURE perfume...I have never had one before!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells awful and they won&#x27;t let me return it. Don&#x27;t buy this product!!! I am so disappointed. I can&#x27;t believe this got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> OMG i love the smell. i can&#x27;t get enough of it, i wear this every where and get a lot of compliments. It lasts long too for 8 hours or so. Love it</li>
            <li> This is an imitation, It is not the original product!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance; however, I can&#x27;t lay the bottle down like it&#x27;s suppose to or it leaks.  I have it perched in a jar to keep it up-right.  again though, I love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> This perfume never disappoints. Still one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I never received this item. Big mess up in shipping. Notified company and was told a replacement would come and later found out was never shipped. Told I would be have the charge removed from card and still not done.  Never buy from them again</li>
            <li> Great perfume... Gets lots of compliments</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I have been wearing it a long time. It&#x27;s awesome, I get a lot of compliments because of my smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend and she loved it!  Granted, I knew this was one of her favorite fragrances, if not her favorite.  The bottle came exactly as shown, and the perfume smells great!  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I will use this perfume forever.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Light scent, Great product - however, seller sent me an opened/used product. I love this perfume!</li>
            <li> the perfum is not the real its fake the smell and color not original i will not buy perfum by amazon, sorry</li>
            <li> My wife specifically requested this fragrance for either our anniversary or birthday. She got it for our anniversary and what a surprise. I was floored at the amount of perfume for the price and talk about delicious smelling. One of the best gifts I&#x27;ve given thus far. Thanks for making me the winner this anniversary.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, EVER!  Love, love, love, love, love it!  The scent is so fresh and last ALL DAY!!!  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it...plus, the scent conforms to your body chemistry, so it makes it unique to you!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume that i have ever smelled, and i also like \\&quot;Alien\\&quot; by this same designer...if u like sweet smells like \\&quot;Lolita Lempicka\\&quot; and \\&quot;Curve Crush\\&quot; or \\&quot;Hanae Mori\\&quot; you&#x27;ll love this smell...and it last all day on u, its VERY strong, so u wont need much...and its so distinctive that everyone will know u have \\&quot;Angel\\&quot; on, cuz it smells like no other perfume....</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother and she loves it. It&#x27;s not strong smelling, but yet it last throughout the day. Happy Mother Happy Life.........lol</li>
            <li> CAME HOME TO ANGEL WAITING FOR ME ON A RAINY DAY. . ALREADY USED IT.&lt;br /&gt;ILOVE THE SENT. MAKES ME FEEL YOUNGER THAN 71.&lt;br /&gt;A FRIEND OF MINE GAVE ME A SAMPLE . THIS WAS A TREAT FOR MY BIRTHDAY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am very pleased with this product, and I&#x27;m especially grateful to those responsible for the superior care in the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li> I too received a defective product and no code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the official response from Thierry Mugler:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON  is unfortunately not a Thierry Mugler authorized retailer.  We only sell to department stores and on our online boutique. While we have suggested prices, those tend to vary from an authorized retailer to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most likely, the product that you purchased was originally acquired on the Gray Market. Products that are sold through distribution channels which are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer are often times replication of the original products with chemical ingredients that may not have been tested by laboratories, or expired products from foreign markets.  Thierry Mugler is not responsible for products that are not purchased from an unauthorized retailer and we unfortunately cannot vouch for the quality of the products. We can only recommend that you do not purchase from those unauthorized retailers.</li>
            <li> This is one of those perfumes that really gets better on me, the longer it&#x27;s on.  It was very strong and harsh when first applied, for lack of better terms, and it contained an undertone I didn&#x27;t care for.  But, I decided to give it a chance to work with my body chemistry, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.  It&#x27;s now about 8 hours after I put it on and I can actually still smell it.  Plus, it smells much better now than it did when I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice the sandalwood fragrance most and the vanilla second most.  The patchouli, to me, is mild, but the blend of fragrances works well together.  I can&#x27;t detect the lower notes at all, but perhaps they are working to enhance the blend.  I see from the product page that this is suggested for daytime use, but this is, to me, the perfect evening fragrance.  I think both &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; are accurate descriptors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: larger bottles of designer perfumes are the most likely ones to be counterfeited.  If you decide to try a third-party seller instead of Amazon, please read the seller feedback carefully before purchasing.  That is the single best way to ensure you&#x27;re getting a genuine product.  Please also note this product must be shipped by ground, depending on size, due to federal regulations regarding flammable material.</li>
            <li> Its smell is not an ordinary one. And it stays very long on my skin, I cannot say I like the smell very much but it is something different and works for me for my official meetings and dinners.</li>
            <li> If you like the fragrance, it&#x27;s great. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll hate it. My wife loved the smell of this on a friend of ours, and couldn&#x27;t stop praising it. Neither of us are particularly enamored with most perfume, the majority of which I fond distracting (not in a good way) or just plain pungent. We sample-checked Angel when we passed through a dept. store a week or so after meeting with the aforementioned friend on a flying visit. With the wife&#x27;s birthday imminent, and my reluctance to fork over the department store price, I placed an order here. I admit that I was somewhat wary, as it cost so much less from this seller than from the other sellers listed. My fears were allayed when the package arrived on her birthday (phew). It was the real thing, and I scored major &#x27;good and thoughtful husband&#x27; points on this gift!&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Go try it in a store to see if it works on you as well as it does on the person you smelled it on when you thought you liked it.&lt;br /&gt;ANGEL is a sophisticated, light, unobtrusive fragrance, with lemony undertones. It mellows into it&#x27;s fragrance pocket a minute or two after application.&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure you get the one in the star-shaped bottle. The other (square/oblong) one is entirely different.</li>
            <li> Best stuff in the world!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious as to why the registration number on the bottle was removed that I got my wife for Christmas. This leads me to believe that I bought a counterfeit bottle of perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope there&#x27;s a good reason ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll raise the rating based on the answer I receive.</li>
            <li> Package was crushed, small amount of liquid was spilled. Could not return, there was no time as it was a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed by this lovely scent.  I smelled it for years on an elderly aunt and finally learned what she was wearing. My soul!  Angel smells amazing on her!  I just could not get enough of this lovely, long-lasting fragrance.  Knowing how scents alter with a person&#x27;s chemistry, I determined to try it first.  I spritzed some on my neck and wrist at the mall and boy, was I shocked.  Angel just does not smell nice on me.  It was much too musty and powdery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: try before you buy.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite perfume.  I love the smell and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  WJH</li>
            <li> I have used Angel for 20 years.  It lasts all day into the evening and wherever I go, I am asked what my scent is.  Worth it!!</li>
            <li> Good price.  Arrived promptly</li>
            <li> At first spray, I didn&#x27;t think I liked this fragrance...it was a little too masculine for me. But in about 30 seconds, it totally changed into something super unique. There are notes of vanilla, sandalwood, patchouli, and some other things I can&#x27;t identify. The result is a very unique blend that smells incredible. Love this scent!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but I have never found a fragrance I like more.  I&#x27;ve been buying it for years.</li>
            <li> For years, this has been my favorite fragrance. Men and women stop me wherever I go and ask what fragrance I am wearing. ANGEL also comes in a wonderful shower gel.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper for me to buy this as a brand new bottle than it was to go into a store and refill the refillable bottle the wife owns.  Now she can smell nice once again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect scent for me. People on the street have asked me what perfume I was wearing that smells so good. I don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Offensive, musky smell.  Girlfriend bought some and wound up having to wash all the sheets to remove the manly musk that had accumulated.  I imagine this would smell appropriate on a WNBA player or maybe a female construction worker.</li>
            <li> I usally order this from Amazon and love it but this time it was very discolored almost yellow in color and the scent was not as strong as I like.  Was disappointed wtih this order.  Will I order it  again? Probably but hope the next one is new and not old!</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for many years.  My daughter in law asked for it for her birthday.  She was very happy with the gift.  Service was very good.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend. It is not the scent I buy from the dept. store. If you order it, you will be disappointed like I was. The identifying number was razored out and resealed and shipped to me. I will not purchase from here again. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom for Christmas.  It came fast and as described. My mom loves it and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best deal in town. I have purchased this brand for many years and this is the easiest and the cheapest way for me to get it.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;special code&#x27; found on all the boxes which Angel is packaged in had its code cut out.  I was so mad.  You can take that code and &#x27;refill&#x27; your bottle on the  Thierry Mugler web site and get all sorts of little free things.  I did complain to Amazon about this, and they gave me a partial credit since I could not return the perfume itself.  This is the first time this has ever  happened to me and am hoping it doesn&#x27;t happen again.  There was nothing wrong with the perfume itself, but since it is so expensive, I&#x27;ve come to look forward to &#x27;refilling&#x27; my bottle and receiving my little gift.</li>
            <li> I wear perfumes as well as perfume oils. This is the only spray perfume I&#x27;ve ever gotten compliments on... literally. When I wear fragrance oils people comment a lot! The perfumes I wear most these days are Pleasures, Chanel Chance Eau Tendre, Coach, Cloe, Body, and Angel. So far, Angel has been the only one that received the \\&quot;OMG! What are you wearing!\\&quot; People will actually tap me on the should while I&#x27;m wearing headphones to ask about my perfume. One lady even walked briskly to catch up with me just to ask what I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously... going back to my high school days of Cool Water, Hugo Boss, Pleasures (still), CKOne, and whatever else... I never received a single compliment on my scent when wearing regular perfume until I found Angel. Men and women always ask what I&#x27;m wearing with perfume oils, at least one person... every time without fail. So, I always figured I had pretty good taste in fragrances! I could never figure why I never got the same reactions with perfumes. Regardless of what I like, I&#x27;ll assume Angel just works really well with my body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I&#x27;ve gotten the general \\&quot;You always smell good\\&quot; type comments, it&#x27;s not the same as having people rave about (or drool over) a particular fragrance. While I still don&#x27;t receive the same number of compliments as when I&#x27;m wearing certain perfume oils, the enthusiasms seems to be greater on average lol. I absolutely love this fragrance and the positive feedback is just the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!!  Great price!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best ever.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law loves this fragrance, so this was her birthday gift.</li>
            <li> I usally wear this and love it but this I bought from Amazon was very discolored and the scent was not as strong and good as I like. Sounds it is an old bottle... I&#x27;m quite disapointed with this order!</li>
            <li> She wanted it so I got it. :-) I would by again if asked. She loves the sent and so do I!</li>
            <li> Recebi a mercadoria sem nenhum problema dentro do prazo que foi estipulado para entrega. Vendedor recomendado. Produto de qualidade. obrigado.</li>
            <li> A few years ago my wife was given a gift of the Angel perfume and she really liked it. Once she realized how much I liked it, she continued to branch out to the shower gels and body lotions too. Since they can sometimes be tough to find in the store, we are very glad that they are readily available here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not know what it is about Thierry Mugler Angel products that makes them so special, but man-o-man do I like this fragrance. Guess it is the combination of the citrus and vanilla scents, maybe mostly the vanilla, that are so darned appealing to me. Actually, it is probably the great combination of the fragrance as worn by the woman I love and have been married to for a couple decades now. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thierry Mugler products are high quality. A little goes a long way too, so you really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a dude, I am telling you now to go ahead and get this as a gift as your lady will like it. Seriously - if you are a lady that likes vanilla scents, try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING ANGEL FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND HAVE NOT GROWN TIRED OF IT AND CONTINUE TO GET COMPLIMENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS.  IT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENTS.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance of Angel and have had compliments on the smell and that&#x27;s all I have to say now</li>
            <li> My husband asked me why I smell like a mildewy old lady. . . Needless to say, he hates the smell of this perfume! It is not a male friendly scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent at a great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance blind. I do not like fruity or flowery scents and was intrigued by the reviews of Angel .... this is by far one of the best fragrances I have ever worn! Not a heavy scent, I am able to wear this every day.</li>
            <li> This by far is one of the sexiest purfumes out. Always smells great and is a definite head turner. My man absolutely loves when I spray this on in the morning, heading out to work. On me it lasts all day. Love, love it.</li>
            <li> Loved this since it came out around 1992--chocolate, vaniila, patchouli--yum!</li>
            <li> it´s a good seller. Recomended.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Awesome price 2 bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this Angel!!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was nervous that I might get a Knock-off of the real Angel.  I have been wearing Angel for 7 years now. I was happy when I received the package (which was delivered in a short time) The box and wrapping were the same as what I have seen with all my purchases in the past from Macy&#x27;s, etc..  The box was wrapped in plastic with the tell-tale sticker on the end. Upon opening, the only thing that bothered me was that the cardboard insert was damaged. It looked as if someome took the Angel star bottle and crammed it in the box crushing the cardboard. I know that the TRUE Angel packaging company would NOT let this leave the their plant this way...&lt;br /&gt;The scent smells like Angel, but not as lasting. I am using it and learning my lesson.  I would NOT purchase this perfume again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great product , love it !</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t refillable, but for convenience and price, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The smell was different than what I am use to and I did not like it.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be...someone else was wearing it so I asked her what she was wearing.  I didn&#x27;t like it on me though.  Very strong.</li>
            <li> As far as the scent goes..this perfume is superb. However, there is supposed to be CODE inside the box so I can register my ANGEL and receive samples and to purchase refills..the code is GONE..I can see where is was but there is only a white strip where the numbers WERE. What happened here?</li>
            <li> Great smell! Great price!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome....exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be but a lot cheaper than in the store!!!!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> OMG ,Best smelling  perfume I have ever used... Love love love it! I don&#x27;t think I will ever use any thing else , It reminds me of Ambush from the 70s..</li>
            <li> love it! arrived sealed in box and it is my all time fave perfume, cant go without</li>
            <li> Did not have the same potency of the dept. store purchase.  Don&#x27;t know why this would be as the pkging was the same</li>
