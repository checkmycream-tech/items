            <li>THIS STUFF IS GREAT</li>
            <li>but they dont smell all that great</li>
            <li>It is also great to use on the heels of your feet between pedis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>absolutly LOVE this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I wish I could give it more than five stars - its that great!!!</li>
            <li>What I like best about this wonderful product is the fragrance - it&#x27;s clean, bright, refreshing, intoxicating.</li>
            <li>And because salt is a good antibacterial agent, that&#x27;s another plus for this product.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty (also good).  </li>
            <li>good before i used it.</li>
            <li>The product has some good ingredients like limes and avocado butters.</li>
            <li>It feels good.</li>
            <li>It smells good, is nice looking</li>
            <li>I have always had good skin, which was nice...</li>
            <li>man, I am glad I got it!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product and I will be a customer forever!</li>
            <li>I even used it on my arms, neck and chest and my skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>I also follow it up with a nice mosturizer (non-Lush).  </li>
            <li>THE SMELL IS NICE</li>
            <li>Experiment on lime-lemon/olive oil combination on cotton ball after washing your face instead of toner can be surprisingly effective also.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is very moisturizing and wonderful for those who do NOT suffer from acne but for those of you who do, STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li>Life is good. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I highly reccoment this product, it is truly the best product I OWN.. and TRUST ME</li>
            <li>I am SOO glad I stuck with it, the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I then moisturize with Dream Cream (another wonderful Lush product) and these 2 products alone</li>
            <li>but it is lots of fun to play with and delivers a good result.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love the Ocean Salt.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about it.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>You will love it too...</li>
            <li>I just got this stuff today after reading the reviews about how it cleared up peoples acne, i decided i wanted to try this stuff, since ive tried most acne products.</li>
            <li>I thought i would suggest that even though most ppl probably assumed that, but one review said that all the granuals were on top and none on the bottom</li>
            <li>I NOW LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cute.  </li>
            <li>This has to be the most invigorating facial/skin product I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>more even toned and 2)better</li>
            <li>In fact, Ocean does a much better job of exfoliation for me than home microderm treatments that I have used.  </li>
            <li>but I use it 2-3x week, more now that it&#x27;s summer.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my hands.  </li>
            <li>Extremely refreshing, with an addictive, very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>If you have any blemishes this pulverizes anything off your skin, and I use it about 1-2 times a week, mostly at night, and right after using it my face is smooth as glass, no kidding!!</li>
            <li>It really is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>It smells great and it leaves  your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>what I do now is apply it to dry skin for a more intense scrub -- trust me, this stuff truly is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect face scrub to use a few times a week.  </li>
            <li>one get one free sale on that year&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Ocean Salt for years and have had to start purchasing it in a larger size, as it provides a great all over exfoliating experience.  </li>
            <li>Pretty gentle as far as salt, but face feels wonderfully tingly and smooth.</li>
            <li>If at first you don&#x27;t succeed...play around until you get a better result-</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite LUSH exfoliator ever!  </li>
            <li>thing I like the best is the small salt granules that eventually  dissolve as you rub it on your face.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a fabulushly popular lush seller, but honestly, its cheap ingredients turn me off big time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and has a great blance between toning and exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>sodium chloride) put your favorite cleanser on top and you are benefiting from the natural scrub and its healing/tightening properties already.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s one of LUSH&#x27;s best products.</li>
            <li>The whole effect is like having a margarita on the beach, I&#x27;ll take that any day over most of the chemically scented exfoliants I&#x27;ve used before.       </li>
            <li>It is great for all those other parts too.</li>
            <li>but Bliss makes a better salt scrub for the body than this one, for about the same price AND more product.</li>
            <li>I am running out of things i can use while pregnant, and avoiding chemicals...</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it if i had sensitive skin, but the size of the salt crystals were perfect for every other day use.</li>
            <li>As this is a fairly abrasive scrub, it&#x27;s not really an everyday treatment for most, but even with dry-ish skin I use it religiously several times a week during the warmer months.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft and clean!  </li>
            <li>This scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>First off, many scrubs use harsh detergents and ingredients like kaolin clay, which is good for supremely oily skin but will parch your face otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I would also recommend stirring the scrub thorougly before the first use, as all of the coarse sea salt and most of the coloring are in a layer on top of the rest of the product.  </li>
            <li>At certain times of the month my face will break out a little and this is really the best things I have ever bought to help fight that.</li>
            <li>It is great for scrubbing off dead skin (it leaves my face super-soft) and preventing acne.  </li>
            <li>My favorite lush product at this time.</li>
            <li>I love all Lush products, especailly this fash wash.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has been helpful with once a week usage- any more than that</li>
            <li>And, no, I do not work for Lush, I just love their products and their business ethics.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face the most, but it keep you hands looking young</li>
            <li>totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>So yes, a bit of effort, because it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>Something is worth the money, something may not be.</li>
            <li>Read the ingredients before shelling out $$$ for something worth $.</li>
            <li>Then, there&#x27;s the fresh citrusy and salty scent.  </li>
            <li>Actual frequency of usage depends upon your own skin</li>
            <li>Ocean Salt is hands down the best facial product I have found.  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed, and at this point I was ready to throw away any other facial scrub I had in my stash of bath product goodies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the good reviews of other people here will give you enough information already.</li>
            <li>I suggest, when you first purchase it, to take a spoon or something and mix everything together.  </li>
            <li>I actually have drier skin than most.</li>
            <li>My pores have shrunk and the blemishes are fading fast!</li>
            <li>It starts with the color, which is exactly as titled--it reminds me of the Pacific.  </li>
            <li>able to absorb subsequent products.  </li>
            <li>This is the first salt scrub that I have used that did not cause a reaction on my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have open sores or blemishes (watch your eyes as well!), they may sting a little, but salt is very good for wounds, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>cream will sink in better, any dermatologist products you use will work better and you will hardly need any foundation.</li>
            <li>IS THE FIRST PRODUCT THAT REALLY WORKS FOR THAT TIME OF MONTH</li>
            <li>Although there  some distinct white flakes concentrated at the top, the whole jar does contains the salt scrub, not just at the top (referring to a previous review).       </li>
            <li>As long as you limit your use of this to 1-2 times per week, your skin will be much softer and your complexion will look more even.  </li>
            <li>As the salt chunks are large, it requires a bit of care when used on the face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your face and will leave it polished and smooth (note:</li>
            <li>It really smells of the sea.</li>
            <li>Probably not for people who want a streamlined beauty routine that can be accomplished fast, but if you like to play...</li>
            <li>Bath &amp; Body Works started using sugar in their scrubs for this reason, but salt has a great effect on clearing up problem skin and tends to help where things aren&#x27;t seriously broken.</li>
            <li>Just be sure that you wet your face before use, and don&#x27;t over-scrub.  </li>
            <li>You can also scrub your whole body with this as an all-over exfoliant.    </li>
            <li>I find I don&#x27;t need to use that much and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to stretch it out as much as I can.</li>
            <li>It really really does the trick.</li>
            <li>ALSO.I HAVE VERY OILY SKIN</li>
            <li>--i havent really seen any change in my fce</li>
            <li>Ocean Salt leaves skin soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all-around sensory experience.</li>
            <li>It gently scrubbed away the nasties and the salt helped to heal my skin.  </li>
            <li>well this scrub has helped my scars lighten up so much i can barley</li>
            <li>When I first ordered a pot of this and opened it, I was a bit scared, because it was chock full of fragrance and blue salt!</li>
            <li>Throw a bunch of sea salt, lime, lanolin, and coconut oil in a jar and voila, you have ocean salt (more or less, less cost for sure!).</li>
            <li>When I opened the container it&#x27;s a pretty sea blue color and smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>I tried this as a sample, but will be going to my local LUSH to buy a full size pot!  </li>
            <li>The scrub smells and looks amazing and the vodka/citrus combination definitely helps dry up blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Wow, my skin was super soft after I got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I found Lush products on here and just tried the soaps at first.</li>
            <li>I only use a finger tip full.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first products I tried from the Lush line.  </li>
            <li>But what you may not know it&#x27;s that any other cleanser you are using like maybe L&#x27;Oreal Happy Derm in my case, you can just add table salt like half a</li>
            <li>Its made from real sea salt and that is what attracted me to this product besides the fact I always like to try out new lines and products.  </li>
            <li>I have tried countless facial scrubs, most of them being high-end and quite pricey.  </li>
            <li>I use this to exfoliate my rough patches on my knees and elbows (haven&#x27;t tried on my face as a cleanser), and it works great at removing all my dead skin.</li>
            <li>(it is kind of rough on sensitive skin) and use Angels on Bare Skin the rest of the time.  </li>
            <li>I am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>coconut oil is highly acnegenic (meaning it causes acne) and Ocean Salt has it in the ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>Here is my citation that coconut oil is HIGHLY acnegenic.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical the first week I tried it because my skin seemed to break out more, but another user pointed out that it brings all the yucky stuff to the surface, so it takes a couple weeks of use to see the true benefit.  </li>
            <li>Its also great as a body scrub, but obviously will not last that long if you use it regularly for your body.</li>
            <li>have used many an ocean salt scrubs - this the the first one that I have found to be gentle enough to use year round.</li>
            <li>It is extremely likely that those experiencing success with this scrub do NOT have acne</li>
            <li>It does look a bit odd in the jar (it is an extreme shade of bright blue), and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, but the results are amazing enough to where I would use this even if it smelled like fresh skunk.    </li>
            <li>Be aware that all internet purchases for Lush are shipped from their manufacturing facility in Vancouver, so unless you are willing to pay a bit for expedited shipping, expect a long wait time for delivery.</li>
            <li>It is worth double it&#x27;s cost, as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural, simple, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>a must have for any lushie and anyone new to lush products!  </li>
            <li>So my skin is very very sensitive to EVERYTHING..</li>
            <li>Ask for a sample and try it first before you spend the $28 on a big pot!  </li>
            <li>I wandered into a lush store over the weekend and my face is already cleared up, it&#x27;s Tuesday!</li>
            <li>Lush to the rescue!    </li>
            <li>You will soon decide this is another Lush product you cannot live without...</li>
            <li>After only the first time using this product, I immediately knew that the scrub I had been using was not doing the job nearly as well as this product did.</li>
            <li>I always wet my face first, and then gently massage in this scrub-</li>
            <li>Like most Lush products, Ocean Salt Scrub may take a little getting used to (and may behave differently depending on what type of water you have)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought that when I would go to the beach and swim in the ocean, my skin would get so clear.</li>
            <li>you are contemplating purchasing any Lush product, I say go for it.</li>
            <li>and i have noticed that my complection looks very glowy the next day.</li>
            <li>I get two, and they last me the whole year.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I found something ALL NATURAL that helps my acne.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this product and anyother by LUSH cosmetics.</li>
            <li>The amount they send is modest for the price.</li>
            <li>Salt(which literally smells like the ocean)for all of three days and WOW.</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all, even used so frequently.</li>
            <li>MADE MY SKIN SO SOFT AND TONED AND CLEARED MY BLEMISHES.</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft, i could tell that this was going to be a product i would continue to buy.</li>
            <li>one day on vaction in Canada, my friends dragged me to Lush, and a woman scrubbed my hand with this stuff, and I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an admitted LUSH junkie --</li>
            <li>It is a Lush product.</li>
            <li>This scrub can sting a bit if you have any open blemishes on your face, but that can be a positive considering salt is an antiseptic and will actually speed healing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very grainy and it spreads well, so you don&#x27;t need to use very much at as single sitting...</li>
            <li>Aside from using parabens as preservatives (the only real negative), most if not all of the ingredients in this scrub are gentle and not overly abrasive.  </li>
            <li>i typically use this with coalface and in less than 2 weeks my face is blemish free!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad; it&#x27;s a great smelling scrub</li>
            <li>My skin has been completely clear since that first week of use, and I no longer need any of the harsh chemicals I used to use to control breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly a dozen facial scrubs...and none of them came close to the quality of this scrub.</li>
            <li>but after awhile I found it not harsh enough!</li>
            <li>but rather suffer from inflammation or breakouts due to drying lotions, soaps and aggressive cleansing styles not advocated for those with normal or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>different approaches seem to work for individual Lush users.  </li>
            <li>the only product i have found that sort of worked was PRONEXIN (which is an all natural facial scrub as well)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never dry.</li>
            <li>After only the first use, my face felt smoother and softer than any other scrub has gotten it... practically like silk!</li>
            <li>On first site, the blue look was a bit odd...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally like products with a lot of fragrance, but this is so very different.</li>
            <li>I used it once a day at night for the first three days, and as my skin improved I used it once every few days, until finally I only needed to use it once a week.  </li>
            <li>Now when you think how many scrubs are out there and how expensive and not worth your time and money they are, this is a real gem.</li>

            <li> And because salt is a good antibacterial agent, that&#x27;s another plus for this product.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty (also good).  </li>
            <li> good before i used it.</li>
            <li> The product has some good ingredients like limes and avocado butters.</li>
            <li> It feels good.</li>
            <li> It smells good, is nice looking</li>
            <li> I have always had good skin, which was nice...</li>
            <li> man, I am glad I got it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and I will be a customer forever!</li>
            <li> I even used it on my arms, neck and chest and my skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li> Love the smell!</li>
            <li> I also follow it up with a nice mosturizer (non-Lush).  </li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS NICE</li>
            <li> Experiment on lime-lemon/olive oil combination on cotton ball after washing your face instead of toner can be surprisingly effective also.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is very moisturizing and wonderful for those who do NOT suffer from acne but for those of you who do, STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li> Life is good. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I highly reccoment this product, it is truly the best product I OWN.. and TRUST ME</li>
            <li> I am SOO glad I stuck with it, the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I then moisturize with Dream Cream (another wonderful Lush product) and these 2 products alone</li>
            <li> but it is lots of fun to play with and delivers a good result.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love the Ocean Salt.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about it.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> You will love it too...</li>
            <li> I just got this stuff today after reading the reviews about how it cleared up peoples acne, i decided i wanted to try this stuff, since ive tried most acne products.</li>
            <li> I thought i would suggest that even though most ppl probably assumed that, but one review said that all the granuals were on top and none on the bottom</li>
            <li> I NOW LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cute.  </li>
            <li> This has to be the most invigorating facial/skin product I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> more even toned and 2)better</li>
            <li> In fact, Ocean does a much better job of exfoliation for me than home microderm treatments that I have used.  </li>
            <li> but I use it 2-3x week, more now that it&#x27;s summer.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my hands.  </li>
            <li> Extremely refreshing, with an addictive, very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> If you have any blemishes this pulverizes anything off your skin, and I use it about 1-2 times a week, mostly at night, and right after using it my face is smooth as glass, no kidding!!</li>
            <li> It really is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> It smells great and it leaves  your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> what I do now is apply it to dry skin for a more intense scrub -- trust me, this stuff truly is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect face scrub to use a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> one get one free sale on that year&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Ocean Salt for years and have had to start purchasing it in a larger size, as it provides a great all over exfoliating experience.  </li>
            <li> Pretty gentle as far as salt, but face feels wonderfully tingly and smooth.</li>
            <li> If at first you don&#x27;t succeed...play around until you get a better result-</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite LUSH exfoliator ever!  </li>
            <li> thing I like the best is the small salt granules that eventually  dissolve as you rub it on your face.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a fabulushly popular lush seller, but honestly, its cheap ingredients turn me off big time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and has a great blance between toning and exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> sodium chloride) put your favorite cleanser on top and you are benefiting from the natural scrub and its healing/tightening properties already.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s one of LUSH&#x27;s best products.</li>
            <li> The whole effect is like having a margarita on the beach, I&#x27;ll take that any day over most of the chemically scented exfoliants I&#x27;ve used before.       </li>
            <li> It is great for all those other parts too.</li>
            <li> but Bliss makes a better salt scrub for the body than this one, for about the same price AND more product.</li>
            <li> I am running out of things i can use while pregnant, and avoiding chemicals...</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it if i had sensitive skin, but the size of the salt crystals were perfect for every other day use.</li>
            <li> As this is a fairly abrasive scrub, it&#x27;s not really an everyday treatment for most, but even with dry-ish skin I use it religiously several times a week during the warmer months.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft and clean!  </li>
            <li> This scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> First off, many scrubs use harsh detergents and ingredients like kaolin clay, which is good for supremely oily skin but will parch your face otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I would also recommend stirring the scrub thorougly before the first use, as all of the coarse sea salt and most of the coloring are in a layer on top of the rest of the product.  </li>
            <li> At certain times of the month my face will break out a little and this is really the best things I have ever bought to help fight that.</li>
            <li> It is great for scrubbing off dead skin (it leaves my face super-soft) and preventing acne.  </li>
            <li> My favorite lush product at this time.</li>
            <li> I love all Lush products, especailly this fash wash.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has been helpful with once a week usage- any more than that</li>
            <li> And, no, I do not work for Lush, I just love their products and their business ethics.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face the most, but it keep you hands looking young</li>
            <li> totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> So yes, a bit of effort, because it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li> Something is worth the money, something may not be.</li>
            <li> Read the ingredients before shelling out $$$ for something worth $.</li>
            <li> Then, there&#x27;s the fresh citrusy and salty scent.  </li>
            <li> Actual frequency of usage depends upon your own skin</li>
            <li> Ocean Salt is hands down the best facial product I have found.  </li>
            <li> I was very impressed, and at this point I was ready to throw away any other facial scrub I had in my stash of bath product goodies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the good reviews of other people here will give you enough information already.</li>
            <li> I suggest, when you first purchase it, to take a spoon or something and mix everything together.  </li>
            <li> I actually have drier skin than most.</li>
            <li> My pores have shrunk and the blemishes are fading fast!</li>
            <li> It starts with the color, which is exactly as titled--it reminds me of the Pacific.  </li>
            <li> able to absorb subsequent products.  </li>
            <li> This is the first salt scrub that I have used that did not cause a reaction on my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have open sores or blemishes (watch your eyes as well!), they may sting a little, but salt is very good for wounds, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> cream will sink in better, any dermatologist products you use will work better and you will hardly need any foundation.</li>
            <li> IS THE FIRST PRODUCT THAT REALLY WORKS FOR THAT TIME OF MONTH</li>
            <li> Although there  some distinct white flakes concentrated at the top, the whole jar does contains the salt scrub, not just at the top (referring to a previous review).       </li>
            <li> As long as you limit your use of this to 1-2 times per week, your skin will be much softer and your complexion will look more even.  </li>
            <li> As the salt chunks are large, it requires a bit of care when used on the face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your face and will leave it polished and smooth (note:</li>
            <li> It really smells of the sea.</li>
            <li> Probably not for people who want a streamlined beauty routine that can be accomplished fast, but if you like to play...</li>
            <li> Bath &amp; Body Works started using sugar in their scrubs for this reason, but salt has a great effect on clearing up problem skin and tends to help where things aren&#x27;t seriously broken.</li>
            <li> Just be sure that you wet your face before use, and don&#x27;t over-scrub.  </li>
            <li> You can also scrub your whole body with this as an all-over exfoliant.    </li>
            <li> I find I don&#x27;t need to use that much and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to stretch it out as much as I can.</li>
            <li> It really really does the trick.</li>
            <li> ALSO.I HAVE VERY OILY SKIN</li>
            <li> --i havent really seen any change in my fce</li>
            <li> Ocean Salt leaves skin soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an all-around sensory experience.</li>
            <li> It gently scrubbed away the nasties and the salt helped to heal my skin.  </li>
            <li> well this scrub has helped my scars lighten up so much i can barley</li>
            <li> When I first ordered a pot of this and opened it, I was a bit scared, because it was chock full of fragrance and blue salt!</li>
            <li> Throw a bunch of sea salt, lime, lanolin, and coconut oil in a jar and voila, you have ocean salt (more or less, less cost for sure!).</li>
            <li> When I opened the container it&#x27;s a pretty sea blue color and smells fresh.  </li>
            <li> I tried this as a sample, but will be going to my local LUSH to buy a full size pot!  </li>
            <li> The scrub smells and looks amazing and the vodka/citrus combination definitely helps dry up blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Wow, my skin was super soft after I got out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I found Lush products on here and just tried the soaps at first.</li>
            <li> I only use a finger tip full.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first products I tried from the Lush line.  </li>
            <li> But what you may not know it&#x27;s that any other cleanser you are using like maybe L&#x27;Oreal Happy Derm in my case, you can just add table salt like half a</li>
            <li> Its made from real sea salt and that is what attracted me to this product besides the fact I always like to try out new lines and products.  </li>
            <li> I have tried countless facial scrubs, most of them being high-end and quite pricey.  </li>
            <li> I use this to exfoliate my rough patches on my knees and elbows (haven&#x27;t tried on my face as a cleanser), and it works great at removing all my dead skin.</li>
            <li> (it is kind of rough on sensitive skin) and use Angels on Bare Skin the rest of the time.  </li>
            <li> I am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> coconut oil is highly acnegenic (meaning it causes acne) and Ocean Salt has it in the ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> Here is my citation that coconut oil is HIGHLY acnegenic.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical the first week I tried it because my skin seemed to break out more, but another user pointed out that it brings all the yucky stuff to the surface, so it takes a couple weeks of use to see the true benefit.  </li>
            <li> Its also great as a body scrub, but obviously will not last that long if you use it regularly for your body.</li>
            <li> have used many an ocean salt scrubs - this the the first one that I have found to be gentle enough to use year round.</li>
            <li> It is extremely likely that those experiencing success with this scrub do NOT have acne</li>
            <li> It does look a bit odd in the jar (it is an extreme shade of bright blue), and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, but the results are amazing enough to where I would use this even if it smelled like fresh skunk.    </li>
            <li> Be aware that all internet purchases for Lush are shipped from their manufacturing facility in Vancouver, so unless you are willing to pay a bit for expedited shipping, expect a long wait time for delivery.</li>
            <li> It is worth double it&#x27;s cost, as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural, simple, and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> a must have for any lushie and anyone new to lush products!  </li>
            <li> So my skin is very very sensitive to EVERYTHING..</li>
            <li> Ask for a sample and try it first before you spend the $28 on a big pot!  </li>
            <li> I wandered into a lush store over the weekend and my face is already cleared up, it&#x27;s Tuesday!</li>
            <li> Lush to the rescue!    </li>
            <li> You will soon decide this is another Lush product you cannot live without...</li>
            <li> After only the first time using this product, I immediately knew that the scrub I had been using was not doing the job nearly as well as this product did.</li>
            <li> I always wet my face first, and then gently massage in this scrub-</li>
            <li> Like most Lush products, Ocean Salt Scrub may take a little getting used to (and may behave differently depending on what type of water you have)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that when I would go to the beach and swim in the ocean, my skin would get so clear.</li>
            <li> you are contemplating purchasing any Lush product, I say go for it.</li>
            <li> and i have noticed that my complection looks very glowy the next day.</li>
            <li> I get two, and they last me the whole year.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found something ALL NATURAL that helps my acne.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product and anyother by LUSH cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The amount they send is modest for the price.</li>
            <li> Salt(which literally smells like the ocean)for all of three days and WOW.</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all, even used so frequently.</li>
            <li> MADE MY SKIN SO SOFT AND TONED AND CLEARED MY BLEMISHES.</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft, i could tell that this was going to be a product i would continue to buy.</li>
            <li> one day on vaction in Canada, my friends dragged me to Lush, and a woman scrubbed my hand with this stuff, and I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an admitted LUSH junkie --</li>
            <li> It is a Lush product.</li>
            <li> This scrub can sting a bit if you have any open blemishes on your face, but that can be a positive considering salt is an antiseptic and will actually speed healing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very grainy and it spreads well, so you don&#x27;t need to use very much at as single sitting...</li>
            <li> Aside from using parabens as preservatives (the only real negative), most if not all of the ingredients in this scrub are gentle and not overly abrasive.  </li>
            <li> i typically use this with coalface and in less than 2 weeks my face is blemish free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad; it&#x27;s a great smelling scrub</li>
            <li> My skin has been completely clear since that first week of use, and I no longer need any of the harsh chemicals I used to use to control breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly a dozen facial scrubs...and none of them came close to the quality of this scrub.</li>
            <li> but after awhile I found it not harsh enough!</li>
            <li> but rather suffer from inflammation or breakouts due to drying lotions, soaps and aggressive cleansing styles not advocated for those with normal or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> different approaches seem to work for individual Lush users.  </li>
            <li> the only product i have found that sort of worked was PRONEXIN (which is an all natural facial scrub as well)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never dry.</li>
            <li> After only the first use, my face felt smoother and softer than any other scrub has gotten it... practically like silk!</li>
            <li> On first site, the blue look was a bit odd...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally like products with a lot of fragrance, but this is so very different.</li>
            <li> I used it once a day at night for the first three days, and as my skin improved I used it once every few days, until finally I only needed to use it once a week.  </li>
            <li> Now when you think how many scrubs are out there and how expensive and not worth your time and money they are, this is a real gem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking into the other facial cleansers as well such as the FRESH FARMACY since i don&#x27;t want to have to use this everyday, twice a day.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much for my skin, perhaps I did not use it long enough, I recieved a few samples.</li>
            <li> After only a few days, any blemishes or potential breakouts that were brewing, were gone completely.</li>
            <li> I normally have really tight itchy dry skin</li>
            <li> By the way, the other part of the combo was Angeles on Bare Skin, followed by Imperialis in the mornings.</li>
            <li> use only once a week if you have dry skin!).  </li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin, actually I have psoriasis.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a long day at work, or have been at the mall X-mas shopping all day, grab the ocean salt scrub.  </li>
            <li> I had acne problams for a very long time..</li>
            <li> After pregnancy and nursing my skin was dry, red mess!  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have been suffering with adult cystic acne for about 7 years now.</li>
            <li> The only problems that I have with this scrub are the fact that it contains harsh preservatives and the not-so-pleasant smell (some folks like the smell, I&#x27;m just not one of them).  </li>
            <li> That way, when you get to the bottom of the pot, you still have a few big chunks of salt.  </li>
            <li> , I used it on all my rough spots, like elbows, knees and feet.</li>
            <li> It does look a little odd when you open it but the retail person at the store told me to stir it up</li>
            <li> At night I followed it with Baby Face cleanser, so my skin never felt dry or tight.    </li>
            <li> Then I began branching out to the other goodies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll save the salt for my food, and the other stuff for my lotion mixtures.</li>
            <li> And I noticed from the other reviews they are just using it on their face</li>
            <li> A little goes a  long way!  </li>
            <li> If I were made of money, I&#x27;d use this on my legs and other areas, but since I&#x27;m not, I won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Sloughs off my dead skin, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> It will get rid of any dead, loose skin you may have on your body.  </li>
            <li> This is a little too rough to use on my face every day, so I use it once a week.  </li>
            <li> I started using LUSH in 1996 and have been addicted ever since.</li>
            <li> and my skin gets tight and irritated and begins to flake.</li>
            <li> I have been a Lushie for about 3-4 years now (since my trip to the UK), and I have very rarely been disappointed in their products.</li>
            <li> I was a bit doubtful when I got it, but now that i use it, it has cleared up my face tremendously!</li>
            <li> : this scrub is serious when it says &#x27;salt&#x27;, so don&#x27;t use it on or near broken skin.  </li>
            <li> I have really complicated skin, that needs to be thoroughly scrubbed to get off the dead skin, but then it always gets too dry, and I have to use heavy moisturizers, which build up to dead skin, etc.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product after Christmas when they are having their buy</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but my friend found this on another site and it&#x27;s about the same price once you consider shipping on amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comprised of large salt chunks in a somewhat creamy base, thus, not oily at all.  </li>
            <li> cleared up my skin in no time and doesn&#x27;t dry me out too bad like other scrubs.  </li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> the small sample size lasted me 5 uses!!   </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Extremely refreshing, with an addictive, very pleasant smell. It really smells of the sea. Pretty gentle as far as salt, but face feels wonderfully tingly and smooth. My favorite lush product at this time.</li>
            <li> I love all Lush products, especailly this fash wash. I got it for my wife, but now she is mad at me because I use it all the time. It is the best feeling fash wash I have ever used. No lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
            <li> If at first you don&#x27;t succeed...play around until you get a better result- different approaches seem to work for individual Lush users.  Like most Lush products, Ocean Salt Scrub may take a little getting used to (and may behave differently depending on what type of water you have) but it is lots of fun to play with and delivers a good result.  Probably not for people who want a streamlined beauty routine that can be accomplished fast, but if you like to play... The scrub smells and looks amazing and the vodka/citrus combination definitely helps dry up blemishes.  I have sensitive skin and this has been helpful with once a week usage- any more than that and my skin gets tight and irritated and begins to flake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One final note of caution: this scrub is serious when it says &#x27;salt&#x27;, so don&#x27;t use it on or near broken skin.  Bath &amp; Body Works started using sugar in their scrubs for this reason, but salt has a great effect on clearing up problem skin and tends to help where things aren&#x27;t seriously broken.</li>
            <li> a must have for any lushie and anyone new to lush products!  cleared up my skin in no time and doesn&#x27;t dry me out too bad like other scrubs.  i typically use this with coalface and in less than 2 weeks my face is blemish free!</li>
            <li> Ocean Salt is hands down the best facial product I have found.  It is great for scrubbing off dead skin (it leaves my face super-soft) and preventing acne.  I was skeptical the first week I tried it because my skin seemed to break out more, but another user pointed out that it brings all the yucky stuff to the surface, so it takes a couple weeks of use to see the true benefit.  I am SOO glad I stuck with it, the difference is amazing.  I use it every three days (it is kind of rough on sensitive skin) and use Angels on Bare Skin the rest of the time.  I also follow it up with a nice mosturizer (non-Lush).  My skin has been completely clear since that first week of use, and I no longer need any of the harsh chemicals I used to use to control breakouts.  I wish I could give it more than five stars - its that great!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried countless facial scrubs, most of them being high-end and quite pricey.  I have to say, none of them worked as well as this one did!  It does look a bit odd in the jar (it is an extreme shade of bright blue), and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, but the results are amazing enough to where I would use this even if it smelled like fresh skunk.    First off, many scrubs use harsh detergents and ingredients like kaolin clay, which is good for supremely oily skin but will parch your face otherwise.  Aside from using parabens as preservatives (the only real negative), most if not all of the ingredients in this scrub are gentle and not overly abrasive.  As long as you limit your use of this to 1-2 times per week, your skin will be much softer and your complexion will look more even.  Just be sure that you wet your face before use, and don&#x27;t over-scrub.  I would also recommend stirring the scrub thorougly before the first use, as all of the coarse sea salt and most of the coloring are in a layer on top of the rest of the product.  This scrub can sting a bit if you have any open blemishes on your face, but that can be a positive considering salt is an antiseptic and will actually speed healing.  You can also scrub your whole body with this as an all-over exfoliant.    Bottom line, this is a great scrub for all skin types.  The only problems that I have with this scrub are the fact that it contains harsh preservatives and the not-so-pleasant smell (some folks like the smell, I&#x27;m just not one of them).  I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who is looking for a great scrub that is exfoliating yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite LUSH exfoliator ever!  I tried this as a sample, but will be going to my local LUSH to buy a full size pot!  I find I don&#x27;t need to use that much and the small sample size lasted me 5 uses!!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The thing I like the best is the small salt granules that eventually  dissolve as you rub it on your face.  Even though this is made of salt and acidic fruit (grapefruit and lime), I never found it to be drying at all.  And because salt is a good antibacterial agent, that&#x27;s another plus for this product.  If you have open sores or blemishes (watch your eyes as well!), they may sting a little, but salt is very good for wounds, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I absolutly LOVE this stuff!!  Ask for a sample and try it first before you spend the $28 on a big pot!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the Ocean Salt. I have very, very dry skin, actually I have psoriasis. I use this to exfoliate my rough patches on my knees and elbows (haven&#x27;t tried on my face as a cleanser), and it works great at removing all my dead skin. I then moisturize with Dream Cream (another wonderful Lush product) and these 2 products alone help keep my psoriasis under control without using my prescribed lotions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are contemplating purchasing any Lush product, I say go for it. I have been a Lushie for about 3-4 years now (since my trip to the UK), and I have very rarely been disappointed in their products. Be aware that all internet purchases for Lush are shipped from their manufacturing facility in Vancouver, so unless you are willing to pay a bit for expedited shipping, expect a long wait time for delivery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PS: And, no, I do not work for Lush, I just love their products and their business ethics.</li>
            <li> After only the first time using this product, I immediately knew that the scrub I had been using was not doing the job nearly as well as this product did. I&#x27;ve tried nearly a dozen facial scrubs...and none of them came close to the quality of this scrub. On first site, the blue look was a bit odd...but it smells heavely. Despite it&#x27;s vodka base, it smells like a margarita. It&#x27;s very grainy and it spreads well, so you don&#x27;t need to use very much at as single sitting... the pot will last you quite some time. After only the first use, my face felt smoother and softer than any other scrub has gotten it... practically like silk! After only a few days, any blemishes or potential breakouts that were brewing, were gone completely. I was very impressed, and at this point I was ready to throw away any other facial scrub I had in my stash of bath product goodies. I tend to use this product at night just before retiring...and i have noticed that my complection looks very glowy the next day. Not a lot of foundation needed! Give this product a try. It is worth double it&#x27;s cost, as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect face scrub to use a few times a week.  I suggest, when you first purchase it, to take a spoon or something and mix everything together.  That way, when you get to the bottom of the pot, you still have a few big chunks of salt.  You only literally need a pea size amount for your entire face.  Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft and clean!  I usually buy this product after Christmas when they are having their buy one get one free sale on that year&#x27;s products.  I get two, and they last me the whole year.  Its also great as a body scrub, but obviously will not last that long if you use it regularly for your body.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product about a week ago. I already see results! I was using Proactiv after I weened myself off oral acne medication. It was sort of working, but drying my skin out so bad! I&#x27;ve always thought that when I would go to the beach and swim in the ocean, my skin would get so clear. Well, I started looking for a sea salt or salt water cleanser. I found Lush products on here and just tried the soaps at first. Then I began branching out to the other goodies. :) That&#x27;s when I found Ocean Salt Cleanser. . . I use this morning and night. It never irritates my skin. It&#x27;s never dry. I don&#x27;t have oily skin at all. I actually have drier skin than most. This moisturizes AND stops oil. I can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about it. It is expensive, but my friend found this on another site and it&#x27;s about the same price once you consider shipping on amazon. I&#x27;m hoping to stretch it out as much as I can. I only use a finger tip full. It smells great too! Citrusy and salty. Like a margarita! :D My pores have shrunk and the blemishes are fading fast! I can&#x27;t believe I found something ALL NATURAL that helps my acne. I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I wandered into a lush store over the weekend and my face is already cleared up, it&#x27;s Tuesday! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product i&#x27;m hooked. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have been suffering with adult cystic acne for about 7 years now. the only product i have found that sort of worked was PRONEXIN (which is an all natural facial scrub as well) this stuff blows it out of the water. I&#x27;m looking into the other facial cleansers as well such as the FRESH FARMACY since i don&#x27;t want to have to use this everyday, twice a day. I feel beautiful again. I would recomend this product and anyother by LUSH cosmetics. it&#x27;s natural, simple, and worth every penny. FINALLY!</li>
            <li> At certain times of the month my face will break out a little and this is really the best things I have ever bought to help fight that. It really really does the trick. I use it on my face the most, but it keep you hands looking young it try to use it there once a month. I found their website a year ago and I have been hooked ever since. It really is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> What I like best about this wonderful product is the fragrance - it&#x27;s clean, bright, refreshing, intoxicating. I can&#x27;t wait to use it for that alone. It has lime and grapefruit and who knows what else. I don&#x27;t generally like products with a lot of fragrance, but this is so very different.</li>
            <li> Throw a bunch of sea salt, lime, lanolin, and coconut oil in a jar and voila, you have ocean salt (more or less, less cost for sure!). This product didn&#x27;t do much for my skin, perhaps I did not use it long enough, I recieved a few samples. Sure, it&#x27;s a fabulushly popular lush seller, but honestly, its cheap ingredients turn me off big time. I won&#x27;t be buying it. I won&#x27;t even be making it because I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is. I&#x27;ll save the salt for my food, and the other stuff for my lotion mixtures.</li>
            <li> The amount they send is modest for the price. It smells good, is nice looking but Bliss makes a better salt scrub for the body than this one, for about the same price AND more product.</li>
            <li> I have always had good skin, which was nice...but now I have GREAT skin. I&#x27;ve been using Ocean Salt(which literally smells like the ocean)for all of three days and WOW. Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day followed by Skin Nanny and it works like a charm. I normally have really tight itchy dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all, even used so frequently.</li>
            <li> I am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products.  I received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty (also good).  I was blown away by how this product made my skin feel.  I have used every product under the sun and am a regular proactiv customer.  This scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft.  I am totally hooked!  You will love it too...totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first products I tried from the Lush line.  Its made from real sea salt and that is what attracted me to this product besides the fact I always like to try out new lines and products.  When I opened the container it&#x27;s a pretty sea blue color and smells fresh.  Wow, my skin was super soft after I got out of the shower.  Its one of the best scrubs out there, I&#x27;ve used St. Ives, Clinique, Sephora, Bath and Body Works products, etc.  It will get rid of any dead, loose skin you may have on your body.  I highly recommend this product.  And I noticed from the other reviews they are just using it on their face, I used it on all my rough spots, like elbows, knees and feet.</li>
            <li> seriously. at first I thought it may be too harsh (this from someone who has skin that can take a beating!) but after awhile I found it not harsh enough! what I do now is apply it to dry skin for a more intense scrub -- trust me, this stuff truly is wonderful.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS GREAT I LUV IT! MADE MY SKIN SO SOFT AND TONED AND CLEARED MY BLEMISHES. THE SMELL IS NICE ALSO.I HAVE VERY OILY SKIN AND IT CUTS SOME OF THE OIL DOWN.THIS IS THE FIRST PRODUCT THAT REALLY WORKS FOR THAT TIME OF MONTH FOR US GIRLS,MY SKIN DID NOT BREAK OUT AT ALL. THIS PRODUCT IS A WINNER IN MY BOOK!!!</li>
            <li> u do get a big tub i got 2 of the biggest ones..but they dont smell all that great like i thought they would..i also find the salt a pain in the butt at times when i cant get it to disolve..4stars --i havent really seen any change in my fce but if i do i will edit and write about it</li>
            <li> I just got this stuff today after reading the reviews about how it cleared up peoples acne, i decided i wanted to try this stuff, since ive tried most acne products. It made my skin so soft, i could tell that this was going to be a product i would continue to buy. It does look a little odd when you open it but the retail person at the store told me to stir it up good before i used it. I thought i would suggest that even though most ppl probably assumed that, but one review said that all the granuals were on top and none on the bottom so i thought i would suggest that.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent scrub.  It&#x27;s comprised of large salt chunks in a somewhat creamy base, thus, not oily at all.  As the salt chunks are large, it requires a bit of care when used on the face.  I always wet my face first, and then gently massage in this scrub- this helps the salt chunks dissolve and ensures they don&#x27;t scratch.  So yes, a bit of effort, because it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  Ocean Salt leaves skin soft and fresh.  As this is a fairly abrasive scrub, it&#x27;s not really an everyday treatment for most, but even with dry-ish skin I use it religiously several times a week during the warmer months.  And I couldn&#x27;t possibly finish this review without mentioning the scent.  Ocean Salt smells just like a margarita- somewhat citrussy, sort of zingy.  It&#x27;s an all-around sensory experience.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best cleanser/exfoliaters i&#x27;ve ever come across. It smells great and it leaves  your skin feeling so soft. The best thing it that it&#x27;s not over abrasive. I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it if i had sensitive skin, but the size of the salt crystals were perfect for every other day use.</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful exfoliating scrub that I use 2-3 weeks.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and has a great blance between toning and exfoliating.  It is also great to use on the heels of your feet between pedis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many an ocean salt scrubs - this the the first one that I have found to be gentle enough to use year round.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ocean Salt for years and have had to start purchasing it in a larger size, as it provides a great all over exfoliating experience.  I have tried similar products for my face, and nothing compares to the way my skin looks and feels after using it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> After pregnancy and nursing my skin was dry, red mess!  Nothing seemed to help it heal and recover from the insane peeling I was experiencing!  Lush to the rescue!    The combo I needed started with the Sea Salt Scrub.  I used it once a day at night for the first three days, and as my skin improved I used it once every few days, until finally I only needed to use it once a week.  A little goes a  long way!  It gently scrubbed away the nasties and the salt helped to heal my skin.  At night I followed it with Baby Face cleanser, so my skin never felt dry or tight.    By the way, the other part of the combo was Angeles on Bare Skin, followed by Imperialis in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the good reviews of other people here will give you enough information already. The product has some good ingredients like limes and avocado butters. But what you may not know it&#x27;s that any other cleanser you are using like maybe L&#x27;Oreal Happy Derm in my case, you can just add table salt like half a teaspoon(yes they are sea salt ocean salt whatever you want to call it...same thing...sodium chloride) put your favorite cleanser on top and you are benefiting from the natural scrub and its healing/tightening properties already. I use this every morning now instead of Ocean Salt Skin Cleanser. Lime/lemon has the effect of the toner. Experiment on lime-lemon/olive oil combination on cotton ball after washing your face instead of toner can be surprisingly effective also. Something is worth the money, something may not be. Read the ingredients before shelling out $$$ for something worth $.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered a pot of this and opened it, I was a bit scared, because it was chock full of fragrance and blue salt! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But man, I am glad I got it! If you have any blemishes this pulverizes anything off your skin, and I use it about 1-2 times a week, mostly at night, and right after using it my face is smooth as glass, no kidding!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;YOur cream will sink in better, any dermatologist products you use will work better and you will hardly need any foundation. Now when you think how many scrubs are out there and how expensive and not worth your time and money they are, this is a real gem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wonderful face scrub, I will always buy this!</li>
            <li> I have really complicated skin, that needs to be thoroughly scrubbed to get off the dead skin, but then it always gets too dry, and I have to use heavy moisturizers, which build up to dead skin, etc. Horrible cicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day on vaction in Canada, my friends dragged me to Lush, and a woman scrubbed my hand with this stuff, and I decided to try it out. I NOW LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Sloughs off my dead skin, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I&#x27;m addicted, I will buy this forever!</li>
            <li> So my skin is very very sensitive to EVERYTHING.. I had acne problams for a very long time.. well the acne is gone but it left acne scars. and to me thats worse then having acne .. well this scrub has helped my scars lighten up so much i can barley see them anymore.. it makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed. I love the smell of this product and I will be a customer forever! I even used it on my arms, neck and chest and my skin has never looked better!  I highly reccoment this product, it is truly the best product I OWN.. and TRUST ME.. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was a bit doubtful when I got it, but now that i use it, it has cleared up my face tremendously! I use it once a day, at night before I go to sleep. When I wake up in the morning my face is a bit clearer than before. I&#x27;ll always get this product! It&#x27;s a must.</li>
            <li> This scrub is the best smelling and best feeling scrub I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.  But somehow my breakouts wern&#x27;t diminishing, and were even getting slightly worse.  I chalked it up to stress.  Then I began scouring product labels, and the answer was obviously: coconut oil is highly acnegenic (meaning it causes acne) and Ocean Salt has it in the ingredient list.  So I gave the remaining 1/2 jar ($18 I\\&quot;ll never get back) to a friend.      If I were made of money, I&#x27;d use this on my legs and other areas, but since I&#x27;m not, I won&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s too bad; it&#x27;s a great smelling scrub and it&#x27;s cute.  But if you have acne, you should stay the hell away.    Edit 5/15/11: I see that 3 people have rated my review poorly. Here is my citation that coconut oil is HIGHLY acnegenic. Note that this citation was provided by my dermatologist: do an internet search for \\&quot;zerozits\\&quot; and click on the second link. Scroll to see how \\&quot;coconut oil\\&quot; is a 4 out of 5, 5 being the very worst in acne-causing properties. It is extremely likely that those experiencing success with this scrub do NOT have acne but rather suffer from inflammation or breakouts due to drying lotions, soaps and aggressive cleansing styles not advocated for those with normal or sensitive skin. Coconut oil is very moisturizing and wonderful for those who do NOT suffer from acne but for those of you who do, STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li> This has to be the most invigorating facial/skin product I have ever purchased.  It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on your face and will leave it polished and smooth (note: use only once a week if you have dry skin!).  If you&#x27;ve had a long day at work, or have been at the mall X-mas shopping all day, grab the ocean salt scrub.  Rub it all over your feet for an instant foot massage and don&#x27;t forget to rub your hands, as well!  You will soon decide this is another Lush product you cannot live without...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an admitted LUSH junkie -- I started using LUSH in 1996 and have been addicted ever since. But this product, I have only recently started using--and it&#x27;s one of my favorites.  It starts with the color, which is exactly as titled--it reminds me of the Pacific.  Then, there&#x27;s the fresh citrusy and salty scent.  The whole effect is like having a margarita on the beach, I&#x27;ll take that any day over most of the chemically scented exfoliants I&#x27;ve used before.       It&#x27;s a wonderful exfoliant, leaving my skin 1) more even toned and 2)better able to absorb subsequent products.  In fact, Ocean does a much better job of exfoliation for me than home microderm treatments that I have used.  Actual frequency of usage depends upon your own skin but I use it 2-3x week, more now that it&#x27;s summer.  And it definitely clears up the occasional blemish.  My skin (both facial and body) feels softer and smoother after usage.  Although there  some distinct white flakes concentrated at the top, the whole jar does contains the salt scrub, not just at the top (referring to a previous review).       Overall, it&#x27;s one of LUSH&#x27;s best products.</li>
            <li> This is a little too rough to use on my face every day, so I use it once a week.  I use it mostly on my hands.  They have never been softer!  I also use it as a shower scrub.  Love the smell!</li>
            <li> This is the first salt scrub that I have used that did not cause a reaction on my skin. I adore this scrub for the bottom of my feet. It is great for all those other parts too. It has a nice clean scent. It feels good. It is a Lush product. Life is good. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am running out of things i can use while pregnant, and avoiding chemicals... This rocks, and has saved the day, and my skin.</li>
