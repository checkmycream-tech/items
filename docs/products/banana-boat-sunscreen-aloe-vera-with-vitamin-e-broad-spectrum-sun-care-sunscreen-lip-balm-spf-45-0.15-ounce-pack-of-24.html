            <li>Great to find in quantity for a good price.</li>
            <li>The price was good too, we saved about a dollar on each unit.</li>
            <li>I fear that if Banana Boat stops making it or changes the formula like so many companies do, my lips will fall off!  </li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best lip balm I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, got a five year supply</li>
            <li>Package arrived as promised and I love this product for all around lip care because it has the 45 SPF.</li>
            <li>I have never used anything better.</li>
            <li>so any time I see it, I buy as many as I can to keep my supply stocked.  </li>
            <li>I know everyone is different and what works for some may not for others, but for me and my daughter, who is in the beauty field and can get all kinds of products, this is the best!</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>We love the Banana Boat Aloe Vera SPF 30 and 45.  </li>

            <li>Best lip prodect and as a sailor I have tried many other products</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, and keeps my lips free from cracks and peeling and drying out.  </li>
            <li>product arrived quickly, and as described.</li>
            <li>The taste could be a little bit better, but other than that, I´m really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>After using this product his lips was healing back to normal.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I had expected!</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little cheaper, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the best idea to get these and dedicate years to a bad tasting chapstick.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff, got a five year supply</li>
            <li> Best lip prodect and as a sailor I have tried many other products</li>
            <li> Excelent protection! The taste could be a little bit better, but other than that, I´m really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband is a forester in Georgia.  Needless to say, he works outside in all kinds of weather.  This is the only lip protector he uses.  With an SPF of 45, it keeps his lips from getting sunburned.  It protects lips from chapping without that waxy feel.  I don&#x27;t use it, but he loves it.  It is difficult to find in the winter so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon. The price was good too, we saved about a dollar on each unit.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had expected!</li>
            <li> Package arrived as promised and I love this product for all around lip care because it has the 45 SPF.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great.  It works wonders for my dry chapped lips.  I recommended this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> A great way price to give out sunscreen to friends! Wanted to pass it out as a health reminder to protect yourself from sun.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product, not gunky like some can be.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service.</li>
            <li> I bought these and I&#x27;m going to be stocked up on chapstick for years to come. They have a really bad taste. So I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the best idea to get these and dedicate years to a bad tasting chapstick.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for beach destination wedding welcome bags and they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Aloe, Vitamin E, and SPF 45.  Can&#x27;t beat that.  But for some reason, not many stores near me actually stock it.  So I bought a carton of 24. I definitely do not want to run out.  This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm/protecting. I have never used anything better. This product is second to none. Since I started using this I have never gotten burnt or chapped lips. I use it several times a day.</li>
            <li> Instead of waiting for a sale of usually $2 each and for the fact that it&#x27;s hard to find here in AK I bought this bulk pack and now I have backup banana boat&#x27;s in my truck and lunchbox and some coats even.</li>
            <li> Of all the products I have tried for chapped and/or sunburned lips, this is the only one that works for me!  I use it every day. It goes on easy, and keeps my lips free from cracks and peeling and drying out.  CAN&#x27;T be without it so any time I see it, I buy as many as I can to keep my supply stocked.  I fear that if Banana Boat stops making it or changes the formula like so many companies do, my lips will fall off!  I know everyone is different and what works for some may not for others, but for me and my daughter, who is in the beauty field and can get all kinds of products, this is the best!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of lip balm for years. It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Great to find in quantity for a good price.</li>
            <li> Mu husband work outdoor and he got really mess up on his face. His lips were weather/sun burn and it started to scab up and blistered a little. After using this product his lips was healing back to normal.</li>
            <li> I was buying this one at a time and happened across this multi-pack!  Great price and I will always use it!  Definitely recommend this lip balm!</li>
            <li> It protects my lips. And I also have used it on other sun-affected facial areas and they seemed to heal.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm without lanolin!</li>
            <li> We love the Banana Boat Aloe Vera SPF 30 and 45.  It&#x27;s by far the best lip balm I&#x27;ve used.  Very gentle, effective, and pleasant light taste/smell.  Great product.  Wish it was a little cheaper, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This balm does an excellent job of protecting tour lips from sunburn and dryness.  I always wear it when I&#x27;m out on the lake or doing a lot of yard work.</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly, and as described.</li>
