            <li>Great Product, I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter!</li>
            <li>I had bought this conditioner before and loved it.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t smell good and didn&#x27;t moisturize good.</li>
            <li>But I thought I&#x27;d try their leave in conditioner, seeing all the good reviews on their website.    </li>
            <li>, he loved the smell of the product</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair smell good.</li>
            <li>The 1 star is for how good it makes your hair smell.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how good it is.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and does an okay job on detangleing.</li>
            <li>Besides the wonderful ingredient, I love the light vanilla</li>
            <li>This smells good, but the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I will definately be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It works like magic!</li>
            <li>I use this for my scalp and braids and love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>but it certainly smells the best.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>But when it came time to re-moisturize my hair I sprayed some of this on it using the LOC method (liquid, oil, cream) and it worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Omg omg smells just amazing  </li>
            <li>the smell  is amazing  </li>
            <li>Nice smell..still evaluating effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes nicely before styling.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing as well :)</li>
            <li>the fragrance is very strong, but i like the smell of vanilla, so i love it.</li>
            <li>I started off with a very light spritz on my head.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because an easy to use, nice smelling leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>We both love it, the smell is amazing, everyone comments on it, it makes it so easy to brush his hair.</li>
            <li>I will not buy this product any more.</li>
            <li>It detangles my hair after I wash it, and the scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>They both say they notice their hair has more moisture and is more manageable.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can spritz it on during the day to give my hair a boost of the scent</li>
            <li>I am mostly Caucasian and have a bit of Native, AA, and Hispanic in me.</li>
            <li>of us and everyone that is around us regularly love the smell of this product, but we don&#x27;t like the pump and bottle.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Carol&#x27;s Daughter for another Great Product.</li>
            <li>It was like spritzing vanilla scented water in my hair more than conditioning.  </li>
            <li>I have had better results with the Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the herbaceous, floral, and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>Love the smell...</li>
            <li>Love Carol&#x27;s Daughter products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice and love the scent.  </li>
            <li>and now it works much better on my hair.</li>
            <li>NOT an overwhelming perfume-type scent:</li>
            <li>and I love this smell.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>It smelled wonderful with the initial application and even that didn&#x27;t linger for any amount of time</li>
            <li>I WILL NOT be purchasing this product again UNLESS the formula is revamped to add MORE moisturizing, shine enhancing ingredients.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and works for multiple hair types.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>and I *love</li>
            <li>Just re-vamp the ingredients to include more \\&quot;softener\\&quot; for women of colors&#x27; hair type</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>The smell has a okay scent, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>It did not detangle nor did it make my hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>This product smells great, but it didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>
            <li>I have fine, oily hair that tangles very easy and</li>
            <li>And honestly, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the black vanilla scent either</li>
            <li>GOOD QUALITY, EXACTLY</li>
            <li>The scent of this product is wonderful, but who wants to pay that much money for hair perfume?</li>
            <li>The vanilla scent isn&#x27;t very strong or overly sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Carol&#x27;s Daughter fan and try to experiment with most of the hair care products.</li>
            <li>The most important thing for me was the effect it had on my hair</li>
            <li>Another one going to good will or whoever wants it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have healthy hair that is not hard, than hair that smells good.</li>
            <li>The results were smooth, soft, manageable, and great smelling hair.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is a good refresher to use on you hair everyday whether you are doing a twist out or if you have extensions …</li>
            <li>.... make detangling really easy.  </li>
            <li>Guess the best way is still to wet the head and apply light product.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and it lasts for days after application.</li>
            <li>My hair is usually not hard to comb through after washing, but it takes me a good 45 min to part and comb through my head.</li>
            <li>If you like to mix your own liquid refreshers this could be easily replaced by a rose water, aloe juice, oil/s, and essential oil blend.</li>
            <li>This leave-in is a huge solution not just to stopping my breakage but is making styling</li>
            <li>I also like the smell of it (unlike Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner), which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>and if you have kinky hair this product wont make much impact on its own</li>
            <li>but this bottle reminded of lightly scented vanilla water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is light on shea (thank goodness).  </li>
            <li>We have to use it daily, so I am glad to see a good price on Amazon and availability so that I can order it frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells really good and leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It was a very nice vanilla smell , strong at first but vanished quickly into a soft smell.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth it!</li>
            <li>So lightweight and fresh!</li>
            <li>not sure if i can say that it&#x27;s the best moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used,</li>
            <li>This product fulfills my needs, except I have one concern: usually products that have a strong (yet pleasant!)</li>
            <li>vanilla but not overly sweet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use daily to keep the hair moist.</li>
            <li>and I ended up with a comb full of hair by the time I was done....</li>
            <li>I tried this product a couple years ago when I was searching for a good moisturizer/conditioner for mixed (multi-ethnic) hair.</li>
            <li>Use a mix of grape seed and sweet almond oils.</li>
            <li>It smells great but didn&#x27;t detangle the way I needed it to compared to other products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, but it lingers on for days and will interfere with any other scents you put on.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite CD&#x27;s products and I use this daily and love the smell.</li>
            <li>My hair was super moisturized and adding the spray over the product that was already in my hair made finger detangling way easier.</li>
            <li>AND MY HAIR HAS A TREMENDOUS TRANSFORMATION IN</li>
            <li>However so far it smells great, too early to tell if it is working.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, but I did not see any significant gain to buying it over a generic product.</li>
            <li>This leave-in does a great job of moisturizing and adding shine without weighing my hair down or making it look oily.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorite conditioners.</li>
            <li>Simply the best for conditioning and controlling without weighing down my flyaway, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my braids looking nice and smooth and keeps my scalp from feeling dry.</li>
            <li>This morning, I took out my twists and I must say, they had more \\&quot;spring to them\\&quot; and they were soft too.  </li>
            <li>I bought this directly from the CD&#x27;s website, but decided to put the review here because I think more people will read the AMZN</li>
            <li>especially the smell leave my hair nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>it by far, leaves my hair softer and more manageable after I get home from work.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other Amazon reviewers, I&#x27;m delighted with this product</li>
            <li>I loved this product as much as other...</li>
            <li>But those reviewers were right.</li>
            <li>right then</li>
            <li>The price is just right and will continue buying it here until it run out.</li>
            <li>I use it right out of the shower and sometimes before bed.</li>
            <li>I used this leave in right after co washing my hair</li>
            <li>I also use it liberally right before blow-drying to help detangle and straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft, and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>Thanks, but no thanks for making my hair smell good.</li>
            <li>but I must admit it does not condition very much, so</li>
            <li>My hair looks like a witch&#x27;s hair now thanks a lot Carol and Lisa!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditoner and I especially like how my hair feels after applying it.</li>
            <li>A higher quality pump would make it easier to apply and would prevent us from inhaling the product.  </li>
            <li>*! Hahaha!</li>
            <li>My hair was left tangled and the scent is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a build up and the spray concentrates the product exactly where I want it.  </li>
            <li>If I could send it back I would; I kept it over 30 days hoping that after continuous use the state of my hair would get better...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased to say that it left my hair with a refreshed look and also feeling light,soft and silky.</li>
            <li>First I would like to say that I am an avid Carol&#x27;s daughter purchaser.</li>
            <li>I switched back to Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s detangler which is about 1/3 the price, doesn&#x27;t have a smell and works much better</li>
            <li>Better luck next time...</li>
            <li>My first time using this product.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I was able to use it for is misting my hair for hydration.  </li>
            <li>good for everyday use, adds shine and no build up ever.</li>
            <li>I currently have and LOVE the hair milk line, the Monoi line (to include the newly released Monoi serum), the 1-2-3 transitioning kit, the Olive oil infusion kit, the healthy hair butter, the marguerite&#x27;s magic hair dress, the hair balm, Lisa&#x27;s hair elixir, the rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner, the black vanilla smoothie, the honey hair mimosa , the macadamia line (smoother, thermal serum &amp; gloss spray)  </li>
            <li>Since, I am transitioning from a relaxer, it would have been nice to know how to use this product with other Carol&#x27;s daughter products for transitioning.</li>
            <li>It has too much water and not enough super rich conditioning ingrediants.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I like your other products, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t bother in the future.</li>
            <li>so this is a great product for my natural African American hair.</li>
            <li>, just spray  a small amount and your good to go.</li>
            <li>I engage in quite a few athletic activities and prefer to avoid heavy creams and oils; the light, almost watery texture of this product is perfect as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>great for acting control and shine without weighing down hair.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and this conditioner is not only light but also</li>
            <li>I have found that with Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, I really like some and really dislike others.  </li>
            <li>My whole family uses it</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I heard so much about it.  </li>
            <li>And it smells like a dream wrapped in a wish, meaning absolutely yummy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want my daughter going around smelling like cookies all day.</li>
            <li>that being said, if you&#x27;re looking for an intense moisturizer, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Did not notice any real value to buying this product.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like but have to give it 2 stars...</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>I wanted to I really did</li>
            <li>Trust, you do not want to use too much because avocado is an oily butter.</li>
            <li>This helps and it has helped me retain moisture as much as my hair can.</li>
            <li>But for now though .. this bottle was a waste of $$ and 20 times the cost of my Fructis on a sale/coupon day &amp; when I can dilute it and turn it into my own spray.</li>
            <li>Due to my racial background it has always been hard to find products that best suit my hair.</li>
            <li>The price was better than what I&#x27;ve found at other vendors.</li>
            <li>I tried it because the price was decent (and I could do a return if I didn&#x27;t like it) and I really needed something for my hair</li>
            <li>My own hair and my oldest daughter&#x27;s hair are both very coarse and kinky and dry.  </li>
            <li>I was really pleasantly surprised at how well this worked from the first minute</li>
            <li>The scent is quite different; not to vanilla at all, but not bad.</li>
            <li>youngest two children have fine soft hair with big curls.  </li>
            <li>I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Leave-in Conditioner.</li>
            <li>i mainly use it as a refresher  during the week and omg</li>
            <li>Decent midweek conditioner for curly girls.</li>
            <li>WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO FRIENDS.  </li>
            <li>I paid about $11 for mine at Target, and even this is too high to me.</li>
            <li>Honestly I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work as its advertised because its a liquid, and unless its a miracle in a bottle I cant believe anything other than a cream can possibly detangle all this denseness I have going on.</li>
            <li>It smells great - not too pungent not to faint-</li>
            <li>I wear a short hairstyle and rarely have to worry about detangling my hair.</li>
            <li>I had to add my normal detangler (Design Essentials, with olive oil and aloe vera juice).</li>
            <li>Normally, I don&#x27;t use \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; products and I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.</li>
            <li>It is a nice but lightweight leave in conditioner that moistens the hair and makes it a bit soft but its no better than lusters s curl activator or kinky curly knot today leave in.</li>
            <li>But it is absolutely missing the moisturization we ladies desparately need that have this challenging hair type.</li>
            <li>This product is beneficial for our scalps which dry out quickly, and makes our hair shiny but not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly dry hair and this product left it feeling soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a quick detangler for my daughters (4a) hair in the mornings when it is dry and needs to be refreshed.</li>
            <li>She has very soft curly hair and tons of flyaways.  </li>
            <li>my first and &#x27;only&#x27; weave</li>
            <li>My hair is very fragile and dry out easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dissuade people from making a purchase because you could have great results, but if you use once and notice you can barely get a comb through your head, don&#x27;t attribute it to having done something wrong yourself.</li>
            <li>I read through all the reviews on the Carol&#x27;s daughter website and there were definitely a lot of mixed reviews but being the loyal Carol&#x27;s daughter fan that I am</li>
            <li>and my hair only felt wet with a strong smell of vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I washed it out and my hair clearly had alot of damage from this product...</li>
            <li>2.leaves hair soft .</li>
            <li>Also my hair feels soft and it has sheen...</li>
            <li>My sister uses these products and got my mother to try who has natural hair.</li>
            <li>We wear natural styles (</li>
            <li>FYI, product scent does not stink up the room, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I am a natural hair lover &amp; I am always in need of a conditioner.</li>
            <li>(smell too intense and too-sticky texture), so I was reluctant to try this when I saw it at my local store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my 6 year old sons hair for 4 years.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re sensitive to smell this is something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well my hair is always soft.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural (eg.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and moisturized this line of products.</li>
            <li>There are only a couple of reviews (if that) for the Black Vanilla product when there were previously a lot more and they only left the glowing reviews up which gave 4 or more stars.</li>
            <li>I use this daily, particularly in the summer months.</li>
            <li>Still love the smell, even 23 months after my first purchase but sorry Carol&#x27;s Daughter for the review on your product.</li>
            <li>I will most likely try this another time but on her wet head only because I spent the money on it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not enough on it&#x27;s own, but using it in conjunction with a little olive oil or a small bit of the Mimosa Hair Honey works to keep my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This is my hair ritual: deep cleasing shampoo, Khoret Amen shampoo, Pantene relaxed and natural breakage defense hair mask, Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner, KA hair oil, and Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair milk.</li>
            <li>Its just so lightweight that its barely there</li>
            <li>I currently have fully natural 4a/b textured hair, I also used CDs products during my 1 year and 1 month transition; all of her products have done me justice except this one.</li>
            <li>Considering I ordered this product on New Year&#x27;s Eve, it was an incredibly LONG wait to receive this product.</li>
            <li>It not only smells terrific, but keeps my curly hair from frizzing and getting too wild.</li>
            <li>I must say this leave-in conditioning product did nothing but make my short-cut, natural (African American) hair feel coarser after applying.</li>
            <li>I really like the Black Vanilla conditioner.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it, is that once the day is complete my hair feels dry.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, curly/wavy hair that is prone to frizz and dryness at the ends and oily at the roots.</li>
            <li>I pull out so much of my hair in little knots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what ingrediants in this product that makes my hair dry, but this product has to be mixed with a super charged leave in conditioner for this hair type.</li>

            <li> Great Product, I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter!</li>
            <li> I had bought this conditioner before and loved it.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t smell good and didn&#x27;t moisturize good.</li>
            <li> But I thought I&#x27;d try their leave in conditioner, seeing all the good reviews on their website.    </li>
            <li> , he loved the smell of the product</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair smell good.</li>
            <li> The 1 star is for how good it makes your hair smell.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how good it is.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and does an okay job on detangleing.</li>
            <li> Besides the wonderful ingredient, I love the light vanilla</li>
            <li> This smells good, but the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I will definately be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It works like magic!</li>
            <li> I use this for my scalp and braids and love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> but it certainly smells the best.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> But when it came time to re-moisturize my hair I sprayed some of this on it using the LOC method (liquid, oil, cream) and it worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Omg omg smells just amazing  </li>
            <li> the smell  is amazing  </li>
            <li> Nice smell..still evaluating effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes nicely before styling.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing as well :)</li>
            <li> the fragrance is very strong, but i like the smell of vanilla, so i love it.</li>
            <li> I started off with a very light spritz on my head.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because an easy to use, nice smelling leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> We both love it, the smell is amazing, everyone comments on it, it makes it so easy to brush his hair.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product any more.</li>
            <li> It detangles my hair after I wash it, and the scent is lovely.</li>
            <li> They both say they notice their hair has more moisture and is more manageable.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can spritz it on during the day to give my hair a boost of the scent</li>
            <li> I am mostly Caucasian and have a bit of Native, AA, and Hispanic in me.</li>
            <li> of us and everyone that is around us regularly love the smell of this product, but we don&#x27;t like the pump and bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Carol&#x27;s Daughter for another Great Product.</li>
            <li> It was like spritzing vanilla scented water in my hair more than conditioning.  </li>
            <li> I have had better results with the Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the herbaceous, floral, and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell...</li>
            <li> Love Carol&#x27;s Daughter products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and love the scent.  </li>
            <li> and now it works much better on my hair.</li>
            <li> NOT an overwhelming perfume-type scent:</li>
            <li> and I love this smell.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> It smelled wonderful with the initial application and even that didn&#x27;t linger for any amount of time</li>
            <li> I WILL NOT be purchasing this product again UNLESS the formula is revamped to add MORE moisturizing, shine enhancing ingredients.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and works for multiple hair types.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> and I *love</li>
            <li> Just re-vamp the ingredients to include more \\&quot;softener\\&quot; for women of colors&#x27; hair type</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> The smell has a okay scent, but not for me.  </li>
            <li> It did not detangle nor did it make my hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li> This product smells great, but it didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>
            <li> I have fine, oily hair that tangles very easy and</li>
            <li> And honestly, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the black vanilla scent either</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY, EXACTLY</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is wonderful, but who wants to pay that much money for hair perfume?</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent isn&#x27;t very strong or overly sweet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Carol&#x27;s Daughter fan and try to experiment with most of the hair care products.</li>
            <li> The most important thing for me was the effect it had on my hair</li>
            <li> Another one going to good will or whoever wants it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have healthy hair that is not hard, than hair that smells good.</li>
            <li> The results were smooth, soft, manageable, and great smelling hair.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is a good refresher to use on you hair everyday whether you are doing a twist out or if you have extensions …</li>
            <li> .... make detangling really easy.  </li>
            <li> Guess the best way is still to wet the head and apply light product.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and it lasts for days after application.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually not hard to comb through after washing, but it takes me a good 45 min to part and comb through my head.</li>
            <li> If you like to mix your own liquid refreshers this could be easily replaced by a rose water, aloe juice, oil/s, and essential oil blend.</li>
            <li> This leave-in is a huge solution not just to stopping my breakage but is making styling</li>
            <li> I also like the smell of it (unlike Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner), which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> and if you have kinky hair this product wont make much impact on its own</li>
            <li> but this bottle reminded of lightly scented vanilla water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is light on shea (thank goodness).  </li>
            <li> We have to use it daily, so I am glad to see a good price on Amazon and availability so that I can order it frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells really good and leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It was a very nice vanilla smell , strong at first but vanished quickly into a soft smell.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth it!</li>
            <li> So lightweight and fresh!</li>
            <li> not sure if i can say that it&#x27;s the best moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used,</li>
            <li> This product fulfills my needs, except I have one concern: usually products that have a strong (yet pleasant!)</li>
            <li> vanilla but not overly sweet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use daily to keep the hair moist.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with a comb full of hair by the time I was done....</li>
            <li> I tried this product a couple years ago when I was searching for a good moisturizer/conditioner for mixed (multi-ethnic) hair.</li>
            <li> Use a mix of grape seed and sweet almond oils.</li>
            <li> It smells great but didn&#x27;t detangle the way I needed it to compared to other products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, but it lingers on for days and will interfere with any other scents you put on.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite CD&#x27;s products and I use this daily and love the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair was super moisturized and adding the spray over the product that was already in my hair made finger detangling way easier.</li>
            <li> AND MY HAIR HAS A TREMENDOUS TRANSFORMATION IN</li>
            <li> However so far it smells great, too early to tell if it is working.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice, but I did not see any significant gain to buying it over a generic product.</li>
            <li> This leave-in does a great job of moisturizing and adding shine without weighing my hair down or making it look oily.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite conditioners.</li>
            <li> Simply the best for conditioning and controlling without weighing down my flyaway, fine hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my braids looking nice and smooth and keeps my scalp from feeling dry.</li>
            <li> This morning, I took out my twists and I must say, they had more \\&quot;spring to them\\&quot; and they were soft too.  </li>
            <li> I bought this directly from the CD&#x27;s website, but decided to put the review here because I think more people will read the AMZN</li>
            <li> especially the smell leave my hair nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> it by far, leaves my hair softer and more manageable after I get home from work.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other Amazon reviewers, I&#x27;m delighted with this product</li>
            <li> I loved this product as much as other...</li>
            <li> But those reviewers were right.</li>
            <li> right then</li>
            <li> The price is just right and will continue buying it here until it run out.</li>
            <li> I use it right out of the shower and sometimes before bed.</li>
            <li> I used this leave in right after co washing my hair</li>
            <li> I also use it liberally right before blow-drying to help detangle and straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft, and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> Thanks, but no thanks for making my hair smell good.</li>
            <li> but I must admit it does not condition very much, so</li>
            <li> My hair looks like a witch&#x27;s hair now thanks a lot Carol and Lisa!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditoner and I especially like how my hair feels after applying it.</li>
            <li> A higher quality pump would make it easier to apply and would prevent us from inhaling the product.  </li>
            <li> *! Hahaha!</li>
            <li> My hair was left tangled and the scent is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a build up and the spray concentrates the product exactly where I want it.  </li>
            <li> If I could send it back I would; I kept it over 30 days hoping that after continuous use the state of my hair would get better...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased to say that it left my hair with a refreshed look and also feeling light,soft and silky.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say that I am an avid Carol&#x27;s daughter purchaser.</li>
            <li> I switched back to Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s detangler which is about 1/3 the price, doesn&#x27;t have a smell and works much better</li>
            <li> Better luck next time...</li>
            <li> My first time using this product.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I was able to use it for is misting my hair for hydration.  </li>
            <li> good for everyday use, adds shine and no build up ever.</li>
            <li> I currently have and LOVE the hair milk line, the Monoi line (to include the newly released Monoi serum), the 1-2-3 transitioning kit, the Olive oil infusion kit, the healthy hair butter, the marguerite&#x27;s magic hair dress, the hair balm, Lisa&#x27;s hair elixir, the rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner, the black vanilla smoothie, the honey hair mimosa , the macadamia line (smoother, thermal serum &amp; gloss spray)  </li>
            <li> Since, I am transitioning from a relaxer, it would have been nice to know how to use this product with other Carol&#x27;s daughter products for transitioning.</li>
            <li> It has too much water and not enough super rich conditioning ingrediants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I like your other products, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t bother in the future.</li>
            <li> so this is a great product for my natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> , just spray  a small amount and your good to go.</li>
            <li> I engage in quite a few athletic activities and prefer to avoid heavy creams and oils; the light, almost watery texture of this product is perfect as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> great for acting control and shine without weighing down hair.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and this conditioner is not only light but also</li>
            <li> I have found that with Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, I really like some and really dislike others.  </li>
            <li> My whole family uses it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I heard so much about it.  </li>
            <li> And it smells like a dream wrapped in a wish, meaning absolutely yummy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really want my daughter going around smelling like cookies all day.</li>
            <li> that being said, if you&#x27;re looking for an intense moisturizer, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any real value to buying this product.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like but have to give it 2 stars...</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> I wanted to I really did</li>
            <li> Trust, you do not want to use too much because avocado is an oily butter.</li>
            <li> This helps and it has helped me retain moisture as much as my hair can.</li>
            <li> But for now though .. this bottle was a waste of $$ and 20 times the cost of my Fructis on a sale/coupon day &amp; when I can dilute it and turn it into my own spray.</li>
            <li> Due to my racial background it has always been hard to find products that best suit my hair.</li>
            <li> The price was better than what I&#x27;ve found at other vendors.</li>
            <li> I tried it because the price was decent (and I could do a return if I didn&#x27;t like it) and I really needed something for my hair</li>
            <li> My own hair and my oldest daughter&#x27;s hair are both very coarse and kinky and dry.  </li>
            <li> I was really pleasantly surprised at how well this worked from the first minute</li>
            <li> The scent is quite different; not to vanilla at all, but not bad.</li>
            <li> youngest two children have fine soft hair with big curls.  </li>
            <li> I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Leave-in Conditioner.</li>
            <li> i mainly use it as a refresher  during the week and omg</li>
            <li> Decent midweek conditioner for curly girls.</li>
            <li> WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO FRIENDS.  </li>
            <li> I paid about $11 for mine at Target, and even this is too high to me.</li>
            <li> Honestly I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work as its advertised because its a liquid, and unless its a miracle in a bottle I cant believe anything other than a cream can possibly detangle all this denseness I have going on.</li>
            <li> It smells great - not too pungent not to faint-</li>
            <li> I wear a short hairstyle and rarely have to worry about detangling my hair.</li>
            <li> I had to add my normal detangler (Design Essentials, with olive oil and aloe vera juice).</li>
            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t use \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; products and I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> It is a nice but lightweight leave in conditioner that moistens the hair and makes it a bit soft but its no better than lusters s curl activator or kinky curly knot today leave in.</li>
            <li> But it is absolutely missing the moisturization we ladies desparately need that have this challenging hair type.</li>
            <li> This product is beneficial for our scalps which dry out quickly, and makes our hair shiny but not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly dry hair and this product left it feeling soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a quick detangler for my daughters (4a) hair in the mornings when it is dry and needs to be refreshed.</li>
            <li> She has very soft curly hair and tons of flyaways.  </li>
            <li> my first and &#x27;only&#x27; weave</li>
            <li> My hair is very fragile and dry out easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dissuade people from making a purchase because you could have great results, but if you use once and notice you can barely get a comb through your head, don&#x27;t attribute it to having done something wrong yourself.</li>
            <li> I read through all the reviews on the Carol&#x27;s daughter website and there were definitely a lot of mixed reviews but being the loyal Carol&#x27;s daughter fan that I am</li>
            <li> and my hair only felt wet with a strong smell of vanilla.  </li>
            <li> I washed it out and my hair clearly had alot of damage from this product...</li>
            <li> 2.leaves hair soft .</li>
            <li> Also my hair feels soft and it has sheen...</li>
            <li> My sister uses these products and got my mother to try who has natural hair.</li>
            <li> We wear natural styles (</li>
            <li> FYI, product scent does not stink up the room, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I am a natural hair lover &amp; I am always in need of a conditioner.</li>
            <li> (smell too intense and too-sticky texture), so I was reluctant to try this when I saw it at my local store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my 6 year old sons hair for 4 years.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re sensitive to smell this is something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well my hair is always soft.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural (eg.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and moisturized this line of products.</li>
            <li> There are only a couple of reviews (if that) for the Black Vanilla product when there were previously a lot more and they only left the glowing reviews up which gave 4 or more stars.</li>
            <li> I use this daily, particularly in the summer months.</li>
            <li> Still love the smell, even 23 months after my first purchase but sorry Carol&#x27;s Daughter for the review on your product.</li>
            <li> I will most likely try this another time but on her wet head only because I spent the money on it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not enough on it&#x27;s own, but using it in conjunction with a little olive oil or a small bit of the Mimosa Hair Honey works to keep my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This is my hair ritual: deep cleasing shampoo, Khoret Amen shampoo, Pantene relaxed and natural breakage defense hair mask, Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner, KA hair oil, and Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair milk.</li>
            <li> Its just so lightweight that its barely there</li>
            <li> I currently have fully natural 4a/b textured hair, I also used CDs products during my 1 year and 1 month transition; all of her products have done me justice except this one.</li>
            <li> Considering I ordered this product on New Year&#x27;s Eve, it was an incredibly LONG wait to receive this product.</li>
            <li> It not only smells terrific, but keeps my curly hair from frizzing and getting too wild.</li>
            <li> I must say this leave-in conditioning product did nothing but make my short-cut, natural (African American) hair feel coarser after applying.</li>
            <li> I really like the Black Vanilla conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it, is that once the day is complete my hair feels dry.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, curly/wavy hair that is prone to frizz and dryness at the ends and oily at the roots.</li>
            <li> I pull out so much of my hair in little knots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what ingrediants in this product that makes my hair dry, but this product has to be mixed with a super charged leave in conditioner for this hair type.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out my Black Vanilla leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s also funny that if you go look on the website this product no longer has those negative reviews up.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have collar bone length, 4B/4C, thirsty, thick hair.</li>
            <li> It was worse then when I use my normal product, and it made my hair seem like it was really crispy and dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who has dry hair, but especially for people who wear their hair kinky-curly.</li>
            <li> Granted I did only use this on dry hair, but the product claims that is what it is for.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair so dry like weeds or hay</li>
            <li> and I intend on purchasing the two newly released Lisa&#x27;s elixir fortifying hair scalp spray/restoring oil; HOWEVER, I will NEVER, EVER purchase the black vanilla spray leave in unless there are some changes!</li>
            <li> It may work for other textures but definitely serves no benefit to my coarse, kinky, coily 4a/b texture.</li>
            <li> My hair was left very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> My hair is an odd texture and super thick.</li>
            <li> I have fragile, thin, so-called 4B/C hair that does not like SHEA butter or olive or COCONUT oil very much.</li>
            <li> but the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger in my hair that long.</li>
            <li> I have been a product junkie for about four years and NOTHING seemed to work because natural hair products heavily use SHEA a basis.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t as excited with the results.</li>
            <li> In an attempt to salvage this product I have mixed it with other watery or creamy leave-ins that I know WORK for me in order to use it up.</li>
            <li> This made my hair dry</li>
            <li> this product seemed to dry my hair out and did not help detangle it at all.</li>
            <li> After blow drying, my hair felt stripped and looked rather dry.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I have ever bought.made my hair dry and tangled.a</li>
            <li> Directions say that it can be used on dry hair and that it makes detangling a cinch.</li>
            <li> I am going natural and this helps with my short thick hair.  </li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you that my hair has never been more dry, tangled and nearly impossible to run a comb through as when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a leave in conditioner that I could use on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> As a MOF, I still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> Well, for the past several months I have used the following regimen</li>
            <li> Shampoo and deep condition with Carol Daughter&#x27;s \\&quot;Black</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this product, but it dried my hair out :(  </li>
            <li> Total mess</li>
            <li> I have been natural over 20 years and it has been very difficult for me to find the right products for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and a lot of it, and I have very hard time brushing it when wet...</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about it is at times it can make your hair a little sticky.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to get the comb through the sections and it left the hair feeling sticky and like straw with much breakage.</li>
            <li> A textured surface on the bottle would make it harder to slip out of hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get a wide tooth comb through.</li>
            <li> I also use this conditioner throughout the week to keep my hair looking fresh and twisted when it hasn&#x27;t be re-twisted in awhile.</li>
            <li> this product made brushing MUCH harder</li>
            <li> I slowly increased the amount of spritz daily since 4b/4c needs moisturization on the daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have very tightly curled hair with various textures (varying between 4a and 4b type).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend Black Vanilla to anyone with dry, damaged or brittle hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It works as a daily moisturizer for my relatively dry, relaxed, thick hair without adding any weight to it -</li>
            <li> but it is extremely drying, by the time I had finished combing my hair</li>
            <li> This product temporarily softened my hair until it dried, then my hair became dry and crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Totally not worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle and cost to return.</li>
            <li> The rest of the Black Vanilla is too heavy on my hair but this specific product is something I spritz into my hair everyday and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my hair, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I use the Black Vanilla Herbal Shampoo, the Leave-in Conditioner and the Hair Smoothie.</li>
            <li> As i write this I am sitting under my dryer, having just washed my hair and put in the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Shampooed my hair with the black vanilla shampoo and then tried out the black vanilla leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I received my Black Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner yesterday.</li>
            <li> I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisturizing every day.  </li>
            <li> B000PI4J3G Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Black Vanilla (Moisturizing) Leave-in Conditioner, 8-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> The black vanilla leave in claims to provide your hair with shine, easier detangling and softness of which none of these happened for me.</li>
            <li> I also use the Black Vanilla Moisturizing Shampoo along with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> what a freaking mess</li>
            <li> a crunchy dried mess it was.  </li>
            <li> Adds a little shine and smells yummy</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on sections of hair before I dry flat twisted.</li>
            <li> this product actually made my hair worse.</li>
            <li> Therefore, use sparingly just before blow drying, and don&#x27;t expect your dead ends to heal from use of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Inexpensive store brand works better.dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll probably break down and re-purchase because Im lazy</li>
            <li> no perm, no hot comb, no blow dryer), so I can pull it in a bun before work (my 10 mins hairstyle) and at the end of the day, my hair feels dried out and hard when I get home.</li>
            <li> Unlike the results from the black vanilla leave-in conditioner, my hair was no more thangled than ususal</li>
            <li> have no doubt that it strengthens hair (in fact, all of CD&#x27;s products have indeed, strengthened my hair), but this made my hair stiff and gooey</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll usually have to put in a moisturizer then spray a little of this in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product dried my hair out, made it hard to comb, and as a result caused breakage over time.</li>

            <li> I am still not sure about how well it works with my hair type.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who hair</li>
            <li> I usually spray on my twist out up do mornings before work or before the gym.</li>
            <li> A few people have bad comments about it, natural hair products sometime don&#x27;t work on every type of hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to find instore</li>
            <li> and since it is lightweight you can spray it on daily between washes without looking dirty.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 years now and really have nothing bad to say about it.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick and course hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell either, it takes too long to fade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , my hair felt  dry and there wasn&#x27;t any shine, so you can imagine my disappointment.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awful and dried my (natural 4a) hair out!</li>
            <li> broken snapped ends.</li>
            <li> BUT because of the poor performance of this item I will continue to use Nexxus Humectress spray leave in which FOLLOWS through on all of the claims that this one promised.</li>
            <li> I found this to be false.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst leave I used over $10.  </li>
            <li> At $20.00 a bottle this is too expensive for the poor results given.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed Overall.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several carol daughter products, hated all of them!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and hydrates my hair while holding it after it&#x27;s been twisted.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s expensive, and didn&#x27;t detangle that well.</li>
            <li> sadly, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I regret ever wasting my $$ and putting my hair through the unnecessary distress!</li>
            <li> You have to do some research on products before you buy them or you will have bad experiences with them.</li>
            <li> Did I receive a bad batch?</li>
            <li> but I am still slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in a set and must say was disappointed in the results.  </li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair, and was thoroughly disappointed with this CD product.</li>
            <li> I hate pump spray bottles tho</li>
            <li> And now it&#x27;s drying my hair so bad!!!</li>
            <li> Worst leave in</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this daily, particularly in the summer months. It not only smells terrific, but keeps my curly hair from frizzing and getting too wild.</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY, EXACTLY WHAT WAS ADVERTISED.  WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO FRIENDS.  I REALLY LIKE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PRODUCT AS WELL.</li>
            <li> I  give this product a five star for a number of reasons. 1. good for everyday use, adds shine and no build up ever. 2.leaves hair soft . 3.  smells pleasing. 4. great for acting control and shine without weighing down hair.  5. no need to wash hair daily, just spray  a small amount and your good to go.</li>
            <li> I had bought this conditioner before and loved it. So i purchased a second bottle and something happened with its smell. It was a very nice vanilla smell , strong at first but vanished quickly into a soft smell. Now it smells not like vanilla, but all plastic-artificial like. I will not buy this product any more.</li>
            <li> This product works really great.  I use it after I have washed and conditioned my hair.  It makes my hair feel soft, and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 6 months and I love it! It detangles my hair after I wash it, and the scent is lovely. Also my hair feels soft and it has sheen...Great Product, I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter!</li>
            <li> The hype that surrounds Carol&#x27;s Daughter is only that...hype! My sister uses these products and got my mother to try who has natural hair. They both say they notice their hair has more moisture and is more manageable. I decided to try it. I use the Black Vanilla Herbal Shampoo, the Leave-in Conditioner and the Hair Smoothie. Let me tell you that my hair has never been more dry, tangled and nearly impossible to run a comb through as when I use this product. My hair is usually not hard to comb through after washing, but it takes me a good 45 min to part and comb through my head. I pull out so much of my hair in little knots. I read a while ago on their website people saying these products do this but I tried anyway because of the reviews of my mom and sister. But those reviewers were right. I think it&#x27;s also funny that if you go look on the website this product no longer has those negative reviews up. There are only a couple of reviews (if that) for the Black Vanilla product when there were previously a lot more and they only left the glowing reviews up which gave 4 or more stars. Shady practice, Carols&#x27; Daughter. I don&#x27;t dissuade people from making a purchase because you could have great results, but if you use once and notice you can barely get a comb through your head, don&#x27;t attribute it to having done something wrong yourself. It&#x27;s the product. Throw it out and don&#x27;t look back!</li>
            <li> I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Leave-in Conditioner. It smells great and is gentle on my hair. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this product, but it dried my hair out :(  It did not condition or detangle my hair. What a bummer - the scent is a keep though.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awful and dried my (natural 4a) hair out! a crunchy dried mess it was.  save your cash, people!</li>
            <li> This works well with the shampoo. The smell is awesome, people always think it is some fancy perfume I am wearing.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my daughter, who is mixed (Africian-American &amp; Caucasian) and this did NOTHING to help with the tangles. And when her hair would dry-aftering putting the product in - it was frizzy and unmanageable. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> As i write this I am sitting under my dryer, having just washed my hair and put in the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner. It smells great - not too pungent not to faint- but the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger in my hair that long. I love the fact that I can spritz it on during the day to give my hair a boost of the scent but I must admit it does not condition very much, so i&#x27;ll usually have to put in a moisturizer then spray a little of this in my hair. All in all this product has made me a fan of Carol&#x27;s Daughter products but I am still slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, i dont know what&#x27;s the buzz with Carol&#x27;s Daughter products but I&#x27;ve tried their body scrub and body shouffle. They didn&#x27;t smell good and didn&#x27;t moisturize good. But I thought I&#x27;d try their leave in conditioner, seeing all the good reviews on their website.    And now it&#x27;s drying my hair so bad!!! My hair looks like a witch&#x27;s hair now thanks a lot Carol and Lisa! What a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I am mostly Caucasian and have a bit of Native, AA, and Hispanic in me.My hair is an odd texture and super thick.Due to my racial background it has always been hard to find products that best suit my hair.The rest of the Black Vanilla is too heavy on my hair but this specific product is something I spritz into my hair everyday and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditoner and I especially like how my hair feels after applying it. I hate pump spray bottles tho and thats the only reason why I won&#x27;t continue usng this product!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily for myself and my daughter.  We wear natural styles (braids/twists/etc) and this conditioner is not only light but also the fragrance is heavenly.</li>
            <li> My own hair and my oldest daughter&#x27;s hair are both very coarse and kinky and dry.  This product is beneficial for our scalps which dry out quickly, and makes our hair shiny but not greasy at all.  We have to use it daily, so I am glad to see a good price on Amazon and availability so that I can order it frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My youngest two children have fine soft hair with big curls.  This product leaves their hair detangled, deodorized, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of us and everyone that is around us regularly love the smell of this product, but we don&#x27;t like the pump and bottle.  A higher quality pump would make it easier to apply and would prevent us from inhaling the product.  A textured surface on the bottle would make it harder to slip out of hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Carol&#x27;s Daughter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-DMJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D.

            <li> This is a great product. A few people have bad comments about it, natural hair products sometime don&#x27;t work on every type of hair. You have to do some research on products before you buy them or you will have bad experiences with them. This product worked wonders for my hair and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this product!!! This is the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used. Thanks Carol&#x27;s Daughter for another Great Product.</li>
            <li> This made my hair dry and I could not believe the tangles in it. I should take a picture. I have fine, oily hair that tangles very easy and this product actually made my hair worse. I bought this on a whim and I will probably never buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> I have hair to my lower back and always need detangler and lots of conditioner. I saw this and thought I would give it a try...BIG mistake, what a freaking mess this made my hair I couldn&#x27;t even get a wide tooth comb through. It was worse then when I use my normal product, and it made my hair seem like it was really crispy and dry. My husband said it made my hair feel like straw, he loved the smell of the product but it is extremely drying, by the time I had finished combing my hair my hair was one big frizz ball with broken snapped ends. Two hours later I actually got my hairbrush stuck in my hair which has never happened before, it was like I had put stuff on my hair to tangle it instead of untangle. I washed it out and my hair clearly had alot of damage from this product...it almost felt like hairspray on my head. I wish I could get my money back. I will go back to my regular product!</li>
            <li> I think this product made my hair even drier than it was before I put the product in! Go figure.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry hair and this product left it feeling soft and healthy.  My hair also has a wonderful sheen without looking or feeling greasy.  I engage in quite a few athletic activities and prefer to avoid heavy creams and oils; the light, almost watery texture of this product is perfect as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Unlike some other Amazon reviewers, I&#x27;m delighted with this product and I definitely shall continue using it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because an easy to use, nice smelling leave-in conditioner. This product fulfills my needs, except I have one concern: usually products that have a strong (yet pleasant!) scent are drying. Therefore, use sparingly just before blow drying, and don&#x27;t expect your dead ends to heal from use of this product. You&#x27;ll have a nice smelling head though! FYI, product scent does not stink up the room, as far as I can tell. Scent will stay close to your head.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth it! I am a natural hair lover &amp; I am always in need of a conditioner. It softens as you as you spray! The smell is amazing as well :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product in a set and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it once I got home. Shampooed my hair with the black vanilla shampoo and then tried out the black vanilla leave in conditioner. this product seemed to dry my hair out and did not help detangle it at all. I wear a short hairstyle and rarely have to worry about detangling my hair. I would not recommend this product to a friend, hell I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a enemy. Carol&#x27;s Daughter is just a phase that everyone is trying out.</li>
            <li> it works. It is lightweight though so I spray this in and then use phyto 9 leave in cream which is the best combo for my hair, but this stuff works great even alone, it detangles and nourishes and since it is lightweight you can spray it on daily between washes without looking dirty.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in a set and must say was disappointed in the results.  It was packaged beautifully and could not wait to use it so I shampooed that night and conditioned my hair.  I sprayed in the CD Leave in and my hair only felt wet with a strong smell of vanilla.  It did not detangle all that well and I did not feel as though my hair was moisturized after using it.  It was like spritzing vanilla scented water in my hair more than conditioning.  After blow drying, my hair felt stripped and looked rather dry.  Not a fan of CD and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice!!! Smells like vanilla! Love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. I didn&#x27;t like the edge balm that I tried from this brand (smell too intense and too-sticky texture), so I was reluctant to try this when I saw it at my local store. I tried it because the price was decent (and I could do a return if I didn&#x27;t like it) and I really needed something for my hair *right then*! Hahaha! I was really pleasantly surprised at how well this worked from the first minute I used it. I have extremely dry and brittle hair. This leave-in is a huge solution not just to stopping my breakage but is making styling easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this 15 starts if I could. I recommend this to anyone who has dry hair, but especially for people who wear their hair kinky-curly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $12 @ Target. Nice smell..still evaluating effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair, and was thoroughly disappointed with this CD product. My hair was left tangled and the scent is overwhelming. I have had better results with the Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner. Unlike the results from the black vanilla leave-in conditioner, my hair was no more thangled than ususal and I was not overwhelmed by the scent. I enjoyed the herbaceous, floral, and refreshing scent. This is my hair ritual: deep cleasing shampoo, Khoret Amen shampoo, Pantene relaxed and natural breakage defense hair mask, Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner, KA hair oil, and Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair milk. The results were smooth, soft, manageable, and great smelling hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly thick hair. After washing and towel drying, all I have to do is spray this on a section of her hair and volia....I can COMB through her hair with no problems!! This is a life saver. Love the smell...vanilla but not overly sweet. I will definately be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I received my Black Vanilla Leave-In Conditioner yesterday. Considering I ordered this product on New Year&#x27;s Eve, it was an incredibly LONG wait to receive this product. Nonetheless, I tried it out on my 3c/4a hair last night. The smell is tolerable (kinda earthy) and my bottle leaks if it&#x27;s laying on it&#x27;s side. I sprayed this on sections of hair before I dry flat twisted. It doesn&#x27;t leave a build up and the spray concentrates the product exactly where I want it.  This morning, I took out my twists and I must say, they had more \\&quot;spring to them\\&quot; and they were soft too.  I may have found a great leave in....</li>
            <li> Worst leave in I have ever bought.made my hair dry and tangled.a&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive store brand works better.dont waste your money. Smells good,so using it as body spray.will never try carols daughter agin!</li>
            <li> I must say this leave-in conditioning product did nothing but make my short-cut, natural (African American) hair feel coarser after applying. Did I receive a bad batch? The scent of this product is wonderful, but who wants to pay that much money for hair perfume? Sorry Carol but it&#x27;s back to the drawing board on this product. If I could send it back I would; I kept it over 30 days hoping that after continuous use the state of my hair would get better...NOT!! I&#x27;m happy that I like your other products, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t bother in the future. I guess you can&#x27;t please everyone</li>
            <li> It seems different people have different takes on this product but for me it works well. The scent is quite different; not to vanilla at all, but not bad. The most important thing for me was the effect it had on my hair and I&#x27;m quite pleased to say that it left my hair with a refreshed look and also feeling light,soft and silky. So from my experience I would say you should atleast try it. Hopefully you&#x27;ll have the same luck I&#x27;ve found with it.</li>
            <li> I have found that with Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, I really like some and really dislike others.  I really like the Black Vanilla conditioner. It moisturizes my hair, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I also like the smell of it (unlike Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner), which is important to me.  I think of a leave in conditioner as similar to a facial moisturizer.  It&#x27;s good to use daily to keep the hair moist.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works so well with my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has very soft curly hair and tons of flyaways.  I can use this product with the Hair milk and not worry about buildup while managing flyaways!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Carol&#x27;s Daughter!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out my Black Vanilla leave in conditioner. It smells great and is a good refresher to use on you hair everyday whether you are doing a twist out or if you have extensions …its for all occasions.</li>
            <li> So lightweight and fresh! Nice size bottle! I love this stuff! I use it every morning and my husband uses it too!</li>
            <li> This is the best detangler that I have ever used! It works like magic! Especially for coarse/curly hair! A definite must have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my 6 year old sons hair for 4 years. We both love it, the smell is amazing, everyone comments on it, it makes it so easy to brush his hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible. If it cost $1, I still wouldn&#x27;t buy it. The smell isnt even all that great. It literally feels like you&#x27;re spraying your hair with vanilla water. I felt no conditioning agents in my hair, no softness, or no slip. It&#x27;s just blah! Totally not worth purchasing. I&#x27;ve tried several carol daughter products, hated all of them!</li>
            <li> I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla Moisturizing every day.  It helps my hair from breaking while I comb it, makes it shine.  It moisturize your scalp, keep it from itching, smells great.  My whole family uses it so I have to have a lot on hand.  The price is just right and will continue buying it here until it run out.</li>
            <li> Softens hair and makes my son&#x27;s hair smell great.  Love Carol&#x27;s Daughter products. Hard to find instore so I order from amazon</li>
            <li> I love this product. Been using it for over a year. It detangles my hair and help keeps my hair manageable in between wash days. A little bit goes a long way. The scent is amazing. I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I heard so much about it.  I have used it twice and love the scent.  I am still not sure about how well it works with my hair type.  I have very tightly curled hair with various textures (varying between 4a and 4b type).  It does soften it some but I can not use it alone.  I need a Hair oil or butter for my hair to retain the moisture.  Since, I am transitioning from a relaxer, it would have been nice to know how to use this product with other Carol&#x27;s daughter products for transitioning.</li>
            <li> Great.... make detangling really easy.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite CD&#x27;s products and I use this daily and love the smell. The price was better than what I&#x27;ve found at other vendors.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick and course hair so when I purchased this I thought it would work wonders based on the reviews. Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t as excited with the results. It smells great but didn&#x27;t detangle the way I needed it to compared to other products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, curly/wavy hair that is prone to frizz and dryness at the ends and oily at the roots. Total mess, I know. This leave-in does a great job of moisturizing and adding shine without weighing my hair down or making it look oily. I use it right out of the shower and sometimes before bed. It smells amazing! The vanilla scent isn&#x27;t very strong or overly sweet.</li>
            <li> I am going natural and this helps with my short thick hair.  The only issue I have with it, is that once the day is complete my hair feels dry.  It feels like it needs moisture which I thought this product should provide.  I must say that once you spray your hair it does make it softer to comb through.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time. I like the way it takes the tangles out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this for my scalp and braids and love it! It keeps my braids looking nice and smooth and keeps my scalp from feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quick detangler for my daughters (4a) hair in the mornings when it is dry and needs to be refreshed. Directions say that it can be used on dry hair and that it makes detangling a cinch. It also claims to not break your hair when detangling. I found this to be false. I sectioned my daughters hair, sprayed, and combed each section.  I found it difficult to get the comb through the sections and it left the hair feeling sticky and like straw with much breakage. Granted I did only use this on dry hair, but the product claims that is what it is for. I will most likely try this another time but on her wet head only because I spent the money on it. Might work to detangle while she is in the tub.  I just wanted a product I could use in the morning to restyle her curls after her sleeping on them. Guess the best way is still to wet the head and apply light product. The one good thing I can say about this product is that it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This product temporarily softened my hair until it dried, then my hair became dry and crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;I poured out 3 ounces of product and replaced it with water and now it works much better on my hair. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell either, it takes too long to fade.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any moisturizing so If I re-purchase it would be for detangling only!</li>
            <li> Mellow &amp; intoxicating vanilla scent.  NOT an overwhelming perfume-type scent: just heavenly!  (Note: The scent in the shampoo &amp; conditioner fade after washing out, so I recommend the leave-in spray).</li>
            <li> First of all, I have collar bone length, 4B/4C, thirsty, thick hair. I used this leave in right after co washing my hair and it didn&#x27;t work at all as a moisturizer or a detangler alone. I had to add my normal detangler (Design Essentials, with olive oil and aloe vera juice). Honestly I wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work as its advertised because its a liquid, and unless its a miracle in a bottle I cant believe anything other than a cream can possibly detangle all this denseness I have going on. So I gave it a side eye then shelved it. But when it came time to re-moisturize my hair I sprayed some of this on it using the LOC method (liquid, oil, cream) and it worked amazingly well. My hair was super moisturized and adding the spray over the product that was already in my hair made finger detangling way easier. And it smells like a dream wrapped in a wish, meaning absolutely yummy. Like vanilla candy. The smell is strong and it lasts for days after application. So if you&#x27;re sensitive to smell this is something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because of the price. Don&#x27;t by this on amazon. I paid about $11 for mine at Target, and even this is too high to me. If you like to mix your own liquid refreshers this could be easily replaced by a rose water, aloe juice, oil/s, and essential oil blend. But I&#x27;ll probably break down and re-purchase because Im lazy and I love this smell.</li>
            <li> Omg omg smells just amazing  i mainly use it as a refresher  during the week and omg the smell  is amazing  works well my hair is always soft.</li>
            <li> Carols daughter is great stuff I have curly hair and it&#x27;s not grease.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Simply the best for conditioning and controlling without weighing down my flyaway, fine hair. Adds a little shine and smells yummy</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from the CD&#x27;s website, but decided to put the review here because I think more people will read the AMZN review.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, my hair HATES Panthenol.  If your hair doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;need\\&quot; protein, I&#x27;d stay away from this.  It didn&#x27;t necessarily moisturize my hair, but my hair does feel \\&quot;coated\\&quot;, like I poured wax on it. Y-U-C-K!&lt;br /&gt;Had I read the ingredients list BEFORE I purchased, with Panthenol (\\&quot;Pro-Vitamin B\\&quot; &#x3D; kiss of death) being the 3rd ingredient, I never would&#x27;ve bought this item.&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that it strengthens hair (in fact, all of CD&#x27;s products have indeed, strengthened my hair), but this made my hair stiff and gooey feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I&#x27;ve used this as a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot;, and got the same result.  Normally, I don&#x27;t use \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; products and I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. Never again!&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I may try this as a rinse OUT detangler, but I&#x27;ll never leave it in my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I can&#x27;t wait to wash it out.</li>
            <li> **UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant beleive the price of this on amazon is now over $20, when I bought it earlier this year it was $12 and its currently $11 on the carols daughter website. Amazon prime is sometimes such a rip off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***ORIGINAL REVIEW***&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of this, but I was a bit dissappointed after hearing and reading such raving reviews about carols daughter. It is a nice but lightweight leave in conditioner that moistens the hair and makes it a bit soft but its no better than lusters s curl activator or kinky curly knot today leave in. Its just so lightweight that its barely there and if you have kinky hair this product wont make much impact on its own, you have to spray it on after using a heavier activator or leave in</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does not contain alcohol ( I didn&#x27;t notice any when I read the ingredient) so this is a great product for my natural African American hair. Besides the wonderful ingredient, I love the light vanilla scent.[[ASIN:B000PI4J3G Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Black Vanilla (Moisturizing) Leave-in Conditioner, 8-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in conditioner.  I use it almost every day to give my hair a perk of freshness.  It works as a daily moisturizer for my relatively dry, relaxed, thick hair without adding any weight to it - it&#x27;s not enough on it&#x27;s own, but using it in conjunction with a little olive oil or a small bit of the Mimosa Hair Honey works to keep my hair soft and shiny.  I also use it liberally right before blow-drying to help detangle and straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product especially the smell leave my hair nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say that I am an avid Carol&#x27;s daughter purchaser. I currently have and LOVE the hair milk line, the Monoi line (to include the newly released Monoi serum), the 1-2-3 transitioning kit, the Olive oil infusion kit, the healthy hair butter, the marguerite&#x27;s magic hair dress, the hair balm, Lisa&#x27;s hair elixir, the rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner, the black vanilla smoothie, the honey hair mimosa , the macadamia line (smoother, thermal serum &amp; gloss spray)  and I intend on purchasing the two newly released Lisa&#x27;s elixir fortifying hair scalp spray/restoring oil; HOWEVER, I will NEVER, EVER purchase the black vanilla spray leave in unless there are some changes! NOTE: I do not &#x27;need&#x27; all of these products to maintain my mane;  I am simply a self-proclaimed product junkie! I read through all the reviews on the Carol&#x27;s daughter website and there were definitely a lot of mixed reviews but being the loyal Carol&#x27;s daughter fan that I am, I still wanted to experience this product for my self. I currently have fully natural 4a/b textured hair, I also used CDs products during my 1 year and 1 month transition; all of her products have done me justice except this one. The black vanilla leave in claims to provide your hair with shine, easier detangling and softness of which none of these happened for me. It smelled wonderful with the initial application and even that didn&#x27;t linger for any amount of time, my hair felt  dry and there wasn&#x27;t any shine, so you can imagine my disappointment. 😣  In an attempt to salvage this product I have mixed it with other watery or creamy leave-ins that I know WORK for me in order to use it up. I WILL NOT be purchasing this product again UNLESS the formula is revamped to add MORE moisturizing, shine enhancing ingredients. I was hoping to keep my shampoos, conditioners, moisturizers, leave ins, hair butters and oils all within the same brand family BUT because of the poor performance of this item I will continue to use Nexxus Humectress spray leave in which FOLLOWS through on all of the claims that this one promised. I will be posting this review BOTH on Amazon and the Carol&#x27;s daughter website. It may work for other textures but definitely serves no benefit to my coarse, kinky, coily 4a/b texture. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product 1 ⭐is because of the vanilla scent which dissipates SOON after applying.</li>
            <li> I have locs and regularly use Carol&#x27;s Daughters products for my hair. I use the Mimosa Hair Honey with this product. I use the hair honey to twist my hair and afterwards spray this conditioner when I&#x27;m done. It moisturizes and hydrates my hair while holding it after it&#x27;s been twisted. I trust Carol&#x27;s Daughters products on my hair. I also use the Black Vanilla Moisturizing Shampoo along with this conditioner. Which leaves my hair smelling like Vanilla. I also use this conditioner throughout the week to keep my hair looking fresh and twisted when it hasn&#x27;t be re-twisted in awhile.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice and i wished that it worked but it zilch zero for my hair. Very disappointed Overall.  Another one going to good will or whoever wants it.  Not worth the hassle and cost to return.</li>
            <li> This smells good, but the smell is very strong. I don&#x27;t really want my daughter going around smelling like cookies all day. Also it&#x27;s expensive, and didn&#x27;t detangle that well. I switched back to Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s detangler which is about 1/3 the price, doesn&#x27;t have a smell and works much better</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite conditioners. Smells wonderful and works for multiple hair types.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> if you dont like scents, this product is not for you. the fragrance is very strong, but i like the smell of vanilla, so i love it. not sure if i can say that it&#x27;s the best moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used, but it certainly smells the best. that being said, if you&#x27;re looking for an intense moisturizer, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any real value to buying this product.  It smells really nice, but I did not see any significant gain to buying it over a generic product.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. Fast delivery. Thoroughly impressed. :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a leave in conditioner that I could use on both wet and dry hair. I have very curly hair and a lot of it, and I have very hard time brushing it when wet...this product made brushing MUCH harder and I ended up with a comb full of hair by the time I was done....I really wanted to like but have to give it 2 stars...The smell is great, but it lingers on for days and will interfere with any other scents you put on.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to admit, I&#x27;ve been dying to try out Carol&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s for awhile and even though I read thru the reviews before buying (50/50 basically), I decided to take a chance and purchase this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well sadly, I&#x27;m not impressed. I wear my hair natural (eg. no perm, no hot comb, no blow dryer), so I can pull it in a bun before work (my 10 mins hairstyle) and at the end of the day, my hair feels dried out and hard when I get home. In fact,I&#x27;ve been using Fructis&#x27; leave in conditioning since Sept 2010, after I got my first and &#x27;only&#x27; weave and I wanted to research how to take care of it. Well, I&#x27;ve continued to use Fructis&#x27; Leave in conditioner (just place some in a water bottle, shake &amp; spray) and it by far, leaves my hair softer and more manageable after I get home from work. Trust me. And honestly, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the black vanilla scent either and I *love* vanilla but this bottle reminded of lightly scented vanilla water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will be sticking with my Fructis with Argan oil (check wikipedia) and Apricot Leave-in-cond. Still love the smell, even 23 months after my first purchase but sorry Carol&#x27;s Daughter for the review on your product. Just re-vamp the ingredients to include more \\&quot;softener\\&quot; for women of colors&#x27; hair type and perhaps I&#x27;ll re-purchase in the future. But for now though .. this bottle was a waste of $$ and 20 times the cost of my Fructis on a sale/coupon day &amp; when I can dilute it and turn it into my own spray.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair smell good. That is the only benefit that I can see that came from it. I did not purchase it again. As a MOF, I still have half a bottle left. Thanks, but no thanks for making my hair smell good. I&#x27;d rather have healthy hair that is not hard, than hair that smells good. No, this didn&#x27;t add any moisture to my hair I don&#x27;t think.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT SMELLS VERY GOOD AND IT ALSO WORKS VERY WELL AND MY HAIR HAS A TREMENDOUS TRANSFORMATION IN IT&#x27;S MANAGEABILITY.</li>
            <li> I loved this product as much as other...I wanted to I really did but it left my hair so dry like weeds or hay I I had to wear my hair it in a pony tail and then a lot of my hair came out because of the dryness. I&#x27;m not sure who hair this is made for but not mine and I have curly hair so I thought it would be perfect. Better luck next time...</li>
            <li> I tried this product a couple years ago when I was searching for a good moisturizer/conditioner for mixed (multi-ethnic) hair. The 1 star is for how good it makes your hair smell. This product dried my hair out, made it hard to comb, and as a result caused breakage over time. I regret ever wasting my $$ and putting my hair through the unnecessary distress!</li>
            <li> Decent midweek conditioner for curly girls. I usually spray on my twist out up do mornings before work or before the gym.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m a huge Carol&#x27;s Daughter fan and try to experiment with most of the hair care products. This one is great for combing out tangles! The only thing I dislike about it is at times it can make your hair a little sticky.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes nicely before styling.</li>
            <li> My first time using this product.  However so far it smells great, too early to tell if it is working.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!  Everyone in the family uses it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this. It is a great as a detangler. I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst leave I used over $10.  It does nothing!  It did not help reduce tangles or add moisture.  The only thing I was able to use it for is misting my hair for hydration.  However, you can just use water for that.  The smell has a okay scent, but not for me.  What a rip off!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 years now and really have nothing bad to say about it.  You must try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Perfect use for detangling hair. I have very thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It did not detangle nor did it make my hair more manageable.  I have combination hair 3c,4a,4c.  It smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and does an okay job on detangleing. But it is absolutely missing the moisturization we ladies desparately need that have this challenging hair type. My hair was left very dry and brittle. I started off with a very light spritz on my head. I slowly increased the amount of spritz daily since 4b/4c needs moisturization on the daily basis. That didn&#x27;t work.  I realized after several days, my hair was getting even dryer. I&#x27;m not sure what ingrediants in this product that makes my hair dry, but this product has to be mixed with a super charged leave in conditioner for this hair type. It has too much water and not enough super rich conditioning ingrediants. At $20.00 a bottle this is too expensive for the poor results given.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it  This conditioner has been a staple in our house for quite some time.  It smells really good and leaves hair soft and manageable. I would recommend Black Vanilla to anyone with dry, damaged or brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I received it but, I&#x27;m taking it to someone as a gift and I won&#x27;t see them until next month so I don&#x27;t know how good it is.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but it didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and moisturized this line of products. I have fragile, thin, so-called 4B/C hair that does not like SHEA butter or olive or COCONUT oil very much. I have been natural over 20 years and it has been very difficult for me to find the right products for my hair. I have been a product junkie for about four years and NOTHING seemed to work because natural hair products heavily use SHEA a basis. This product is light on shea (thank goodness).  Well, for the past several months I have used the following regimen: Aloe and water works well daily. Shampoo and deep condition with Carol Daughter&#x27;s \\&quot;Black Vanilla\\&quot; line once a week (co-washing dries my hair). Use a mix of grape seed and sweet almond oils. And, end with twisting the a bit (just a bit) of Avocado Butter. Trust, you do not want to use too much because avocado is an oily butter. Wear a satin scarf at night. So, in essence, I use the liquid, oil, and creme/butter (LOC or LOB) method. My hair is very fragile and dry out easily. This helps and it has helped me retain moisture as much as my hair can.</li>
