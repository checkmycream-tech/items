            <li>These are good quality and the application is smooth.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s the most sustainable thing to do, aside from using your own fingers for application.</li>
            <li>Great cosmetic wedges and very affordable.  </li>
            <li>I love these cosmetic wedges.</li>
            <li>Good price for the large amount of cosmetic wedges.</li>

            <li>I only get two uses from the wedge before I throw it away, so I&#x27;m always looking for these at a good price.</li>
            <li>These are great wedges for makeup or even applying other creams to your face.</li>
            <li>they are getting harder to find but amazon has a good price and they are always in stock.</li>
            <li>Most wedges are similar and these are too</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t out of the ordinary, but still do a good job.</li>
            <li>I feel like this item takes in too much of the foundation and absorbs almost as much of the stuff as I wear, I will not be buying these again.</li>
            <li>And fast ship</li>
            <li>I use them for painting dolls that have a realistic look</li>
            <li>This variety is a little more silky (rather than cottony).</li>
            <li>Wow fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Great deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several brands and this one is of the higher quality.  </li>
            <li>Premium sponge is slightly firmer than most of the sponges out at your local drugstore.  </li>
            <li>For myself, I use the same wedge for a whole week (sometimes longer) and it holds up well.</li>
            <li>I normally use wedges from the dollar store but after reading the back of the packaging of these wedges, I decided to to purchase this brand.</li>
            <li>I also received them much quicker than I expected.  </li>
            <li>This cosmetic wedges are much softer (squish factor) than other brands and have a smoother texture (are denser)</li>
            <li>Though the description says you can use them more than once if you prefer, I&#x27;m not sure they would hold up through one use, much less two.</li>

            <li> Excellent came before I expected to. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great cosmetic wedges and very affordable.  These work quite well and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Good price for the large amount of cosmetic wedges. They allow the make up to go on smooth. They aren&#x27;t out of the ordinary, but still do a good job.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup sponges at a great price!</li>
            <li> I love these cosmetic wedges. As an independent cosmetic representative, I go through a lot of wedges when customers are trying different shades of foundation at demonstrations. These are good quality and the application is smooth. Several of my customers have asked me if they can order the wedges via the cosmetic company I work for because they liked them. For myself, I use the same wedge for a whole week (sometimes longer) and it holds up well. I&#x27;ve also successfully washed wedges to use even longer.</li>
            <li> Wife loves them and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> Great price and good quality. Noticed a few complaints that these tear - have not had any problems with that.</li>
            <li> Wow fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Great deal. Packaged great.</li>
            <li> Most wedges are similar and these are too but with the ease of ordering on Amazon and the fast shipping, it sure makes my life easier. I use them for painting dolls that have a realistic look and they work fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great price and a great buy! I&#x27;m a noob at makeup and I wanted to try these sponges. I love them! I have only used one bag of these, and I still have a bunch in that bag I&#x27;m using. Love these!!</li>
            <li> save time and make-up.  I tried using that egg shaped sponge but it got so dirty and the make-up never washed out.  To each his or her own.</li>
            <li> Beats the price at CVS nearby so, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I normally use wedges from the dollar store but after reading the back of the packaging of these wedges, I decided to to purchase this brand. I got these wedges because the package stated that less make up is wasted but truth is the application leaves little craters allover my face. Even with continous blending the make up is still appears uneven. Now i just use Swisspers wedges for removing excess make up</li>
            <li> These are great wedges for makeup or even applying other creams to your face. I make mine last by using all sides of it before tossing away. I think that&#x27;s the most sustainable thing to do, aside from using your own fingers for application.</li>
            <li> These work well, though I don&#x27;t use them for their intended purpose.  We use them to apply diaper ointment.  It&#x27;s great to keep the ointment off our hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these before with no problems.  However this time, when I use them they are falling apart in chunks.</li>
            <li> tons of sponges and these do not fall apart during use!</li>
            <li> They do what they should, but one bag came opened (returned due to the fact that they need to be sterile). This variety is a little more silky (rather than cottony).</li>
            <li> Premium sponge is slightly firmer than most of the sponges out at your local drugstore.  I&#x27;ve used several brands and this one is of the higher quality.  It blends foundation easily. I recommend you wetting the sponge before makeup application to give you added blending power.</li>
            <li> I feel like this item takes in too much of the foundation and absorbs almost as much of the stuff as I wear, I will not be buying these again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase of these cosmetic wedges.  The quality is great and the price was excellent. I also received them much quicker than I expected.  Great service, great company. Will definitely purchase again.</li>

            <li> This cosmetic wedges are much softer (squish factor) than other brands and have a smoother texture (are denser) so I find these easier to use.</li>
            <li> Love these!  And fast ship</li>
            <li> These wedges are so small and thin they are difficult to handle. They measure 1 1/2&amp;#34; x 1/2&amp;#34; x 1/8&amp;#34; and are extremely flimsy. Though the description says you can use them more than once if you prefer, I&#x27;m not sure they would hold up through one use, much less two. I would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Perfect price and quantity for one time use to keep makeup oil free. Not one for washing applicators after each use.</li>
