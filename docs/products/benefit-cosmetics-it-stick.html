            <li>THE BEST</li>
            <li>LOVE this!!!  </li>
            <li>This is a non-greasy coverup and it works great</li>
            <li>I use it as a highlighter under my eyebrows to bring out my brow bone, works great this way.</li>
            <li>Also works great as a concealer, for which it is for.</li>
            <li>have fair skin, and it matches alright, but I also wear powder foundation.</li>
            <li>you have fair skin, and you DON&#x27;T use powder, then this may work for you.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34;it stick&amp;#34;, great product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on the waterline of my eye and it works nice</li>
            <li>NICE PRICE</li>
            <li>For some reason the powder, over top of the it stick just doesnt look good, and is way too cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>seems really good coverage but light and blendy</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>so those circles go away and also on \\&quot;it\\&quot; spots :)</li>
            <li>Love it to fill in the lines around my lips.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE MY BENEFIT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Okay.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I thought this particular product was off the market and was happy to see it in the cosmetics section.</li>
            <li>its perfect for any spots or blemishes on the face that may need a little more attention.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best for hiding/concealing flaws.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my skin tone is just too light for it to show up...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, I can see why the company discontinued it.</li>
            <li>The stick applies smoothly and evenly covering darkness around the eye.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good product overall, easy to apply, but</li>
            <li>When i got the package the original box</li>
            <li>Cant live without this one it is amazing if u cant get it or find it then there</li>
            <li>Good for a teen with pimples</li>
            <li>AND AT THIS PRICE I CAN BUY ONE FOR HOME AND FOR MY PURSE AND FOR A FRIEND LOVE IT  THANKS  </li>
            <li>Received item quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>heals blemishes quickly...</li>
            <li>great product, it was exactly what I expected to receive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice concept but doesn&#x27;t blend well enough to use for blemishes or even under the eyes.</li>
            <li>It comes off the pencil easily, sharpening will be frequent.</li>
            <li>I have to put it on my finger first and then apply it to my face.  </li>
            <li>Coverage is ok, but not enough for the under eye area.</li>
            <li>I received it so fast too!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it, and I definitely don&#x27;t use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also goes on kind of rough considering</li>
            <li>I LOVED that last stick, but this one wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>last forever and is so easy to use..</li>
            <li>I use it as my on-the-go emergency concealer (if my regular stuff somehow gets rubbed off or I have a huge zit).  </li>
            <li>Personally, I think this is cheap quality, and your better off going with a coverup stick from some other cheaper brand like covergirl or maybelline.</li>
            <li>very natural looking!</li>
            <li>r other brands that make same kind of pencil</li>
            <li>Great concealer that doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; or fake.</li>
            <li>Works great to cover little (or not so little) in perfections w/o having to use a foundation...</li>
            <li>i open it and the stick comes out first without the lid.</li>
            <li>Easily blended for a natural look and small enough to tuck into your purse for touch-ups on-the-go.</li>
            <li>i love putting it under my eyes when  feel tired</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I ordered this off of amazon bc I heard it was discontinued just as i ran out of my last stick.  I LOVED that last stick, but this one wasn&#x27;t the same. The formula seemed too hard, not creamy like my last one.  I have to put it on my finger first and then apply it to my face.  It just isn&#x27;t the same. bummer. I&#x27;m still using it until it runs out, but I will buy another product next time.</li>
            <li> It stick is one \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for me.  I am very sorry they stopped making it, and was lucky enough to find it here,  The coverage of a concealor with the portability of a pencil, you can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the rave reviews for this. I used it as recommended and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it makes any difference. Maybe my skin tone is just too light for it to show up...</li>
            <li> Good product overall, easy to apply, but I feel like so much gets wasted when I sharpen the pencil. Coverage is ok, but not enough for the under eye area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit like a grease pencil.  It lasts all day, but can intensify its whiteness if on an oily part of your face, like the forehead.  I usually use it on the inner and outer corners of my eyes, and under the brow. It&#x27;s a bit shiny. Put some on with the pencil and then smudge it with a finger tip or put it onto a finger tip and then smear it on.  It comes off the pencil easily, sharpening will be frequent.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product. its perfect for any spots or blemishes on the face that may need a little more attention. i love putting it under my eyes when  feel tired so those circles go away and also on \\&quot;it\\&quot; spots :) i recommend this product to any one!</li>
            <li> I thought this particular product was off the market and was happy to see it in the cosmetics section. As someone who has dark under eye circles that don&#x27;t completely disappear with concealer, this item does the trick. The pencil contains reflective material&lt;br /&gt;that camouflages shadows caused by puffiness under the eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I&#x27;ve used it for only one day and I&#x27;m in love! I received it so fast too!</li>
            <li> Love this!  Works great to cover little (or not so little) in perfections w/o having to use a foundation... very natural looking!</li>
            <li> expected different coverage.  Good for a teen with pimples</li>
            <li> LOVE this!!!  It is hands down the best for hiding/concealing flaws.  I&#x27;ve also used it on the waterline of my eye and it works nice but you do have to reapply there throughout the day.  Very bad move on Benefit&#x27;s side to discontinue this product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> great product, it was exactly what I expected to receive. The makeup was the color and consistency that it was supposed to be</li>
            <li> This is a non-greasy coverup and it works great -- just pat it to blend.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use. Easily blended for a natural look and small enough to tuck into your purse for touch-ups on-the-go.</li>
            <li> Love it to fill in the lines around my lips.  Couldn&#x27;t put on lipstick without it.  Great if you&#x27;re over 60!!!!</li>
            <li> seems really good coverage but light and blendy</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE MY BENEFIT \\&quot;STICKS THERE THE BEST AND AT THIS PRICE I CAN BUY ONE FOR HOME AND FOR MY PURSE AND FOR A FRIEND LOVE IT  THANKS  NICE PRICE TOO I CAN NOW STOCK UP</li>
            <li> When i got the package the original box it comes in was neat and untouched. i open it and the stick comes out first without the lid. (assuming the lid wasn&#x27;t put on properly)..  I tested it on my hand and realized its a bit dry and a little too dark for my face. (im pale)  Overall i could donate it to a friend but it just doesn&#x27;t work for my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Okay. I use it as my on-the-go emergency concealer (if my regular stuff somehow gets rubbed off or I have a huge zit).  I don&#x27;t love it, and I definitely don&#x27;t use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin, and it matches alright, but I also wear powder foundation. For some reason the powder, over top of the it stick just doesnt look good, and is way too cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fair skin, and you DON&#x27;T use powder, then this may work for you. Personally, I think this is cheap quality, and your better off going with a coverup stick from some other cheaper brand like covergirl or maybelline.</li>
            <li> Love the &amp;#34;it stick&amp;#34;, great product. I use it as a highlighter under my eyebrows to bring out my brow bone, works great this way. Also works great as a concealer, for which it is for. Received item quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, I can see why the company discontinued it. I never use it because it doesn&#x27;t do anything it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I was upset when this was discontinued.  I&#x27;&#x27;ve been using it everyday.  I am so glad I found it on Amazon.  The stick applies smoothly and evenly covering darkness around the eye.  It works!</li>
            <li> Every girl needs the &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34; stick..last forever and is so easy to use..heals blemishes quickly...Not really easy to sharpen but it can be done...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice concept but doesn&#x27;t blend well enough to use for blemishes or even under the eyes. It also goes on kind of rough considering it is meant to be used on delicate parts of skin like the undereye area.</li>
            <li> Great concealer that doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; or fake.</li>
            <li> Cant live without this one it is amazing if u cant get it or find it then there r other brands that make same kind of pencil I forget the brands but I think it cometics is one of them and sometimes in an upper off beat drugstore u can find a generic for the meanwhile always try benefits sight and look around I bet u will come across it soon. Good luck</li>
