            <li>I&#x27;ve used shikakai off and on with great results, but now I&#x27;m using it exclusively with other ayurvedic herbs, and my hair had never been better.</li>
            <li>While this powder gets my scalp clean</li>

            <li>I have nothing to say anything better than this items works really well and delivers the results.</li>
            <li>Good alternative for regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need a new technique to use, but I didn&#x27;t want to use it like a conditioner like many do because it is suppose to clean your hair.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had found it many, many years earlier.  </li>
            <li>so it is good for ladies with dry hair.</li>
            <li>Reading the earlier reviews, I find that people liked this product but commented on it not lathering.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered many of these natural hair treatments</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is worth purchasing again.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and healthy just after letting the paste set in my hair for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Good enough for natural care.</li>
            <li>Pretty good cleanser mixed with Amla hair was sooo soft (4b hair).</li>
            <li>you use just a tablespoon per rinse, this box will last you many wash days -- even if you wash every day.</li>
            <li>I use this powder along with the amla powder from the same company to wash my hair and the results are lovely.</li>
            <li>First time user so jury is still out.</li>
            <li>I think next time I will try this with my mud wash (which will hopefully give it more effort).  </li>
            <li>This is the first time writing a comment, on a product.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my hair grew 1.5 inches in first month.  </li>
            <li>Shikakai Powder used along with Amla, Henna, and Senna makes a perfect conditioning mask for overly dry, lifeless, limp hair!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love every single one of them.</li>
            <li>very drying to the hair if you dont use it correctly.</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t really know if it is working.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>,  Aretha powder mixed about 1 tsp full of each, in Amal oil and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>I think it does better than typical shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, fine and brittle hair.</li>
            <li>I like to use natural and organic products, but I just didn&#x27;t realize any real benefit</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;d like to say - if you live in city/state where you have Indian Grocery stores - this item sells for $2.00 Max -- i get mine for $1.59 + tax</li>
            <li>What I do is use a tea strainer and an old tea pot.</li>
            <li>The powder got really grainy when mixed with water.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to help maintain my natural hair color and keep the gray at bay.  </li>
            <li>Shikakai is a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>It does not strip the hair of its natural oils</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and managable.  </li>
            <li>The day I opened it, it went all over the place, had a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>The powder either too old or to coarse or both.</li>
            <li>You will need some seriously deep conditioning to bring your hair back to normal.  </li>
            <li>The mixture is messy but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I just got it to try, but it is messy, smells funny and dries out my hair</li>

            <li> I was very careful to mix the product very well, but there were still pebbles / grains in the end mixture, which I am certain is not good for hair in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been self conscious of my hair for the last few years, so I&#x27;ve been trying everything to stimulate hair growth.</li>

            <li> The only good thing I have to say about this product is that at least it did not smell as bad as the Aritha powder that is also made my the same company.  </li>
            <li> I also felt like my ends were getting too dry with this and had to use a condition anyways.</li>
            <li> should be enough for medium length hair) in 2 cups of water overnight and boil the next morning for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> my hair is luxurious, healthy and thick whereas it used to be oily and thin.</li>
            <li> It kind of dried my hair really bad.</li>
            <li> I guess it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> -I could get the same result using plain water.</li>
            <li> Unlike others, I do not mix Shikakai powder with other powders</li>
            <li> I use this in combo with other powders to make a hair rinse to condition my hair and strengthen it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was due to  </li>
            <li> I discovered this one about 5 years ago at a neighborhood store that has since closed down.</li>
            <li> The instant it was applied to my hair, it made the hair extremely hard.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if my hair felt cleaner or not, I do know it was a bit difficult to wash out.  </li>
            <li> My problem with this powder was the mess and it doesn&#x27;t get a lot of the oils out of my hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit of work involved in this process</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about those few strands of hair that you always lose with the usage of a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I could see someone who washed their hair everyday benefiting from this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday (as you shouldn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any smell, so I usually use conditioner before or after using this just for the smell.</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure if this worked in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am not completely sure what is the purpose for this product once you can buy shampoo...</li>
            <li> It alleviates complaints about this being hard to rinse</li>
            <li> I always had thick hair, lots of shedding over the years.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the shedding, decreased, vertually stopped, just a few strands of hair in the Comb.  </li>
            <li> , I trim my hair, off approximately 3 inches.  </li>
            <li> got this because I had awful dry scalp this winter, and even my usual shampoo (Rahua volumising) was getting too drying.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my head still itched after using this, but I did somewhat like using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to lather, but no soap does not translate into dirty hair.</li>
            <li> Its was very difficult rinsing it out of my hair ...</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you are thinking about ordering it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you hate getting some out of date product?</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>
            <li> My hair is afro textured and horribly picky when it comes to hair products.</li>

            <li> very drying to the hair if you dont use it correctly.</li>
            <li> It kind of dried my hair really bad. just started using it so i don&#x27;t really know if it is working.</li>
            <li> I guess it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. The day I opened it, it went all over the place, had a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian with 2a/M/ii hair. I tried several mixed with Conditioners/amla/Dr. Bonners etc. I fould this works best all buy itself mixed as the directions tell you to mix. Otherwise it was hard to rinse and made my hair texture feel funny and kinda dry...when I did the simple mix as recommended on the box, my hair was silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Unlike others, I do not mix Shikakai powder with other powders and I do not worry about the tiny granules. What I do is use a tea strainer and an old tea pot. I put a tablespoon of shikakai powder into the strainer and pour warm to hot water over it (from the faucet). I let it \\&quot;steep\\&quot; on the bathroom counter while I rinse and condition my hair in the shower. Then I take out the strainer and pour the tea pot of shikakai water over my hair and let it remain on for a minute or two. Then, I rinse it out. It tightens my hair cuticles so that detangling is easy and my hair strands are smooth. My hair dries thicker (with more volume &amp; body) and stronger. It also conditions my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefit of straining the rinse is that the granules don&#x27;t get in your eyes or on the shower floor. It alleviates complaints about this being hard to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: some people might be allergic to this product. It can cause eye irritation, sneezing and runny nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use just a tablespoon per rinse, this box will last you many wash days -- even if you wash every day. I use shikakai soap to cleanse, but the powder as just a conditioning rinse.</li>
            <li> Great powder to wash your hair instead of the chemical shampoos but my hair is blonde so it tinted my hair. I have been using Cassia Obovata (Senna powder) as shampoo on my hair for 3 years now and will never touch soap or shampoo again...my hair is luxurious, healthy and thick whereas it used to be oily and thin. Truly recommend for blondes!</li>
            <li> I use this powder along with the amla powder from the same company to wash my hair and the results are lovely. I love how this makes my hair feel. I used to just use reetha (soapnut) tea earlier but now I mix a spoonful of both powders, add reetha tea to it, use this as shampoo. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Reading the earlier reviews, I find that people liked this product but commented on it not lathering.  Using this with reetha nut (soap nut) powder will help provide the lather.  The combination of shikakai and soap nut has been used for centuries in India for hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also take soap nuts - smash the nut and remove the nut / stone inside, keeping only the skin.  Soak the skins (1 or 2 should be enough for medium length hair) in 2 cups of water overnight and boil the next morning for a few minutes.  Cool and blend with the water it soaked in. Strain and add shikakai powder, stir and use as shampoo to wash your hair.  A little bit of work involved in this process but you will be amazed at the results.  Makes hair lustrous and healthy, promotes growth of hair and prevents / removes dandruff.</li>
            <li> While this powder gets my scalp clean it&#x27;s too drying to use alone. I find Aritha get&#x27;s my hair even cleaner without the dryness so I probably won&#x27;t repurchase. Probably great for oily hair tho.</li>
            <li> Love this. Great replacement to hair dye. Mix with Amal powder add lavender pure oil [...] for best therapeutic hair oil.  It never washes out and helps w damaged itchy scalp too</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product for natural hair. I have ordered many of these natural hair treatments and I absolutely love every single one of them. Great scalp cleanser and hair moisturizer. You will not be disappointed if you are thinking about ordering it.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product was it&#x27;s price. The powder either too old or to coarse or both.It did not give the soapy feeling while using and did not wash my hair-I could get the same result using plain water. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and love it as a shampoo. I keep it in a spice shaker in the shower, wet my hair, and then dump some onto different parts of my head and rub it in. I let it sit for a couple minutes, and then rub it around some more and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because I had awful dry scalp this winter, and even my usual shampoo (Rahua volumising) was getting too drying. This definitely solves the problem and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy either. It doesn&#x27;t have any smell, so I usually use conditioner before or after using this just for the smell. I find that you don&#x27;t actually need conditioner while using this, though. I love how it&#x27;s cheap too. I may be a permanent convert!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Hesh Shikakai powder for $1.99.  The powder got really grainy when mixed with water.  The instant it was applied to my hair, it made the hair extremely hard.  I was very careful to mix the product very well, but there were still pebbles / grains in the end mixture, which I am certain is not good for hair in general. The only good thing I have to say about this product is that at least it did not smell as bad as the Aritha powder that is also made my the same company.  There was nothing good about the powder.  Save your money, time and hair.  You will need some seriously deep conditioning to bring your hair back to normal.  It took me forever to was the pebbles that this products left in my hair.  I would not recommend it or purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I use this in combo with other powders to make a hair rinse to condition my hair and strengthen it. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The owners were nice and the product shipped fast! Though my boxes were a bit bent up there was no problem. Even the product was still in date. Don&#x27;t you hate getting some out of date product?</li>
            <li> I used shikakai on my hair every sunday growing up, it&#x27;s great and you will notice significantly lesser hair fall / loss. I&#x27;m talking about those few strands of hair that you always lose with the usage of a conditioner. It&#x27;s not going to make your hair silky and oil-free but it does make it healthy.</li>
            <li> Pretty good cleanser mixed with Amla hair was sooo soft (4b hair).</li>
            <li> I love Ayurvedic  powders. I discovered this one about 5 years ago at a neighborhood store that has since closed down. This will always be one of my staples.</li>
            <li> I hate it! it stays on your hair even after several shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;it dries my hair.&lt;br /&gt;maybe it&#x27;s just my hair (4c) but works perfect on my friend (4c) as well</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing after each treatment!</li>
            <li> This product is good - but i&#x27;d like to say - if you live in city/state where you have Indian Grocery stores - this item sells for $2.00 Max -- i get mine for $1.59 + tax</li>
            <li> I use a combination of Amla, Shikakai and Brahmi with some Amla oil and it works well for me - I can start feeling the difference in terms of texture and hair fall.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this anymore, but I should reconsider. This is a mild shampoo and does clean the hair and condition as well. I think it does better than typical shampoo. The smell is strong and can be a turn off.</li>
            <li> I like to use natural and organic products, but I just didn&#x27;t realize any real benefit&lt;br /&gt;from using this product.</li>
            <li> Good product to add to my hair mask. Makes my hair grow faster..happy camper..not 5 stars because does leave my hair tangly. Cheaper at local Indian grocery store.</li>
            <li> I mixed this product with henna. After using - my hair was nice and healthy looking! It is awesome and I will DEFINITELY BE PURCHASING IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Its was very difficult rinsing it out of my hair ... It does feel stronger</li>
            <li> I got this powder because traditional shampoos and conditioners were making my head itch. Needless to say, my head still itched after using this, but I did somewhat like using it. My problem with this powder was the mess and it doesn&#x27;t get a lot of the oils out of my hair. I could see someone who washed their hair everyday benefiting from this. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday (as you shouldn&#x27;t) so when I went to use this my hair was still greasy. I also felt like my ends were getting too dry with this and had to use a condition anyways. I ended up using regular shampoo and conditioner and adding 15 or so drops of tea tree oil to them. My head feels much better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my friends. Seems they like it. But to be on fair side I am not the right to rate it.</li>
            <li> This product is very effective and I can not emphasize enough how good it is to promote hair growth, strengh and shine.  It also seems to help maintain my natural hair color and keep the gray at bay.  I wish I had found it many, many years earlier.  I mix a spoonful of Shikakai and Amla powder on my regular conditioner and use it once or twice a week when I wash my hair. I also mix a spoonful of Brahmi powder in my regular shampoo.  I will always, always use this product along with Amla and Brahmi powders. These powders are just that good.</li>
            <li> Shikakai Powder used along with Amla, Henna, and Senna makes a perfect conditioning mask for overly dry, lifeless, limp hair!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. First time user so jury is still out. Hair looks and feels the same so no hram.</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure if this worked in my hair.  I can&#x27;t really tell if my hair felt cleaner or not, I do know it was a bit difficult to wash out.  I used this alone in place of a shampoo.  I think next time I will try this with my mud wash (which will hopefully give it more effort).  I don&#x27;t know if this is worth purchasing again.  But we will see the second time around.  Maybe I need a new technique to use, but I didn&#x27;t want to use it like a conditioner like many do because it is suppose to clean your hair.  So we will see.</li>
            <li> I am not completely sure what is the purpose for this product once you can buy shampoo... I just got it to try, but it is messy, smells funny and dries out my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on Amazon before. Frankly, I&#x27;ve never been so pleased with a product I&#x27;ve ordered before either. I saw a blog entry in passing about how great this product was, so I decided it was worth a try (especially considering how inexpensive it is). I have very dry, fine and brittle hair. I&#x27;ve been self conscious of my hair for the last few years, so I&#x27;ve been trying everything to stimulate hair growth. I have started using Shikakai powder once a week, and I don&#x27;t know how I would go on without it now. My hair feels soft and healthy just after letting the paste set in my hair for 15 minutes. I have always struggled to give my hair a good clean, and this product rejuvenated my scalp in a way I never thought possible.</li>
            <li> We have been using for our hair care. I have nothing to say anything better than this items works really well and delivers the results.</li>
            <li> Shikakai is a natural shampoo. It help your hair to be bouncy. It does not strip the hair of its natural oils so it is good for ladies with dry hair.</li>
            <li> Good enough for natural care. Good alternative for regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> After using this product as a measure my hair has been eye catching I used this powder with my henna and it have me more then great results</li>
            <li> This is the first time writing a comment, on a product.  I always had thick hair, lots of shedding over the years.  I thought it was due to  the relaxers I used for so many years.  My hair was thining and shedding at an amazing rate. To add to my problem, I began graying which added another chemical to my damage hair.I decided to give  n&amp;eacute;em, shikakai, Aritha and Amla a try.  I began this journey May 30 2015., I trim my hair, off approximately 3 inches.  I had my hair in a proactive style,(braids) for two months.  I noticed my hair grew 1.5 inches in first month.  I removed the braid, my hair grew but The most amazing thing. I noticed the shedding, decreased, vertually stopped, just a few strands of hair in the Comb.  The mixture is messy but it is worth it.  My mixture  consist of Amla powder, neem powder, shikakai powder,  Aretha powder mixed about 1 tsp full of each, in Amal oil and coconut oil.  Combined all together in a paste.  Part your hair into  four sections and apply the mixture to your hair.  Leave on for 45-60 mins; rinse your hair well in the shower work best. Use a shampoos of your choice to remove the excess power and residue.  My hair is soft and managable.  Hope this information helps.  I plan on using weekly, for the next year..</li>
            <li> My hair is afro textured and horribly picky when it comes to hair products. Salon brandss, drug store brands, indie brands, conditioner washing, if you name it, I&#x27;ve probably tried it. I&#x27;ve used shikakai off and on with great results, but now I&#x27;m using it exclusively with other ayurvedic herbs, and my hair had never been better. I mix it with amla, brahmi, and fenugreek powders for better results. When used consistantly over a long period of time, my hair feels amazing! Don&#x27;t expect this to lather, but no soap does not translate into dirty hair.</li>
            <li> Used this in combination with henna and alma for a henna gloss and loved the results!</li>
