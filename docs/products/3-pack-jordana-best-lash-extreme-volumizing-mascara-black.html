            <li>It&#x27;s an ok mascara.</li>
            <li>I discovered this brand about 1 year ago &amp; am so pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Jordana Best Lash and will continue to purchase this product as long as I wear mascara!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to build longer lashes.</li>
            <li>It is better to use fresh mascara anyway.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic mascaras at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>My dad ordered this for me, it came in perfect condition and color is very black.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>My lashes look full &amp; defined.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because it&#x27;s so cheap but trust me</li>
            <li>best one ive tried so far and very black.</li>
            <li>, that then spread too my eye lid and then over to my right eye.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other brands, and this is the only one that looks good, stays on all day/doesn&#x27;t smear, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be worried about the low price for this mascara, it is truly worth more than it&#x27;s selling for.</li>
            <li>They are even more affordable at Walgreens if you live near one.</li>
            <li>Minimal flaking and very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I have short, thin, and light eyelashes, and this is the only mascara I&#x27;ve found that makes them look great!</li>
            <li>I bought this based off a recommendation, and I really wish I hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It may be that too much begins coming out on the brush when you dip it in.  </li>
            <li>It is so reasonable though</li>
            <li>This stuff dries out your lashes so much that mine practically fell out when washing my face.</li>
            <li>it really does wonders to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Works very well when paired with another mascara.</li>
            <li>The product itself is wonderful, I enjoyed it, but it caused the worst reaction for me Ive ever had.</li>
            <li>Better than most expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I have short lashes and they are extended tremendously with this mascara.</li>
            <li>It separates lashes nicely and can work for a more finished dramatic look if you want dark full lashes or for a natural day, no-makeup  look</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look that full and long</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel wasteful just opening a new one.  </li>
            <li>mascara is far too clumpy for me.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes it stays well.</li>
            <li> Delivers long lashes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost $4 a tube at the drugstore so this definitely saved me a little bit of money.</li>
            <li> , I am on heavy medications now to try and bring my immune system back under control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It started as a small rash under my left eye</li>
            <li> So I now have swollen red and itchy eye sockets, not a nice experience at all.</li>
            <li> Please do a patch test before using, the pain torture is not worth risking it, wish I&#x27;d never bought it now,</li>
            <li> No matter what I use to remove it at night I always wake up with black under my eye.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars, because toward the end it gets a littlie clumpy, not a lot, just a little.</li>
            <li> Only thing i didn&#x27;t like was when my eyes watered, it&#x27;s definitely not good to rub your eyes after!</li>
            <li> 6 weeks off being normal unable to use any make up at all and taking steroids to try to counteract the issues this product caused!</li>
            <li> I usually grab them at walgreens, but opted to Amazon the 3 pack to save me some trips to the store.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick and clumpy</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes crazy thick and long looking!  </li>
            <li> and I find it&#x27;s very hard to get all the way off.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with the worst dermatits/excema around my eyes</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re getting a pack of three mascaras and the product is absolutely terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Definitely a holy grail item for me. It&#x27;s perfect for volume and I only need two coats. No touch ups needed.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best and so reasonably priced. They are even more affordable at Walgreens if you live near one. It separates lashes nicely and can work for a more finished dramatic look if you want dark full lashes or for a natural day, no-makeup  look</li>
            <li> My two daughters and I all agree that this is the best mascara ever!  Makes my eyelashes crazy thick and long looking!  I order 6 at a time and have been giving out to friends to try.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Makes my eyelashes look perfect. So glad I bought this and will be buying again. :)</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever... and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!! I found this reviewed on Makeupalley.com and that is why I purchased it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now, and I&#x27;ve used everything, from fiberlash mascara to the most expensive on the market. I LOVE Jordana Best Lash and will continue to purchase this product as long as I wear mascara!</li>
            <li> This mascara is the bomb. I have short, thin, and light eyelashes, and this is the only mascara I&#x27;ve found that makes them look great! I have tried so many other brands, and this is the only one that looks good, stays on all day/doesn&#x27;t smear, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I usually grab them at walgreens, but opted to Amazon the 3 pack to save me some trips to the store.</li>
            <li> I had been using this for 4 weeks now on and off since I got it and I ended up with the worst dermatits/excema around my eyes the professor said he had seen in years.&lt;br /&gt;It started as a small rash under my left eye, that then spread too my eye lid and then over to my right eye. It was so swollen and sore, I am on heavy medications now to try and bring my immune system back under control. So I now have swollen red and itchy eye sockets, not a nice experience at all. The product itself is wonderful, I enjoyed it, but it caused the worst reaction for me Ive ever had. Please do a patch test before using, the pain torture is not worth risking it, wish I&#x27;d never bought it now, Im still 6 weeks off being normal unable to use any make up at all and taking steroids to try to counteract the issues this product caused!</li>
            <li> Great mascara.  I have ordered it before. Better than most expensive brands. Lengthens without caking up.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite mascara. It&#x27;s almost $4 a tube at the drugstore so this definitely saved me a little bit of money. All three came individually wrapped just like they do at the store. Very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this mascara if you&#x27;re looking for one. I was hesitant at first because it&#x27;s so cheap but trust me it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this based off a recommendation, and I really wish I hadn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is far too clumpy for me.</li>
            <li> I will order this again.  I gave it 4 stars, because toward the end it gets a littlie clumpy, not a lot, just a little. It may be that too much begins coming out on the brush when you dip it in.  It is so reasonable though, I don&#x27;t feel wasteful just opening a new one.  It is better to use fresh mascara anyway.  I will continue ordering this product.</li>
            <li> This product actually comes in a pack of three so you&#x27;re getting a pack of three mascaras and the product is absolutely terrible. This stuff dries out your lashes so much that mine practically fell out when washing my face. I was hoping to buy one quality mascara but I got three ones. I&#x27;ll be throwing them away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to build longer lashes. Only thing i didn&#x27;t like was when my eyes watered, it&#x27;s definitely not good to rub your eyes after! But i didn&#x27;t notice running at all. So as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes it stays well. Minimal flaking and very easy to remove. So if you are looking for a good inexpensive mascara, this is it.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara !!! And I&#x27;m a makeup artist !!!</li>
            <li> Delivers long lashes!</li>
            <li> this mascara was amazing. best one ive tried so far and very black. im glad i purchased the 3 pack and i will be repurchasing. it came on tiem and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, wish it came in waterproof.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it really does wonders to my eyelashes. It also came on time</li>
            <li> My dad ordered this for me, it came in perfect condition and color is very black. Will be purchasing again soon, I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascaras at a fantastic price. Don&#x27;t be worried about the low price for this mascara, it is truly worth more than it&#x27;s selling for. I have short lashes and they are extended tremendously with this mascara. I fully recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works very well when paired with another mascara. I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best! I read about it in a make up blog and since trying it have tossed out my more expensive brands. This is all I will ever wear.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly and the product was in perfect condition and I use it everyday! Great price for a pack of three!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok mascara. It&#x27;s really thick and clumpy and I find it&#x27;s very hard to get all the way off. No matter what I use to remove it at night I always wake up with black under my eye.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s intended to do.  No complaints, whatsoever.</li>
            <li> it is nice ,but i was expecting more from it ,because all the wonders I&#x27;ve heard , its fine but it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look that full and long as i like and get with others</li>
            <li> This is my go-to mascara.  I discovered this brand about 1 year ago &amp; am so pleased with it.  My lashes look full &amp; defined.</li>
    </ol>
