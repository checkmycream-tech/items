            <li>It is super cute!</li>

            <li>It works but is much smaller than a &#x27;Kaboodle&#x27; case that I own (which I love!!)  </li>
            <li>I always get complimented on it too.&lt;br /&gt;So much better to be original.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate how the weight is evenly distributed on both sides so it doesn&#x27;t easily topple over.  </li>
            <li>that is why I took great care in picking the Pink Rose design.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Originally I got the 14&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and she really loved it, she said that it has the perfect shape, not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li>Very pleased overall.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty exteriorior.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m mostly happy with this adorable little light-weight case.</li>
            <li>and instead I received the Bright Pink Croc.</li>
            <li>So, if you own lots of makeup you make want to look for a bigger contraption.</li>
            <li>I have only traveled once since its purchase, but I found it saved time by keeping my make up neat and handy.</li>
            <li>First let me tell you that I did not receive the item I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Pink Rose case</li>
            <li>can be tricky but Will kEep my daughter out;)</li>
            <li>I really wanted the cases to match, but now I have a very loud (Bright Pink Croc, but it is not my style) case and do not have the matching 14&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is of okay build, about what I expected.</li>
            <li>It is of okay build, about what I expected.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>The compartments are sized reasonably well to hold her set of brushes and all her makeup.  </li>
            <li>I recieve the item i was really upset</li>
            <li>I love the pink roses.</li>
            <li>The lock is very chintzy.</li>
            <li>and I was very disapointed about this matter.  </li>
            <li>I love the pink and silver design!!</li>
            <li>Shelves inside seem more stable then most other makeup cases I&#x27;ve seen, but still a little bit flimsy.</li>
            <li>Not great, but good enough.nt auction.    </li>
            <li>I bought this case for my 10 year old daughter who does competitive dance and needs to haul her makeup around.  </li>
            <li>My 18 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>It is a Christmas gift for my 16 year old niece</li>
            <li>Not great, but good enough.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, hard to maneuver and has a weird new smell that never disappears lol</li>
            <li>If you use only sample size makeups you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is black and most makeup these days seem to be in black cases and tubes, I lined bottom colored</li>

            <li> TOO MUCH&amp;#34;,easily an $80 case at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Black dust gets on some things I put inside the box</li>
            <li> Comes with two little keys if you want to lock your case</li>

            <li> I just did not want to do black!</li>
            <li> It is rather small.</li>

            <li> Compartment deviders are to small for usual make up compacts.</li>
            <li> way to small</li>
            <li> /&gt;These cases are pricey and I saved for a long time to afford this case and now I am disappointed</li>
            <li> My disapointment in receiving the wrong case has colored my review.  </li>
            <li> I subtracted the fifth star for the fact that it was delivered by DHL who have become infamous for terrible delivery service, and indeed I got terrible delivery service this time around, I ended up picking it up myself.</li>

            <li> This case does not hold standard size compacts and lipsticks. If you use only sample size makeups you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is black and most makeup these days seem to be in black cases and tubes, I lined bottom colored paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, try the one with movable dividers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the smaller-than-3\\&quot; compartments, all items must go to bottom of case. This was supposed to help me organize my basic face regimen, including, wash, moisturize, sunblock, makeup, pencils, tubes, compacts. It flat out does not work for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upper shelves tend to tip backwards towards the ends and thus pencils and tubes roll back where can&#x27;t be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bottom compartment is very very deep. I guess this is where to keep fulll size bottles of lotion, shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash? But I am trying to organize my cosmetics. All I can do is stack stuff in it tightly or have a big jumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried thinking of other uses for it but decided to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is of okay build, about what I expected. Not great, but good enough.nt auction.    It is of okay build, about what I expected. Not great, but good enough.</li>

            <li> Just love it as it was a gift to my great granddaughter</li>
            <li> Made the perfect gift for my niece, as a performer of Philippine Folk dance. Fully enabling for her make up carrying needs at on-location performances.</li>
            <li> Scolded by wife for&amp;#34;SPENDING TOO MUCH&amp;#34;,easily an $80 case at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> It works but is much smaller than a &#x27;Kaboodle&#x27; case that I own (which I love!!)  Comes with two little keys if you want to lock your case (the keys fall out if you keep them in the lock with the little ring).  Wish it had more sections to hold more makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I like this for holding my makeup.</li>

The case is a great size for her and is very pretty.  The compartments are sized reasonably well to hold her set of brushes and all her makeup.

            <li> very pleased with my purchase.. great quality.. speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> It is super cute! I love the pink roses. It is rather small. So, if you own lots of makeup you make want to look for a bigger contraption. I am using this for travel and it is perfect that.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! I KEEP MY MEDS IN IT</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter and she is very happy which makes me happy :-)</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. She uses it for all the small accessories that go to her sewing machine.</li>
            <li> It has some mistakes and marks on it. I will show you in pictures,  I don&#x27;t know how to describe those.</li>
            <li> This is a well made case. The lock works well, both interior and exterior look nice and function well. It is spacious and has nice compartments for organizing makeup. I would definitely recommend this case if the dimensions are what you need.</li>
            <li> Lots of space to stash your makeup. The lock is very chintzy. Don&#x27;t expect it to work at all.</li>
            <li> Just started using it and so far I&#x27;m mostly happy with this adorable little light-weight case. I&#x27;m using it for aromatherapy instead of makeup. I needed something to carry oil bottles and basic blending tools and bases. The fourth star is docked because I don&#x27;t like the &#x27;shedding&#x27; black felt lining. Black dust gets on some things I put inside the box and I can&#x27;t have that stuff in my products. Going to try vacuuming it and hoping that solves that problem. I subtracted the fifth star for the fact that it was delivered by DHL who have become infamous for terrible delivery service, and indeed I got terrible delivery service this time around, I ended up picking it up myself. As far as packaging goes, that was all good, it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful and perfect size. My 18 year old daughter loves it. Says it is better than any she has seen.</li>
            <li> Mahalo!  Very pleased overall.  The only downfall was that I couldn&#x27;t get it to lock with the key.</li>
            <li> Originally I got the 14&amp;#34; size but it was way too big to lug around so I exchanged it for this smaller size and it&#x27;s perfect. Not too heavy, compartment inside is big enough for my brushes and the design is pretty and not cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Great upgrade from my shoe box LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect makeup suit case. It keeps all my makeup in an organized area.</li>
            <li> Best Vanity! i love it. I can take anywhere I want. Specially good for travel lovers.</li>
            <li> This train case is absolutely gorgeous!!  Much more stunning than the photos can convey.  It is a Christmas gift for my 16 year old niece and I cannot wait to give it to her!</li>
            <li> Had no key to lock . Compartment deviders are to small for usual make up compacts.</li>
            <li> I would have given five stars except for the flimsy trays that pull out. They just aren&#x27;t that sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;The box itself Is super cute! I love the pink and silver design!! I always get complimented on it too.&lt;br /&gt;So much better to be original. I just did not want to do black!</li>
            <li> First let me tell you that I did not receive the item I ordered.  I have not ever had that issue with amazon before and I was very disapointed about this matter.  I ordered the Pink Rose case and instead I received the Bright Pink Croc. design.  My disapointment in receiving the wrong case has colored my review.  I needed the 10&amp;#34; and 14&amp;#34; case and that is why I took great care in picking the Pink Rose design.  I really wanted the cases to match, but now I have a very loud (Bright Pink Croc, but it is not my style) case and do not have the matching 14&amp;#34; case.&lt;br /&gt;The case its self is nice. I do like how it holds my daily needs neat and organized.  I am very happy with it and hope it will travel well since I travel out of town on the weekends for business reasons.&lt;br /&gt;These cases are pricey and I saved for a long time to afford this case and now I am disappointed everytime I see it.  I am working on getting over it and maybe this review will help.</li>
            <li> Keeping all your beauty needs in one neat storage.  I like the sturdy durable case.  The locks snap shut and hold very good.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of room.&lt;br /&gt;Lock can be tricky but Will kEep my daughter out;)</li>
            <li> Very pretty exteriorior. Lots of storage inside. Shelves inside seem more stable then most other makeup cases I&#x27;ve seen, but still a little bit flimsy. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was&lt;br /&gt;Way way to small</li>
            <li> Love this makeup case cause it has plenty room and it&#x27;s also pink 😊</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter for Xmas</li>
            <li> I love this cosmetic organizer. I have only traveled once since its purchase, but I found it saved time by keeping my make up neat and handy. It prevented my makeup from getting mixed up with other packed items and saved me time by having my makeup sorted and packed before my trip. I use it at home, too.</li>
