            <li>Fits nicely into your hand, and very easy &amp; precise to use.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>These are just fantastic, they work so well that I have ripped a lot of my skin off!</li>
            <li>You can tell it will do a better job and allow more accuracy than those scissor-type models.  </li>
            <li>, IT&#x27;S EASY TO HOLD AND EASY TO USE.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but no one seems to make precise tweezers anymore.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to get something that looked more effective, and this has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>La Cross has a grip that is comfortable and works fairly well.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best tweezers in the world.</li>
            <li>I find these do a decent job, better than anything in the drugstore I could find.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to find mine at the Dollar Tree...</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable to use and it&#x27;s not hard to get use to the way you hold them in your palm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had much luck with them getting the really fine hairs, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, they do a good job if you are careful.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>you best be careful you&#x27;re only gripping the hair and not a flake of dry skin because it will peel yer hide off fella!  </li>
            <li>Sadly, it&#x27;s not so.</li>
            <li>Incidentally, the steel must be either polished or of a higher quality because it hasn&#x27;t rusted on the tips at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>I have now come back to search out more pairs SPECIFICALLY because they work so well . . .</li>
            <li>This tweezer are very helpful even on the go!</li>
            <li>But they are way better than the garbage I could find in the cosmetic departments of various stores.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think there would be that much variance in tweezers,</li>
            <li>Like others have said, you&#x27;d think that there wouldn&#x27;t be much tweezer variance, but there really</li>
            <li>but they really are so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>so I need several different kind of Tweezers for both me and my husband.</li>
            <li>After using pretty much every kind of straight tweezer on the market, this is the one for serious use.</li>
            <li>These tweezers fit my hands perfectly and unlikesome other tweezers I have purchased in the past, these do not scar my face because they are too sharp.</li>
            <li>They do a decent job of</li>
            <li>I was searching around for a new set and after reading the reviews on this one, I decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li>Tweezerman Stainless Steel Slant tweezer was much lighter in weight than the La Cross.</li>
            <li>Because they are sharp, they tend to break off the hair more often than the La Cross.</li>
            <li>you have ever suffered a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; pair of tweezers that just couldn&#x27;t get a firm grip on a fine hair, these are the tweezers for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these for a while now, and I doubt I&#x27;ll go back to straight ones.</li>
            <li>I bought the La Cross Tweezer and the Tweezerman Stainless Steel Slant tweezer.</li>
            <li>I struggled with a cheap, conventional tweezer for years just for occasionally grooming the eyebrow area.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy useing these it even takes the small hairs out.</li>
            <li>They are very close grabbers, like sometimes TOO close, be careful with these.</li>
            <li>Every pair I purchase has the same problem--the tips don&#x27;t meet completely.</li>
            <li>(I guess I used to waste time repositioning the tweezers between my fingers, but with these I keep the same grip the entire time) and don&#x27;t experience any of the skin pinching, having to go back for the same hair more than once, or grabbing hairs</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve thrown so much money down the drain at drugstores etc....</li>
            <li>Very using when you don&#x27;t like those black hair just there on your facial hairs.</li>

            <li> I have had a pair for 4 years now, as a random drugstore purchase . . .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE these tweezers ! 😊</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think there would be that much variance in tweezers, right? Sadly, it&#x27;s not so. After using pretty much every kind of straight tweezer on the market, this is the one for serious use. This one has two advantages--the finger hold and the ground points. The finger hold, curved away from the point, allows one to position the tweezer with a minimum of difficulty. Second, the points of this tweezer are ground down and actually come together snugly. If you&#x27;ve ever had a tweezer that simply didn&#x27;t close enough to grasp the splinter or hair, you&#x27;ll know how helpful this is. I&#x27;ve had one of these for a while now, and I doubt I&#x27;ll go back to straight ones. Incidentally, the steel must be either polished or of a higher quality because it hasn&#x27;t rusted on the tips at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, IT&#x27;S EASY TO HOLD AND EASY TO USE.  IT&#x27;S VERY PRECISE, SO YOU DON&#x27;T SPEND ALOT OF TIME ON YOUR EYEBROWS!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great.  They are the best I have ever found.  I recommended them to a friend, but she could not find them in a retail store. She was happy to find them on Amazon and is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> different but works well</li>
            <li> Seriously the best tweezers in the world. I could tweeze a flea&#x27;s eyebrows with these things.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, you&#x27;d think that there wouldn&#x27;t be much tweezer variance, but there really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever suffered a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; pair of tweezers that just couldn&#x27;t get a firm grip on a fine hair, these are the tweezers for you. I have had a pair for 4 years now, as a random drugstore purchase . . . the style intrigued me. I have now come back to search out more pairs SPECIFICALLY because they work so well . . . we are replacing all the tweezers in the house with these, as my husband and I both seek out this single pair for EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> These are just fantastic, they work so well that I have ripped a lot of my skin off! They are very close grabbers, like sometimes TOO close, be careful with these. They are very comfortable to use and it&#x27;s not hard to get use to the way you hold them in your palm. Would recommend these to any \\&quot;plucker\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This tweezer are very helpful even on the go! I enjoy useing these it even takes the small hairs out. Very using when you don&#x27;t like those black hair just there on your facial hairs. Great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but no one seems to make precise tweezers anymore. Every pair I purchase has the same problem--the tips don&#x27;t meet completely. I was hoping these would finally solve my problem. Alas, the same as every other pair I&#x27;ve tried. Guess I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> These tweezers fit my hands perfectly and unlikesome other tweezers I have purchased in the past, these do not scar my face because they are too sharp.</li>
            <li> BEST TWEEZERS ON THE MARKET, ALL TWEEZERS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL, THESE ARE GREAT</li>
            <li> After being so disappointed in tweezers I could find in drugstores, I came to amazon and looked around, read reviews and decided to buy the two with the top ratings. Since I&#x27;ve thrown so much money down the drain at drugstores etc....I figured what the heck, throw another 50 bucks at it and see what sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought the La Cross Tweezer and the Tweezerman Stainless Steel Slant tweezer. This review is going to be a comparison between the two.&lt;br /&gt;The La Cross has a grip that is comfortable and works fairly well. They don&#x27;t work as well the tweezers I replaced but does anything these days?  It seems quality has gone out the backdoor and China crap has come in the front door. Anyhow, I digress.  I find these do a decent job, better than anything in the drugstore I could find.  They do a decent job of gripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman Stainless Steel Slant tweezer was much lighter in weight than the La Cross. However, it has a sharper edge so one must be careful not to skin their hide off while tweezing. I&#x27;m not kidding....you best be careful you&#x27;re only gripping the hair and not a flake of dry skin because it will peel yer hide off fella!  I find they only grip on the side that is not pointed and I find it annoying that I must make sure I have it positioned right before it will grip the hair.  Because they are sharp, they tend to break off the hair more often than the La Cross. However, they do a good job if you are careful. I&#x27;ve not had much luck with them getting the really fine hairs, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m not thrilled with either pair because they do not match the quality and performance of the tweezers of yesteryear. But they are way better than the garbage I could find in the cosmetic departments of various stores.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers! I&#x27;ve had them for a couple years now. The price is shocking to see now. I was lucky to find mine at the Dollar Tree... $1 and they were mine. Had I known, I would&#x27;ve stocked up and sold them off at half price!</li>
            <li> These were difficult to hold and did not grip the hair tightly. Would not recommend to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> I struggled with a cheap, conventional tweezer for years just for occasionally grooming the eyebrow area.  I finally decided to get something that looked more effective, and this has not disappointed.  I&#x27;m very happy with the design.  You can tell it will do a better job and allow more accuracy than those scissor-type models.  Go ahead and buy this product it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Have a quilting business and need tweezers to remove threads... so I need several different kind of Tweezers for both me and my husband.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers and they work great!  My only problem is that after 1 trip in the shaving bag, the metal is rusting in areas.  I have cleaned them the best I can, but I would have liked them more if they didn&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the very best tweezers which I have ever seen or owned, in all respects.  Fits nicely into your hand, and very easy &amp; precise to use.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are awesome.  I was searching around for a new set and after reading the reviews on this one, I decided to go for it.  All I can say is that I don&#x27;t know why someone didn&#x27;t think of this shape earlier but they really are so much easier to use.  I have my eyebrows done in half the usual time (I guess I used to waste time repositioning the tweezers between my fingers, but with these I keep the same grip the entire time) and don&#x27;t experience any of the skin pinching, having to go back for the same hair more than once, or grabbing hairs I didn&#x27;t mean to that I used to have with standard tweezers.  These tweezers are well-made, and have a guarantee, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great and I already have a few ladies in mind who will be getting a pair for Christmas!</li>
