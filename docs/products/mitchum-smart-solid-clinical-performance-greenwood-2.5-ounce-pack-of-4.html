            <li>very good value and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Best deoderant I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>This has to be one of the better antiperspirants out there.  </li>
            <li>I love mitchum.  </li>
            <li>A roll on would be better.</li>
            <li>Antiperspirant is great but the smell is too much for me.  </li>
            <li>Is very good but can fall apart rather easily if you push it too far out of the plastic tube.</li>
            <li>Smells good, goes on smooth, keeps me dry, keeps the people around me happy.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, and I enjoy smelling my underarms!</li>
            <li>It works but it does fall apart and crumble easily.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Mitchum makes fabulous antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>It smells modern (not cheesy in an old spice red zone kind of way either) and goes on perfectly.</li>
            <li>I was an Old Spice man for many years, and I made the switch to Mitchum.</li>
            <li>worth each penny</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what I wanted and arrived fast! !</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and smooth, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked great for about 2 years, not sure if the formula changed</li>
            <li>I found this solid deodorant goes on light, leaves no powder on my skin and certainly stops underarm odor.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Hey, makes my pits not stink and not sweat (much).  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other antiperspirant ive used, but it will give me a rash if I use it exclusively.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this stuff as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>product actually irritated my skin, even though i&#x27;ve been using this same item for more than 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A quick hint for anyone reading this: Only buy what you are going to use in six months.</li>
            <li>highly suggest if you sweat a lot like me</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I normally go with the unsented, but this time I went with the Greenwood.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend mitchum smart solid in greenwood if you&#x27;re thinking about a switch.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break my skin and pretty much any other deodorant will.</li>
            <li>The price on amazon was MUCH cheaper than in the store, and Mitchum is the only deodorant I buy.  </li>
            <li>I used to be an Old Spice man.</li>
            <li>The product was too old.</li>
            <li>I used to be an Old Spice man, but the stuff wouldn&#x27;t cut it in summertime.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if this is from a different &amp;#34;lot&amp;#34;, but this product doesn&#x27;t seem like the product i normally purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>used earlier Mitchum antiperspirants and have been using the Smart Solid for about a year.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure why any full grown man would consider something else.</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant brand I ever use, because it keeps me really dry for much longer than I thought possible.</li>
            <li>It has improved my social life.</li>
            <li>Mitchum Smart Solid keeps my shirt dry all day long.</li>
            <li>I notice that the Smart Solid will dry out and split if left unused for too long.</li>
            <li>Trying to find the Greenwood scent in stores is really tough, so I like having this available via Amazon.</li>

            <li> It goes on dry unlike the roll-on or the fake solids that are just goop squeezed through holes in an oval top.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> This four pack was fresh and over the hill, not dried up and difficult to use like some I have ordered.</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry, doesnt smell, and is simple as can be.</li>
            <li> This one has been my favorite for years, the only bad part is that it goes on a bit wet and really needs to dry for 10-15 min before putting your shirt on or it will feel wet all day.</li>
            <li> and it blocks oddor all day long as supposed to.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad, he used it once and says that all day long his armpits HURT, when he got home and looked at them - they look bruised.</li>
            <li> It was not old.  </li>
            <li> used to alternate, but it gives me rough spots that are not comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With other brands/products you can use them all the way down to the plastic, but I find these tend to break off the applicator before the product has been completely used up.</li>
            <li> The product keeps me dry, even during the warmest of conditions.</li>
            <li> I put it on and wait for it to dry before putting on my shirt.  </li>
            <li> Do apply on body when area is DRY,</li>
            <li> I have found it difficult to procure the scented Smart Solid Antiperspirant at my local retail stores and now have it automatically delivered with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I switched to this product a few years ago, and have not looked back.</li>
            <li> I got only a few uses before it all fell apart.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is that sometimes the product will break off down near the end...</li>
            <li> It is not flawless on the hottest summer days (I live in DC and we had multiple 90+ days this summer), but it holds up well compared to other deoderants.  </li>
            <li> No match to other brands... not even Axe... which will wear off in about 8 hours...</li>
            <li> No more white chunks clinging to my armpits, or staining my dark shirts and pants.  </li>
            <li> Not worth deducting a star though.</li>
            <li> With products from other manufacturers, I tend to perspire heavily even while working my desk job.  </li>
            <li> Gave me a rash/broken skin on using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve apparently wasted a lot of money buying it at store prices, and I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the deoderant fell out of the plastic...</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely hard and cracked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for their advertising campaign and it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve used since I was a child</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find it at stores lately for some reason, so i bought it here on amazon</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there was something wrong with this batch or it is typical for the Greenwood -</li>
            <li> It is less messy than the gel, though still gets on clothing, and doesn&#x27;t bleach clothes as bad as the gel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect but none of them are.</li>
            <li> Just a bad product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Gave me a rash/broken skin on using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> This has one of the highest %&#x27;s of aluminum which is the ingredient that keeps you from sweating. This one has been my favorite for years, the only bad part is that it goes on a bit wet and really needs to dry for 10-15 min before putting your shirt on or it will feel wet all day.</li>
            <li> works great and smells even better.  highly suggest if you sweat a lot like me</li>
            <li> If by chance you skip a day, no worries.</li>
            <li> Mitchum makes fabulous antiperspirants.

            <li> This deodorant is just fantastic. I was an Old Spice man for many years, and I made the switch to Mitchum. The smell is fantastic, and I enjoy smelling my underarms!</li>
            <li> very good value and shipped fast. what can I we like it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find this product in the stores, but it&#x27;s the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  With Subscribe and Save it&#x27;s even cheaper than going to the drug store or department store chain.  Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Mitchum works the best out of all the products on the market for me, and it doesn&#x27;t discolor my shirts.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the better antiperspirants out there.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> I love mitchum.  It has a great scent and great protection.  I use it everyday.  It is not flawless on the hottest summer days (I live in DC and we had multiple 90+ days this summer), but it holds up well compared to other deoderants.  i would recommend switching your deoderant every 6 months so the bacteria in your body doesn&#x27;t adjust.  i feel like my body adjusted to mitchum, so now I go back and forth with another brand, but I still fully support it.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Some supermarkets stopped carrying this. So i purchase by bulk on here. The Best deodorant on the market if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Really works. My son loves this product and uses it daily. No irritation.</li>
            <li> The best money can buy in my opinion. Trying to find the Greenwood scent in stores is really tough, so I like having this available via Amazon. The product keeps me dry, even during the warmest of conditions. I will buy this stuff as long as it&#x27;s available. A quick hint for anyone reading this: Only buy what you are going to use in six months. I notice that the Smart Solid will dry out and split if left unused for too long.</li>
            <li> The absolute best.  Nothing compares.</li>
            <li> I normally go with the unsented, but this time I went with the Greenwood.  I am not sure if there was something wrong with this batch or it is typical for the Greenwood - but chunks of this stuff break off when using it.  I have probably lost 25% of the product.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that keeps me dry. It is less messy than the gel, though still gets on clothing, and doesn&#x27;t bleach clothes as bad as the gel.  The gel LITERALLY bleaches everything it touches - ugh.  I put it on and wait for it to dry before putting on my shirt.  I do still sweat a bit but nothing compared to sweating without it.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 3 years, and as an athletic male that needs to not instantly turn off a woman with sweat stains, I don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> The price on amazon was MUCH cheaper than in the store, and Mitchum is the only deodorant I buy.  Everything else irritates my skin.  I am very glad I found this deal.  I&#x27;ve apparently wasted a lot of money buying it at store prices, and I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> Is very good but can fall apart rather easily if you push it too far out of the plastic tube.</li>
            <li> Out of all the deodorants, this one is still the best.  It&#x27;s not perfect but none of them are.</li>
            <li> Works just as well for me as the solid. This is the only deodorant brand I ever use, because it keeps me really dry for much longer than I thought possible. Shipped quickly, and it smells nice and the price was great.</li>
            <li> This is not a scent I prefer.  Otherwise it works just fine.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best deodorant you can buy. Doesn&#x27;t break my skin and pretty much any other deodorant will. Smells great too and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best. It&#x27;s the longest lasting solid I&#x27;ve ever tried and it also has a pleasant, non-overpowering fragrance. It goes on dry unlike the roll-on or the fake solids that are just goop squeezed through holes in an oval top.</li>
            <li> I found this solid deodorant goes on light, leaves no powder on my skin and certainly stops underarm odor.  Do apply on body when area is DRY,</li>
            <li> Great Stuff. Works well; has a pleasant aroma. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best deoderant I have used so far.  It doesnt smell so it doesnt mix with my perfume and it blocks oddor all day long as supposed to.</li>
            <li> Hey, makes my pits not stink and not sweat (much).  The best</li>
            <li> I used to be an Old Spice man. I&#x27;m a sucker for their advertising campaign and it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve used since I was a child but you can&#x27;t argue with results.  This was recommended to me by a friend and is now what I use and recommend.</li>
            <li> I had totally forgotten about this product, so I purchased again once remembered, and I do like the scent, and the potency in the odor fighter, without breaking me out in some rash.  Truly a great product * will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> It works but it does fall apart and crumble easily. I will not be reordering. A roll on would be better.</li>
            <li> excellent porduct. worth each penny</li>
            <li> This four pack was fresh and over the hill, not dried up and difficult to use like some I have ordered.</li>
            <li> Antiperspirant is great but the smell is too much for me.  5 stars for the unscented version.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best deodorant out there. Smells good, goes on smooth, keeps me dry, keeps the people around me happy. The one complaint I have is that sometimes the product will break off down near the end... With other brands/products you can use them all the way down to the plastic, but I find these tend to break off the applicator before the product has been completely used up. Not worth deducting a star though.</li>
            <li> What can you say? It has improved my social life.</li>
            <li> The product was too old. It was extremely hard and cracked. After a few uses, the deoderant fell out of the plastic...</li>
            <li> best ever, for real. smells great, now i&#x27;m stocked up for like 2-3 years.  can&#x27;t find it at stores lately for some reason, so i bought it here on amazon</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad, he used it once and says that all day long his armpits HURT, when he got home and looked at them - they look bruised. He will not use again and definately would not recommend based on his experience.</li>
            <li> I used to be an Old Spice man, but the stuff wouldn&#x27;t cut it in summertime. I switched to this product a few years ago, and have not looked back. It goes on clear and smooth, and dries quickly. No more white chunks clinging to my armpits, or staining my dark shirts and pants.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Use it every morning and no accumulation on Tee shirts.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  The product breaks apart, chunk by chunk.  I got only a few uses before it all fell apart.  It was not old.  Just a bad product.</li>
            <li> This does not work for me and as others have stated it does crumble when using it.</li>
            <li> Of all the clinical strength brands, this one lasts the longest and works just as good as the rest, better price.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that will satisfy my needs when it comes to fighting B.O.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it for years now, and its is the best. No match to other brands... not even Axe... which will wear off in about 8 hours...</li>
            <li> Works better than any other antiperspirant ive used, but it will give me a rash if I use it exclusively.  An evening shower will fix that, but I cant even use this stuff anymore.  used to alternate, but it gives me rough spots that are not comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great for about 2 years, not sure if the formula changed but I cant use it even for a day anymore before a monster rash comes out of nowhere.  Was my go-to, and if it works for you, it will probably be the best you can find.  Keeps you dry, doesnt smell, and is simple as can be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kidding! Well maybe. Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure why any full grown man would consider something else. This stuff works, and it works well. It smells modern (not cheesy in an old spice red zone kind of way either) and goes on perfectly. I&#x27;d highly recommend mitchum smart solid in greenwood if you&#x27;re thinking about a switch.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for this item that was meant for the chew sticks I ordered.  This item was exactly what I wanted and arrived fast! !</li>
