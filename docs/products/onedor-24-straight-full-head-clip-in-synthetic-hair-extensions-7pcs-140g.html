            <li>They&#x27;re good for people that wear their hair straight and that&#x27;s all I know so far with them!</li>

            <li>and I was super upset.</li>
            <li>Super soft and quick shipping!!</li>
            <li>Definitely reccomond to anyone looking for nice and affordable hair extensions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was SUPER fast too!</li>
            <li>But something just didn&#x27;t look quite right.</li>
            <li>thank you very much üòçüòçüòç</li>
            <li>these r not my first.</li>
            <li>Looks just like my real hair!  </li>
            <li>After the first wear I was never able to get them to looks as good as they did right out of the package.</li>
            <li>I love long hair but my hair never seems to grow below my collar bone!</li>
            <li>but it a certain way to treat that</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really blend well.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair..</li>
            <li>They feel real.</li>
            <li>Even the real hair from there</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and comes with a case thing for the hair</li>
            <li>As long as you put them in correctly then they should blend perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft, looks natural, and doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>, I expected this to be on the thinner side, which is fine for my hair.</li>
            <li>I plan on trimming the prices just so that it blends a little better.</li>
            <li>They blend nicely and that&#x27;s coming from a girl with below shoulder length thick hair.</li>
            <li>The hair was still perfectly fine (although I&#x27;m unaware whether or not it actually dyed the hair extensions.</li>
            <li>I brushed it out and took out the tiny knots fine.</li>
            <li>I recommend these for realistic pricing or Bellami for the real deal high quality HUMAN hair..</li>
            <li>Very soft feelings.</li>
            <li>I received this product today and was very pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I am 16 years old and I am always trying new things with my hair.</li>
            <li>I guess they&#x27;re such high quality that they CAN so far handle heat.</li>
            <li>It is really thick hair and very true to color(to</li>
            <li>but other then those things I am happy not so expensive either.</li>
            <li>I love these, really thick synthetic hair strands and long!</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s thinner than other pieces purchased in the past, the texture is silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Thanks to the other reviews</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re soft and long.</li>
            <li>The only problem that I have with it is that is tangles very easily, so I have been wary of wearing them on a windy day.</li>

            <li> with the hair falling out of course they fall out if your rough with it and brush it.</li>

            <li> the item took a while to get here but that because i bought other things too</li>
            <li> They were heavy as hell and obviously since my hair is a little shorter than my shoulders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned not to use a regular brush on these, it only makes it worse when getting any tangles out.</li>

            <li> dark brown worked well for my black Brown hair.</li>
            <li> I wear mine everyday</li>
            <li> previously stated these do get frizzy, but thats no biggy for me!</li>
            <li> My hair is not as shiny as the extensions, so I ran my straightener on 400¬∞ degrees over them a few times to dull the shine.</li>
            <li> Needless to say they are going to be worn daily XP</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was the hair is very thin.</li>
            <li> my hair is thick so as I said before I bought 2 packs.</li>
            <li> so I ended up cutting them just below my breasts (about half the hair).</li>
            <li> I mean all hair tangles, fake or not.</li>
            <li> Horrible synthetic hair</li>

            <li> I am 16 years old and I am always trying new things with my hair. I love long hair but my hair never seems to grow below my collar bone! I ordered these hair extensions in dark brown and recievee them 3 days later! I am 5&#x27;1&amp;#34; and they were very long on my so I ended up cutting them just below my breasts (about half the hair). When I cut them they no longer tangled easily and I even put layers in them to go along with my own hair. The color matched perfectly and the clips work great. I did cut a swatch of hair off the extensions and dyed it dark brown. The hair was still perfectly fine (although I&#x27;m unaware whether or not it actually dyed the hair extensions. My hair is not as shiny as the extensions, so I ran my straightener on 400¬∞ degrees over them a few times to dull the shine. They work fine now and they blend in perfectly. I get lots of compliments! Definitely worth the buy! (:</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really blend well. I&#x27;ve had mine for awhile and still can&#x27;t curl them and the hair falls out in chunks when I brush them. After the first wear I was never able to get them to looks as good as they did right out of the package.</li>
            <li> You get a pretty good product considering the price. I got the brown ones and it didn&#x27;t match my hair that good but they are so long and silky but they do tangle a bit. But it&#x27;s nice product.</li>
            <li> They are great for the price! I wear mine everyday</li>
            <li> They tangled super easy and once they get tangled they stay and I had to throw them away</li>
            <li> i am trying to grow my hair out so meanwhile i was looking for cheap but good extensions. these r not my first. i bought sone before that were remy but they were so thin!&lt;br /&gt;these r beautiful! great body, nice and thick. i bought 2 sets because my hair is kinda thick.&lt;br /&gt;as previously stated these do get frizzy, but thats no biggy for me! suuuper happy with my purchase and would most definitely purchase from this seller again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my hair is thick so as I said before I bought 2 packs. But something just didn&#x27;t look quite right. They were heavy as hell and obviously since my hair is a little shorter than my shoulders they didn&#x27;t blend THAT well.&lt;br /&gt;SO I layered them and I trimmed them a bit so they weren&#x27;t QUITE as long and here is the result! Needless to say they are going to be worn daily XP</li>
            <li> I love it thank you very much üòçüòçüòçüëçüëç</li>
            <li> Really great, just needs some layering to blend well.</li>
            <li> Very soft feelings. It&#x27;s good to braid with it. The style comes out lovely !</li>
            <li> Great quality hair! Amazing customer service as well. Very little shedding, and looks very natural when in. Definitely reccomond to anyone looking for nice and affordable hair extensions.</li>
            <li> ¬°Me encantaron!&lt;br /&gt;I loved them!</li>
            <li> Color was way off not usable</li>
            <li> 1st time of using hair extensions..so started with the synthetic one..I have naturally straight hair.. My hair has medium thickness..nd this extension make them look better.. I gave it a trim to get the shape of my own hair style...nd the clips are well made..</li>
            <li> It is really thick hair and very true to color(to me it is though). I love it! I&#x27;ve learned not to use a regular brush on these, it only makes it worse when getting any tangles out. I recently bought a extension brush and it gets the tangles out! I love these, really thick synthetic hair strands and long! As my hair gets longer I&#x27;ll be able to blend these in more to my natural hair.</li>
            <li> these extensions are great for the price, they do tangle easily, i ordered a darker color than my hair i plan on dying my hair darker, the dark brown is a beautiful color. again my only complaint is the fact they tangle.</li>
            <li> Horrible synthetic hair</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical buying these but they match perfectly! And they&#x27;re soft and long. Have some tangling but most extensions do that.. I mean all hair tangles, fake or not. When I was looking at reviews I was looking for more so.. Like can these curl or handle heat? I guess they&#x27;re such high quality that they CAN so far handle heat. But I&#x27;ll add photos later when I can actually sit down and test them out entirely. They blend nicely and that&#x27;s coming from a girl with below shoulder length thick hair. As long as you put them in correctly then they should blend perfectly fine. I was looking to know also if these are shiny and have any hairs of glitter and such(like most do..). Over all I&#x27;ll give 5 stars unless these don&#x27;t curl or something then 4. They&#x27;re good for people that wear their hair straight and that&#x27;s all I know so far with them! They feel real. They&#x27;re 10000x better than the Sally&#x27;s ones. Even the real hair from there lol. I recommend these for realistic pricing or Bellami for the real deal high quality HUMAN hair.. Hope this helps some people.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and comes with a case thing for the hair, the color didn&#x27;t match to well and was super shiny but after a couple of uses it faded.  They can be curled and straightened but it&#x27;s takes a bit of time.  I also had to re-sew some of the clips .hair gets tangled fast and is hard to brush..  but other then those things I am happy not so expensive either.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!! IT SEEMS LONGER THAN 22&amp;#34; BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE HAIR EXTENSIONS... I DO RECOMMEND THEM TO BUYERS. with the hair falling out of course they fall out if your rough with it and brush it. its sewed on synthetic hair on hair clips... even human hair sewed into clips falls off... I did straighten it it doesn&#x27;t melt as long as you jeep the heat at a low temperature.. and no I didn&#x27;t spray it wet. care instructions say to but I didn&#x27;t. my hair is short cause a hairstylist cut it too short for my liking and I was super upset. so I bought this I love it. dark brown worked well for my black Brown hair.</li>
            <li> this was my first  time buying clip in and i thought when i got them they were awesome. the item took a while to get here but that because i bought other things too but otherwise it a great product besides it tangles easily but it a certain way to treat that</li>
            <li> Super soft and quick shipping!!</li>
            <li> I received this product today and was very pleasantly surprised!  Thanks to the other reviews, I expected this to be on the thinner side, which is fine for my hair. Although it&#x27;s thinner than other pieces purchased in the past, the texture is silky smooth! Yes, it does get tangled. But it&#x27;s hair! I brushed it out and took out the tiny knots fine. I plan on trimming the prices just so that it blends a little better. I don&#x27;t plan on curling the extensions, so I can&#x27;t speak on styling just yet. Considering the price, fast shipping price and quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Looks just like my real hair!  The only problem that I have with it is that is tangles very easily, so I have been wary of wearing them on a windy day.</li>
            <li> Was not for me but my niece loves them</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair! It&#x27;s super soft, looks natural, and doesn&#x27;t tangle. The only problem I had was the hair is very thin. I got 1 set thinking 120g would be enough, but I would probably need to get 3 sets next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was SUPER fast too!</li>
