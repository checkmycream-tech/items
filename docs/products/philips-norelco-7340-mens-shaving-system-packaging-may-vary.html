            <li>and it&#x27;s working great.  </li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li>great shaver I get one of closet shaves.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, it shaves great too.  </li>
            <li>Everything works great on it.</li>
            <li>Great product--have used a 5000 series Norelco for ~20 yrs still works but wanted a backup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a happy Norelco user for 30 years.  </li>
            <li>great value, i have been using electrics for 30+ years.</li>
            <li>and I got it at a great price too.</li>
            <li>I was happily relieved by Norelco&#x27;s tech support who said that the motor has not been slowed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
            <li>This thing is great.</li>
            <li>Great close shave, battery lasts about three weeks before it needs recharging.</li>

            <li>All around this is a great value.</li>
            <li>Forgive me, Norelco, for I had sinned, but if it&#x27;s any consolation, the Braun never made me happy.</li>
            <li>Great razor for under $70.</li>
            <li>It does a great job</li>
            <li>and I look great too.&lt;br /&gt;Cricket</li>
            <li>Great eBayer</li>
            <li>which worked great for over 3 years.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>great product, i would buy from them again.</li>
            <li>; it is very handy.</li>
            <li>I am reviewing this years after buying it here - still works great, a great close shave, good battery life too.</li>
            <li>rotary shaver does an Amazing job!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great with good performance in shaving, especailly concerning about 41 bucks price.</li>
            <li>Still a nice razor, but not an upgrade!</li>
            <li>When I was shopping I was impressed that I could use the Norelco shaver for 45 days and still be able to return it.  </li>
            <li>Not the best shaver out there, but this thing has held up strong over the years.</li>
            <li>Yes, its a good shave</li>
            <li>It replaced a Remington cordless that did a good job, but the battery died on.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, the battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>But to this price, it&#x27;s fair.</li>
            <li>Once a month give it a good cleaning according to the enclosed directions and do not forget to oil the heads with a drop of mineral oil.  </li>
            <li>This razor is quieter but it takes longer to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>I get a good shave every</li>
            <li>A good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Purchased the 7340 in May, 2009, and it is good value for money and does the job.</li>
            <li>If you need a good shaver at a good price---this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>GOOD BATTERY++</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard PHILLIPS/NORELCO were good.    </li>
            <li>good ~</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s good price was a plus.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is good and charge lasted about 10-12 shaves.</li>
            <li>You get a good, close shave with this without my skin getting irritated.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s not even a good shave for the pain.  </li>
            <li>This is a good shaver at a good price.</li>
            <li>nice looking and great feel on hand.</li>
            <li>off to Norelco for another good mid-range priced electric razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a good lower cost Norelco.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a good lower cost Norelco.  </li>
            <li>And I believe  Tissot is a good brand.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>But is a good stuff</li>
            <li>Fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Battery life seems good.</li>
            <li>I have bought two of this razor for my husband and father,they told me that the quality is good and the product is Ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He said he will tell his friends how good these shalver.</li>
            <li>The 7340XL is well-balanced and has a good feel in the hand.  </li>
            <li>Good product .</li>
            <li>Good battery life before recharging, good trimmer, and balanced in the hand.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver.</li>
            <li>I was using for 10 years, but the deal was too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li>One of the best at the original price point.  </li>
            <li>The greatest convenience and best feature is the ability to open the unit and rinse it out under the sink.  </li>
            <li>When you need a highly effective razor, but do not want to spend 50 dollars, this is very suitable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real easy.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this model.</li>
            <li>I amm very pleased with this product and the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>up is real easy</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m most happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite and effective, also good for your money.</li>
            <li>A very nice feature is being able to wash out the blade area with running water, eliminating the need to use a brush.</li>
            <li>It works great; gives a close, smooth shave; and is very easy and convenient to use!</li>
            <li>This razor is an excellent choice for regifting this season. ;)</li>
            <li>I love this razor!</li>
            <li>More freedom!  </li>
            <li>, dont worry, you will love it!</li>
            <li>&quot; are also top drawer!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m still getting better using it!</li>
            <li>Really smooth shave!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the product, but I love the customer service!</li>
            <li>pretty nice price &#x3D;D</li>
            <li>Very good price, is a good shaving option, is my first of this kind</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly the best razor deal and closest shave ever!!</li>
            <li>I have found this latest Norelco to be lightweight, comfortable to hold and to the point - it gives me a very good shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves well, and cleans up nicely in running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do NOT recommend shaving while driving, this could be hazardous to your health!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think the 7340 has worked out great, and is the best overall value Norelco Shaver.  </li>
            <li>Nice Close</li>
            <li>This 7340 shaves well, holds a charge and fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li>I found this shaver to be quite nice for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, Norelco&#x27;s descriptions of their shavers no longer tell you what kind of battery is inside.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift, and he liked the shaver</li>
            <li>an excellent shaver at a reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced that an electric razor gives as good a shave as a blade and it is certainly more convenient.</li>
            <li>Just pour warm water over it and no worries.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a reasonably priced electric shaver for my son, he&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco 7340 shaver, with its patented \\&quot;floating heads\\&quot; system, is as good as or better than any electric shaver I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco has a well-engineered and nicely manufactured product in this shaver.</li>
            <li>Honest seller.</li>
            <li>good price, nice cut (after skin got used to it after 2 weeks), holds a charge for every day use for more than 7 days.  </li>
            <li>When they worked, they liked them, But, both of the shavers stopped working (would no longer charge) in 2014.  </li>
            <li>A nice feature is that you can rinse off the hair and blades with tap water.  </li>
            <li>Having a Norelco razor for many years with excellent results, I first tried to find a replacement battery as it had reached the end of life.  </li>
            <li>great arrived as described, charged the battery full,</li>
            <li>I resently went with the full on bald look and this shaver is great for that.</li>
            <li>Norelco is an old friend, I have used them for many years, seldom wear out, always to a good job, Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic was great, and always gave me a great share.  </li>
            <li>As I write this, it is now near the end of June, 2013, and I can honestly say this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Its very good and very close a shave to the skin.</li>
            <li>Using a good electric pre-shave solution is important.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to use and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>This one is by far the best one I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had (7340).</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver as a replacement for my old one, since day 1 I am very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I suppose this razor would be suitable for someone who shaves all the hair of there face and has no need to trim a beard.</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to wash it out after each use as well.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good, it replenishes quickly and gives him a nice shave.</li>
            <li>- The fact it is waterproof in the sense I CAN RISE IT UNDER TAP EASY CLEANING!    </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the quality of the product and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is very light in your hand and does an excellent job, and is not heavy in you hand.</li>
            <li>This is a very good quality product at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that, the shaver was great and it was nice being able to rinse it off with water for a fast cleaning!</li>
            <li>a few minutes, without water, lather, splashing, and rinsing gets me off to a great start to the day.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I made the move to the Philips Norelco 7340 Mens Shaver,.... and at $49.50 I&#x27;ll be saving money on razor blades for years.</li>
            <li>Certainly not the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought, but it is good for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>All things considered I&#x27;m very pleased although I DO wish this model gave me some sort of blinking light when the battery was about to die.</li>
            <li>to see a good brand such as Philips Norelco discontinue a good product and replace with inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;You will get years and years of good service with any 7310 or the 7340.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ergonomically designed, and is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Quick charge, holds a charge for 4-5 days and provides a good shave.  </li>
            <li>and it is quick and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>He is VERY particular and He was happy with the shaver.</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to hold in your hand, easy to clean, cordless, rechargeable, and does a great job shaving my husbands face.</li>
            <li>Its real easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>However, I am more than satisfied with my purchase of the Phillips Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I will be sure to purchase more items.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and decided Norelco seemed the safest bet.  </li>
            <li>Product doesn&#x27;t feel or sound powerful but it does the job great.</li>
            <li>mostly just yanks on them, but doesn&#x27;t cause a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>This one seems better constructed than No. 3, so I hope to get a decade of use out of it.</li>
            <li>with no cord....full charge lasts more than a week....</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelcos for decades, and love the shaves they give.  </li>
            <li>The shavings heads do not turn as fast as one may think, but they do a great job at the speed they turn at.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would spend more and get a better product.</li>
            <li>That more than meets my needs.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It is a simple and excellent product.</li>
            <li>(more than 5 shaves without a recharge)</li>
            <li>This is my third Norelco shaver, and I think it is an excellent buy.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>What more could anyone ask for?</li>
            <li>you probably will not be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I can say without a doubt this is the most aggravating one I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Mostly Norelco.</li>
            <li>This model doesn&#x27;t tear longer hairs out, making it much more humane.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li>Unless u can find a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unless u can find a better deal.     </li>
            <li>i like better.</li>
            <li>During the summer I shaved off my beard of many years and began the search for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I tried for three months and thought there had to be something better.  </li>
            <li>Now, every morning, I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>I feel - more control.  </li>
            <li>Even when I wrap it in something in my luggage, the top pops off, and the parts--</li>
            <li>I have used Norelcos for years and each model just seems to get better and beter.</li>
            <li>I Recently purchased this item and am really impressed with the results that I have achieved.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still reliable after a year.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews here, but after using the 7340 for a month, I love it.</li>
            <li>Much better than my 7825XL</li>
            <li>At age 62 I&#x27;ve been shaving for many years.</li>
            <li>Most of those years have been with a Norelco rechargable razor.  </li>
            <li>the difference is that this razor has better blades.</li>
            <li>shave, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.</li>
            <li>But for the price, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine that a $240 razor can be 6X better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes more time than you would take if you use a manual</li>
            <li>Was weary switching from straight razor, am SO happy I did.  </li>
            <li>the price, gentlemen, there is nothing better than this razor.</li>
            <li>I have tried several electric razors and this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not too savy on what it should and shouldn&#x27;t be able to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read that I need to use it for a couple times and the shave will get better in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>went with this one, and boy am I glad</li>
            <li>And I have another 2.6 weeks for the shave quality to get better and better.</li>
            <li>but this is okay on the days you don&#x27;t want to scrape your face.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>glad i bought this one.</li>
            <li>I tried using A/C power but still shaving was not good.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this unit needs more shaving ability.</li>
            <li>The one issue most have with</li>
            <li>and it does better on my neck hairs.</li>
            <li>I am still pleased wth the razor.</li>
            <li>I have had several Norelcos over my 30+ year shaving career, and its not stretching it to say this is the best yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Phillips Norelco is the most no fuss, convenient, quickest way to start</li>
            <li>He likes it better.  </li>
            <li>But, it really works great.</li>
            <li>Even after rubbing many times..it still leaves some hair here and there.</li>
            <li>Bought this after many years of using disposable blade razors; but was getting upset with the rising costs.</li>
            <li>My fault,I should have looked closer,but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>The shaver is very quiet and may give the impression of being underpowered but the shave is excellent.</li>
            <li>have been using it for more than 1 year before I write this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Years ago, I had owned a Norelco shaver and had been satisfied by the shave.</li>
            <li>I have been a satisfied Norelco user for many years.</li>
            <li>I use the shaver more than every-other-day but not every day and am now 19 days on one charge.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to use the shaver with the charging cord.  </li>
            <li>The technology of this 7340 is better.</li>
            <li>Like most things these days - they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.</li>
            <li>I was even able to milk a couple more bursts out of it to do most of my face</li>
            <li>And unlike the Braun, most of the shorn whiskers are caught in the well beneath the razor heads.</li>
            <li>(Most of the Braun whiskers fell all over my collar or in the sink.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 14 years, mostly with semi-disposal razors (your mach 3 types).  </li>
            <li>Satisfied...</li>
            <li>but could be way better.</li>
            <li>this is better than the rest Ive had.</li>
            <li>But I had admit that Philips shaver do not get any more progress in shaving  technics.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a gift for guy,I suggest that this shaving may be the better</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>cheap and productive!</li>
            <li>have used this model for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I was sure it would be phillips.</li>
            <li>and I love em.</li>
            <li>instructions say that, for best battery life, you should use it cordless as much as possible, and run the batteries almost all the way out before recharging.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have a razor I can use corded all the time, but this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>I know there are much better electric razors on the market, but you&#x27;ll have to pay a lot for one of those.  </li>
            <li>This razor gets the job done for the most part.  </li>
            <li>In sum, if you&#x27;re looking for an affordable razor that will perform good enough, then this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>This razor worked okay, until I dropped it from about 3 feet.  </li>
            <li>But, I have more than one rechargeable razor.  </li>
            <li>He is loving the new razor and I am loving a not-empty wallet!</li>
            <li>Full functional and easy to use with good quality.</li>
            <li>It cuts close, is easy to use, easy to clean, and has a good battery life.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this shaver, great shaver and it won&#x27;t bust your wallet.</li>
            <li>I like it really good, i like it very much.</li>
            <li>, It gave a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li>This razor works well but does not provide quite as good a shave as my first.  </li>
            <li>I gave the shavers as gifts for 4 friends and all my friends gave me a pretty good feedback after they used it.</li>
            <li>To buy a new shaver was a great choice for us.  </li>
            <li>It shaves best on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I really liked it, and it gave a great shave for a low cost.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is very easy to clean -</li>
            <li>[...] bucks but very good and durable.&lt;br /&gt;I think recent norelco shavers seems to develop contrary.&lt;br /&gt;Old</li>
            <li>Considering that fact, this shaver seemed much more smooth after just one swipe.</li>
            <li>I always use a blade when it is important, a electric razor is ok for work etc.</li>
            <li>every purchase I have made, this one is no diffirent to the outstanding service, prices and &#x27;free shipping&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>but I was finally able to get a smooth shave all over.</li>
            <li>Great decision so far.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my son &amp; so far is working great.  </li>
            <li>I was contemplating replacing the razor heads but they were costing around $35 for the three heads - its like GPS map updates cost as much as newer models (with some good online deals, of course)</li>
            <li>And I have another 2.6 weeks for the shave quality to get better and better.o the throat, which isn&#x27;t completely perfect, but at least in my own experience I would never complain about the quality of this shave.  </li>
            <li>Good close shave, not irritating.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco 7340 is very nice and easy to use, easy to clean, shaving very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; easy to clean too!  </li>
            <li>My only advice would be to take good care of it!</li>
            <li>You only need 35 dollars, a good deal!</li>
            <li>They also came with more significant charging stations and accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Philips razor than in Chinese prices cheap 50$  quality is very good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good product, ok for soft use.</li>
            <li>The three heads in the shaver can be washed and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to charge and use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is easy, just use tap water.</li>
            <li>I notice a stubble, but considering how easy it is to use (and washable)</li>
            <li>The fact it is waterproof in the sense I CAN RISE IT UNDER TAP EASY CLEANING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On/off button easy to press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is amazing that I can use it a whole month (15 times or more per month) and it is like new.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You have to make sure that the heads are clean</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to clean with warm water by just opening the head.  </li>
            <li>protector - junk which comes off easy and breaks easily, leading to...&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can be rinsed out for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Anyway, this model is an exceptional value - highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and wash.</li>
            <li>Performs well and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>And this one is good, made in China (of course) and does a decent job for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Have had this shaver for 2 1/2 years now and still working strong.  </li>
            <li>Nice razor at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I prefer my Norelco Cool Skin shaver much more.</li>
            <li>To get the best battery life you do need to let the batteries run down.  </li>
            <li>and it still works as good as new.  </li>
            <li>Even so, the remingtons were never this good new out of the box.  </li>
            <li>(To comment on a previous review, I find it best to run the battery out before charging rather than leaving it</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>It still working perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I end up cleaning it every 4 or 5 months and its still works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Norelco user for many years.  </li>
            <li>The two downsides, compared to my previous one, is that there isn&#x27;t a good way to see if it needs charging, and it doesn&#x27;t come with a good travel case.</li>
            <li>I will admit the shave is not as smooth as some reviewer seem to want, but for me it is fine.</li>
            <li>The shaver gives fine, smooth shaves, which is all I could ask for.</li>
            <li>so this little device works perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The upgraded heads on the 7340 made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This Philips/Norelco rotary cuts well with a lighter touch (still not blade smooth), and with an after shave gel followup</li>
            <li>An adequately smooth shave, in about 2/3 the time, with a lot fewer ingrowns.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the exterior metal is as smooth as it once was.  </li>
            <li>One feature I like is the charge indicator light which blinks when the razor is charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>I just want a razor that worked, this seems to fit the bill</li>
            <li>Smooth shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate if you find this model for cheap.</li>
            <li>Makes it SO EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need a light to tell me I have the unit turned on.  </li>
            <li>But this Norelco is actually doing a great job...</li>
            <li>Even more fun</li>
            <li>One that I bought on the cheap side something like 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high-quality, cheap, durable razor-</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a carry case is also not an issue for me; however, the cap could fit a bit tighter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The protective plastic head is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, will not buy Phillips again.</li>
            <li>My face was RELATIVELY smooth and have had over 2 months now without discomfort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the 7430 is light....extremely light.  </li>
            <li>Once discussed, things went smoothly.</li>
            <li>The one downside is the lack of a light that signals the need to re-charge the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I ordered another shaver for my brother.  </li>
            <li>Razor is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Have tried a few and this is one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li>No cuts, no rash, and my skin is smooth after every use.</li>
            <li>Electrics keep me smooth until mid-afternoon, blade shavers all day.</li>
            <li>Great mistake when I decided to quit using Remington and gave a try to Philips Norelco following all the hype surrounding this brand.</li>
            <li>Shave is close and smooth.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I own 2 of these in case #1 breaks.  </li>
            <li>It feels very durable and was worth the money to get a good shaver.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>The shave is still good,  So far each charge lasts about a month.  </li>
            <li>This one has lasted so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far its good.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t know since this is my first, but decided a closer but still safe and easy shave is best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Norelco gives a clean shave and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>my first time to use electric shaver and its of course, more comfortable than Manual.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good but does not seem strong enough.</li>
            <li>After many years in retail I am fully aware of the importance of eye appeal and discouraging shop lifters.  </li>
            <li>one of the best shaver i have ever owned in the past 45 years.</li>
            <li>i feel i have to do extra looking around my face to make sure i&#x27;ve got all the hair , but i think it&#x27;s more its more my face adjusting.......</li>
            <li>Still using the original blades</li>
            <li>being said, I began the search for a replacement razor - going over many reviews on many sites of many different models.  </li>
            <li>This shaver has the better HQ-8 heads as compared to the 7310.&lt;br /&gt;The heads cost almost as much as I paid for the entire shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works great but don&#x27;t leave home without the cord/charger&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li>bought it long time ago as gift for my father, he is happy for what he got it, no issue at all for about 2 years.</li>
            <li>, you need the original cord since it includes an adapter.</li>
            <li>I originally bought my Norelco 7340 shaver at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>The manual said the full charge takes about 8 hours and the light will go off after fully charged.</li>
            <li>It gives him a close shave, plus it comes with a pop up trimmer to help with having a clean edge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone says to run water over the blades to clean them.  </li>
            <li>you clean it under a running faucet........</li>
            <li>Instead of having a head which can be cleanly removed at the push of a button this shaver head is on a hinge.  </li>
            <li>this one is much lighter, quieter, more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Rinsing under faucet to clean is a Godsend.</li>
            <li>I am African_American and this did not manage to give me a clean shave.</li>
            <li>, charging unit are waterproof sealed so to clean it basically pop the head</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you just rinse out the product after each use to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>No hassles just shave and rinses clean everytime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver also allows the use of water to rinse the heads clean.  </li>
            <li>The documents that came suggested to clean it every 3 months, but I keep forgetting.</li>
            <li>It can shave mostly clean.</li>
            <li>Shaving is quick, close &amp; comfortable - even with my heavier-than-average whiskers, AND WITH 5 DAYS GROWTH, the shave I get is, again, quick, close &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li>First I  really liked it, until I used for the first time.</li>
            <li>But make no mistake that a good blade shaver (Gillette Fusion for example) will be much closer and doesn&#x27;t even draw much blood.</li>
            <li>The retractable trimmer is very handy for trimming sideburns or really long hairs.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I then did some research on a good reviewed shaver at a decent price and then went out and bought this Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Both sound much more quite then my older Norelcos I had.  </li>
            <li>And cleaning is very easy to just open the top and run it under tap water.  </li>
            <li>It worked much better during the first month, but after your skin got used to the razor, the performance was not as good, meaning you had to make more effort such as shaving longer, using different angles, and using more force.  </li>
            <li>If I wanted to spend more time trying to get a really close shave with the Norelco I could, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a really good close shave although I&#x27;m Asian</li>
            <li>Overall a good product save the side trimmer.</li>
            <li>and the batteries hold a full charge from week to week.  </li>
            <li>to now, the battery duration is good enough.</li>
            <li>to add that the people giving this razor good reviews have either never shaved with a high-quality electric razor or they have a different beard type than I do.</li>
            <li>I am able to get a very close shave in a minimum of time.</li>
            <li>Love it shaves very well.</li>
            <li>It was not giving good shave since starting</li>
            <li>&#x27;s now Dec. 2010 - 2 years later - and it shaves every bit as good as when I bought it.</li>
            <li>AT ALL, Big +  superior blades/</li>
            <li>full battery Indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>-The colour and looks appealed     -Had a full battery Indicator.     </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generate much in the way of whiskers, so the deeper \\&quot;reservoir\\&quot; holds many days</li>
            <li>After over thirty years of wearing a full beard, I decided it was time for a change.  </li>
            <li>then I thought I&#x27;d go the full clean-shaved route.  </li>
            <li>It did not take more than 3 minutes to finish the job but was very noisy</li>
            <li>It does provide a good shave, but it gives no warning when it is low on battery power.</li>
            <li>If you just need a good close shave at a low price without any fancy bells and whistles, this is for you.</li>
            <li>Only had it for 3 weeks now, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it at a really good price.</li>
            <li>Overall I am delighted with the quality and value of the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not a advertisement,it is true</li>
            <li>Definitely a good shaver for the price range and time will tell if it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li>Only good things to say i will update if that changes.</li>
            <li>Really wish it was put together with a bit better clipping mechanism.  </li>
            <li>so it just sits on the counter while charging, and 2) the latch is kind of sensitive</li>
            <li>It works quite well and the battery last a good while.  </li>
            <li>It was also a very reasonable price and was shipped to me very quickly.</li>
            <li>The blades give me a good clean shave and the adjustable heads make it easy to get around the chin and other areas of the face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Norelco 5601X for almost 10 years, worked great and never needed to do much more than clean it and change the blades when they got dull.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives me a clean, close and comfortable shave at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy, rinse under hot water after each shave.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco is still working on its first charge, (over a month ago), and still shaving strong.</li>
            <li>The main head, though, just can&#x27;t seem to do a good job of totally removing already-trimmed, just-washed hair; no matter how many times I go over my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, in comparison to some of the other razors out there, this ends up being a great deal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first shave was a dream - a very close comfortable shave provided by the new HQ8 type heads, which is as good as it gets for a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new 7340 has better clean shaving and the battery can hold longer.</li>
            <li>Have used older model Norelco shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li>Charges quickly.</li>
            <li>A super gun for man.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several days now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>It does shave as close a blade but requires practice to shave quickly and</li>
            <li>The quality of the shave is better than with my older razor</li>
            <li>and then you must quickly remove it when it is charged.</li>
            <li>It fits in my hand very well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I can find similar models in stores, but none this cheap or nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure over time a charge won&#x27;t last 12 days, but anything was better than the Braun piddling out two days after it was charged.</li>
            <li>If it will give an old man a close shave  and is very easy to use (and it does and is)</li>
            <li>I find the Norelco shavers better for my beard than the highly rated Braun model.  </li>
            <li>Even though it sounds like it&#x27;s barely running, it has given a nice, close shave on my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, which is good, except that&#x27;s mostly due to the cheap plastic construction.  </li>
            <li>really recommend this razor as it reaches the whole face, it shaves fast and good.</li>
            <li>It took a couple weeks to get used to;  the cut was slightly different from the old one for some reason and this one is really light,  but now it works great.  </li>
            <li>It takes some extra attention to the jaw line, which is always a challenge with my beard, and to the throat, which isn&#x27;t completely perfect, but at least in my own experience I would never complain about the quality of this shave.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try a different kind of shaver and went with this norelco and have loved every second of it.</li>
            <li>I have been using an older Norelco shaver for the last 3 years and it was doing a great job until about Feb/Mar time frame.</li>
            <li>it worked better than the new one.</li>
            <li>The good:  a good shave; plenty of battery life (at least when brand-new); corded or cordless use; when corded, it shaves really well even if the batteries are nearly depleted; easy to clean (the heads can be rinsed under the tap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades are quite easy on your skin and do a great job of getting those hard to reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I quickly get a relatively close shave with the Norelco, and then finish by applying a post-shave ointment and using a popular multiple-blade razor.  </li>
            <li>The price was much better than the Braun, and the unit seems to be about half the weight, which I found is nice when packing it in my toiletries it for travel.</li>
            <li>The price was much better than the Braun, and the unit seems to be about half the weight, which I found is nice when packing it in my toiletries it for travel.</li>
            <li>down side is that it needs several shaves to get better results, and when it gets to perfect shave your skin is very irritated.</li>
            <li>I buy it for myself, its cheap and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>I think replacement blades are in the $30s, and recommended once a year - if I continue to get this result, it will be worth it.  </li>
            <li>all about the same and mine works really well and got surprisingly closer</li>
            <li>but this one is far better than the remington razor it replaced.  </li>
            <li>The quite sound makes it seem like they are slow, but don&#x27;t let that fool you the 7340 works great.  </li>
            <li>So not at all worth spending money</li>
            <li>I was surprised and happy when this razor left my neck</li>
            <li>I had an old Gillette razor from 1999 that shaved my face better than this does</li>
            <li>shipping cost &amp; time delivery factor did not make it worth it</li>
            <li>Shaver is Better than my old Remington R842.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips</li>
            <li>Also i do sorta feel the side burn trimmer on my old model was better than this one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth mentioning....</li>
            <li>Worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>Also i do sorta feel the side burn trimmer on my old model was better than this one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth mentioning....</li>
            <li>Worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily I was able to use the old cord I had saved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spend the extra $15 and get a nice foil shaver that will still not break the bank, but not break your face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that any kind of electric product can do as well as a regular blade.</li>
            <li>The price cost is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>No negatives whatsoever - anyone who downgrades this product must have received a (rare) \\&quot;lemon\\&quot; and could undoubtedly have obtained a brand-new replacement via Norelco warranty</li>
            <li>It shaves much better than my old Remington.</li>
            <li>because right from day 1 it has had a smooth quality shave it really</li>
            <li>It is the first time I use Norelco shavers&#x27;before that I used  pansonic and so on&#x27; Norelco shavers7340  does a great job,  so much less noise from the shaver  than that I used before.</li>
            <li>Even so, after 4 years the older razor still cuts fine.</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to clean in the dry mode and disassembles/re-assembles easily for periodic \\&quot;deep\\</li>
            <li>It uses a NiCd battery, which means that if you don&#x27;t follow the directions EXACTLY the battery will quickly be ruined.</li>
            <li>With the &#x27;95 model, I was only able to brush out what I could after each shave; it required periodic disassembly of the heads to thoroughly clean it.  </li>
            <li>This is technically a dry shaver, as the instructions tell you to \\&quot;use on dry skin for the best results.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The original blades lasted 4 years and still cut very well.</li>
            <li>What makes this razor such a good buy,in addition to it giving a clean shave is that this razor&#x27;s battery keeps its charge for a surprisingly long time; it has been more than 30 days since I first fully charged it and after more than 30 daily shaves it still has not needed to be recharged... amazing for an electric razor that is so relatively inexpensive!</li>
            <li>The trimmer feature allows me to keep my moustache the right length.</li>
            <li>I like the opening head that can be emptied right into a trash can and then washed with water.  </li>
            <li>but I plugged the charger right in and finished shaving.  </li>
            <li>They are right, it is not as substanial feeling.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>However, as long as it works and lasts, I am satisfied with a light weight model.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit even my older cases.  </li>
            <li>I must report the shaver worked great,delivered excellent shaves, I really expected this shaver would hold up for quite a long time</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it showed you a battery level or even a warning as it&#x27;s getting low when you first turn it on, but instead you just have to wait until it stops working and start charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap and gives a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>Cleanup is very easy and only requires water.  </li>
            <li>When the batteries ran down I used to bring the shaver to Norelco&#x27;s in NYC or Macy&#x27;s shaver repair.&lt;br /&gt;There are best buys for rotary shavers such as Remington&#x27;s model.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>Never before would I expect as close a shave as I&#x27;d get with a conventional razor (Good News, Bic etc).</li>
            <li>But, I kind of wanted to try a Norelco again and this one was $15 less than the Panasonic(I&#x27;m too cheap).  </li>
            <li>The problem is I can get the job done with disposable razors in less than ten minutes, with almost perfect results everytime.  </li>
            <li>I had a previous razor of the same model and it performs flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>The motor seems pretty powerful and the blades seem to conform well to the contours of the face.</li>
            <li>The only indication that it&#x27;s probably a NiCd is that the manual says \\&quot;battery performance is best if you recharge only when the batteries are (almost) completely empty.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>On the other hand battery life was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Norelco makes better shavers for a little more money.</li>
            <li>The comfortable, close shave of my new Phillips Norelco 7340 men&#x27;s razor is by far&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a new one, but figured that technology had advanced in 10 years</li>
            <li>I bought two of these in 2012 for my youngest sons, both new shavers, with light beards.  </li>
            <li>I have had this razor for over 5 months, and I have charged it 3 times, INCLUDING the first charge right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>No electric razor shaves half as good as a blade</li>
            <li>It is very quiet, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is good, the shaving it&#x27;s almost as close as with a razor, is not as noisy as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks ago I was in my university final exams, so shaving was no a priority</li>
            <li>The close, comfortable, quiet shave makes shaving a genuine pleasure again.</li>
            <li>This electric shaver does a great job, and  there  is so much less noise from the shaver in this model than in older models.</li>
            <li>All good, except I don&#x27;t think I get as close a shave as with my previous shaver.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>I could live with the auto clean refills ( about 1 every 6 weeks at $10.00 a pop) but the shave was not that clean particularly along the neck.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get nearly as good of a shave, and the construction just feels a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>The first time the battery ran out, and the shaver stopped, I plugged it in, and it ran full speed for the rest of the shave, nulike the older rechargeable types that had to be charged fully to run at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A huge improvement over the old Panasonic it replaced.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first to switch over to an electric razor seeing as I had never used one.</li>
            <li>As soon as I saw this model on sale for around $38 (after rebates), I jumped on it and just tried it today morning for the first time.</li>
            <li>i got a Philips Norelco for christmas but it doesnt look exactly like the one in the picture</li>
            <li>I am willing to give this another week.  </li>
            <li>I ever find a lady willing to test the results of my shave, perhaps the star count will go to five, or it may go to one.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe that was just the first times.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any irritation at all after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>norelco are better than recent norelco shavers.....</li>
            <li>I still keep the first one as a cord-only backup, since its battery died.  </li>
            <li>The first, manufactured in Germany, lasted 19 years.</li>
            <li>Hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver on a regular basis for more than 30 years.</li>
            <li>However, this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned that has irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not troubled by it being manufactured in China.</li>
            <li>Not much to say -- it shaves and shaves nicely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;WIll definitely publish some more data once I use the shaver for a month or so..</li>
            <li>The last Norelco shaver I had, the back trimmer was much more durable and did a much better job.</li>
            <li>This is likely the case with most razors though.  </li>
            <li>i really love the fact that when it needs cleaning i can simply wash it.</li>
            <li>although i got it at a very reduced price,it still wasnt worth it.  </li>
            <li>And it only takes 1 or 2 passes at my face to be able to do that.  </li>
            <li>first battery charge has lasted for weeks now without the need for another charge.  </li>
            <li>Not the first razor I have tried and was hoping this would work when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>It consistently leaves my face with untrimmed whiskers.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li>But I only somewhat feel that way most part</li>
            <li>When my decade-old Norelco triple header&#x27;s battery began to indicate it was no longer able to provide the necessary power, I began looking for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li>Second, the top part of the shaver falls apart EVERY TIME I travel with it.</li>
            <li>The first lasted many years and finally died.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the power or rpm that my first one had.  </li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m completely pleased with my purchase, and I can use the carrying case (such as it is) that came with my 7825XL.</li>
            <li>First, I went to a Remington beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The first 8/9 hour charge has lasted 10 days plus.</li>
            <li>This was my first electrical razor and I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Go with this one first</li>
            <li>It is incredible to me that Norelco would intentionally make the shaving experience worse, presumably to increase profits.  </li>
            <li>The first charge has lasted over a month.</li>
            <li>The wall plug is ok, not as big as others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>so one can assure a consistent shave each time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the first Norelco that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Each lasting more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the first Norelco I&#x27;ve owned without the comfort control setting.  </li>
            <li>The higher priced models use the HQ9s.  </li>
            <li>The first charge lasted two weeks.</li>
            <li>The reason:  the higher cost of replacing the battery.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well, and I don&#x27;t notice a decrease in performance.</li>
            <li>First, it is the quietest shaver I have found.</li>
            <li>I could never get all my neck hairs and most times I left the bath area bleeding.  </li>
            <li>ONLY drawback is more of an O.C.D. thing -</li>
            <li>I have use Philips shaver more than 20 years from I was a middle school boy.</li>
            <li>It is his first time to use a electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and it stays charged for almost a week between recharges!</li>
            <li>It is extremely comfortable on the face and offers a close shave that rivals a blade.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to remove all my facial hair with it.</li>
            <li>I had to go over the same area dozens of times to remove most, but not all of the hair, and never, ever, could remove all hair from the neck.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>I have used my 7340 in the sands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan and it has not failed me.</li>
            <li>The entire top assembly came apart.  </li>
            <li>the first try.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use, quiet, lightweight and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I had another Norelco razor which I was satisfied with, but it was 10 years old, time for a new one.</li>
            <li>Nice Shaver, it&#x27;s my first one ever xD, so I&#x27;m not the one to compare between shavers, but I find the results enough satisfying for a shave, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get every hair cut, but overall does a great work, leaves my face pretty soft and with no irritation at all, plus</li>
            <li>As for my opinion and experience, this model is pretty simple and works good only on very light 1-day facial hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be a less advanced shaver than the 7340, and yet it provides me with a better shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the product, but do not think it is worth the extra cost, the basic model would probably do just fine.</li>
            <li>But I have tried many electric razors with limited success.</li>
            <li>around Christmas 2009 I bought this battery operated rotary shaver, pretty much out of boredum, it was just $9.95, I fig what the heck, I never owned a rotary shaver before, it very cheap and generic, to my amazement</li>
            <li>Would be great except blades replacements cost almost as much as shaver and don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li>And at my age and beard condition, I seemed to be getting more of them with the foil shavers - I think mostly because I had to push hard and repeat with the foil to get a sufficiently close shave.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the close, clean shave, including the neck area.  </li>
            <li>I tend never to buy the cheapest model or the most expensive model, something in-between seems to work good for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the latest one that I bought a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve been the least satisfied with it so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone interested in an affordable, easy &amp; quiet shave should buy this Norelco 7340.  </li>
            <li>It was his first real razor, so we have nothing to compare it to, but nonetheless, he would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am a college student and there are times where I do not have time to stand in front of the mirror waiting until my whole face is shaved, instead I can move around and know it is doing exactly what I expect it to do.</li>
            <li>However, one has to consider that the first razor did cost twice as much as this one.</li>
            <li>My last electric was a Braun, which was okay, but I expected so much more for the money.</li>
            <li>so this is my first day really using</li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s always gunk stuck in the chamber, putting it under hot running water is fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much quieter than the Braun it replaced, and no silly cleaning solution to buy.</li>
            <li>a blog above the older Norelco were better made than today&#x27;s models.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold while shaving a relatively quiet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Quiet like it should be and cleans out easily too.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have the nice charging stand like the previous one</li>
            <li>Battery does not seem to give enough power, doesn&#x27;t feel strong, though it Feels like it gives a close shave</li>
            <li>After my initial charge (8 hours or so) the battery lasted about 12 days worth of shaves - not bad at all.</li>
            <li>but the making material seems a little cheap and may easy to break.</li>
            <li>(Seems to have very good battery life done at least 9 shaves since first charge of 8 hours and still running, have not charged it a second time yet.</li>
            <li>I guess getting what you pay for certainly applies to this razor.</li>
            <li>And I would certainly use in the event of a (God forbid) date, or going to church.</li>
            <li>This one just stops when the voltage falls below certain level.  </li>
            <li>After using a Remington Shaver for the last 5 years and many replacement heads I decided to try a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>it is fast and easy to carry any where took about 2 weeks to adjust ,i will never go back to blades ,thank you norelco.</li>
            <li>Having more moving parts, it seems more likely to break down.</li>
            <li>Sure it may take a few passes to get the longer hairs but in the end it is a quick close shave</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t remember exactly, but I&#x27;ve used  this Norelco shaver at least two years, and it just keeps giving me a nice, easy, fast, comfortable shave every other morning.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty amazing, actually, that such a quiet, light thing could shave so well.</li>
            <li>The features are fine; I had a Remington a couple years back that had a battery charge indicator and -- surprise!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rest of unit is up to Norelco&#x27;s fine standard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears that the Norelco engineers&#x27; attempts to improve a very good shaver have failed.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable for its features that I like including a cleaner close shave, running quiet, and ability to clean it under running hot water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, it takes a long time to shave with the razor, it seems like you have to go over the same spot many times to get a clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now going to do what I should have done originally and just put new heads on my trusty old 6618.</li>
            <li>just completed a test, shaving half my face with the Norelco, half with my old Braun (not in the best shape), and after judging my beard the next morning, the Norelco easily won.</li>
            <li>IT is quiet, light weight and cuts very close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and it works for me.</li>
            <li>So I said, lets try a much cheaper shaver.  </li>
            <li>and now i dont thanks the philips norelco</li>
            <li>My beard appears to be too much for this razor.</li>
            <li>Also, Norelco really needs to put a low-battery indicator on this model.</li>
            <li>The electric raiser is working very well.  </li>
            <li>My face was really soar with the 6940, but not with the 7340.  </li>
            <li>I was very suprised by this shaver.  </li>
            <li>But, it really worked.</li>
            <li>So overall it gives a close shave, holds a charge for several shaves, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving system us a very lightweight reliable shaver.  </li>
            <li>In the light of experience, in future, i would not purchase a shaver without a remaining-power timer feature.</li>
            <li>that said, I may very well keep this shaver.  </li>
            <li>need to have much longer  to see if reliable.</li>
            <li>very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Norelco, which although is made in China, seems very well made.</li>
            <li>It is remarkably quiet and comfortable, a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>After three weeks of getting my beard accustomed to the shaver I can say it seems to shave reasonably close and gets all the hairs - something my Braun had a problem</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much&lt;br /&gt;-Although</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I can&#x27;t really call it a con</li>
            <li>I would reccommend others buying but not at 94.99 Walmart carries it for 79.99 and deals out of the USA are much cheaper</li>
            <li>I wanted a 100mark quality razor for much less&#x3D;69.99 rather than a 69.99 dollar razor for 10[..]</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really call it a con</li>
            <li>I would reccommend others buying but not at 94.99 Walmart carries it for 79.99 and deals out of the USA are much cheaper still.     </li>
            <li>I wanted a 100mark quality razor for much less&#x3D;69.99 rather than a 69.99 dollar razor for 10[..] off.    </li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t provide a close shave (it&#x27;s electric after all), it was very convenient and got the job done.</li>
            <li>Works real well.</li>
            <li>and I get done much faster than with my Braun.</li>
            <li>, he is very practical every day</li>
            <li>The shave is really close</li>
            <li>Much faster than shaving.</li>
            <li>did I know that you have to be a technician to replace the battery - a bummer and very foolish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend for the value and price point!</li>
            <li>resulting shave is very close and without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I doubt that you could really tell the difference with this shaver</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really a non-issue for me, but maybe it matters to some.</li>
            <li>This model gives me a close shave, and without much irritation.  </li>
            <li>I can shave my whole face in about 2 minutes, and it cuts very close.</li>
            <li>much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose that&#x27;s true--if I shave twice with a Quattro, once with the grain and once against, and don&#x27;t mind that I&#x27;ll cut gouges in my face and irritate my skin so much</li>
            <li>Product works very well.</li>
            <li>It cuts very well and is a much faster shave then</li>
            <li>A very close shave.</li>
            <li>The Norelco shaver is very reliable and gives a close shave everytime.</li>
            <li>Thanks Norelco.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>very confertable.&lt;br /&gt;i use it almost every day and save much time.</li>
            <li>but I can state that the 7340 system sold here is a much changed version of what I have used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he is ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>very clear.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very quiet.and</li>
            <li>Its beard and mustache trimmer works very well too.</li>
            <li>He says it works very well.</li>
            <li>If they had been clearer up front that the cord was not included and would cost as much as it does, I would not have ordered as I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really upset over the whole situation.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately it started acting squirelly, so a couple weeks ago I ordered this Norelco off Amazon.</li>
            <li>The shave itself is much smoother with no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow issues.</li>
            <li>It was priced at nearly $70 by the manufacturer, but on sale for about $30 at the time, and worth every penny of that</li>
            <li>Seems to take a while to cut...does NOT beat a straight razor by any means.</li>
            <li>However, with the Norelco all of my hairs were shaved and it leaves a very close shave to boot.  </li>
            <li>This one also works very well.  </li>
            <li>I run my hand across my cheeks and can feel some micro hair sticking up, not always as smooth, but my hair grows in all different directions.</li>
            <li>Well, I owned a Phillips shaver before, much cheaper model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll always find some hairs remaining, especially near the adam&#x27;s apple or the nostrils.</li>
            <li>Mustache trimmer makes a straight edge trim line.  </li>
            <li>I am old enough to have owned many electric shavers over the years</li>
            <li>If you constantly plug it in to keep it \\&quot;topped off\\&quot;, you will be replacing batteries on a more frequent cycle.  </li>
            <li>If you constantly plug it in to keep it \\&quot;topped off\\&quot;, you will be replacing batteries on a more frequent cycle.  </li>
            <li>I swore I&#x27;d never buy a Philips again, but here I am, using one at least once a week, after finding one over Christmas at a good price.</li>
            <li>since if it stops dead you can finish up with the cord, but I still would have liked a \\&quot;Time to Recharge\\&quot; indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it cleans up fairly well with water after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>pretty much exactly what i was looking for, no frills and works well, battery easily holds a charge long enough for a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because the first one ceased working in three weeks, but Amazon quickly supplied a replacement at no extra cost.</li>
            <li>Long battery life, cheap($35), and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>This razor was reasonably priced, holds charge a long time, cuts better, and is much quieter than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>From my research the biggest complaint about the HQ9 head is that it seems to take more time to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>choice Norelco because of all the reviews on amazon, Norelco overwhelimingly received much better reviews of other brands.</li>
            <li>and you can shave with it while you are doing many other morning duties.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand shaving more than every other day, then yes, I could get closer with a blade.  </li>
            <li>Better than any other battery or electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Probably due to more shave time needed to remove stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t want to waste too much words on the advantage of this shaver, comfortable, quick and clean shaving, light in weight, low noise, but i&#x27;d like to highlight that the power can last for longer time after one charge than my expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor leaves my face clean, without any facial hair at all.</li>
            <li>So, finally you end up using the manual razor to clean those places.</li>
            <li>I have a clean non soar, nor red face!</li>
            <li>This Philips Norelco 7340 do not shave clean enough</li>
            <li>I would have liked one-hour rather than eight-hour recharge, but that is only a minor drawback.  </li>
            <li>Edit from 5/24/09:&lt;br /&gt;While my initial experience with this razor was very positive, after the first week I started to notice that the quality of the shave it gave was deteriorating rapidly.  </li>
            <li>Because it was only $38, I give this a full 5 stars for the performance/value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor has a charge indicator but its only purpose is to indicate when the shaver is being charged and that it has reached full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be careful when buying this product if your face has many irregularities, or if one of your hairs grow in a manner contrary or very attached to face this razor may do little for you unless you plan to use a shaving razor blade double standard thing Norelco does not recommend, in addition to submitting the face of an adaptation process that may never work for the cost involved does not seem so great option</li>
            <li>It caused too much irritation on my skin and takes too long to do a clean shave.</li>
            <li>This is NOT disclosed in the product description; I had to hunt down more details on the product.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new razor!  </li>
            <li>We bought a new Norelco shaver because the replacement blades for the \\&quot;very</li>
            <li>/&gt;Specifically it shaves very well, close as I would expect new &#x27;blades&#x27; to do...with any Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I chose this model because a slightly more expensive model seemed like it had the best reviews, and this razor is virtually identical for $30 less with only a couple differences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used more expensive razors and they have not done better.  </li>
            <li>Tried to give myself a decently close shave with this thing to my folly.  </li>
            <li>The newer models now come with nickel metal-hydride batterys instead of the older Ni-cads.  </li>
            <li>-- does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t beat a blade, but is much better than a much more expensive Remington that I was using.  </li>
            <li>I have replaced an older Norelco with this one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the expensive models from Panasonic, Braun and Norelco and didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money so this time around I went cheap</li>
            <li>I think it is decently built</li>
            <li>The heads are held in place better than one of the more expensive models, giving -</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how light and quiet this Norelco 7340 men&#x27;s shaver is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor is adequately constructed (for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get a piece of solid iron).  </li>
            <li>That goes double when you realize I would not be able to shave this close with a razor on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That goes double when you realize I would not be able to shave this close with a razor on a daily basis.    </li>
            <li>The rotaries in the older models were made of metal.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many electric razors and many, if not all, failed to beat this razor.  </li>
            <li>This particular razor has the HQ8 heads.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Norelco 7340 for my husband to replace a much older one that he used when he traveled.  </li>
            <li>particularly for the neck.......</li>
            <li>A simple puff cleans out the well, though on weekends when I have a bit more time, I can rinse out the residue that&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li>A simple puff cleans out the well, though on weekends when I have a bit more time, I can rinse out the residue that&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li>Charges quick, and last for a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this particular shaver over the cheaper Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the 7340.</li>
            <li>I had been using the same razor my entire life that finally died after nearly 15 years of good use.  </li>
            <li>on the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll take it back and go for the model without the &#x27;double blades&#x27; and see if the battery situation is better.  </li>
            <li>Before this one I had more expensive, more stylish one, but it wasn&#x27;t shaving properly, didn&#x27;t cut a lil bit long hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I had a little travel shaver that did a better job... and the blade the catches the hairs for a closer shave</li>
            <li>Some may find it a little light(made more out of plastic than metal)</li>
            <li>+ years, I decided to spend a little more and get the 7340.  </li>
            <li>I should have just put new blades in my older one.</li>
            <li>So far it shaves very well and it quietest of any Noreclo I have had.  </li>
            <li>7340 is much lighter and quieter than my old 7825XL.</li>
            <li>My shave doesn&#x27;t seem much closer than my old electric razor</li>
            <li>Shaves very close, and so far is holding its charge for about 6 days of shaving.</li>
            <li>the finish is quite smooth, not as close a shave as a razor, ie: wouldn&#x27;t pass an 9 hour military day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, after replacing the head, the shaver generally works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I wish the side burn trimmer u pushed up out instead of releasing , cuz normally u go with the grain of the hair</li>
            <li>, cuz normally u go with the grain of the hair</li>
            <li>well, though a couple of days later I found a lower price of 34.77 in Walmart, I still think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>Note that this service normally must be done by a service person since the batteries are soldered in.  </li>
            <li>Note that this service normally must be done by a service person since the batteries are soldered in.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money (which was also a big selling point.)</li>
            <li>and I was just missing out on a better shave.</li>
            <li>so I take more than 5 mins everyday so that I have to recharge it every 5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my third or fourth Philips Norelco triple-head model over the past decade...and by far the best of the generally satisfactory lot.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised with how much lighter the new razor is, and</li>
            <li>And removing the heads (for deeper cleaning) is also easy rather than some of the more complicated ones I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>gaining better shave, far less irritation, return of lost time.</li>
            <li>To start off i owned a braun shaver for the last 4 years and loved it until it recently broke due to my doing.</li>
            <li>the battery lasts a fairly long time but when it goes it goes quick.</li>
            <li>Pull your skin tight with your free hand and shave away, this makes your whiskers stand up straight and easier for the shaver to</li>
            <li>I agree with others that this thing is quiet, much more quiet than the old Ramington, but that&#x27;s because the old Remington was performing work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is probably my third Norelco as my last one finally gave up for good after several years of reliable service and I have been shaving with an electric for some years now.</li>
            <li>If you learn to really take your time and go slowly over the shaved area of the face you can acheive a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The head then goes crashing down onto the sink which will easily damage the cutters.  </li>
            <li>razor feels cheaply made, not exactly flimsy but there&#x27;s nothing screaming quality either.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, even after just two days&#x27; use (so during the adjustment period) with the Norelco 7340 I can get a shave that&#x27;s just as close (feels perfectly smooth and passes the \\&quot;my girlfriend</li>
            <li>It may be because of the new blades too</li>
            <li>Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco 7340 Shaver from Amazon has been a new revelation in shaving for me.  </li>
            <li>Now this new shaver is so convenient...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given lots of time for my skin to adjust to the new one, but I need to replace this one.  </li>
            <li>and I live an hour away from the US border</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to praise new products however this time I must make an exception.  </li>
            <li>Now I have new freedom to walk around the house shaving.  </li>
            <li>I hope this new&#x27;un lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Never even changed cutters, never needed new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They told me that all norelco&#x27;s have always run at 2000 RPMS, and that the motor has been updated with the new \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; to reduce the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use tape and glue to repair the plastic protective device rather than buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>This just may be the &#x27;new&#x27; technology of batteries</li>
            <li>I can live with this.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed that every time I purchase a new razor from Philips they have reduced the quality and value of their products.</li>
            <li>and it is still sharper than the new Norelco.</li>
            <li>So I made up my mind to buy a new one</li>
            <li>shaver is very easy to maintain, and really hardly needs any maintenance except emptying.</li>
            <li>I just got tired of shaving the old fashioned way with the shaving cream the shaver, the nicks and cuts when using a new razor, the time it took to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I can make a direct comparison because my older Norelco just feels smoother.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is quiet, charges quickly and the charge lasts at least a week of shaving as I charge every Sunday after carrying it many times for a week on the road.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to my present from my wife via Amazon, shaving now is a real pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope there is a yellow light which can remind you about the low power</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said:  I would have liked an indicator when the battery is down far enough that recharging is indicated, like my old Norelco had.  </li>
            <li>I have recently bought a new razor that is more expensive and, hopefully will do a better job.</li>
            <li>Cheap and not worth the anguish.</li>
            <li>I also recommend spending the couple of extra dollars over the other 7310XL and get the better heads.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I only use it every other day, but that is much better than the piece of junk this razor replaced.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the purchase (especially the price) and would likely buy again.</li>
            <li>I had been using the same corded Norelco shaver since 1995 with the original blades and decided it was time for a change to the 21st century.  </li>
            <li>When I tried this one, the first thing I noticed was how quiet it was.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I wasn&#x27;t using it properly</li>
            <li>This is such a problem that I am bringing back the old 5601X into service and will replace the blades and use it as my primary shaver again.  </li>
            <li>First, it simply doesn&#x27;t provide a quality shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my second electric razor, the first being a Panasonic that did not work well.  </li>
            <li>The size is also pretty big and weight is not light.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I charged it two Saturday nights ago, and used it for the first time before church the next morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with Norelco&#x27;s for the past 30 years and have had entry level models all the way up to top of the line models.</li>
            <li>I already owned an Norelco shaver but it was old and needed new blades.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely cheaper to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Oh, the battery does stay full charge (or near) till the very end, and then shuts down - no indicator.  </li>
            <li>I have had multiple value shavers that were ok, but took a long time to give an only decent shave.  </li>
            <li>Based on 3 weeks of use of the 7340, even without the comfort control, not only do the HQ8 heads shave as fast as my older Norelco&#x27;s but the shave is also closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clean, fast, no pulling or missing misc hairs.</li>
            <li>i have used blades  for 50 years in my old age i have become lazy to shave every day ,so i decided to buy an electric shaver .i love my new shaver i am getting close</li>
            <li>I had a low end Philips Norelco shave for the last few years (in the $40 range) and this one at $60 (when I ordered it) seems to be far superior.</li>
            <li>course the new one, so far, is improved and cost $40.</li>
            <li>The new 7340 did not perform as well as my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>: Not a super smooth shave, razor burn, feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I find the light goes off less than 8 hours.</li>
            <li>It often just falls off when trying to do a quick partial cleaning during shaving.</li>
            <li>The cleaning feature is a major improvement over older models.  </li>
            <li>Probably true of other company&#x27;s shavers as well.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does give you a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I received this item in good condition with brand new retail packaging, and the plastic in the packaging was difficult to get through.</li>
            <li>(i never found noise an issue with my old model, but i will say the sound of this 1 when fully charged sounds similar to that of my old shaver when it was winding down on battery power, so it&#x27;s very misleading you think when you first use it that it&#x27;s low on juice</li>
            <li>It does, however, do a much better job than my previous shaver, giving an extremely close shave that lasts for a couple of days (complete with some razor burn), which I would expect for the higher price...</li>
            <li>The trimmer, though seemingly lighter in construction, actually does a better job than my previous unit.  </li>
            <li>i bought this norelco that was priced in the middle- $60 more or less.</li>
            <li>This is a major advantage over my older Norelco&#x27;s since I use a pre shave product that can cause the blades to need frequent cleaning.  </li>
            <li>When I tried to clean it, I dropped one of the razor heads down the sink while trying to unclip the underside of the shaver head.  </li>
            <li>The washable head is a significant improvement over my previous model.</li>
            <li>You will find the sound of this product is a little loud.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing about it that could be improved, and no, I am not a shill for Norelco, simply a satisfied user with a tough beard.</li>
            <li>but if I need to shave two times as often, clearly there&#x27;s an issue here.</li>
            <li>I can shave in less than 2 minutes and clean it in 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>(Am 84 years young and over the decades I&#x27;ve owned &amp;#</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 60s now, and over the years I&#x27;ve bounced around, as far as shaving.  </li>
            <li>When I get near 30 minutes usage, I just let it run out, and then put it on charge - for about 8 hours.</li>
            <li>I find that I have to shave with my old stick razors after using this.  </li>
            <li>So far the highlight of this shaver has been the battery life.</li>
            <li>I have the old Norelco which it was about 5-7 yrs old.</li>
            <li>my finger was nearly cut off trying to tear the clear plastic over the razor.  </li>
            <li>I replaced my 10 year old Norelco which has been indestructible.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor because Walmart quit carying the blades for my 10 year old R845.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;ve found blades for the old razor on amazon</li>
            <li>The quality of shaves has so far (four months) been first-rate.</li>
            <li>It can be washable directly under the tap!&lt;br /&gt;Up</li>
            <li>and I use the old one for overnight stays.</li>
            <li>this is by far the poorest example.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well this shaver works.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this razor holds a charge.  </li>
            <li>They are now completely mixed up and the blade components are now mismatched which is going to make them wear out much sooner.  </li>
            <li>This unit shaves fast, close and quietly.  </li>
            <li>if you have a soft skin like i do this is not for you.</li>
            <li>I do like the pivoting heads, as opposed to the fixed heads on the &#x27;95 model.  </li>
            <li>saved the case from my old shaver (which I still have as a backup) and will use that when traveling.  </li>
            <li>its alright for 3 day old stubble.  </li>
            <li>Mostly though the one complaint I have about it was it needed an 8 hour charge before use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-LIGHTWEIGHT (lighter than my old model, not that weight was ever an issue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cuz u can&#x27;t my old cord was just a spaghetti type cord with a 2 prong plug this has the 2 prong plug</li>
            <li>69.99 seemed reasonable for a product in CANADA regularly priced around the 100 dollar mark.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i am in my early 20&#x27;s and have had a electric shaver since 99/2000 and since then have not bothered with manual razors since i got my Remington R842</li>
            <li>Cuz u can&#x27;t my old cord was just a spaghetti type cord with a 2 prong plug this has the 2 prong plug</li>
            <li>69.99 seemed reasonable for a product in CANADA regularly priced around the 100 dollar mark.</li>
            <li>i am in my early 20&#x27;s and have had a electric shaver since 99/2000 and since then have not bothered with manual razors since i got my Remington R842</li>
            <li>I am very conservative, and just wanted as close to the same thing which served me so well for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spend so much time going over the same area that I might as well just use a blade.</li>
            <li>but, the material to making it has, today it&#x27;s all plastic compared to the old ones where metal was predominate.</li>
            <li>It replaced my &gt;10 year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>My old shaver had me tethered to an electrical outlet since the batteries were so worn out.  </li>
            <li>and I think it will take a few months to really be comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li>My face had already got &#x27;used&#x27; to a rotary, I managed to acquire an ancient (12 yrs old?)</li>
            <li>I started realizing my old razor wasn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d still have an old battery.</li>
            <li>Compared to my old method of shaving (disposable razors)</li>
            <li>It just stops completely.  </li>
            <li>I have this shaver for use in my second home, very close shave that does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have went with the lithium-ion batteries,but these are preforming well so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exactly like my old norelco</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and almost never pinches.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at the cheapness of this company</li>
            <li>Next, it shaves close, REALLY close, virtually indistinguishably from a razor.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin has had no problems with rashes or burning in the month</li>
            <li>Once fully charged it offers about two weeks of shaving time without a re-charge.  </li>
            <li>Does not feel as substantial as my old one, so</li>
            <li>I just try to stretch the skin out and keep going over the area, and after a few minutes, my face should be as smooth as it&#x27;ll get with an electric</li>
            <li>i was surprised</li>
            <li>This razor works just as good as the expensive ones</li>
            <li>great buy - I hope the battery lasts as long as the previous model did - one charge for about 2-3 weeks of everyday shaving.</li>
            <li>This shaver is so quiet I can not do other things like watch TV, or hear the sound on my computer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to hold for my somewhat small hands.  </li>
            <li>I use it dry and it has traveled a lot and gotten banged around - really could not improve on this shaver!</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a very old Norelco Reflex Plus 6618, thinking that rather than just buy new heads for the old one, it was time to replace the entire shaver.</li>
            <li>The customer service rep told me to buy a new razor rather than send it back for a new battery to be installed.  </li>
            <li>The back cuts pretty well, though it can leave the skin a bit more sore than other heavy groomers.</li>
            <li>Battery life was also a problem, I only received about half as many shaves as advertised before shaver simply stopped.</li>
            <li>and this is coming from a guy who usually uses the pro glide razors, but the only reason i made the switch was from cartridge to electric was it was more cost efficient</li>
            <li>Also, you will have to cover the same territory 2 or 3 times to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a similar older model when its battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li>The only feature I wish it had would be pure-corded operation; I would rather this model were twenty dollars cheaper and had no battery, but for this head assembly that&#x27;s not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding shave quality, the usual comment on most electrics is \\&quot;well, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is it did freeze in the car in the winter whereas the older model I have did not.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older and similar Norelco that I had for 10 years.</li>
            <li>For the fun of it, I have used it every morning since without recharging to see how long a charge will last.</li>
            <li>This is a simple model without any bells and whistles, but in my opinion it provides a decent shave for the price.</li>
            <li>highly recommend using Lectric Shave prior to shaving and an aftershave product when you are done.  </li>
            <li>This razor seems very underpowered even when fully charged, and although I do not have a heavy beard, it takes a long time to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>As to those who complain that they can&#x27;t predict the battery dying like the old NiCad battery models, the Lithium Ion battery in the new models is a vast improvement.  </li>
            <li>It cost me about the same on sale as new blades would&#x27;ve been for the old one.  </li>
            <li>But even after using for such a long time it never gives clean shave also if you try too hard to get clean shave</li>
            <li>A razor this expensive should not crap out this quickly.  </li>
            <li>i thought it was just that cheap generic one that spun slow and that really led me to get the Norelco, but this one spins just as also, I guess they are just made that</li>
            <li>/&gt;-BLADES DON&#x27;T PULL AT LONG HAIR (not even with long hair even on the very first shave.</li>
            <li>Does not seem to shave as close as my old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Still trying to get a good shave by trying different techniques but after 3 weeks I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li>, it gave me a couple shaves less per charge, but in all other respects it was better.</li>
            <li>I find it even more convenient to simply blow on them really hard.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day because i am in the military and require it so much quicker to use then the straight flat ones i am used to it cuts hairs all directions all the time.</li>
            <li>Yes, the closeness of the shave with the new 7340 is equal to my 6618 . . .</li>
            <li>I figured this shaver only cost me about one years supply of the new type razor blades.</li>
            <li>Bought Phillips7340 New Years Eve 2008 online at Future Shop&#x27;s website for sale price of 69.99, reg 94.99.</li>
            <li>And for the price just above the cost of new replacement shaving head.</li>
            <li>same o same o, been using this product for over 30 years, the shave hasn&#x27;t improved that much</li>
            <li>Most of the time they would leave random hairs, or you would go around and around your face so much that your face thought it was a massage.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wished it had was some type of battery meter showing how much power is left in the battery so that it lets us know when it should be charged.</li>
            <li>It was so quiet I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>It works fine and about the price of new blades-what&#x27;s up with blades being so expensive in relation to the whole razor?  </li>
            <li>MAJOR+++ (blades water proof</li>
            <li>NOT THE #1 A MAJOR REASON WHY.</li>
            <li>NOT THE #1 A MAJOR REASON WHY.</li>
            <li>As long as it still gives a decent shave, and it does.</li>
            <li>a decent shaver in a long time.</li>
            <li>I had an older model that lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>, is the recharging time: instead of less than half an hour, it&#x27;s more like 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li>and I generally shave every day.</li>
            <li>no suena pero por lo general es un buen producto a un buen precio.&lt;br /&gt;Algo</li>
            <li>This Novelco is very quiet but takes more than 5 minutes to finish the job and the job is not good.</li>
            <li>The razor shaves very close and gets the short stubble as well as the long hairs.  </li>
            <li>early fifties - back to rotary.  </li>
            <li>The stubble is a gritty dust with fairly frequent use, so it disappears on the carpet</li>
            <li>It sounds like it is barely running</li>
            <li>even though the 7340 is cordless, the charging cord is longer on the 7340 and a bit too short for the fixed corded</li>
            <li>I have charged it once so far and have been using it for about 3 weeks on the same charge.  </li>
            <li>Vast improvement over my old model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(if ur batteries are low you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge up like my old shaver, you can just plug it in the wall &amp; run of electricity &amp; it will charge while also running.</li>
            <li>After going from a 10+ year old shaver to this one, it was like starting to shave all over again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I was surprised by how quiet it is.</li>
            <li>The heads barely turn...and I can feel them &#x27;cut&#x27; my beard</li>
            <li>Shaves far closer than I thought possible..</li>
            <li>And I have sensitive skin - the overall quality and \\&quot;ergonomics\\</li>
            <li>Apparently if you leave it in even after fully charge, it degrades the battery.</li>
            <li>I was having problems with old shaver not geting all the wisker, I do not have that problem with this shaver never have any left when I</li>
            <li>It seems to have a little less heft and maybe a little less power than earlier Norelcos, but the shave is certainly excellent.  </li>
            <li>I owned and used a Remington (not rotary heads) and the razor screen had a small tear which cdause cuts and bleeding----the rotary heads make a lot of difference in shaving comfort and it is extremely quiet and easy to clean---I definitely would reommend it&#x27;s purchase</li>
            <li>: While the clippers in the back are still going strong, the blades on the head are soft and only seem to last 20 uses or so before starting to dull; over the next 40-50 uses it gets to the point where hardly anything is done at all, and it tends to grab instead of cut, leading to more burn and redness.</li>
            <li>There seem to have been some subtle changes in the mechanism to make it quieter and easier to clean than my old one.</li>
            <li>I bought the philips norelco 7340 confident on the brands reputation, unfortunately less than six months later it just shut down one day and never started again, after having it checked by the asistance in my country</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day and have thick and quick growing hair.</li>
            <li>since I have a very sensitive face and shave one day in between, I use to soar my face and even cut myself with a standard razor, now I only use my Norelco even on my car!</li>
            <li>My first shave was reduced to about half the time the Braun took.</li>
            <li>I also spent considerable time going back over face and neck areas that left my face very irritated.</li>
            <li>My first selection was a fairly expensive Braun model with the auto clean unit.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;The rotars seem to spin slow, not like a fast acting foil shaver, at first</li>
            <li>I decided to get a new one because a new one costs less than the blades do.</li>
            <li>This product suffers from the genius of some market manager/product designer who spent months trying to find an attractive product for this item regardless of what the package did to the customers temper or blood pressure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaving head pops open for cleaning with running water, green lights tell you when it&#x27;s charging (steady light) and when it&#x27;s completed charging (blinking green lights).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to my trusty old, solid, reliable 6618.</li>
            <li>(another big reason for buying a model like this because my old unit if the battery was low you couldn&#x27;t plug into the wall and use it</li>
            <li>razor is fairly quiet, especially in comparison to my old one.  </li>
            <li>I really never dreamed a electric shaver can give me a decent shave.</li>
            <li>The extra few dollars is well worth the upgrade to the 7340.  </li>
            <li>I had bought my father an expensive electric shaver for christmas which he liked well enough, but he dropped it and it broke.  </li>
            <li>I could&#x27;nt be happier with my purchase - it just shaves very clean around the neck and jaw areas where my previous shaver used to take multiple rounds to clear the beard and I tend to get very little hair there</li>
            <li>Excellent battery life, average cutting ability compared to the other three-headed shavers from Norelco.</li>
            <li>which is spring loaded (easy to take off or on) and dump hair in garbage then rinse under tap with hot or cold water.</li>
            <li>No more giving myself irritated red skin on my neck trying to adequately shave in that tricky area.  </li>
            <li>The third, from China, barely made it to five.</li>
            <li>My old model did that pulled at long hair and it hurt</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this philips shaver******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---So after several charges &amp; recharges, as per manufacturers instructions, I&#x27;m barely getting 3-4 shaves (15 mins max) out of this Norelco.</li>
            <li>That and it was as loud as a leaf blower and took constant ploughing back and forth across my face until it would finally trim my thickish beard.</li>
            <li>First one&#x27;s battery died after a few yrs &amp; then I was using Razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Should have expected that so not much of a complaint.</li>
            <li>But if you take a break for a few weeks, and then use the razor again, the performance will be just like the first month&#x27;s usage before your skin gets used to it again.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it is so large, since it obviously contains only a tiny motor and a single, tiny cell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t let the battery go all the way down very often</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the new one long enough to assess its length of service, which is my only concern for this product.</li>
            <li>One small surprise was plugging it in right after it \\&quot;died\\&quot; from lack of charge, it would not turn on.</li>
            <li>The local repair shop who has serviced my previous 2 Norelco&#x27;s noted that the new ones aren&#x27;t the quality of the old.  </li>
            <li>I previously used a straight edge razor to shave.  </li>
            <li>My previous shaver is much louder and is not waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Now the after shave rinse to the head assembly keeps things much cleaner without having to disassemble the heads, which was what I previously had to</li>
            <li>- it sounds as if the razors are turning too slow, but I can&#x27;t argue with the results - it does provide a quick, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Washable</li>
            <li>It sounds very weak.&lt;br /&gt;Suspect that impression is from my distant past where I recall much louder electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>The rotary blades are definitely not rotating as fast as the previous models.</li>
            <li>This razor comes with a straight charging cord instead of the far more convenient coiled cords of the past, no charging stand like in the past, and no travel case like in the past.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you buy the one that costs 225.00 it would shave a little closer, but for 225.00 you can buy a whole lot of razor blades.</li>
            <li>Nobody&#x27;s going to bother to disassemble the whole thing and stick a little brush in there.  </li>
            <li>For that reason I actually prefer the older NiCd batteries because I can run them all the way down, and don&#x27;t care about the quicker charge feature of NiMH batteries.  </li>

            <li> This one&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> great shaver I get one of closet shaves.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, it shaves great too.  </li>
            <li> Everything works great on it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been a happy Norelco user for 30 years.  </li>
            <li> great value, i have been using electrics for 30+ years.</li>
            <li> and I got it at a great price too.</li>
            <li> I was happily relieved by Norelco&#x27;s tech support who said that the motor has not been slowed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
            <li> This thing is great.</li>

            <li> All around this is a great value.</li>
            <li> Forgive me, Norelco, for I had sinned, but if it&#x27;s any consolation, the Braun never made me happy.</li>
            <li> Great razor for under $70.</li>
            <li> It does a great job</li>
            <li> and I look great too.&lt;br /&gt;Cricket</li>

            <li> which worked great for over 3 years.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> great product, i would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> ; it is very handy.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this years after buying it here - still works great, a great close shave, good battery life too.</li>
            <li> rotary shaver does an Amazing job!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great with good performance in shaving, especailly concerning about 41 bucks price.</li>
            <li> Still a nice razor, but not an upgrade!</li>
            <li> When I was shopping I was impressed that I could use the Norelco shaver for 45 days and still be able to return it.  </li>
            <li> Not the best shaver out there, but this thing has held up strong over the years.</li>
            <li> Yes, its a good shave</li>
            <li> It replaced a Remington cordless that did a good job, but the battery died on.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, the battery life is good.  </li>
            <li> But to this price, it&#x27;s fair.</li>
            <li> Once a month give it a good cleaning according to the enclosed directions and do not forget to oil the heads with a drop of mineral oil.  </li>
            <li> This razor is quieter but it takes longer to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I get a good shave every</li>
            <li> A good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased the 7340 in May, 2009, and it is good value for money and does the job.</li>
            <li> If you need a good shaver at a good price---this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> GOOD BATTERY++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard PHILLIPS/NORELCO were good.    </li>
            <li> good ~</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s good price was a plus.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is good and charge lasted about 10-12 shaves.</li>
            <li> You get a good, close shave with this without my skin getting irritated.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s not even a good shave for the pain.  </li>
            <li> This is a good shaver at a good price.</li>
            <li> nice looking and great feel on hand.</li>
            <li> off to Norelco for another good mid-range priced electric razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good lower cost Norelco.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good lower cost Norelco.  </li>
            <li> And I believe  Tissot is a good brand.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> But is a good stuff</li>
            <li> Fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Battery life seems good.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of this razor for my husband and father,they told me that the quality is good and the product is Ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He said he will tell his friends how good these shalver.</li>
            <li> The 7340XL is well-balanced and has a good feel in the hand.  </li>
            <li> Good product .</li>
            <li> Good battery life before recharging, good trimmer, and balanced in the hand.  </li>
            <li> Good shaver.</li>
            <li> I was using for 10 years, but the deal was too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li> One of the best at the original price point.  </li>
            <li> The greatest convenience and best feature is the ability to open the unit and rinse it out under the sink.  </li>
            <li> When you need a highly effective razor, but do not want to spend 50 dollars, this is very suitable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s real easy.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this model.</li>
            <li> I amm very pleased with this product and the price.</li>

            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> up is real easy</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m most happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite and effective, also good for your money.</li>
            <li> A very nice feature is being able to wash out the blade area with running water, eliminating the need to use a brush.</li>
            <li> It works great; gives a close, smooth shave; and is very easy and convenient to use!</li>
            <li> This razor is an excellent choice for regifting this season. ;)</li>
            <li> I love this razor!</li>
            <li> More freedom!  </li>
            <li> , dont worry, you will love it!</li>
            <li> &quot; are also top drawer!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m still getting better using it!</li>
            <li> Really smooth shave!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the product, but I love the customer service!</li>
            <li> pretty nice price &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Very good price, is a good shaving option, is my first of this kind</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly the best razor deal and closest shave ever!!</li>
            <li> I have found this latest Norelco to be lightweight, comfortable to hold and to the point - it gives me a very good shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves well, and cleans up nicely in running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do NOT recommend shaving while driving, this could be hazardous to your health!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think the 7340 has worked out great, and is the best overall value Norelco Shaver.  </li>
            <li> Nice Close</li>
            <li> This 7340 shaves well, holds a charge and fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li> I found this shaver to be quite nice for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, Norelco&#x27;s descriptions of their shavers no longer tell you what kind of battery is inside.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift, and he liked the shaver</li>
            <li> an excellent shaver at a reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that an electric razor gives as good a shave as a blade and it is certainly more convenient.</li>
            <li> Just pour warm water over it and no worries.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reasonably priced electric shaver for my son, he&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 7340 shaver, with its patented \\&quot;floating heads\\&quot; system, is as good as or better than any electric shaver I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco has a well-engineered and nicely manufactured product in this shaver.</li>
            <li> Honest seller.</li>
            <li> good price, nice cut (after skin got used to it after 2 weeks), holds a charge for every day use for more than 7 days.  </li>
            <li> When they worked, they liked them, But, both of the shavers stopped working (would no longer charge) in 2014.  </li>
            <li> A nice feature is that you can rinse off the hair and blades with tap water.  </li>
            <li> Having a Norelco razor for many years with excellent results, I first tried to find a replacement battery as it had reached the end of life.  </li>
            <li> great arrived as described, charged the battery full,</li>
            <li> I resently went with the full on bald look and this shaver is great for that.</li>
            <li> Norelco is an old friend, I have used them for many years, seldom wear out, always to a good job, Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic was great, and always gave me a great share.  </li>
            <li> As I write this, it is now near the end of June, 2013, and I can honestly say this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Its very good and very close a shave to the skin.</li>
            <li> Using a good electric pre-shave solution is important.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to use and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> This one is by far the best one I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had (7340).</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a replacement for my old one, since day 1 I am very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I suppose this razor would be suitable for someone who shaves all the hair of there face and has no need to trim a beard.</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to wash it out after each use as well.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good, it replenishes quickly and gives him a nice shave.</li>
            <li> - The fact it is waterproof in the sense I CAN RISE IT UNDER TAP EASY CLEANING!    </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the product and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is very light in your hand and does an excellent job, and is not heavy in you hand.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality product at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, the shaver was great and it was nice being able to rinse it off with water for a fast cleaning!</li>
            <li> a few minutes, without water, lather, splashing, and rinsing gets me off to a great start to the day.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I made the move to the Philips Norelco 7340 Mens Shaver,.... and at $49.50 I&#x27;ll be saving money on razor blades for years.</li>
            <li> Certainly not the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought, but it is good for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> All things considered I&#x27;m very pleased although I DO wish this model gave me some sort of blinking light when the battery was about to die.</li>
            <li> to see a good brand such as Philips Norelco discontinue a good product and replace with inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;You will get years and years of good service with any 7310 or the 7340.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ergonomically designed, and is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Quick charge, holds a charge for 4-5 days and provides a good shave.  </li>
            <li> and it is quick and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> He is VERY particular and He was happy with the shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to hold in your hand, easy to clean, cordless, rechargeable, and does a great job shaving my husbands face.</li>
            <li> Its real easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> However, I am more than satisfied with my purchase of the Phillips Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I will be sure to purchase more items.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and decided Norelco seemed the safest bet.  </li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t feel or sound powerful but it does the job great.</li>
            <li> mostly just yanks on them, but doesn&#x27;t cause a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> This one seems better constructed than No. 3, so I hope to get a decade of use out of it.</li>
            <li> with no cord....full charge lasts more than a week....</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelcos for decades, and love the shaves they give.  </li>
            <li> The shavings heads do not turn as fast as one may think, but they do a great job at the speed they turn at.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would spend more and get a better product.</li>
            <li> That more than meets my needs.  </li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> It is a simple and excellent product.</li>
            <li> (more than 5 shaves without a recharge)</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco shaver, and I think it is an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> What more could anyone ask for?</li>
            <li> you probably will not be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I can say without a doubt this is the most aggravating one I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Mostly Norelco.</li>
            <li> This model doesn&#x27;t tear longer hairs out, making it much more humane.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li> Unless u can find a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless u can find a better deal.     </li>
            <li> i like better.</li>
            <li> During the summer I shaved off my beard of many years and began the search for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I tried for three months and thought there had to be something better.  </li>
            <li> Now, every morning, I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> I feel - more control.  </li>
            <li> Even when I wrap it in something in my luggage, the top pops off, and the parts--</li>
            <li> I have used Norelcos for years and each model just seems to get better and beter.</li>
            <li> I Recently purchased this item and am really impressed with the results that I have achieved.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still reliable after a year.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews here, but after using the 7340 for a month, I love it.</li>
            <li> Much better than my 7825XL</li>
            <li> At age 62 I&#x27;ve been shaving for many years.</li>
            <li> Most of those years have been with a Norelco rechargable razor.  </li>
            <li> the difference is that this razor has better blades.</li>
            <li> shave, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.</li>
            <li> But for the price, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine that a $240 razor can be 6X better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes more time than you would take if you use a manual</li>
            <li> Was weary switching from straight razor, am SO happy I did.  </li>
            <li> the price, gentlemen, there is nothing better than this razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric razors and this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not too savy on what it should and shouldn&#x27;t be able to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read that I need to use it for a couple times and the shave will get better in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> went with this one, and boy am I glad</li>
            <li> And I have another 2.6 weeks for the shave quality to get better and better.</li>
            <li> but this is okay on the days you don&#x27;t want to scrape your face.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> glad i bought this one.</li>
            <li> I tried using A/C power but still shaving was not good.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this unit needs more shaving ability.</li>
            <li> The one issue most have with</li>
            <li> and it does better on my neck hairs.</li>
            <li> I am still pleased wth the razor.</li>
            <li> I have had several Norelcos over my 30+ year shaving career, and its not stretching it to say this is the best yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Phillips Norelco is the most no fuss, convenient, quickest way to start</li>
            <li> He likes it better.  </li>
            <li> But, it really works great.</li>
            <li> Even after rubbing many times..it still leaves some hair here and there.</li>
            <li> Bought this after many years of using disposable blade razors; but was getting upset with the rising costs.</li>
            <li> My fault,I should have looked closer,but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very quiet and may give the impression of being underpowered but the shave is excellent.</li>
            <li> have been using it for more than 1 year before I write this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Years ago, I had owned a Norelco shaver and had been satisfied by the shave.</li>
            <li> I have been a satisfied Norelco user for many years.</li>
            <li> I use the shaver more than every-other-day but not every day and am now 19 days on one charge.  </li>
            <li> I like being able to use the shaver with the charging cord.  </li>
            <li> The technology of this 7340 is better.</li>
            <li> Like most things these days - they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.</li>
            <li> I was even able to milk a couple more bursts out of it to do most of my face</li>
            <li> And unlike the Braun, most of the shorn whiskers are caught in the well beneath the razor heads.</li>
            <li> (Most of the Braun whiskers fell all over my collar or in the sink.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 14 years, mostly with semi-disposal razors (your mach 3 types).  </li>
            <li> Satisfied...</li>
            <li> but could be way better.</li>
            <li> this is better than the rest Ive had.</li>
            <li> But I had admit that Philips shaver do not get any more progress in shaving  technics.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a gift for guy,I suggest that this shaving may be the better</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> cheap and productive!</li>
            <li> have used this model for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I was sure it would be phillips.</li>
            <li> and I love em.</li>
            <li> instructions say that, for best battery life, you should use it cordless as much as possible, and run the batteries almost all the way out before recharging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a razor I can use corded all the time, but this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I know there are much better electric razors on the market, but you&#x27;ll have to pay a lot for one of those.  </li>
            <li> This razor gets the job done for the most part.  </li>
            <li> In sum, if you&#x27;re looking for an affordable razor that will perform good enough, then this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> This razor worked okay, until I dropped it from about 3 feet.  </li>
            <li> But, I have more than one rechargeable razor.  </li>
            <li> He is loving the new razor and I am loving a not-empty wallet!</li>
            <li> Full functional and easy to use with good quality.</li>
            <li> It cuts close, is easy to use, easy to clean, and has a good battery life.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this shaver, great shaver and it won&#x27;t bust your wallet.</li>
            <li> I like it really good, i like it very much.</li>
            <li> , It gave a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li> This razor works well but does not provide quite as good a shave as my first.  </li>
            <li> I gave the shavers as gifts for 4 friends and all my friends gave me a pretty good feedback after they used it.</li>
            <li> To buy a new shaver was a great choice for us.  </li>
            <li> It shaves best on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I really liked it, and it gave a great shave for a low cost.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is very easy to clean -</li>
            <li> [...] bucks but very good and durable.&lt;br /&gt;I think recent norelco shavers seems to develop contrary.&lt;br /&gt;Old</li>
            <li> Considering that fact, this shaver seemed much more smooth after just one swipe.</li>
            <li> I always use a blade when it is important, a electric razor is ok for work etc.</li>
            <li> every purchase I have made, this one is no diffirent to the outstanding service, prices and &#x27;free shipping&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> but I was finally able to get a smooth shave all over.</li>
            <li> Great decision so far.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son &amp; so far is working great.  </li>
            <li> I was contemplating replacing the razor heads but they were costing around $35 for the three heads - its like GPS map updates cost as much as newer models (with some good online deals, of course)</li>
            <li> And I have another 2.6 weeks for the shave quality to get better and better.o the throat, which isn&#x27;t completely perfect, but at least in my own experience I would never complain about the quality of this shave.  </li>
            <li> Good close shave, not irritating.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 7340 is very nice and easy to use, easy to clean, shaving very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; easy to clean too!  </li>
            <li> My only advice would be to take good care of it!</li>
            <li> You only need 35 dollars, a good deal!</li>
            <li> They also came with more significant charging stations and accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Philips razor than in Chinese prices cheap 50$  quality is very good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good product, ok for soft use.</li>
            <li> The three heads in the shaver can be washed and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge and use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is easy, just use tap water.</li>
            <li> I notice a stubble, but considering how easy it is to use (and washable)</li>
            <li> The fact it is waterproof in the sense I CAN RISE IT UNDER TAP EASY CLEANING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On/off button easy to press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is amazing that I can use it a whole month (15 times or more per month) and it is like new.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You have to make sure that the heads are clean</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to clean with warm water by just opening the head.  </li>
            <li> protector - junk which comes off easy and breaks easily, leading to...&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can be rinsed out for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Anyway, this model is an exceptional value - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and wash.</li>
            <li> Performs well and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> And this one is good, made in China (of course) and does a decent job for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Have had this shaver for 2 1/2 years now and still working strong.  </li>
            <li> Nice razor at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I prefer my Norelco Cool Skin shaver much more.</li>
            <li> To get the best battery life you do need to let the batteries run down.  </li>
            <li> and it still works as good as new.  </li>
            <li> Even so, the remingtons were never this good new out of the box.  </li>
            <li> (To comment on a previous review, I find it best to run the battery out before charging rather than leaving it</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> It still working perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I end up cleaning it every 4 or 5 months and its still works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Norelco user for many years.  </li>
            <li> The two downsides, compared to my previous one, is that there isn&#x27;t a good way to see if it needs charging, and it doesn&#x27;t come with a good travel case.</li>
            <li> I will admit the shave is not as smooth as some reviewer seem to want, but for me it is fine.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives fine, smooth shaves, which is all I could ask for.</li>
            <li> so this little device works perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The upgraded heads on the 7340 made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> This Philips/Norelco rotary cuts well with a lighter touch (still not blade smooth), and with an after shave gel followup</li>
            <li> An adequately smooth shave, in about 2/3 the time, with a lot fewer ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the exterior metal is as smooth as it once was.  </li>
            <li> One feature I like is the charge indicator light which blinks when the razor is charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> I just want a razor that worked, this seems to fit the bill</li>
            <li> Smooth shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate if you find this model for cheap.</li>
            <li> Makes it SO EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a light to tell me I have the unit turned on.  </li>
            <li> But this Norelco is actually doing a great job...</li>
            <li> Even more fun</li>
            <li> One that I bought on the cheap side something like 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high-quality, cheap, durable razor-</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a carry case is also not an issue for me; however, the cap could fit a bit tighter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The protective plastic head is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made, will not buy Phillips again.</li>
            <li> My face was RELATIVELY smooth and have had over 2 months now without discomfort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the 7430 is light....extremely light.  </li>
            <li> Once discussed, things went smoothly.</li>
            <li> The one downside is the lack of a light that signals the need to re-charge the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I ordered another shaver for my brother.  </li>
            <li> Razor is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Have tried a few and this is one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li> No cuts, no rash, and my skin is smooth after every use.</li>
            <li> Electrics keep me smooth until mid-afternoon, blade shavers all day.</li>
            <li> Great mistake when I decided to quit using Remington and gave a try to Philips Norelco following all the hype surrounding this brand.</li>
            <li> Shave is close and smooth.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I own 2 of these in case #1 breaks.  </li>
            <li> It feels very durable and was worth the money to get a good shaver.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> The shave is still good,  So far each charge lasts about a month.  </li>
            <li> This one has lasted so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far its good.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know since this is my first, but decided a closer but still safe and easy shave is best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Norelco gives a clean shave and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> my first time to use electric shaver and its of course, more comfortable than Manual.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good but does not seem strong enough.</li>
            <li> After many years in retail I am fully aware of the importance of eye appeal and discouraging shop lifters.  </li>
            <li> one of the best shaver i have ever owned in the past 45 years.</li>
            <li> i feel i have to do extra looking around my face to make sure i&#x27;ve got all the hair , but i think it&#x27;s more its more my face adjusting.......</li>
            <li> Still using the original blades</li>
            <li> being said, I began the search for a replacement razor - going over many reviews on many sites of many different models.  </li>
            <li> This shaver has the better HQ-8 heads as compared to the 7310.&lt;br /&gt;The heads cost almost as much as I paid for the entire shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works great but don&#x27;t leave home without the cord/charger&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li> bought it long time ago as gift for my father, he is happy for what he got it, no issue at all for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> , you need the original cord since it includes an adapter.</li>
            <li> I originally bought my Norelco 7340 shaver at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> The manual said the full charge takes about 8 hours and the light will go off after fully charged.</li>
            <li> It gives him a close shave, plus it comes with a pop up trimmer to help with having a clean edge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone says to run water over the blades to clean them.  </li>
            <li> you clean it under a running faucet........</li>
            <li> Instead of having a head which can be cleanly removed at the push of a button this shaver head is on a hinge.  </li>
            <li> this one is much lighter, quieter, more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Rinsing under faucet to clean is a Godsend.</li>
            <li> I am African_American and this did not manage to give me a clean shave.</li>
            <li> , charging unit are waterproof sealed so to clean it basically pop the head</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you just rinse out the product after each use to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li> No hassles just shave and rinses clean everytime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver also allows the use of water to rinse the heads clean.  </li>
            <li> The documents that came suggested to clean it every 3 months, but I keep forgetting.</li>
            <li> It can shave mostly clean.</li>
            <li> Shaving is quick, close &amp; comfortable - even with my heavier-than-average whiskers, AND WITH 5 DAYS GROWTH, the shave I get is, again, quick, close &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> First I  really liked it, until I used for the first time.</li>
            <li> But make no mistake that a good blade shaver (Gillette Fusion for example) will be much closer and doesn&#x27;t even draw much blood.</li>
            <li> The retractable trimmer is very handy for trimming sideburns or really long hairs.  </li>
            <li> So much so that I then did some research on a good reviewed shaver at a decent price and then went out and bought this Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Both sound much more quite then my older Norelcos I had.  </li>
            <li> And cleaning is very easy to just open the top and run it under tap water.  </li>
            <li> It worked much better during the first month, but after your skin got used to the razor, the performance was not as good, meaning you had to make more effort such as shaving longer, using different angles, and using more force.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted to spend more time trying to get a really close shave with the Norelco I could, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a really good close shave although I&#x27;m Asian</li>
            <li> Overall a good product save the side trimmer.</li>
            <li> and the batteries hold a full charge from week to week.  </li>
            <li> to now, the battery duration is good enough.</li>
            <li> to add that the people giving this razor good reviews have either never shaved with a high-quality electric razor or they have a different beard type than I do.</li>
            <li> I am able to get a very close shave in a minimum of time.</li>
            <li> Love it shaves very well.</li>
            <li> It was not giving good shave since starting</li>
            <li> &#x27;s now Dec. 2010 - 2 years later - and it shaves every bit as good as when I bought it.</li>
            <li> AT ALL, Big +  superior blades/</li>
            <li> full battery Indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -The colour and looks appealed     -Had a full battery Indicator.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generate much in the way of whiskers, so the deeper \\&quot;reservoir\\&quot; holds many days</li>
            <li> After over thirty years of wearing a full beard, I decided it was time for a change.  </li>
            <li> then I thought I&#x27;d go the full clean-shaved route.  </li>
            <li> It did not take more than 3 minutes to finish the job but was very noisy</li>
            <li> It does provide a good shave, but it gives no warning when it is low on battery power.</li>
            <li> If you just need a good close shave at a low price without any fancy bells and whistles, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Only had it for 3 weeks now, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it at a really good price.</li>
            <li> Overall I am delighted with the quality and value of the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not a advertisement,it is true</li>
            <li> Definitely a good shaver for the price range and time will tell if it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> Only good things to say i will update if that changes.</li>
            <li> Really wish it was put together with a bit better clipping mechanism.  </li>
            <li> so it just sits on the counter while charging, and 2) the latch is kind of sensitive</li>
            <li> It works quite well and the battery last a good while.  </li>
            <li> It was also a very reasonable price and was shipped to me very quickly.</li>
            <li> The blades give me a good clean shave and the adjustable heads make it easy to get around the chin and other areas of the face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco 5601X for almost 10 years, worked great and never needed to do much more than clean it and change the blades when they got dull.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a clean, close and comfortable shave at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy, rinse under hot water after each shave.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco is still working on its first charge, (over a month ago), and still shaving strong.</li>
            <li> The main head, though, just can&#x27;t seem to do a good job of totally removing already-trimmed, just-washed hair; no matter how many times I go over my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, in comparison to some of the other razors out there, this ends up being a great deal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first shave was a dream - a very close comfortable shave provided by the new HQ8 type heads, which is as good as it gets for a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new 7340 has better clean shaving and the battery can hold longer.</li>
            <li> Have used older model Norelco shavers for many years.  </li>
            <li> Charges quickly.</li>
            <li> A super gun for man.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several days now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> It does shave as close a blade but requires practice to shave quickly and</li>
            <li> The quality of the shave is better than with my older razor</li>
            <li> and then you must quickly remove it when it is charged.</li>
            <li> It fits in my hand very well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I can find similar models in stores, but none this cheap or nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure over time a charge won&#x27;t last 12 days, but anything was better than the Braun piddling out two days after it was charged.</li>
            <li> If it will give an old man a close shave  and is very easy to use (and it does and is)</li>
            <li> I find the Norelco shavers better for my beard than the highly rated Braun model.  </li>
            <li> Even though it sounds like it&#x27;s barely running, it has given a nice, close shave on my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, which is good, except that&#x27;s mostly due to the cheap plastic construction.  </li>
            <li> really recommend this razor as it reaches the whole face, it shaves fast and good.</li>
            <li> It took a couple weeks to get used to;  the cut was slightly different from the old one for some reason and this one is really light,  but now it works great.  </li>
            <li> It takes some extra attention to the jaw line, which is always a challenge with my beard, and to the throat, which isn&#x27;t completely perfect, but at least in my own experience I would never complain about the quality of this shave.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try a different kind of shaver and went with this norelco and have loved every second of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using an older Norelco shaver for the last 3 years and it was doing a great job until about Feb/Mar time frame.</li>
            <li> it worked better than the new one.</li>
            <li> The good:  a good shave; plenty of battery life (at least when brand-new); corded or cordless use; when corded, it shaves really well even if the batteries are nearly depleted; easy to clean (the heads can be rinsed under the tap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades are quite easy on your skin and do a great job of getting those hard to reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I quickly get a relatively close shave with the Norelco, and then finish by applying a post-shave ointment and using a popular multiple-blade razor.  </li>
            <li> The price was much better than the Braun, and the unit seems to be about half the weight, which I found is nice when packing it in my toiletries it for travel.</li>
            <li> The price was much better than the Braun, and the unit seems to be about half the weight, which I found is nice when packing it in my toiletries it for travel.</li>
            <li> down side is that it needs several shaves to get better results, and when it gets to perfect shave your skin is very irritated.</li>
            <li> I buy it for myself, its cheap and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I think replacement blades are in the $30s, and recommended once a year - if I continue to get this result, it will be worth it.  </li>
            <li> all about the same and mine works really well and got surprisingly closer</li>
            <li> but this one is far better than the remington razor it replaced.  </li>
            <li> The quite sound makes it seem like they are slow, but don&#x27;t let that fool you the 7340 works great.  </li>
            <li> So not at all worth spending money</li>
            <li> I was surprised and happy when this razor left my neck</li>
            <li> I had an old Gillette razor from 1999 that shaved my face better than this does</li>
            <li> shipping cost &amp; time delivery factor did not make it worth it</li>
            <li> Shaver is Better than my old Remington R842.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips</li>
            <li> Also i do sorta feel the side burn trimmer on my old model was better than this one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth mentioning....</li>
            <li> Worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> Also i do sorta feel the side burn trimmer on my old model was better than this one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth mentioning....</li>
            <li> Worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily I was able to use the old cord I had saved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spend the extra $15 and get a nice foil shaver that will still not break the bank, but not break your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that any kind of electric product can do as well as a regular blade.</li>
            <li> The price cost is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> No negatives whatsoever - anyone who downgrades this product must have received a (rare) \\&quot;lemon\\&quot; and could undoubtedly have obtained a brand-new replacement via Norelco warranty</li>
            <li> It shaves much better than my old Remington.</li>
            <li> because right from day 1 it has had a smooth quality shave it really</li>
            <li> It is the first time I use Norelco shavers&#x27;before that I used  pansonic and so on&#x27; Norelco shavers7340  does a great job,  so much less noise from the shaver  than that I used before.</li>
            <li> Even so, after 4 years the older razor still cuts fine.</li>
            <li> It is extremely easy to clean in the dry mode and disassembles/re-assembles easily for periodic \\&quot;deep\\</li>
            <li> It uses a NiCd battery, which means that if you don&#x27;t follow the directions EXACTLY the battery will quickly be ruined.</li>
            <li> With the &#x27;95 model, I was only able to brush out what I could after each shave; it required periodic disassembly of the heads to thoroughly clean it.  </li>
            <li> This is technically a dry shaver, as the instructions tell you to \\&quot;use on dry skin for the best results.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The original blades lasted 4 years and still cut very well.</li>
            <li> What makes this razor such a good buy,in addition to it giving a clean shave is that this razor&#x27;s battery keeps its charge for a surprisingly long time; it has been more than 30 days since I first fully charged it and after more than 30 daily shaves it still has not needed to be recharged... amazing for an electric razor that is so relatively inexpensive!</li>
            <li> The trimmer feature allows me to keep my moustache the right length.</li>
            <li> I like the opening head that can be emptied right into a trash can and then washed with water.  </li>
            <li> but I plugged the charger right in and finished shaving.  </li>
            <li> They are right, it is not as substanial feeling.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> However, as long as it works and lasts, I am satisfied with a light weight model.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fit even my older cases.  </li>
            <li> I must report the shaver worked great,delivered excellent shaves, I really expected this shaver would hold up for quite a long time</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it showed you a battery level or even a warning as it&#x27;s getting low when you first turn it on, but instead you just have to wait until it stops working and start charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap and gives a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> Cleanup is very easy and only requires water.  </li>
            <li> When the batteries ran down I used to bring the shaver to Norelco&#x27;s in NYC or Macy&#x27;s shaver repair.&lt;br /&gt;There are best buys for rotary shavers such as Remington&#x27;s model.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> Never before would I expect as close a shave as I&#x27;d get with a conventional razor (Good News, Bic etc).</li>
            <li> But, I kind of wanted to try a Norelco again and this one was $15 less than the Panasonic(I&#x27;m too cheap).  </li>
            <li> The problem is I can get the job done with disposable razors in less than ten minutes, with almost perfect results everytime.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous razor of the same model and it performs flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> The motor seems pretty powerful and the blades seem to conform well to the contours of the face.</li>
            <li> The only indication that it&#x27;s probably a NiCd is that the manual says \\&quot;battery performance is best if you recharge only when the batteries are (almost) completely empty.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> On the other hand battery life was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Norelco makes better shavers for a little more money.</li>
            <li> The comfortable, close shave of my new Phillips Norelco 7340 men&#x27;s razor is by far&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a new one, but figured that technology had advanced in 10 years</li>
            <li> I bought two of these in 2012 for my youngest sons, both new shavers, with light beards.  </li>
            <li> I have had this razor for over 5 months, and I have charged it 3 times, INCLUDING the first charge right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> No electric razor shaves half as good as a blade</li>
            <li> It is very quiet, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is good, the shaving it&#x27;s almost as close as with a razor, is not as noisy as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks ago I was in my university final exams, so shaving was no a priority</li>
            <li> The close, comfortable, quiet shave makes shaving a genuine pleasure again.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver does a great job, and  there  is so much less noise from the shaver in this model than in older models.</li>
            <li> All good, except I don&#x27;t think I get as close a shave as with my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> I could live with the auto clean refills ( about 1 every 6 weeks at $10.00 a pop) but the shave was not that clean particularly along the neck.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get nearly as good of a shave, and the construction just feels a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> The first time the battery ran out, and the shaver stopped, I plugged it in, and it ran full speed for the rest of the shave, nulike the older rechargeable types that had to be charged fully to run at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A huge improvement over the old Panasonic it replaced.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first to switch over to an electric razor seeing as I had never used one.</li>
            <li> As soon as I saw this model on sale for around $38 (after rebates), I jumped on it and just tried it today morning for the first time.</li>
            <li> i got a Philips Norelco for christmas but it doesnt look exactly like the one in the picture</li>
            <li> I am willing to give this another week.  </li>
            <li> I ever find a lady willing to test the results of my shave, perhaps the star count will go to five, or it may go to one.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe that was just the first times.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any irritation at all after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> norelco are better than recent norelco shavers.....</li>
            <li> I still keep the first one as a cord-only backup, since its battery died.  </li>
            <li> The first, manufactured in Germany, lasted 19 years.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver on a regular basis for more than 30 years.</li>
            <li> However, this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned that has irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not troubled by it being manufactured in China.</li>
            <li> Not much to say -- it shaves and shaves nicely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;WIll definitely publish some more data once I use the shaver for a month or so..</li>
            <li> The last Norelco shaver I had, the back trimmer was much more durable and did a much better job.</li>
            <li> This is likely the case with most razors though.  </li>
            <li> i really love the fact that when it needs cleaning i can simply wash it.</li>
            <li> although i got it at a very reduced price,it still wasnt worth it.  </li>
            <li> And it only takes 1 or 2 passes at my face to be able to do that.  </li>
            <li> first battery charge has lasted for weeks now without the need for another charge.  </li>
            <li> Not the first razor I have tried and was hoping this would work when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It consistently leaves my face with untrimmed whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> But I only somewhat feel that way most part</li>
            <li> When my decade-old Norelco triple header&#x27;s battery began to indicate it was no longer able to provide the necessary power, I began looking for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li> Second, the top part of the shaver falls apart EVERY TIME I travel with it.</li>
            <li> The first lasted many years and finally died.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the power or rpm that my first one had.  </li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m completely pleased with my purchase, and I can use the carrying case (such as it is) that came with my 7825XL.</li>
            <li> First, I went to a Remington beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The first 8/9 hour charge has lasted 10 days plus.</li>
            <li> This was my first electrical razor and I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Go with this one first</li>
            <li> It is incredible to me that Norelco would intentionally make the shaving experience worse, presumably to increase profits.  </li>
            <li> The first charge has lasted over a month.</li>
            <li> The wall plug is ok, not as big as others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> so one can assure a consistent shave each time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the first Norelco that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Each lasting more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the first Norelco I&#x27;ve owned without the comfort control setting.  </li>
            <li> The higher priced models use the HQ9s.  </li>
            <li> The first charge lasted two weeks.</li>
            <li> The reason:  the higher cost of replacing the battery.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well, and I don&#x27;t notice a decrease in performance.</li>
            <li> First, it is the quietest shaver I have found.</li>
            <li> I could never get all my neck hairs and most times I left the bath area bleeding.  </li>
            <li> ONLY drawback is more of an O.C.D. thing -</li>
            <li> I have use Philips shaver more than 20 years from I was a middle school boy.</li>
            <li> It is his first time to use a electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and it stays charged for almost a week between recharges!</li>
            <li> It is extremely comfortable on the face and offers a close shave that rivals a blade.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to remove all my facial hair with it.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same area dozens of times to remove most, but not all of the hair, and never, ever, could remove all hair from the neck.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> I have used my 7340 in the sands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan and it has not failed me.</li>
            <li> The entire top assembly came apart.  </li>
            <li> the first try.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use, quiet, lightweight and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had another Norelco razor which I was satisfied with, but it was 10 years old, time for a new one.</li>
            <li> Nice Shaver, it&#x27;s my first one ever xD, so I&#x27;m not the one to compare between shavers, but I find the results enough satisfying for a shave, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get every hair cut, but overall does a great work, leaves my face pretty soft and with no irritation at all, plus</li>
            <li> As for my opinion and experience, this model is pretty simple and works good only on very light 1-day facial hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be a less advanced shaver than the 7340, and yet it provides me with a better shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the product, but do not think it is worth the extra cost, the basic model would probably do just fine.</li>
            <li> But I have tried many electric razors with limited success.</li>
            <li> around Christmas 2009 I bought this battery operated rotary shaver, pretty much out of boredum, it was just $9.95, I fig what the heck, I never owned a rotary shaver before, it very cheap and generic, to my amazement</li>
            <li> Would be great except blades replacements cost almost as much as shaver and don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> And at my age and beard condition, I seemed to be getting more of them with the foil shavers - I think mostly because I had to push hard and repeat with the foil to get a sufficiently close shave.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the close, clean shave, including the neck area.  </li>
            <li> I tend never to buy the cheapest model or the most expensive model, something in-between seems to work good for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the latest one that I bought a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve been the least satisfied with it so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone interested in an affordable, easy &amp; quiet shave should buy this Norelco 7340.  </li>
            <li> It was his first real razor, so we have nothing to compare it to, but nonetheless, he would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a college student and there are times where I do not have time to stand in front of the mirror waiting until my whole face is shaved, instead I can move around and know it is doing exactly what I expect it to do.</li>
            <li> However, one has to consider that the first razor did cost twice as much as this one.</li>
            <li> My last electric was a Braun, which was okay, but I expected so much more for the money.</li>
            <li> so this is my first day really using</li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s always gunk stuck in the chamber, putting it under hot running water is fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much quieter than the Braun it replaced, and no silly cleaning solution to buy.</li>
            <li> a blog above the older Norelco were better made than today&#x27;s models.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold while shaving a relatively quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Quiet like it should be and cleans out easily too.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have the nice charging stand like the previous one</li>
            <li> Battery does not seem to give enough power, doesn&#x27;t feel strong, though it Feels like it gives a close shave</li>
            <li> After my initial charge (8 hours or so) the battery lasted about 12 days worth of shaves - not bad at all.</li>
            <li> but the making material seems a little cheap and may easy to break.</li>
            <li> (Seems to have very good battery life done at least 9 shaves since first charge of 8 hours and still running, have not charged it a second time yet.</li>
            <li> I guess getting what you pay for certainly applies to this razor.</li>
            <li> And I would certainly use in the event of a (God forbid) date, or going to church.</li>
            <li> This one just stops when the voltage falls below certain level.  </li>
            <li> After using a Remington Shaver for the last 5 years and many replacement heads I decided to try a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> it is fast and easy to carry any where took about 2 weeks to adjust ,i will never go back to blades ,thank you norelco.</li>
            <li> Having more moving parts, it seems more likely to break down.</li>
            <li> Sure it may take a few passes to get the longer hairs but in the end it is a quick close shave</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remember exactly, but I&#x27;ve used  this Norelco shaver at least two years, and it just keeps giving me a nice, easy, fast, comfortable shave every other morning.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty amazing, actually, that such a quiet, light thing could shave so well.</li>
            <li> The features are fine; I had a Remington a couple years back that had a battery charge indicator and -- surprise!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rest of unit is up to Norelco&#x27;s fine standard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears that the Norelco engineers&#x27; attempts to improve a very good shaver have failed.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable for its features that I like including a cleaner close shave, running quiet, and ability to clean it under running hot water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it takes a long time to shave with the razor, it seems like you have to go over the same spot many times to get a clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now going to do what I should have done originally and just put new heads on my trusty old 6618.</li>
            <li> just completed a test, shaving half my face with the Norelco, half with my old Braun (not in the best shape), and after judging my beard the next morning, the Norelco easily won.</li>
            <li> IT is quiet, light weight and cuts very close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and it works for me.</li>
            <li> So I said, lets try a much cheaper shaver.  </li>
            <li> and now i dont thanks the philips norelco</li>
            <li> My beard appears to be too much for this razor.</li>
            <li> Also, Norelco really needs to put a low-battery indicator on this model.</li>
            <li> The electric raiser is working very well.  </li>
            <li> My face was really soar with the 6940, but not with the 7340.  </li>
            <li> I was very suprised by this shaver.  </li>
            <li> But, it really worked.</li>
            <li> So overall it gives a close shave, holds a charge for several shaves, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving system us a very lightweight reliable shaver.  </li>
            <li> In the light of experience, in future, i would not purchase a shaver without a remaining-power timer feature.</li>
            <li> that said, I may very well keep this shaver.  </li>
            <li> need to have much longer  to see if reliable.</li>
            <li> very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Norelco, which although is made in China, seems very well made.</li>
            <li> It is remarkably quiet and comfortable, a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of getting my beard accustomed to the shaver I can say it seems to shave reasonably close and gets all the hairs - something my Braun had a problem</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much&lt;br /&gt;-Although</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I can&#x27;t really call it a con</li>
            <li> I would reccommend others buying but not at 94.99 Walmart carries it for 79.99 and deals out of the USA are much cheaper</li>
            <li> I wanted a 100mark quality razor for much less&#x3D;69.99 rather than a 69.99 dollar razor for 10[..]</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really call it a con</li>
            <li> I would reccommend others buying but not at 94.99 Walmart carries it for 79.99 and deals out of the USA are much cheaper still.     </li>
            <li> I wanted a 100mark quality razor for much less&#x3D;69.99 rather than a 69.99 dollar razor for 10[..] off.    </li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t provide a close shave (it&#x27;s electric after all), it was very convenient and got the job done.</li>
            <li> Works real well.</li>
            <li> and I get done much faster than with my Braun.</li>
            <li> , he is very practical every day</li>
            <li> The shave is really close</li>
            <li> Much faster than shaving.</li>
            <li> did I know that you have to be a technician to replace the battery - a bummer and very foolish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend for the value and price point!</li>
            <li> resulting shave is very close and without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I doubt that you could really tell the difference with this shaver</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really a non-issue for me, but maybe it matters to some.</li>
            <li> This model gives me a close shave, and without much irritation.  </li>
            <li> I can shave my whole face in about 2 minutes, and it cuts very close.</li>
            <li> much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s true--if I shave twice with a Quattro, once with the grain and once against, and don&#x27;t mind that I&#x27;ll cut gouges in my face and irritate my skin so much</li>
            <li> Product works very well.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well and is a much faster shave then</li>
            <li> A very close shave.</li>
            <li> The Norelco shaver is very reliable and gives a close shave everytime.</li>
            <li> Thanks Norelco.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> very confertable.&lt;br /&gt;i use it almost every day and save much time.</li>
            <li> but I can state that the 7340 system sold here is a much changed version of what I have used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he is ready for the day.  </li>
            <li> very clear.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very quiet.and</li>
            <li> Its beard and mustache trimmer works very well too.</li>
            <li> He says it works very well.</li>
            <li> If they had been clearer up front that the cord was not included and would cost as much as it does, I would not have ordered as I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset over the whole situation.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately it started acting squirelly, so a couple weeks ago I ordered this Norelco off Amazon.</li>
            <li> The shave itself is much smoother with no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow issues.</li>
            <li> It was priced at nearly $70 by the manufacturer, but on sale for about $30 at the time, and worth every penny of that</li>
            <li> Seems to take a while to cut...does NOT beat a straight razor by any means.</li>
            <li> However, with the Norelco all of my hairs were shaved and it leaves a very close shave to boot.  </li>
            <li> This one also works very well.  </li>
            <li> I run my hand across my cheeks and can feel some micro hair sticking up, not always as smooth, but my hair grows in all different directions.</li>
            <li> Well, I owned a Phillips shaver before, much cheaper model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always find some hairs remaining, especially near the adam&#x27;s apple or the nostrils.</li>
            <li> Mustache trimmer makes a straight edge trim line.  </li>
            <li> I am old enough to have owned many electric shavers over the years</li>
            <li> If you constantly plug it in to keep it \\&quot;topped off\\&quot;, you will be replacing batteries on a more frequent cycle.  </li>
            <li> If you constantly plug it in to keep it \\&quot;topped off\\&quot;, you will be replacing batteries on a more frequent cycle.  </li>
            <li> I swore I&#x27;d never buy a Philips again, but here I am, using one at least once a week, after finding one over Christmas at a good price.</li>
            <li> since if it stops dead you can finish up with the cord, but I still would have liked a \\&quot;Time to Recharge\\&quot; indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it cleans up fairly well with water after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> pretty much exactly what i was looking for, no frills and works well, battery easily holds a charge long enough for a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the first one ceased working in three weeks, but Amazon quickly supplied a replacement at no extra cost.</li>
            <li> Long battery life, cheap($35), and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This razor was reasonably priced, holds charge a long time, cuts better, and is much quieter than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> From my research the biggest complaint about the HQ9 head is that it seems to take more time to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> choice Norelco because of all the reviews on amazon, Norelco overwhelimingly received much better reviews of other brands.</li>
            <li> and you can shave with it while you are doing many other morning duties.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand shaving more than every other day, then yes, I could get closer with a blade.  </li>
            <li> Better than any other battery or electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Probably due to more shave time needed to remove stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t want to waste too much words on the advantage of this shaver, comfortable, quick and clean shaving, light in weight, low noise, but i&#x27;d like to highlight that the power can last for longer time after one charge than my expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor leaves my face clean, without any facial hair at all.</li>
            <li> So, finally you end up using the manual razor to clean those places.</li>
            <li> I have a clean non soar, nor red face!</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco 7340 do not shave clean enough</li>
            <li> I would have liked one-hour rather than eight-hour recharge, but that is only a minor drawback.  </li>
            <li> Edit from 5/24/09:&lt;br /&gt;While my initial experience with this razor was very positive, after the first week I started to notice that the quality of the shave it gave was deteriorating rapidly.  </li>
            <li> Because it was only $38, I give this a full 5 stars for the performance/value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor has a charge indicator but its only purpose is to indicate when the shaver is being charged and that it has reached full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful when buying this product if your face has many irregularities, or if one of your hairs grow in a manner contrary or very attached to face this razor may do little for you unless you plan to use a shaving razor blade double standard thing Norelco does not recommend, in addition to submitting the face of an adaptation process that may never work for the cost involved does not seem so great option</li>
            <li> It caused too much irritation on my skin and takes too long to do a clean shave.</li>
            <li> This is NOT disclosed in the product description; I had to hunt down more details on the product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new razor!  </li>
            <li> We bought a new Norelco shaver because the replacement blades for the \\&quot;very</li>
            <li> /&gt;Specifically it shaves very well, close as I would expect new &#x27;blades&#x27; to do...with any Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I chose this model because a slightly more expensive model seemed like it had the best reviews, and this razor is virtually identical for $30 less with only a couple differences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive razors and they have not done better.  </li>
            <li> Tried to give myself a decently close shave with this thing to my folly.  </li>
            <li> The newer models now come with nickel metal-hydride batterys instead of the older Ni-cads.  </li>
            <li> -- does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t beat a blade, but is much better than a much more expensive Remington that I was using.  </li>
            <li> I have replaced an older Norelco with this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the expensive models from Panasonic, Braun and Norelco and didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money so this time around I went cheap</li>
            <li> I think it is decently built</li>
            <li> The heads are held in place better than one of the more expensive models, giving -</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how light and quiet this Norelco 7340 men&#x27;s shaver is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor is adequately constructed (for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get a piece of solid iron).  </li>
            <li> That goes double when you realize I would not be able to shave this close with a razor on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That goes double when you realize I would not be able to shave this close with a razor on a daily basis.    </li>
            <li> The rotaries in the older models were made of metal.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors and many, if not all, failed to beat this razor.  </li>
            <li> This particular razor has the HQ8 heads.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Norelco 7340 for my husband to replace a much older one that he used when he traveled.  </li>
            <li> particularly for the neck.......</li>
            <li> A simple puff cleans out the well, though on weekends when I have a bit more time, I can rinse out the residue that&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> A simple puff cleans out the well, though on weekends when I have a bit more time, I can rinse out the residue that&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> Charges quick, and last for a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this particular shaver over the cheaper Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High quality.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the 7340.</li>
            <li> I had been using the same razor my entire life that finally died after nearly 15 years of good use.  </li>
            <li> on the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll take it back and go for the model without the &#x27;double blades&#x27; and see if the battery situation is better.  </li>
            <li> Before this one I had more expensive, more stylish one, but it wasn&#x27;t shaving properly, didn&#x27;t cut a lil bit long hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I had a little travel shaver that did a better job... and the blade the catches the hairs for a closer shave</li>
            <li> Some may find it a little light(made more out of plastic than metal)</li>
            <li> + years, I decided to spend a little more and get the 7340.  </li>
            <li> I should have just put new blades in my older one.</li>
            <li> So far it shaves very well and it quietest of any Noreclo I have had.  </li>
            <li> 7340 is much lighter and quieter than my old 7825XL.</li>
            <li> My shave doesn&#x27;t seem much closer than my old electric razor</li>
            <li> Shaves very close, and so far is holding its charge for about 6 days of shaving.</li>
            <li> the finish is quite smooth, not as close a shave as a razor, ie: wouldn&#x27;t pass an 9 hour military day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, after replacing the head, the shaver generally works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I wish the side burn trimmer u pushed up out instead of releasing , cuz normally u go with the grain of the hair</li>
            <li> , cuz normally u go with the grain of the hair</li>
            <li> well, though a couple of days later I found a lower price of 34.77 in Walmart, I still think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> Note that this service normally must be done by a service person since the batteries are soldered in.  </li>
            <li> Note that this service normally must be done by a service person since the batteries are soldered in.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money (which was also a big selling point.)</li>
            <li> and I was just missing out on a better shave.</li>
            <li> so I take more than 5 mins everyday so that I have to recharge it every 5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my third or fourth Philips Norelco triple-head model over the past decade...and by far the best of the generally satisfactory lot.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised with how much lighter the new razor is, and</li>
            <li> And removing the heads (for deeper cleaning) is also easy rather than some of the more complicated ones I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> gaining better shave, far less irritation, return of lost time.</li>
            <li> To start off i owned a braun shaver for the last 4 years and loved it until it recently broke due to my doing.</li>
            <li> the battery lasts a fairly long time but when it goes it goes quick.</li>
            <li> Pull your skin tight with your free hand and shave away, this makes your whiskers stand up straight and easier for the shaver to</li>
            <li> I agree with others that this thing is quiet, much more quiet than the old Ramington, but that&#x27;s because the old Remington was performing work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is probably my third Norelco as my last one finally gave up for good after several years of reliable service and I have been shaving with an electric for some years now.</li>
            <li> If you learn to really take your time and go slowly over the shaved area of the face you can acheive a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The head then goes crashing down onto the sink which will easily damage the cutters.  </li>
            <li> razor feels cheaply made, not exactly flimsy but there&#x27;s nothing screaming quality either.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, even after just two days&#x27; use (so during the adjustment period) with the Norelco 7340 I can get a shave that&#x27;s just as close (feels perfectly smooth and passes the \\&quot;my girlfriend</li>
            <li> It may be because of the new blades too</li>
            <li> Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 7340 Shaver from Amazon has been a new revelation in shaving for me.  </li>
            <li> Now this new shaver is so convenient...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given lots of time for my skin to adjust to the new one, but I need to replace this one.  </li>
            <li> and I live an hour away from the US border</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to praise new products however this time I must make an exception.  </li>
            <li> Now I have new freedom to walk around the house shaving.  </li>
            <li> I hope this new&#x27;un lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Never even changed cutters, never needed new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They told me that all norelco&#x27;s have always run at 2000 RPMS, and that the motor has been updated with the new \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; to reduce the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use tape and glue to repair the plastic protective device rather than buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> This just may be the &#x27;new&#x27; technology of batteries</li>
            <li> I can live with this.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that every time I purchase a new razor from Philips they have reduced the quality and value of their products.</li>
            <li> and it is still sharper than the new Norelco.</li>
            <li> So I made up my mind to buy a new one</li>
            <li> shaver is very easy to maintain, and really hardly needs any maintenance except emptying.</li>
            <li> I just got tired of shaving the old fashioned way with the shaving cream the shaver, the nicks and cuts when using a new razor, the time it took to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I can make a direct comparison because my older Norelco just feels smoother.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quiet, charges quickly and the charge lasts at least a week of shaving as I charge every Sunday after carrying it many times for a week on the road.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to my present from my wife via Amazon, shaving now is a real pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope there is a yellow light which can remind you about the low power</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said:  I would have liked an indicator when the battery is down far enough that recharging is indicated, like my old Norelco had.  </li>
            <li> I have recently bought a new razor that is more expensive and, hopefully will do a better job.</li>
            <li> Cheap and not worth the anguish.</li>
            <li> I also recommend spending the couple of extra dollars over the other 7310XL and get the better heads.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I only use it every other day, but that is much better than the piece of junk this razor replaced.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the purchase (especially the price) and would likely buy again.</li>
            <li> I had been using the same corded Norelco shaver since 1995 with the original blades and decided it was time for a change to the 21st century.  </li>
            <li> When I tried this one, the first thing I noticed was how quiet it was.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought I wasn&#x27;t using it properly</li>
            <li> This is such a problem that I am bringing back the old 5601X into service and will replace the blades and use it as my primary shaver again.  </li>
            <li> First, it simply doesn&#x27;t provide a quality shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my second electric razor, the first being a Panasonic that did not work well.  </li>
            <li> The size is also pretty big and weight is not light.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I charged it two Saturday nights ago, and used it for the first time before church the next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Norelco&#x27;s for the past 30 years and have had entry level models all the way up to top of the line models.</li>
            <li> I already owned an Norelco shaver but it was old and needed new blades.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely cheaper to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Oh, the battery does stay full charge (or near) till the very end, and then shuts down - no indicator.  </li>
            <li> I have had multiple value shavers that were ok, but took a long time to give an only decent shave.  </li>
            <li> Based on 3 weeks of use of the 7340, even without the comfort control, not only do the HQ8 heads shave as fast as my older Norelco&#x27;s but the shave is also closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clean, fast, no pulling or missing misc hairs.</li>
            <li> i have used blades  for 50 years in my old age i have become lazy to shave every day ,so i decided to buy an electric shaver .i love my new shaver i am getting close</li>
            <li> I had a low end Philips Norelco shave for the last few years (in the $40 range) and this one at $60 (when I ordered it) seems to be far superior.</li>
            <li> course the new one, so far, is improved and cost $40.</li>
            <li> The new 7340 did not perform as well as my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> : Not a super smooth shave, razor burn, feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I find the light goes off less than 8 hours.</li>
            <li> It often just falls off when trying to do a quick partial cleaning during shaving.</li>
            <li> The cleaning feature is a major improvement over older models.  </li>
            <li> Probably true of other company&#x27;s shavers as well.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does give you a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I received this item in good condition with brand new retail packaging, and the plastic in the packaging was difficult to get through.</li>
            <li> (i never found noise an issue with my old model, but i will say the sound of this 1 when fully charged sounds similar to that of my old shaver when it was winding down on battery power, so it&#x27;s very misleading you think when you first use it that it&#x27;s low on juice</li>
            <li> It does, however, do a much better job than my previous shaver, giving an extremely close shave that lasts for a couple of days (complete with some razor burn), which I would expect for the higher price...</li>
            <li> The trimmer, though seemingly lighter in construction, actually does a better job than my previous unit.  </li>
            <li> i bought this norelco that was priced in the middle- $60 more or less.</li>
            <li> This is a major advantage over my older Norelco&#x27;s since I use a pre shave product that can cause the blades to need frequent cleaning.  </li>
            <li> When I tried to clean it, I dropped one of the razor heads down the sink while trying to unclip the underside of the shaver head.  </li>
            <li> The washable head is a significant improvement over my previous model.</li>
            <li> You will find the sound of this product is a little loud.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing about it that could be improved, and no, I am not a shill for Norelco, simply a satisfied user with a tough beard.</li>
            <li> but if I need to shave two times as often, clearly there&#x27;s an issue here.</li>
            <li> I can shave in less than 2 minutes and clean it in 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> (Am 84 years young and over the decades I&#x27;ve owned &amp;#</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 60s now, and over the years I&#x27;ve bounced around, as far as shaving.  </li>
            <li> When I get near 30 minutes usage, I just let it run out, and then put it on charge - for about 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to shave with my old stick razors after using this.  </li>
            <li> So far the highlight of this shaver has been the battery life.</li>
            <li> I have the old Norelco which it was about 5-7 yrs old.</li>
            <li> my finger was nearly cut off trying to tear the clear plastic over the razor.  </li>
            <li> I replaced my 10 year old Norelco which has been indestructible.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because Walmart quit carying the blades for my 10 year old R845.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;ve found blades for the old razor on amazon</li>
            <li> The quality of shaves has so far (four months) been first-rate.</li>
            <li> It can be washable directly under the tap!&lt;br /&gt;Up</li>
            <li> and I use the old one for overnight stays.</li>
            <li> this is by far the poorest example.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this shaver works.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this razor holds a charge.  </li>
            <li> They are now completely mixed up and the blade components are now mismatched which is going to make them wear out much sooner.  </li>
            <li> This unit shaves fast, close and quietly.  </li>
            <li> if you have a soft skin like i do this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I do like the pivoting heads, as opposed to the fixed heads on the &#x27;95 model.  </li>
            <li> saved the case from my old shaver (which I still have as a backup) and will use that when traveling.  </li>
            <li> its alright for 3 day old stubble.  </li>
            <li> Mostly though the one complaint I have about it was it needed an 8 hour charge before use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-LIGHTWEIGHT (lighter than my old model, not that weight was ever an issue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cuz u can&#x27;t my old cord was just a spaghetti type cord with a 2 prong plug this has the 2 prong plug</li>
            <li> 69.99 seemed reasonable for a product in CANADA regularly priced around the 100 dollar mark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am in my early 20&#x27;s and have had a electric shaver since 99/2000 and since then have not bothered with manual razors since i got my Remington R842</li>
            <li> Cuz u can&#x27;t my old cord was just a spaghetti type cord with a 2 prong plug this has the 2 prong plug</li>
            <li> 69.99 seemed reasonable for a product in CANADA regularly priced around the 100 dollar mark.</li>
            <li> i am in my early 20&#x27;s and have had a electric shaver since 99/2000 and since then have not bothered with manual razors since i got my Remington R842</li>
            <li> I am very conservative, and just wanted as close to the same thing which served me so well for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spend so much time going over the same area that I might as well just use a blade.</li>
            <li> but, the material to making it has, today it&#x27;s all plastic compared to the old ones where metal was predominate.</li>
            <li> It replaced my &gt;10 year old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> My old shaver had me tethered to an electrical outlet since the batteries were so worn out.  </li>
            <li> and I think it will take a few months to really be comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li> My face had already got &#x27;used&#x27; to a rotary, I managed to acquire an ancient (12 yrs old?)</li>
            <li> I started realizing my old razor wasn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d still have an old battery.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old method of shaving (disposable razors)</li>
            <li> It just stops completely.  </li>
            <li> I have this shaver for use in my second home, very close shave that does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have went with the lithium-ion batteries,but these are preforming well so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exactly like my old norelco</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and almost never pinches.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the cheapness of this company</li>
            <li> Next, it shaves close, REALLY close, virtually indistinguishably from a razor.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin has had no problems with rashes or burning in the month</li>
            <li> Once fully charged it offers about two weeks of shaving time without a re-charge.  </li>
            <li> Does not feel as substantial as my old one, so</li>
            <li> I just try to stretch the skin out and keep going over the area, and after a few minutes, my face should be as smooth as it&#x27;ll get with an electric</li>
            <li> i was surprised</li>
            <li> This razor works just as good as the expensive ones</li>
            <li> great buy - I hope the battery lasts as long as the previous model did - one charge for about 2-3 weeks of everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> This shaver is so quiet I can not do other things like watch TV, or hear the sound on my computer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to hold for my somewhat small hands.  </li>
            <li> I use it dry and it has traveled a lot and gotten banged around - really could not improve on this shaver!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a very old Norelco Reflex Plus 6618, thinking that rather than just buy new heads for the old one, it was time to replace the entire shaver.</li>
            <li> The customer service rep told me to buy a new razor rather than send it back for a new battery to be installed.  </li>
            <li> The back cuts pretty well, though it can leave the skin a bit more sore than other heavy groomers.</li>
            <li> Battery life was also a problem, I only received about half as many shaves as advertised before shaver simply stopped.</li>
            <li> and this is coming from a guy who usually uses the pro glide razors, but the only reason i made the switch was from cartridge to electric was it was more cost efficient</li>
            <li> Also, you will have to cover the same territory 2 or 3 times to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a similar older model when its battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> The only feature I wish it had would be pure-corded operation; I would rather this model were twenty dollars cheaper and had no battery, but for this head assembly that&#x27;s not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding shave quality, the usual comment on most electrics is \\&quot;well, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is it did freeze in the car in the winter whereas the older model I have did not.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older and similar Norelco that I had for 10 years.</li>
            <li> For the fun of it, I have used it every morning since without recharging to see how long a charge will last.</li>
            <li> This is a simple model without any bells and whistles, but in my opinion it provides a decent shave for the price.</li>
            <li> highly recommend using Lectric Shave prior to shaving and an aftershave product when you are done.  </li>
            <li> This razor seems very underpowered even when fully charged, and although I do not have a heavy beard, it takes a long time to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> As to those who complain that they can&#x27;t predict the battery dying like the old NiCad battery models, the Lithium Ion battery in the new models is a vast improvement.  </li>
            <li> It cost me about the same on sale as new blades would&#x27;ve been for the old one.  </li>
            <li> But even after using for such a long time it never gives clean shave also if you try too hard to get clean shave</li>
            <li> A razor this expensive should not crap out this quickly.  </li>
            <li> i thought it was just that cheap generic one that spun slow and that really led me to get the Norelco, but this one spins just as also, I guess they are just made that</li>
            <li> /&gt;-BLADES DON&#x27;T PULL AT LONG HAIR (not even with long hair even on the very first shave.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to shave as close as my old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Still trying to get a good shave by trying different techniques but after 3 weeks I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> , it gave me a couple shaves less per charge, but in all other respects it was better.</li>
            <li> I find it even more convenient to simply blow on them really hard.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day because i am in the military and require it so much quicker to use then the straight flat ones i am used to it cuts hairs all directions all the time.</li>
            <li> Yes, the closeness of the shave with the new 7340 is equal to my 6618 . . .</li>
            <li> I figured this shaver only cost me about one years supply of the new type razor blades.</li>
            <li> Bought Phillips7340 New Years Eve 2008 online at Future Shop&#x27;s website for sale price of 69.99, reg 94.99.</li>
            <li> And for the price just above the cost of new replacement shaving head.</li>
            <li> same o same o, been using this product for over 30 years, the shave hasn&#x27;t improved that much</li>
            <li> Most of the time they would leave random hairs, or you would go around and around your face so much that your face thought it was a massage.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wished it had was some type of battery meter showing how much power is left in the battery so that it lets us know when it should be charged.</li>
            <li> It was so quiet I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> It works fine and about the price of new blades-what&#x27;s up with blades being so expensive in relation to the whole razor?  </li>
            <li> MAJOR+++ (blades water proof</li>
            <li> NOT THE #1 A MAJOR REASON WHY.</li>
            <li> NOT THE #1 A MAJOR REASON WHY.</li>
            <li> As long as it still gives a decent shave, and it does.</li>
            <li> a decent shaver in a long time.</li>
            <li> I had an older model that lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> , is the recharging time: instead of less than half an hour, it&#x27;s more like 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> and I generally shave every day.</li>
            <li> no suena pero por lo general es un buen producto a un buen precio.&lt;br /&gt;Algo</li>
            <li> This Novelco is very quiet but takes more than 5 minutes to finish the job and the job is not good.</li>
            <li> The razor shaves very close and gets the short stubble as well as the long hairs.  </li>
            <li> early fifties - back to rotary.  </li>
            <li> The stubble is a gritty dust with fairly frequent use, so it disappears on the carpet</li>
            <li> It sounds like it is barely running</li>
            <li> even though the 7340 is cordless, the charging cord is longer on the 7340 and a bit too short for the fixed corded</li>
            <li> I have charged it once so far and have been using it for about 3 weeks on the same charge.  </li>
            <li> Vast improvement over my old model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (if ur batteries are low you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge up like my old shaver, you can just plug it in the wall &amp; run of electricity &amp; it will charge while also running.</li>
            <li> After going from a 10+ year old shaver to this one, it was like starting to shave all over again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I was surprised by how quiet it is.</li>
            <li> The heads barely turn...and I can feel them &#x27;cut&#x27; my beard</li>
            <li> Shaves far closer than I thought possible..</li>
            <li> And I have sensitive skin - the overall quality and \\&quot;ergonomics\\</li>
            <li> Apparently if you leave it in even after fully charge, it degrades the battery.</li>
            <li> I was having problems with old shaver not geting all the wisker, I do not have that problem with this shaver never have any left when I</li>
            <li> It seems to have a little less heft and maybe a little less power than earlier Norelcos, but the shave is certainly excellent.  </li>
            <li> I owned and used a Remington (not rotary heads) and the razor screen had a small tear which cdause cuts and bleeding----the rotary heads make a lot of difference in shaving comfort and it is extremely quiet and easy to clean---I definitely would reommend it&#x27;s purchase</li>
            <li> : While the clippers in the back are still going strong, the blades on the head are soft and only seem to last 20 uses or so before starting to dull; over the next 40-50 uses it gets to the point where hardly anything is done at all, and it tends to grab instead of cut, leading to more burn and redness.</li>
            <li> There seem to have been some subtle changes in the mechanism to make it quieter and easier to clean than my old one.</li>
            <li> I bought the philips norelco 7340 confident on the brands reputation, unfortunately less than six months later it just shut down one day and never started again, after having it checked by the asistance in my country</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day and have thick and quick growing hair.</li>
            <li> since I have a very sensitive face and shave one day in between, I use to soar my face and even cut myself with a standard razor, now I only use my Norelco even on my car!</li>
            <li> My first shave was reduced to about half the time the Braun took.</li>
            <li> I also spent considerable time going back over face and neck areas that left my face very irritated.</li>
            <li> My first selection was a fairly expensive Braun model with the auto clean unit.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;The rotars seem to spin slow, not like a fast acting foil shaver, at first</li>
            <li> I decided to get a new one because a new one costs less than the blades do.</li>
            <li> This product suffers from the genius of some market manager/product designer who spent months trying to find an attractive product for this item regardless of what the package did to the customers temper or blood pressure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaving head pops open for cleaning with running water, green lights tell you when it&#x27;s charging (steady light) and when it&#x27;s completed charging (blinking green lights).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to my trusty old, solid, reliable 6618.</li>
            <li> (another big reason for buying a model like this because my old unit if the battery was low you couldn&#x27;t plug into the wall and use it</li>
            <li> razor is fairly quiet, especially in comparison to my old one.  </li>
            <li> I really never dreamed a electric shaver can give me a decent shave.</li>
            <li> The extra few dollars is well worth the upgrade to the 7340.  </li>
            <li> I had bought my father an expensive electric shaver for christmas which he liked well enough, but he dropped it and it broke.  </li>
            <li> I could&#x27;nt be happier with my purchase - it just shaves very clean around the neck and jaw areas where my previous shaver used to take multiple rounds to clear the beard and I tend to get very little hair there</li>
            <li> Excellent battery life, average cutting ability compared to the other three-headed shavers from Norelco.</li>
            <li> which is spring loaded (easy to take off or on) and dump hair in garbage then rinse under tap with hot or cold water.</li>
            <li> No more giving myself irritated red skin on my neck trying to adequately shave in that tricky area.  </li>
            <li> The third, from China, barely made it to five.</li>
            <li> My old model did that pulled at long hair and it hurt</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this philips shaver******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---So after several charges &amp; recharges, as per manufacturers instructions, I&#x27;m barely getting 3-4 shaves (15 mins max) out of this Norelco.</li>
            <li> That and it was as loud as a leaf blower and took constant ploughing back and forth across my face until it would finally trim my thickish beard.</li>
            <li> First one&#x27;s battery died after a few yrs &amp; then I was using Razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should have expected that so not much of a complaint.</li>
            <li> But if you take a break for a few weeks, and then use the razor again, the performance will be just like the first month&#x27;s usage before your skin gets used to it again.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is so large, since it obviously contains only a tiny motor and a single, tiny cell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t let the battery go all the way down very often</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the new one long enough to assess its length of service, which is my only concern for this product.</li>
            <li> One small surprise was plugging it in right after it \\&quot;died\\&quot; from lack of charge, it would not turn on.</li>
            <li> The local repair shop who has serviced my previous 2 Norelco&#x27;s noted that the new ones aren&#x27;t the quality of the old.  </li>
            <li> I previously used a straight edge razor to shave.  </li>
            <li> My previous shaver is much louder and is not waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Now the after shave rinse to the head assembly keeps things much cleaner without having to disassemble the heads, which was what I previously had to</li>
            <li> - it sounds as if the razors are turning too slow, but I can&#x27;t argue with the results - it does provide a quick, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Washable</li>
            <li> It sounds very weak.&lt;br /&gt;Suspect that impression is from my distant past where I recall much louder electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> The rotary blades are definitely not rotating as fast as the previous models.</li>
            <li> This razor comes with a straight charging cord instead of the far more convenient coiled cords of the past, no charging stand like in the past, and no travel case like in the past.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you buy the one that costs 225.00 it would shave a little closer, but for 225.00 you can buy a whole lot of razor blades.</li>
            <li> Nobody&#x27;s going to bother to disassemble the whole thing and stick a little brush in there.  </li>
            <li> For that reason I actually prefer the older NiCd batteries because I can run them all the way down, and don&#x27;t care about the quicker charge feature of NiMH batteries.  </li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer is a little awkward to open, but cuts very nicely.  </li>
            <li> (HOWEVER i did read a review that said the battery just stops hence stoping the unit when out of power there&#x27;s no slow down noise (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really now quite upset the shaver will  no longer hold a charge,and as always I can&#x27;t get a refund or a replacement,i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item to anyone looking for a dependable product,i have owned this item less than six months!  .</li>
            <li> The only thing that doesn&#x27;t measure up to my other razor is that it lacks a soft travel case.</li>
            <li> and I vacuum it up whenever I vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resorted to using a vacuum cleaner rather than the supplied brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only minor quibble is that sometimes it takes a few passes to get the bit by the base of each jawbone, and it never seems quite perfect.</li>
            <li> last few shavers Ive had were corded only, because I didn&#x27;t like the earlier versions of the rechargeable ones, but after running this new one a few weeks off of the first single charge, I can say I am converted and like the freedom of not being tethered to a wall socket.</li>
            <li> (other models as well clearly have this feature)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (other models as well clearly have this feature)     -Price</li>
            <li> I very convenient use but charging rather long time a little too convenient</li>
            <li> and then I get a new one; method of death typically involves worn out battery or getting smashed in a fall to the floor.  </li>
            <li> Seriously - coming off a fresh overnight charge</li>
            <li> The battery last long considering you are using it for 2 minutes every day, so it will last up to two weeks without charging it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is cheap and nasty and nowhere near as useful as the one on my old Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> My first complaint with this shaver is the battery.</li>
            <li> I have used different razors in my long life from blades to electric.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li> This razor continues to disappoint on a daily basis and I should have replaced it long ago.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see whether battery lasts as long as last model.</li>
            <li> Long battery life been running on one charge since purchase on 11/12/09 now 12/5/09 and a lot of charge left...</li>
            <li> The 6940 would get a 2 star rating from me, and is clearly not on the same level as the 7340.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe Norelco&#x27;s other razors are better, but this one is certainly not very good.</li>
            <li> The replacement models - completely different - apparently have garnered poor reviews - as apparently Philips Norelco has cheapified the entire new product line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t yet allowed it to completely die down before needing to charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are relatively inexpensive and Philips lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> with its OLD heads (at least 5 years old)</li>
            <li> A year and a half ago my old one died, so I bought this item (7340XL).  </li>
            <li> Then leave the head open to air dry.</li>
            <li> This unit is open, rinse, let dry.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is less sensitive it may work well for you.</li>
            <li> After trying a few different blades and aftershaves, and not liking the hassle, I recalled having a Norelco as a young guy in the &#x27;60&#x27;s, and so decided to give one a try.  </li>
            <li> Wished he had received one before he spent all that time shaving with a regular razor for daily upkeep of his beard.</li>
            <li> The batteries last for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> Multiple shaves after single eight hour charge.</li>
            <li> Other users, however, have a different explanation for quiet!</li>
            <li> Today, I had to go back a fourth time and decided to warn other.</li>
            <li> The real question will be how long will it run before the blades become dull, which was always the problem with the remingtons.  </li>
            <li> and he fully anticipates having to buy another in the not too distant future.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that is often misses hairs and you have to go over the area multiple times pressing pretty firmly to remove all the stubborn hairs.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time, too.  </li>
            <li> He has used Philips brand as long as he can remember.  </li>
            <li> Mute, long durability.</li>
            <li> After a few hours charge, I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> This unit seems to operate for a long time on one charge.  </li>
            <li> So long integral adapter, so long</li>
            <li> This machine does cut close, and didn&#x27;t cause me any razor burn, it just takes way to long.  </li>
            <li> Have had no issues with it, and it still holds a charge for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> It catches your skin before it shaves a long hair.</li>
            <li> and it stays charge for an unbleviable long time.</li>
            <li> Normally I consider time spent shaving to be a waste.  </li>
            <li> It lasted almost 3 weeks after the initial charge, which is about 2x as long as my 7825XL was giving me (again as expected, considering the batteries were over 7 years old).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it still works the only problem was the trimmer which ultimately broke down.</li>
            <li> I do not shave daily (retired and don&#x27;t care), but, try to look presentable on heavy social occasions--like going to Costco.</li>
            <li> While it appears to have two LEDs on the front, which I took to mean one LED for \\&quot;charging/charged\\&quot;, and one for \\&quot;needs/low charge\\&quot;, it&#x27;s really just one indicator made to look like two.  </li>
            <li> : Light weight, quiet, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Poor shave, increased time shave to remove stubble, skin irritation, poor battery life, no storage case, poor packaging</li>
            <li> am extremely impressd and would only buy a rotary elcetric shaver of hunting for an electric....</li>
            <li> It comes close to the nose entries and other facial intersections without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> But once I managed to get it out, it has gone above and beyond any other razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> only problem is I used 3 other Norelcos...</li>
            <li> This razor is way above other brands in quality and speed.  </li>
            <li> Whether my hair is dry or damp, it just can&#x27;t seem to cut evenly.</li>
            <li> My previous unit&#x27;s lights at least indicated how much charge I had left, so I could recharge it if I was planning a trip, etc.  </li>
            <li> Rather than multiple LEDs that reveal the battery&#x27;s state of charge, the razor just runs for a bit and then stops dead - always in the middle of a shave.  </li>
            <li> No more blade, hot water, soap, and messy</li>
            <li> After years of using a Norelco Triple Header, ever since my grandfather gave me one when I started shaving late in high school, I switched to a Braun a couple years ago.</li>
            <li> Very close, although not much more close than previous model.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shaver for about half a year, and recently it had caused minor cuts on me twice.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with blades for 20 years but it seems like my blades are wearing out quickly lately and cutting me more frequently.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the blade guard doesn&#x27;t clip low enough to prevent the head from springing up to disgorge its hairy contents in transit.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it shaves closer than my old Remington, but it feels nicer on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Product appears to be a victim of programed obsolescence.  </li>
            <li> The pleasure of using this new shaver was hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> I wipe the shaver body dry, shake it out with the head closed, re-open the head and air dry it.  </li>
            <li> This AM it dropped down into the sink (about the fourth time)</li>
            <li> Even if I had run the battery down, you can shave with the cord as well - something my prior Norelco wouldn&#x27;t do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will have to wait and see if it holds up as well as my former shavers that were Holland manufactured.st battery life you do need to let the batteries run down.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I returned it soon after I bought it because the battery kept running down after only three days or so of use.</li>
            <li> I knew this at the time of purchase, but did not think it would be much of an issue, as i read in a review at the time, that near the end of power time, you could faintly hear the power running low, which you can, but have to be discerning, and when traveling, is not a precise indicator.</li>
            <li> However, it does not have a remaining-power digital timer, which all my previous Norelco shavers had.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s with a typical morning shave of between 3 &amp; 5 minutes &amp; using the trimmer once on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> My last shaver (a Remington micro-screen) gave me two years of continuous service, and my previous one (a Braun) gave me six.</li>
            <li> Was taken aback a little by previous reviewer&#x27;s comment that razor runs out of juice without warning (which, of course hasn&#x27;t happened yet)--am keeping old Norelco charged up just in case</li>
            <li> So you really do not have to let the batteries run down before you charge them, but I still would not constantly keep the charging the batteries.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco for a long time, and decided I needed to replace it due to age, batteries failing, and blades dulling over time.</li>
            <li> I should of sent this mess back.</li>
            <li> so it has popped open a couple of time when carrying this in my bag and made a bit of a mess in the leather pouch</li>
            <li> I suppose soon Philips will eliminate the little cleaning brush, since that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> HAVE OLD NORELCO,AT LEAST 20 YS ,CAN NO LONGER GET IT</li>
            <li> save myself at least seven minutes a day and nearly fifty dollars on month</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the shaver doesn&#x27;t charge and shave at the same time.  </li>
            <li> but since they go well round the edges, I think it should take lesser time to get cleaner shaves for me from now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, and at age 77, I often go for several days without shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that it feels a bit \\&quot;fragile\\&quot;, and plastic cover is flimsy, but I will just be careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> quality not what my husband expected</li>
            <li> It did this once in my travel bag, so now I just empty it of  hair whenever I travel.</li>
            <li> but I had never changed the heads, so that&#x27;s probably to be expected).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the unit is lightweight and does not slip or slide with wet hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m knocking points off my score for this - It&#x27;s not acceptable for an item to only work properly a few months, is it?</li>
            <li> Break in period for skin was minimal.</li>
            <li> Razor is everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> You can only plug it in when the battery is ALMOST dead.</li>
            <li> A heads up that it came so packaged in a plastic carton as to need a sledgehammer, scissors and heavy gloves to get it open lest the plastic rips you to shreds.</li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid the battery-trap, but the AC only model I had was truly a waste and lasted only a few months.  </li>
            <li> The battery finally died and I found out it wouldn&#x27;t run with the cord attached once the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> it is not that what I was expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a way to measure decibels here, but it&#x27;s roughly the equivalent of a fish-tank air supply or a laptop fan motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had they spent the effort.</li>
            <li> I am in the military and I bought this shaver for field use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After using this shaver as a \\&quot;wet shaver\\&quot; for a few months, I have noticed it does not perform well as such.</li>
            <li> what they mean when for this model when they say waterproof just so you understand &amp; clearly states so in the manual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought, as have several previous reviewers that Norelco had slowed the motor down for the sake of noise.</li>
            <li> While it works reasonably well, it has a few serious defects.</li>
            <li> will tell if the razor lasts for a long time or if the battery eventually drives me crazy, but for now at least, I&#x27;m already pleased.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell if the razor lasts for a long time or if the battery eventually drives me crazy, but for now at least, I&#x27;m already pleased.  </li>
            <li> The first few shaves were a bit irritating to my face but the manual asks you to try the product for 21 days in order to get used to it</li>
            <li> My battery life is down to just one shave after only a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very little facial hair</li>
            <li> I could actually hear the blades doing their job on my beard, and with very little motor noise.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have never liked dry shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using regular razors is just annoying, while this one is easy to use and gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hurt like hell, worse than normal razor burn.  </li>
            <li> As with my other shaver, I find that sometimes a bladed razor is needed to catch up on things that get by this</li>
            <li> It maintains performance until it stops abruptly, when it&#x27;s out of juice.  </li>
            <li> other shavers the blades have to be replaced once a year.  </li>
            <li> No adjustments, poor battery life, sounds like a weak, cheap razor.  </li>
            <li> the negative side the razor is delivered bare bones.  </li>
            <li> Extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is not with the shaver itself, but with the excessive price of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I may have to just eat the cost of this disappointment and purchase replacement blades for the Cool Skin.</li>
            <li> use it 5-7 days a week and usually plug it in to charge only once-a-week</li>
            <li> Not sure if you can actually use the razor in the shower</li>
            <li> So, while this one is recharging, the other one is in use.</li>
            <li> I expected at least the same performance and quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> An unfortunate related problem:  Norelco describes the \\&quot;needs charge\\&quot; or \\&quot;low charge\\&quot; indication simply as a \\&quot;charge indicator\\&quot;; hey Norelco, that&#x27;s insufficient English, because it could be taken to mean \\&quot;chargING indicator\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Heads]]at least $5 cheaper than any other source I found, local or on line.</li>
            <li> The little 3 shafts have seals so the unit can get wet.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers commented on the lighter weight than previous models.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Compare with other brand take less than 1 hour recharging time, Philips Norelco need 8 hours to recharge, I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> the blades are now dull on it, the side burn trimmmer needs constant oiling, and it cannot plug in and be used whent</li>
            <li> the blades are now dull on it, the side burn trimmmer needs constant oiling, and it cannot plug in and be used whent</li>
            <li> the disadvantage, the indicator light of power is bad.</li>
            <li> It also seems as fast as any shaver I have used including my expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is the lack of a travel case of some sort.</li>
            <li> And it was a tedious effort to keep it ready to go.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long my luck will hold with its quality, but couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> About the only negative is I wish it had a warning of when to recharge the battery.</li>
            <li> I have seen the error of my ways, repented and returned from the Dark Side.</li>
            <li> I think some of the negative reviews on here, are because they did not give it enough time.  </li>
            <li> Philips/Norelco sees this and does finally respond to me, then i might upgrade this negative review.)</li>
            <li> and I have fairly thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday &amp; have rough stubble</li>
            <li> Despite its lack of loud irritating buzz, it doe the job.</li>
            <li> It was less than half the price of the other one and he loves it.  </li>
            <li> only negative, and it&#x27;s a slight one for me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly thick hair, maybe medium thickness, so you might get half or double depending on your hair.</li>
            <li> This thing works well on my cheeks but as soon as I go down to the neck area none of the hair there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll turn this thing on and let the battery run down and recharge to see if it is a battery memory issue.</li>
            <li> Which one matters because you can run a NiCd battery all the way down without problems, but if you do so to a NiMH</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;d use the side burn trimmer to trim it down before i&#x27;d use the 3 head blades</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I can plug it in the A/C outlet and run it even when the batteries are run down</li>
            <li> -I can plug it in the A/C outlet and run it even when the batteries are run down</li>
            <li> It is an electrical requirement that LiIon batteries shut down before they are dead-dead (like NiCads)</li>
            <li> I will never buy this product unless its price goes down.</li>
            <li> I called customer service about this and was told that when the motor slows down, it&#x27;s time for re-charging.  </li>
            <li> Since the instructions recommend blade replacements every year, I have to see what happens down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive had a lot others before this one, and hands down</li>
            <li> I agree that the quality of Norelco shavers seem to have gone down over the years.</li>
            <li> It is dull, slow and the batteries do not last long.</li>
            <li> He is currently deployed, so he can&#x27;t always plug in or have power, and it is hard to get disposable, so having one he can charge up and not worrying about charging again for a few days is what he needed.</li>
            <li> I been a blade man all my life with thick heavy facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> year and a half of life for a rechargeable battery is thoroughly inadequate.</li>
            <li> The Norelco gives a cleaner shave in less time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened in the past ten years, but I don&#x27;t see myself trying another Philips Norelco shaver for a while.  </li>
            <li> The previous one lasted over 10 years, and I&#x27;ll still use it for trips.</li>
            <li> It seems to need about a minute or less of charging for some reason before it could be used corded.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a braun micromesh electric.</li>
            <li> My previous electronic shaver was Browns.</li>
            <li> my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> Considering I paid less than $35 (on sale), I&#x27;d do it again for that price.  </li>
            <li> I just 10 minutes or less</li>
            <li> my previous 2 Norelco&#x27;s the comfort control setting seemed to affect the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> My previous Norelco had a battery gauge which allowed me to know when to recharge the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Although my face is angular I thought the newer head design would lead to a closer shave and less stubble, this was not the case.</li>
            <li> They promised a 10-day charge, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem going for a week and a half before re-charging.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> It does not shave half as well as my previous shaver did.</li>
            <li> and I have probably an a little less than average beard...</li>
            <li> Always hated using miniscule brush as the only way to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;flip-up head\\&quot; is flimsy and insecure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deff quicker and less messy than a blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After one shave I realized what I had been missing for the previous 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I had a very old Norelco 800 series razor whose battery failed to hold a charge although it would still shave plugged in.  </li>
            <li> went with this one instead of an even cheaper model because the razor-cover-guard thing has little holes in addition to slots.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> I have been using the razor as directed along with a little pre-electric shaving</li>
            <li> It took a little while getting used to</li>
            <li> so me face gets a little hairy before i shave.</li>
            <li> Compared against the cost of shaving with shaving cream and blades, a less expensive option by far.</li>
            <li> and I was not very sure about it when I ordered.  </li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t tug or get caught, but you have to go very slowly around and over multiple times to get</li>
            <li> older Norelco&#x27;s would slow down as their batteries started to fail.</li>
            <li> Have spent lots of money on expensive shavers and when the last one quit I decided to try something cheaper.</li>
            <li> Normally if I waited that long to shave there was always quite a bit of whisker pulling which is painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes few hours to charge but lasts about a week, or you can always plug it in and shave that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have monstrous harsh stubble to take care of.  </li>
            <li> to make it worse, there is no low battery warning.</li>
            <li> The thing just stops dead.  </li>
            <li> not for everyday shaving,it dosent shave close at all.my</li>
            <li> /&gt;-FULL CHARGE DISPLAY ( flashes green when fully charged, BUT does not turn unit off, just indicated when fully charged via the flashing green</li>
            <li> he batteries are dead.</li>
            <li> he batteries are dead.</li>
            <li> For point of comparison, my beard tends to be heavy and course.  </li>
            <li> Wanting not to skimp on something I&#x27;d use everyday for hopefully another 15</li>
            <li> Contacted customer service a few days ago (Nov 12th), explained the problem &amp; they&#x27;ve agreed to send another one out on a return basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is because of the shape of my face being small and narrow which forced me to have to manoeuvre the shaver in various angles.</li>
            <li> I bought one a few days ago as 34.99$, so when now I want to buy another one for my father</li>
            <li> if you have no available AC outlet at the time.</li>
            <li> I use this Norelco shaver everyday.</li>
            <li> sorry I threw out my old Philips</li>
            <li> it still leaves a few hairs on the face.</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought that was the appeal behind this device was that it was faster than traditional methods, no luck with me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No sound maybe betther for my family</li>
            <li> But it takes a few days to let the skin get used to it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t need to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> -- it was never accurate.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get the slow down, it just shuts down.  </li>
            <li> Will probably replace in the near future as I now hate to shave at all due to the amount of time that it takes with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> It was hard to clean and after some time it started smelling bad after all my cleaning attempts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, all other brands seem to suffer from the same condition.  </li>
            <li> Although there is little warning that the battery is dying, you can sense a bit of slow down as a warning.</li>
            <li> I have not used the wet rinse method since the dry clean/shake-out works well and doesn&#x27;t leave the cutting head wet.  </li>
            <li> This thing is usable, but not worth its price in the least.  </li>
            <li> Always hated placing a sharp instrument so close to my jugular in the early early morning, i.e., shaving sucks.</li>
            <li> Requiring 8 hours for a full charge would be annoying if I did a lot of traveling, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I think they slow the motor down to make it quieter.</li>
            <li> As it is, you just have to listen and when the RPMs of the shaving heads slow down noticeably -</li>
            <li> I brought this item for my father who was in desperate need of a new shaving system.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it even reflects badly on Amazon even though someone else provided the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Love.</li>
            <li> As for actual use it is so slow as to be painfully frustrating.</li>
            <li> the past I have owned a few foil shavers and NONE were worth a crap to me.</li>
            <li> The foils on this shaver are so bad they constantly miss long hairs.</li>
            <li> Foil shavers are out, thing of the past for</li>
            <li> but I usually need to shave about once every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> No more wasting my time shaving in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> this model compered to the other four that I have owned inthe pass years fells that the motor is weak has no power</li>
            <li> Crazy 34.99 price made this the bargain of the year so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 and have been using Braun shavers for the past 25 years because I felt they gave a closer shave than Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT IM NOT SURE</li>
            <li> No more cleaning unit refills to buy.  </li>
            <li> Re-assembling this thing is NOT enjoyable.</li>
            <li> No more irritation</li>
            <li> For those of you considering switching from a blade to an electric, be cautioned that no matter how slick the advertising an electric (in my experience) just doesn&#x27;t give quite as close a shave.</li>
            <li> I am only slightly disappointed that this razor operates on battery only and not by cord.</li>
            <li> Nicest Norelco I&#x27;ve had for the past 40 years.  </li>
            <li> Shave close without irritation or my skin breaking out, which was always my problem in the past with electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;-always leaves small patches of hair on your face</li>
            <li> And C, the price I got at Amazon is an unbelievable bargain.</li>
            <li> well I usually shave 4-5 times between charges.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a $100 Braun for the past 6 years.</li>
            <li> , I use it on weekends when I am too lazy to blade shave.</li>
            <li> Been using it for past 2 months already and still works</li>
            <li> not sure how it will hold up.</li>
            <li> complete disappointment to me.</li>
            <li> I have had one just like it for the past 6 years</li>
            <li> He has a very heavy beard and has to shave twice a day.</li>
            <li> but I was a little doubtful about spending so much on replacements.</li>
            <li> when they told me that its inner carching circuit had damaged and it was completely worthless, it was a pretty lousy deal i wont ever buy again form them.</li>
            <li> It seems to leave random long hairs.  </li>
            <li> It stays charged for at least 2 weeks if not more.</li>
            <li> In past experience I got at least 4-5 years service out of one set of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In past experience I got at least 4-5 years service out of one set of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived late as I was not sure what caused the delay.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it was that the packaging was a little difficult to get into initially in order to get the razor.  </li>
            <li> Tough to get tight spaces</li>
            <li> Quality products hard to find today.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delicate heads - any little bump will dent the heads, with even the tiniest dent causing a loud and annoying noise.</li>
            <li> Late teens - rotary.  </li>
            <li> I have been an exclusive Norelco shaver since the late &#x27;50s.</li>
            <li> This makes daily cleaning awkward.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not the least disapointed.</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> Everything I was afraid of came back.  </li>
            <li> It got so bad that I had returned the product for the promised refund a few weeks later.  </li>
            <li> Over a span of 30 years I have owned at least six Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> in all a disappointing purchase, I have gone back to</li>
            <li> I have had this for at least three years and it works well.  </li>
            <li> This issue is probably common on all electric razors and not just this one.  </li>
            <li> As a result, you must move slowly over your face.</li>
            <li> Any longer hairs will pull and you can even hear the rotor speed slow.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably slow.</li>
            <li> it sounds so slow you think it is going to quit on you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the blades did not get really slow slower until the batteries die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard or are looking for a shave that&#x27;s as close as a blade you should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Shaves smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Motor seems slow...</li>
            <li> My beard has very thick and stiff whiskers, but this baby plowed through it like it was nothing.</li>
            <li> He says the razor does not irritate his face at all, and it has saved him from being late a few times!!</li>
            <li> I hate how difficult it is to clean out all of the clippings...</li>
            <li> star for the failure to impress.</li>
            <li> I had a braun, and it started tugging the crap out of my hair, even with a new blade replacement.</li>
            <li> I usually like recent Philips electronics but disappointed with this item.</li>
            <li> and it is next to impossible to shave a beard line with it.</li>
            <li> For a life-long Norelco user, the 7430 is a major disappointment!</li>
            <li> Obviously not a good thing</li>
            <li> This is a process way too complicated and messy for me at this stage in life.  </li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s not as good as razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Every week like clockwork, when this lame little shaver dies on me mid-shave, I find myself glaring at it and am tempted to hurl it across the room!  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin unless I press very hard and repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> Very slow to shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a replacement, and a poor one.</li>
            <li> Worse, the battery just drained and I plugged it in, but it won&#x27;t recharge at all.  </li>
            <li> So the product for me at least was useless.</li>
            <li> They are poorly designed and don&#x27;t grab all the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommendation: Poor, do not buy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When shaving at home, I can even hear my roommate when he starts talking to me two rooms away, as is his annoying penchant, especially now that he can&#x27;t hear the tell-tale roar of the Braun that indicates I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric razors in the past and this has been the worst one.  </li>
            <li> I have tried electric in the past with disappointment</li>
            <li> I hate dry shaving or using cold water when I shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> , I can wash the shavings out rather than using that little annoying brush.</li>
            <li> im sorry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power, it takes longer to shave than it probably should, but you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  </li>
            <li> I still have this as a backup, but the Remington hasn&#x27;t failed yet</li>
            <li> BATTERY SHAVERS ARE LOUSY NO POWER  </li>
            <li> But, the worst part is that often the hinge releases suddenly when the head is opened.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately after using this razor for a while I have come to the conclusion that it is flawed.  </li>
            <li> I called Norelco and unfortunately they do not offer a replacement battery</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor as I had the identical one for 2 years and was time to replace it as the replacement blades were almost as expensive as the razor.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the Braun is in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It has become so expensive.</li>
            <li> However it did not come with a power cord and is completely useless without it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m shaving wrong, if so give your suggestions of how to use the electric razor in the comments below.</li>
            <li> After a few months I throw this crap in the garbage and got a Remington again</li>
            <li> Sad to see them discontinued.</li>
            <li> I am unhappy as to how expensive replacement blades are for my two pricey shavers.  </li>
            <li> The problem is the cutting power is very poor.</li>
            <li> The washable feature and cutting head design have made this product unbeatable.</li>
            <li> If you want quality and aren&#x27;t afraid to spend the money to get it, you should.  </li>
            <li> was it can irritate if i don&#x27;t watch the direction of cutting.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is very difficult.</li>
            <li> Not to bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t include this with the shaver anymore</li>
            <li> I did not think the item was bad just not for me.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.  </li>
            <li> I am on a college budget, and the price shocked me along with reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a safety razor user for years - and a frustrated one at that.  </li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed with this shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve had it a year, I can say I am highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painfully annoying to shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li> Also I hope the charging signal can use another color instead of the annoying blinking.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad experience with this company and I will never do business with them again.  </li>
            <li> and I have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> packaging was horrible, a welded clamshell.  </li>

            <li> Worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have to move it on and on again until my face gets red.the trimmer is awful, it does not shave at all</li>

    <ol>
            <li> As I write this, it is now near the end of June, 2013, and I can honestly say this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  (Am 84 years young and over the decades I&#x27;ve owned &amp;#34;a few&amp;#34; units.)  Can&#x27;t remember exactly, but I&#x27;ve used  this Norelco shaver at least two years, and it just keeps giving me a nice, easy, fast, comfortable shave every other morning.  Using a good electric pre-shave solution is important.  If I wanted to spend more time trying to get a really close shave with the Norelco I could, but I don&#x27;t.  I quickly get a relatively close shave with the Norelco, and then finish by applying a post-shave ointment and using a popular multiple-blade razor.  It&#x27;s fast and it works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 60s now, and over the years I&#x27;ve bounced around, as far as shaving.  Late teens - rotary.  Twenties - blade.  Thirties - beard with blade and/or rotary around the edges.  Forties/early fifties - back to rotary.  Rest of fifties - foil.  In all cases, off and on, I would often get a few ingrown hair white pustules on the front of the chin, under the lower lip - very aggravating.  And at my age and beard condition, I seemed to be getting more of them with the foil shavers - I think mostly because I had to push hard and repeat with the foil to get a sufficiently close shave.  This Philips/Norelco rotary cuts well with a lighter touch (still not blade smooth), and with an after shave gel followup, I am happy with the end result.  An adequately smooth shave, in about 2/3 the time, with a lot fewer ingrowns.  It took me 3 or 4 shaves, to adjust my touch.  BTW, I do like the water cleanup - it&#x27;s real easy.  I researched on-line for about 4-6 hours, and decided on this product after reading several reviews, and comparing prices.  I just could not justify going up towards $100 (or beyond) for shaving.  I think replacement blades are in the $30s, and recommended once a year - if I continue to get this result, it will be worth it.  Oh, the battery does stay full charge (or near) till the very end, and then shuts down - no indicator.  I don&#x27;t mind.  When I get near 30 minutes usage, I just let it run out, and then put it on charge - for about 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I been a blade man all my life with thick heavy facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have owned a few foil shavers and NONE were worth a crap to me. I had name brand ones (Braun for one).&lt;br /&gt;Back around Christmas 2009 I bought this battery operated rotary shaver, pretty much out of boredum, it was just $9.95, I fig what the heck, I never owned a rotary shaver before, it very cheap and generic, to my amazement, It gave a pretty good shave. So much so that I then did some research on a good reviewed shaver at a decent price and then went out and bought this Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rotary shaver does an Amazing job!  Its very good and very close a shave to the skin. I really never dreamed a electric shaver can give me a decent shave. It&#x27;s deff quicker and less messy than a blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely impressd and would only buy a rotary elcetric shaver of hunting for an electric....Foil shavers are out, thing of the past for me.&lt;br /&gt;The rotars seem to spin slow, not like a fast acting foil shaver, at first i thought it was just that cheap generic one that spun slow and that really led me to get the Norelco, but this one spins just as also, I guess they are just made that way.&lt;br /&gt;I choice Norelco because of all the reviews on amazon, Norelco overwhelimingly received much better reviews of other brands. You wont be disappointed with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It takes few hours to charge but lasts about a week, or you can always plug it in and shave that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome shave!</li>
            <li> This Norelco replaces my last one whose battery gave way after years of service.  I was surprised with how much lighter the new razor is, and -- unlike the last one -- will work with a cord even when the battery needs charging.  I also like the smaller size of the charging gizmo.  The Norelco gives a clean shave and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new razor!  He says that it works great and saves him a lot of time.  It was his first real razor, so we have nothing to compare it to, but nonetheless, he would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to shave with my old stick razors after using this.  Yes, its a good shave but I usually need to shave about once every two weeks.  With this, since I don&#x27;t get close enough, I&#x27;m up to about once a week.  I know that that&#x27;s not often but if I need to shave two times as often, clearly there&#x27;s an issue here.</li>
            <li> Well I am a brown guy, and I got think facial hair !  This thing works well on my cheeks but as soon as I go down to the neck area none of the hair there gets cut.  Its the design shape, I move it around for a bit around the area but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  So after this I have to use a razor to shave that part.</li>
            <li> Be careful when buying this product if your face has many irregularities, or if one of your hairs grow in a manner contrary or very attached to face this razor may do little for you unless you plan to use a shaving razor blade double standard thing Norelco does not recommend, in addition to submitting the face of an adaptation process that may never work for the cost involved does not seem so great option</li>
            <li> Have used older model Norelco shavers for many years.  This one beats them all, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothest save I ever had.[[ASIN:B001AJ8YGC Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first to switch over to an electric razor seeing as I had never used one. However, I am more than satisfied with my purchase of the Phillips Norelco Razor. It works great; gives a close, smooth shave; and is very easy and convenient to use! It was also a very reasonable price and was shipped to me very quickly. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable, great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in November of 2009.  It replaced a Remington cordless that did a good job, but the battery died on.  I have owned several electric razors in the past and this has been the worst one.  It seems to leave random long hairs.  I am always having to go back and pluck out hairs on my neck, chin, upper lip, etc.  On the plus side, the battery life is good.  I have recently bought a new razor that is more expensive and, hopefully will do a better job.</li>
            <li> i have used blades  for 50 years in my old age i have become lazy to shave every day ,so i decided to buy an electric shaver .i love my new shaver i am getting close shaves like blades it is fast and easy to carry any where took about 2 weeks to adjust ,i will never go back to blades ,thank you norelco.</li>
            <li> It was hard to clean and after some time it started smelling bad after all my cleaning attempts.So I stopped using it</li>
            <li> I am unhappy as to how expensive replacement blades are for my two pricey shavers.  So I said, lets try a much cheaper shaver.  Results.  This shaver is so quiet I can not do other things like watch TV, or hear the sound on my computer.  It also seems as fast as any shaver I have used including my expensive ones.  Seems to shave plenty close as well.</li>
            <li> So far the highlight of this shaver has been the battery life. I shave every day and the charge lasted all week. I get a close shave and I have fairly thick facial hair. I am very pleased with this model. I had a low end Philips Norelco shave for the last few years (in the $40 range) and this one at $60 (when I ordered it) seems to be far superior.</li>
            <li> I have been using an older Norelco shaver for the last 3 years and it was doing a great job until about Feb/Mar time frame. I was contemplating replacing the razor heads but they were costing around $35 for the three heads - its like GPS map updates cost as much as newer models (with some good online deals, of course) but I was a little doubtful about spending so much on replacements. As soon as I saw this model on sale for around $38 (after rebates), I jumped on it and just tried it today morning for the first time. I could&#x27;nt be happier with my purchase - it just shaves very clean around the neck and jaw areas where my previous shaver used to take multiple rounds to clear the beard and I tend to get very little hair there and I generally shave every day. Considering that fact, this shaver seemed much more smooth after just one swipe. The motor seems pretty powerful and the blades seem to conform well to the contours of the face. It may be because of the new blades too but since they go well round the edges, I think it should take lesser time to get cleaner shaves for me from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy - I hope the battery lasts as long as the previous model did - one charge for about 2-3 weeks of everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> I have the old Norelco which it was about 5-7 yrs old. This new 7340 has better clean shaving and the battery can hold longer. For the price $30 and its performance, go for it if you need one. It does not come with a bag.</li>
            <li> Never used a rotary shaver before so did not know what to expect. Does not seem to shave as close as my old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Still trying to get a good shave by trying different techniques but after 3 weeks I&#x27;m not impressed. Probably would not buy again.</li>
            <li> i got a Philips Norelco for christmas but it doesnt look exactly like the one in the picture but i had a really big beard and now i dont thanks the philips norelco i got, so if this is a different model im sorry but i figure there all about the same and mine works really well and got surprisingly closer then what i thought it would and this is coming from a guy who usually uses the pro glide razors, but the only reason i made the switch was from cartridge to electric was it was more cost efficient</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas. It being cordless was ideal for him. He is currently deployed, so he can&#x27;t always plug in or have power, and it is hard to get disposable, so having one he can charge up and not worrying about charging again for a few days is what he needed. It gives him a close shave, plus it comes with a pop up trimmer to help with having a clean edge. It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My man is HAPPY, HAPPY AND HAPPY!! Glad I purchased it at Amazon.com. I will be sure to purchase more items. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year</li>
            <li> I might have given this 5 stars except for the packaging.  After many years in retail I am fully aware of the importance of eye appeal and discouraging shop lifters.  This product suffers from the genius of some market manager/product designer who spent months trying to find an attractive product for this item regardless of what the package did to the customers temper or blood pressure.  It took an hour to get the thing open.  my finger was nearly cut off trying to tear the clear plastic over the razor.  This cost Norelco one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is unaccustomed to razors; it has been about six years since I shaved.  I have used different razors in my long life from blades to electric.  As another reviewer has pointed out it takes time for your skin to get used to a razor.  I am willing to give this another week.  It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power, it takes longer to shave than it probably should, but you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  I have used more expensive razors and they have not done better.  If I forgive the packaging problem, I would recomend this Norelco to anyone who feels the need to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever find a lady willing to test the results of my shave, perhaps the star count will go to five, or it may go to one.  I see the prospect of my writing anouther review based on this test as non-existant.&lt;br /&gt;but miracles do happen, so they say.  Keep checking.</li>
            <li> I replaced my 10 year old Norelco which has been indestructible. This unit seems to have the same quality. Provides a close shave. The clipper cleans up sideburns well. Charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as a gift. He is VERY particular and He was happy with the shaver. The battery life is good, it replenishes quickly and gives him a nice shave. Would reccomend it .</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve purchased.  I read many reviews and decided Norelco seemed the safest bet.  I chose this model because a slightly more expensive model seemed like it had the best reviews, and this razor is virtually identical for $30 less with only a couple differences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Charge time of 8 hours instead of 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Stated on the box that it can be used as a corded razor.  Reviews stated the more expensive one could be used corded, but it didn&#x27;t say so on the box.  So I felt safer getting this cheaper model and it saved a bit of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with this one instead of an even cheaper model because the razor-cover-guard thing has little holes in addition to slots.  The holes are supposed to create a closer shave.  I wouldn&#x27;t know since this is my first, but decided a closer but still safe and easy shave is best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered shaving a hassle, but not anymore.  I can shave while in front of my computer reading articles on the internet.  Wonderful.  Normally I consider time spent shaving to be a waste.  And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin unless I press very hard and repeatedly.  Or maybe that was just the first times.  I haven&#x27;t had any irritation at all after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says to run water over the blades to clean them.  I find it even more convenient to simply blow on them really hard.  The stubble is a gritty dust with fairly frequent use, so it disappears on the carpet and I vacuum it up whenever I vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best purchases I have made.  No more wasting my time shaving in the mirror.  No more giving myself irritated red skin on my neck trying to adequately shave in that tricky area.  Yes, it works on my neck.  It also catches all of the shavings, so you could shave while driving to work if you wanted to.  But since it is no hassle, I don&#x27;t see why I would wait until the last minute to do it.  I keep it by my computer, and shave whenever I happen to notice a bit of stubble.</li>
            <li> Gives me a really good close shave although I&#x27;m Asian and I only need to use it like every 2 days so I don&#x27;t have monstrous harsh stubble to take care of.  I bought it a month ago and it&#x27;s still working on the same initial charge.  Product doesn&#x27;t feel or sound powerful but it does the job great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good product, ok for soft use. but the making material seems a little cheap and may easy to break. But to this price, it&#x27;s fair.</li>
            <li> After using several weeks, I like my purchase. The price was reasonable for its features that I like including a cleaner close shave, running quiet, and ability to clean it under running hot water. I have used Noelco shavers for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> I used to have norelco 2 rotary shaver for 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;was [...] bucks but very good and durable.&lt;br /&gt;I think recent norelco shavers seems to develop contrary.&lt;br /&gt;Old norelco are better than recent norelco shavers.....&lt;br /&gt;This shaver takes a lot of minute to shave and it&#x27;s not close shave.&lt;br /&gt;After I shave with this shaver, I was looked like being not shaved for a day.</li>
            <li> Tried to give myself a decently close shave with this thing to my folly.  hurt like hell, worse than normal razor burn.  I had a little travel shaver that did a better job... and the blade the catches the hairs for a closer shave mostly just yanks on them, but doesn&#x27;t cause a closer shave.  This thing is usable, but not worth its price in the least.  I wanted something I could shave with every day, and this is not it.</li>
            <li> Great item, best shave in years. Battery life is incredible, received on 9/7 and have not charged battery yet.</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco in 35 years. I still keep the first one as a cord-only backup, since its battery died.  Dropped and broke the second after 10-12 years. Tried a Remington foil razor for price, but sent it back for refund after three weeks:  way too noisy, shaved well but missed longer hairs on neck.  Selected 7340 for Norelco quality, corded/cordless operation and  low to mid-range price.  So far it shaves very well and it quietest of any Noreclo I have had.  It seems to have a little less heft and maybe a little less power than earlier Norelcos, but the shave is certainly excellent.  I would have liked one-hour rather than eight-hour recharge, but that is only a minor drawback.  I am happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> The three heads in the shaver can be washed and are easy to use. The side trimmer for finer cuts does not hold up well when held close to the skin. Overall a good product save the side trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because Walmart quit carying the blades for my 10 year old R845. I agree with others that this thing is quiet, much more quiet than the old Ramington, but that&#x27;s because the old Remington was performing work. My beard appears to be too much for this razor. It sounds like it is barely running and the results indicate the same. My two minute shave has gone to 5 minutes for the same results. I&#x27;ll turn this thing on and let the battery run down and recharge to see if it is a battery memory issue. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve found blades for the old razor on amazon and I&#x27;m going that route. This razor is an excellent choice for regifting this season. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/13. I still have this as a backup, but the Remington hasn&#x27;t failed yet and I haven&#x27;t had the heart to regift the Phillips.</li>
            <li> For a life-long Norelco user, the 7430 is a major disappointment! I bought this to replace a very old Norelco Reflex Plus 6618, thinking that rather than just buy new heads for the old one, it was time to replace the entire shaver. I expected at least the same performance and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;improvements\\&quot; in the 7340 compared to the 6618 are backward steps in engineering and convenience. The new \\&quot;flip-up head\\&quot; is flimsy and insecure. It often just falls off when trying to do a quick partial cleaning during shaving. Cleaning is very difficult. I&#x27;ve resorted to using a vacuum cleaner rather than the supplied brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that the Norelco engineers&#x27; attempts to improve a very good shaver have failed. I&#x27;ve gone back to my trusty old, solid, reliable 6618. Yes, the closeness of the shave with the new 7340 is equal to my 6618 . . . with its OLD heads (at least 5 years old). I&#x27;m now going to do what I should have done originally and just put new heads on my trusty old 6618.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product is excellent for the price. It stays charged for at least 2 weeks if not more. It is very light in your hand and does an excellent job, and is not heavy in you hand. Some may find it a little light(made more out of plastic than metal) but I find it to be Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> This is my fourth rechargeable or battery-powered Norelco shaver. The first, manufactured in Germany, lasted 19 years. The second, a Japanese product, lasted 11. The third, from China, barely made it to five. This one seems better constructed than No. 3, so I hope to get a decade of use out of it. The quality of shaves has so far (four months) been first-rate.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco electric razors for 30 years. This was a replacement, and a poor one. The razor has almost no power. It runs like my last one did when it was out of charge. As a result, you must move slowly over your face. Any longer hairs will pull and you can even hear the rotor speed slow. Also, you will have to cover the same territory 2 or 3 times to get a decent shave. Cheap and not worth the anguish.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver on a regular basis for more than 30 years. I figured this shaver only cost me about one years supply of the new type razor blades. It burned me every time I needed to buy them.  They used to be an incidental expense item....no more!&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco 7340 Shaver from Amazon has been a new revelation in shaving for me.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, and at age 77, I often go for several days without shaving. Now this new shaver is so convenient...with no cord....full charge lasts more than a week....you clean it under a running faucet........and you can shave with it while you are doing many other morning duties.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves without any surface pressure, and it leaves no discomfort where you have shaved.  It comes close to the nose entries and other facial intersections without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Just a few minutes, without water, lather, splashing, and rinsing gets me off to a great start to the day.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I made the move to the Philips Norelco 7340 Mens Shaver,.... and at $49.50 I&#x27;ll be saving money on razor blades for years.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Norelco user for many years.  However, this is the first one I&#x27;ve owned that has irritated my skin.  I don&#x27;t think the exterior metal is as smooth as it once was.  I can make a direct comparison because my older Norelco just feels smoother.  I&#x27;ve given lots of time for my skin to adjust to the new one, but I need to replace this one.  Also, Norelco really needs to put a low-battery indicator on this model.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelcos for decades, and love the shaves they give.  A year and a half ago my old one died, so I bought this item (7340XL).  It shaves well, and cleans up nicely in running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, when the battery drains, it stops without warning.  Worse, the battery just drained and I plugged it in, but it won&#x27;t recharge at all.  I tried several sockets, and even another Norelco charger, but it won&#x27;t recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year and a half of life for a rechargeable battery is thoroughly inadequate.</li>
            <li> NORELCO is the best!!!! If it will give an old man a close shave  and is very easy to use (and it does and is) then it will give everyone the best shave going. It was delivered promptly and was a very good price.  You can&#x27;t beat a deal like that!!</li>
            <li> No issues to report.  Quick charge, holds a charge for 4-5 days and provides a good shave.  Easy to hold while shaving a relatively quiet.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the price.  I tend never to buy the cheapest model or the most expensive model, something in-between seems to work good for me.  Easy to charge and use.  The newer models now come with nickel metal-hydride batterys instead of the older Ni-cads.  This eliminates the memory effect of Ni-cads.  So you really do not have to let the batteries run down before you charge them, but I still would not constantly keep the charging the batteries.  I charge mine once a week or so and the batteries hold a full charge from week to week.  In the beginning it did take about a month for my skin and the shaver to adjust to my skin.  I previously used a straight edge razor to shave.  Pull your skin tight with your free hand and shave away, this makes your whiskers stand up straight and easier for the shaver to cut.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is extremely quiet and lightweight.  The shavings heads do not turn as fast as one may think, but they do a great job at the speed they turn at.  Cleaning is easy, rinse under hot water after each shave.  Once a month give it a good cleaning according to the enclosed directions and do not forget to oil the heads with a drop of mineral oil.  I just got tired of shaving the old fashioned way with the shaving cream the shaver, the nicks and cuts when using a new razor, the time it took to get a good shave.  With the Norelco 7340XL I can shave anywhere, while surfing on the net, talking on the phone, watching TV, whatever.  I do NOT recommend shaving while driving, this could be hazardous to your health!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver, great shaver and it won&#x27;t bust your wallet.</li>
            <li> An excellent shaving system. Full functional and easy to use with good quality. A super gun for man.</li>
            <li> I had another Norelco razor which I was satisfied with, but it was 10 years old, time for a new one. I thought I would spend more and get a better product. This razor is quieter but it takes longer to get a good shave. I think they slow the motor down to make it quieter. One feature I like is the charge indicator light which blinks when the razor is charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with the product, but do not think it is worth the extra cost, the basic model would probably do just fine.</li>
            <li> BATTERY SHAVERS ARE LOUSY NO POWER  HAVE OLD NORELCO,AT LEAST 20 YS ,CAN NO LONGER GET IT FIXED,110 VOLTS POWERFULL  CHINESE IS A NO  NO</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for a couple of weeks now and would buy it again.  No electric razor shaves half as good as a blade but this one is far better than the remington razor it replaced.  It does not leave skin burn.  I always use a blade when it is important, a electric razor is ok for work etc.</li>
            <li> The electric raiser is working very well.  I get a good shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge for about 9 days.  That more than meets my needs.  It is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> I amm very pleased with this product and the price. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is there isn&#x27;&#x27;t a battery level indicator. But no problem, i just remember when i charged it last.</li>
            <li> great arrived as described, charged the battery full, have used for two weeks w/o recharging, after a few days got a really close shave.  this is the quietest shaver i have ever seen.  LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I purchase it at price $29.9, very good for the price! Also the produce is excellent, you will never regret!</li>
            <li> It is a simple and excellent product. It can be washable directly under the tap!&lt;br /&gt;Up to now, the battery duration is good enough. (more than 5 shaves without a recharge)</li>
            <li> I bought this Razor for my dad for his birthday. I am on a college budget, and the price shocked me along with reviews so I bought it. He is loving the new razor and I am loving a not-empty wallet!</li>
            <li> I already owned an Norelco shaver but it was old and needed new blades.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely cheaper to buy a new one.  The rinse in water is a great feature.  Very happy with it and I use the old one for overnight stays.</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco shaver, and I think it is an excellent buy. My last one cost $130 and lasted 10 years until the battery would no longer hold a charge. This one cost only $40 and shaves every bit as well as my last one. I&#x27;ll admit that it feels a bit \\&quot;fragile\\&quot;, and plastic cover is flimsy, but I will just be careful not to drop it. Requiring 8 hours for a full charge would be annoying if I did a lot of traveling, but I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not troubled by it being manufactured in China. I have been using it daily for two months. There seem to have been some subtle changes in the mechanism to make it quieter and easier to clean than my old one.</li>
            <li> Not much to say -- it shaves and shaves nicely.  It&#x27;s comfortable to use and does a good job.  I bought this to replace a similar older model when its battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> The 6940 would get a 2 star rating from me, and is clearly not on the same level as the 7340.  If you&#x27;re on a budget I&#x27;d still pass on the 6940.  The extra few dollars is well worth the upgrade to the 7340.  My face was really soar with the 6940, but not with the 7340.  The upgraded heads on the 7340 made a huge difference.  Another bummer with the 6940 is the short cord... even though the 7340 is cordless, the charging cord is longer on the 7340 and a bit too short for the fixed corded 6940.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both sound much more quite then my older Norelcos I had.  The quite sound makes it seem like they are slow, but don&#x27;t let that fool you the 7340 works great.  I also recommend spending the couple of extra dollars over the other 7310XL and get the better heads.  I believe that is the only difference besides color between those two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the 7340 has worked out great, and is the best overall value Norelco Shaver.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and it still has only been charged once.  I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day and have thick and quick growing hair.</li>
            <li> I just want a razor that worked, this seems to fit the bill okay -- does a decent job.  I had a braun, and it started tugging the crap out of my hair, even with a new blade replacement. This razor doesn&#x27;t tug or get caught, but you have to go very slowly around and over multiple times to get all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Nice Close Shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  Very slow to shave&lt;br /&gt;  Leaves stragglers&lt;br /&gt;  Tough to get tight spaces</li>
            <li> I have very little facial hair so this little device works perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using regular razors is just annoying, while this one is easy to use and gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy, just use tap water.</li>
            <li> I have been an exclusive Norelco shaver since the late &#x27;50s. this is by far the poorest example. It is dull, slow and the batteries do not last long. to make it worse, there is no low battery warning. The thing just stops dead.  This is giant bother when camping. I don&#x27;t know why it is so large, since it obviously contains only a tiny motor and a single, tiny cell. (1.2 volts)... I think I will replace it soon. Probably with another brand.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use, quiet, lightweight and easy to clean. A good product for the price.</li>
            <li> We fell for the hype in advertisement.  quality not what my husband expected and he fully anticipates having to buy another in the not too distant future.  won&#x27;t be a philips.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this shaver works.  I doesn&#x27;t beat a blade, but is much better than a much more expensive Remington that I was using.  I also like the fact that it is very quiet.</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;THis is my second shaver..First one&#x27;s battery died after a few yrs &amp; then I was using Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I was again tempted to buy my second shaver. I was surprised when I put it on charge - it was already fully charged...Not sure If I rxd a returned piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for 3 days.. Find the shave to be noiseless but skin irritation is present &amp; shave is not close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am getting convinced that it was a returned piece afterall.&lt;br /&gt;ANyway to check if this is a used piece rxd from Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WIll definitely publish some more data once I use the shaver for a month or so..</li>
            <li> I was very suprised by this shaver.  I have replaced an older Norelco with this one and I was not very sure about it when I ordered.  It is very good and excatly what I want.  I have charged it once so far and have been using it for about 3 weeks on the same charge.  It is very quiet when running and shaves close.  What more could anyone ask for?</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 2nd electric razor to keep at my Florida home so I would not have take my razor from my MA home. This 7340 shaves well, holds a charge and fits nicely in my hand. The trimmer feature allows me to keep my moustache the right length. The only thing that doesn&#x27;t measure up to my other razor is that it lacks a soft travel case.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver from Amazon.com.The item was delivered on time.Its a very good quality of shaver and the rechargeable battery keeps charge for days. I would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this razor holds a charge.  I get several shaves from one charge.  This razor gives me a shave that feels closer than that of my last Norelco.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the cleaning instructions to rinse under a faucet. But, it really worked. So overall it gives a close shave, holds a charge for several shaves, and is easy to clean.  Not to bad.</li>
            <li> As for my opinion and experience, this model is pretty simple and works good only on very light 1-day facial hair. Also, in my case blades got stuck several times.&lt;br /&gt;For problem facial hair I recommend Norelco 1200 series, otherwise (even with Norelco 1100 series) you probably will not be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my brother and he loves it. It&#x27;s quite and effective, also good for your money.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for over 5 months, and I have charged it 3 times, INCLUDING the first charge right out of the box.  Granted, I only use it every other day, but that is much better than the piece of junk this razor replaced.  I like the opening head that can be emptied right into a trash can and then washed with water.  Only negative is the lack of a travel case of some sort.</li>
            <li> I found this shaver to be quite nice for the price. The blades are quite easy on your skin and do a great job of getting those hard to reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this shaver is the back trimmer which I found to be quite flimsy. The last Norelco shaver I had, the back trimmer was much more durable and did a much better job.</li>
            <li> Instead of having a head which can be cleanly removed at the push of a button this shaver head is on a hinge.  This makes daily cleaning awkward. But, the worst part is that often the hinge releases suddenly when the head is opened.  The head then goes crashing down onto the sink which will easily damage the cutters.  This AM it dropped down into the sink (about the fourth time) and I had all the cutter pieces scattered all over the sink.  They are now completely mixed up and the blade components are now mismatched which is going to make them wear out much sooner.  I am old enough to have owned many electric shavers over the years and I can say without a doubt this is the most aggravating one I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving system us a very lightweight reliable shaver.  It holds a charge for almost a week of my husband using it daily on his face.  The only negative is that is often misses hairs and you have to go over the area multiple times pressing pretty firmly to remove all the stubborn hairs.  This is likely the case with most razors though.  Overall I am pleased with the purchase (especially the price) and would likely buy again.</li>
            <li> This unit shaves fast, close and quietly.  It holds a charge for a long time, too.  This is the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Have spent lots of money on expensive shavers and when the last one quit I decided to try something cheaper. This razor works just as good as the expensive ones and I&#x27;m not the least disapointed. There is nothing negative to say. Plug it in. Charge it and shave. Don&#x27;t know how long it will last but when it goes I will buy another one just like it.</li>
            <li> I guess getting what you pay for certainly applies to this razor. I&#x27;ve had the expensive models from Panasonic, Braun and Norelco and didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money so this time around I went cheap and I&#x27;m suffering for it.&lt;br /&gt;This razor feels cheaply made, not exactly flimsy but there&#x27;s nothing screaming quality either. As for actual use it is so slow as to be painfully frustrating. Unbelievably slow. Seriously - coming off a fresh overnight charge it sounds so slow you think it is going to quit on you.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with this thing takes FOREVER. Over and over the same areas and still hairs get missed. The trimmer is cheap and nasty and nowhere near as useful as the one on my old Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. Will probably replace in the near future as I now hate to shave at all due to the amount of time that it takes with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that it is slow?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add that the people giving this razor good reviews have either never shaved with a high-quality electric razor or they have a different beard type than I do. This razor continues to disappoint on a daily basis and I should have replaced it long ago.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric  shavers. Mostly Norelco. This one is by far the best one I have ever owned. I am able to get a very close shave in a minimum of time. I would recommend this Model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Penny</li>
            <li> Have been buying Norelco shavers for years. Purchased the 7340 in May, 2009, and it is good value for money and does the job. However, it does not have a remaining-power digital timer, which all my previous Norelco shavers had. I knew this at the time of purchase, but did not think it would be much of an issue, as i read in a review at the time, that near the end of power time, you could faintly hear the power running low, which you can, but have to be discerning, and when traveling, is not a precise indicator. In the light of experience, in future, i would not purchase a shaver without a remaining-power timer feature.</li>
            <li> if you have a soft skin like i do this is not for you. look at the picture titled \\&quot;it&#x27;s burning\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this razor! I am a college student and there are times where I do not have time to stand in front of the mirror waiting until my whole face is shaved, instead I can move around and know it is doing exactly what I expect it to do. This razor leaves my face clean, without any facial hair at all. I would definitely recommend this item to a friend.</li>
            <li> I buy it for myself, its cheap and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Its my first time to use electric shaver and its of course, more comfortable than Manual.</li>
            <li> Love it shaves very well. i really love the fact that when it needs cleaning i can simply wash it. no need to do anything else</li>
            <li> this model compered to the other four that I have owned inthe pass years fells that the motor is weak has no power</li>
            <li> I will make an exception in regards to the performance of this razor.  There is absolutely nothing about it that could be improved, and no, I am not a shill for Norelco, simply a satisfied user with a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about 45 days back and used it. It was not giving good shave since starting but I thought as it is said in the booklet it may take some time to adjust to my face. But even after using for such a long time it never gives clean shave also if you try too hard to get clean shave you will get rashes all over your face. So not at all worth spending money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Norelco shavers for years.  They last 3-5 years and then I get a new one; method of death typically involves worn out battery or getting smashed in a fall to the floor.  This is the latest one that I bought a couple weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve been the least satisfied with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it lacks a \\&quot;needs charge\\&quot; indicator.  While it appears to have two LEDs on the front, which I took to mean one LED for \\&quot;charging/charged\\&quot;, and one for \\&quot;needs/low charge\\&quot;, it&#x27;s really just one indicator made to look like two.  An unfortunate related problem:  Norelco describes the \\&quot;needs charge\\&quot; or \\&quot;low charge\\&quot; indication simply as a \\&quot;charge indicator\\&quot;; hey Norelco, that&#x27;s insufficient English, because it could be taken to mean \\&quot;chargING indicator\\&quot;.  When I was looking at buying one of these, I didn&#x27;t realize that \\&quot;charge indicator\\&quot; in the description meant what it actually means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, Norelco&#x27;s descriptions of their shavers no longer tell you what kind of battery is inside.  Is it NiCd or NiMH?  Which one matters because you can run a NiCd battery all the way down without problems, but if you do so to a NiMH you are actually damaging it.  Repeated deep discharges of NiMH will kill it.  For that reason I actually prefer the older NiCd batteries because I can run them all the way down, and don&#x27;t care about the quicker charge feature of NiMH batteries.  The only indication that it&#x27;s probably a NiCd is that the manual says \\&quot;battery performance is best if you recharge only when the batteries are (almost) completely empty.\\&quot;  Here&#x27;s hoping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I may very well keep this shaver.  I&#x27;m on the fence and trying to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> I had been using the same corded Norelco shaver since 1995 with the original blades and decided it was time for a change to the 21st century.  I saw this Norelco 7340 model online and purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the shaver works well.  Particularly impressive are its quietness and the ability to rinse it out after each use.  My previous shaver is much louder and is not waterproof.  With the &#x27;95 model, I was only able to brush out what I could after each shave; it required periodic disassembly of the heads to thoroughly clean it.  Note that the directions of this model also call for periodic disassembly of the heads for cleaning and lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say that the shaver gives a closer shave than the 1995 model, but I can&#x27;t say that I have found that to be the case.  I do like the pivoting heads, as opposed to the fixed heads on the &#x27;95 model.  They seem to ease navigating the contours of the face.  If you let your beard go for a number of days, you will still need a razor.  As with my other shaver, I find that sometimes a bladed razor is needed to catch up on things that get by this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts for about 10 shaves.  It maintains performance until it stops abruptly, when it&#x27;s out of juice.  I just plug it in, turn it back on, and finish my shave.  Then I allow it to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved the case from my old shaver (which I still have as a backup) and will use that when traveling.  Too bad they don&#x27;t include this with the shaver anymore; it is very handy.</li>
            <li> I brought this item for my father who was in desperate need of a new shaving system.  He has used Philips brand as long as he can remember.  He has had the product already for a month and he loves it.  Smooth shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li> although i got it at a very reduced price,it still wasnt worth it.  its alright for 3 day old stubble.  not for everyday shaving,it dosent shave close at all.my last shaver was a remington  titanium it was superb for any stubble</li>
            <li> shaves close! holds charge.  need to have much longer  to see if reliable.</li>
            <li> He utilizado rasuradoras el&amp;eacute;ctricas de marca Brawm y Panasonic pero esta es la primera rotatoria y despu&amp;eacute;s de 3 semanas de utilizarla a&amp;uacute;n me causa ciertas molestias en la parte de mi cuello pero cuando tengo el rostro bien limpio y seco no hay problemas.&lt;br /&gt;Cuando esta encendida parece como de mentiras ya que casi no suena pero por lo general es un buen producto a un buen precio.&lt;br /&gt;Algo en desventaja es que tiene cierta dificultad para removerle la barba de la parte interior cuando se desea dejarla bien limpia.</li>
            <li> Nice Shaver, it&#x27;s my first one ever xD, so I&#x27;m not the one to compare between shavers, but I find the results enough satisfying for a shave, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get every hair cut, but overall does a great work, leaves my face pretty soft and with no irritation at all, plus pretty nice price &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Replaces another Norelco lift &amp; cut razor that died after 14 years (only my second one since I began shaving)and this one is much lighter, quieter, more comfortable. This model doesn&#x27;t tear longer hairs out, making it much more humane. I guess there have been improvements over the last decade. Rinsing under faucet to clean is a Godsend. Always hated using miniscule brush as the only way to keep clean. Very close, although not much more close than previous model. Let&#x27;s see whether battery lasts as long as last model. Crazy 34.99 price made this the bargain of the year so far. Don&#x27;t hesitate if you find this model for cheap.</li>
            <li> This shaver has definitely lived up the billing!  I have had multiple value shavers that were ok, but took a long time to give an only decent shave.  When I tried this one, the first thing I noticed was how quiet it was.  Even though it sounds like it&#x27;s barely running, it has given a nice, close shave on my face.  And it only takes 1 or 2 passes at my face to be able to do that.  Before, one side of my neck had always left hairs when any electric shavers tried to shave them.  I was surprised and happy when this razor left my neck very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first battery charge has lasted for weeks now without the need for another charge.  It&#x27;s also easy to hold for my somewhat small hands.  The only bad thing about it was that the packaging was a little difficult to get into initially in order to get the razor.  But once I managed to get it out, it has gone above and beyond any other razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> one of the best shaver i have ever owned in the past 45 years. i would buy another one if needed.it also gives me the close&#x27;s shave in such short time.</li>
            <li> I did not think the item was bad just not for me. I received this item in good condition with brand new retail packaging, and the plastic in the packaging was difficult to get through. A pair of scissors was needed. Mostly though the one complaint I have about it was it needed an 8 hour charge before use. Should have expected that so not much of a complaint. I am African_American and this did not manage to give me a clean shave. So the product for me at least was useless. I am not saying it wont work for you as it did shave, just not well enough for me. Not the first razor I have tried and was hoping this would work when I ordered it. the sub $100 range of razors do not seem to work for me. back to the blade.</li>
            <li> If you need a good shaver at a good price---this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> It was a gift, and he liked the shaver becouse it&#x27;s rechargeable... thank you very much. Recommended 100%</li>
            <li> It seems Norelco is using a lower power output in this model in comparision to earlier models. The rotary blades are definitely not rotating as fast as the previous models. I guess for $40 bucks you cann&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who is in the Marines. He said that once he learned how to use it that he loves it. He has a very heavy beard and has to shave twice a day. This irritates his facial skin. He says the razor does not irritate his face at all, and it has saved him from being late a few times!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after using this razor for a while I have come to the conclusion that it is flawed.  It consistently leaves my face with untrimmed whiskers.  At first I thought I wasn&#x27;t using it properly but I&#x27;ve now realized the problem lies with the foils on the razor.  They are poorly designed and don&#x27;t grab all the whiskers.  I had an old Gillette razor from 1999 that shaved my face better than this does and that is not an exaggeration. I end up shaving the rest of my whiskers with a regular razor which defeats the purpose of using an electric shaver.  Stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> We bought a new Norelco shaver because the replacement blades for the \\&quot;very old\\&quot; Norelco shaver could not be found in our local stores.  To buy a new shaver was a great choice for us.  These shavers last forever, this is our second in 15 years and they do a great job shaving!  This razor is easy to hold in your hand, easy to clean, cordless, rechargeable, and does a great job shaving my husbands face.</li>
            <li> I bought the shaver from Best Buy for $52 three weeks ago. I&#x27;m 63 and have been using Braun shavers for the past 25 years because I felt they gave a closer shave than Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco, which although is made in China, seems very well made. It is remarkably quiet and comfortable, a pleasure to use. After three weeks of getting my beard accustomed to the shaver I can say it seems to shave reasonably close and gets all the hairs - something my Braun had a problem with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just completed a test, shaving half my face with the Norelco, half with my old Braun (not in the best shape), and after judging my beard the next morning, the Norelco easily won. It&#x27;s not as close as a blade - by 5 p.m I notice a stubble, but considering how easy it is to use (and washable) I really can&#x27;t complain! an excellent shaver at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[It&#x27;s now Dec. 2010 - 2 years later - and it shaves every bit as good as when I bought it. I use it every day and I have probably an a little less than average beard... what can I say, it&#x27;s a great shaver!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.... It&#x27;s now Jan. 2016 and the battery will only hold enough charge for 1 shave. I called Norelco and unfortunately they do not offer a replacement battery so I&#x27;ll have to use the cord... That&#x27;s a shame because the shaver still works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philco Razor for A Christmas.  I can&#x27;t rate on performance, but I can rate the transaction on Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;As every purchase I have made, this one is no diffirent to the outstanding service, prices and &#x27;free shipping&#x27;.  You just can&#x27;t beat Amazon for quality products at competitive prices.</li>
            <li> Bought Phillips7340 New Years Eve 2008 online at Future Shop&#x27;s website for sale price of 69.99, reg 94.99. I woulda bought it out of the US which woulda been cheaper but shipping cost &amp; time delivery factor did not make it worth it and I live an hour away from the US border so i didn&#x27;t bother to drive (GAS$).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Shaver is Better than my old Remington R842.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips HQ 7340 Electric Shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;-LIGHTWEIGHT (lighter than my old model, not that weight was ever an issue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-BLADES DON&#x27;T PULL AT LONG HAIR (not even with long hair even on the very first shave. My old model did that pulled at long hair and it hurt so i&#x27;d use the side burn trimmer to trim it down before i&#x27;d use the 3 head blades, this model DOES NOT PULL AT THE HAIR AT ALL, Big +  superior blades/heads)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-VERY QUIET RUNNING (i never found noise an issue with my old model, but i will say the sound of this 1 when fully charged sounds similar to that of my old shaver when it was winding down on battery power, so it&#x27;s very misleading you think when you first use it that it&#x27;s low on juice NOT SO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-NICE GRIPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-CLEANING VERY EASY!!! MAJOR+++ (blades water proof, charging unit are waterproof sealed so to clean it basically pop the head which is spring loaded (easy to take off or on) and dump hair in garbage then rinse under tap with hot or cold water. Then leave the head open to air dry. Makes it SO EASY TO CLEAN. Vast improvement over my old model.&lt;br /&gt; *** WARNING!!!!! DO NOT USE IN SHOWER OR SHAVE WHILE DRENCHED WITH WATER! NOT FOR USE IN SHOWER!! **** this model says waterproof because the blades are waterproof to corrosion &amp; the battery unite is water sealed FOR RISNING ONLY! IN THE TAP...IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE SUBMERGED IN WATER!!!that what they mean when for this model when they say waterproof just so you understand &amp; clearly states so in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- GOOD BATTERY++ (Seems to have very good battery life done at least 9 shaves since first charge of 8 hours and still running, have not charged it a second time yet. Used it on the 30th Dec now Jan.14th,09. The manual claims 35 min of continual shaving or 10 days worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-BATTERY RECHARGEABLE OR WALL PLUG IN (if ur batteries are low you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge up like my old shaver, you can just plug it in the wall &amp; run of electricity &amp; it will charge while also running. (another big reason for buying a model like this because my old unit if the battery was low you couldn&#x27;t plug into the wall and use it, it would just try and charge and u would drain battery by trying to use it while plugged in) (HOWEVER i did read a review that said the battery just stops hence stoping the unit when out of power there&#x27;s no slow down noise (as i mentioned it already runs that quiet) I DON&#x27;T ACTUALLY KNOW YET.....i haven&#x27;t had to charge it a second time yet so I can&#x27;t say for sure but that is what another user had posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-FULL CHARGE DISPLAY ( flashes green when fully charged, BUT does not turn unit off, just indicated when fully charged via the flashing green light.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- HEAD MOVEMENT (the heads flex to the countour of ur face because not only do the blades push in but the triagular part the head is in flexes down.....not a biggy but some razors don&#x27;t have that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-According to it automatic selection of voltage 120/220 worldwide voltage although I have yet to try it out and i thought i read somewhere u need some type of adapter.

But I only somewhat feel that way most part I think it&#x27;s designed and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes i feel i have to do extra looking around my face to make sure i&#x27;ve got all the hair , but i think it&#x27;s more its more my face adjusting.......because right from day 1 it has had a smooth quality shave it really does.&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the side burn trimmer u pushed up out instead of releasing , cuz normally u go with the grain of the hair but if u choose to go opposite the release way it will push up &amp; close (not a big deal but noteable). Also i do sorta feel the side burn trimmer on my old model was better than this one. But it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The heads/blades are like 57.99 to replace in Can. Unless u can find a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I can&#x27;t really call it a con but it&#x27;s worth mentioning....the overall size of the unit is prob 2 inches longer than my old unit and because it is a leathery Norelco case it JUST fits into it, some people have said it does not fit into there old case. Worth mentioning. ALSO this unit does not come with a case so you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you wanna call it a con it&#x27;s made in China .....but then again what isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Cord has a bulky power unit on it which is a pain in the @$$ if u wanna store it in ur case.

My now 2nd shaver Phillips 7340 i like better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that an electric razor gives as good a shave as a blade and it is certainly more convenient. This razor goes forever it seems without a recharging.</li>
            <li> The razor works great. Started to use as soon as it came. Long battery life been running on one charge since purchase on 11/12/09 now 12/5/09 and a lot of charge left...</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart a little over a year ago. Although it didn&#x27;t provide a close shave (it&#x27;s electric after all), it was very convenient and got the job done. My only advice would be to take good care of it! I dropped mine 5 ft from above the ground and it shattered everywhere! It was beyond repair. Aside from that, the shaver was great and it was nice being able to rinse it off with water for a fast cleaning!</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality product at a decent price.  Works real well.</li>
            <li> During the summer I shaved off my beard of many years and began the search for an electric razor.  My first selection was a fairly expensive Braun model with the auto clean unit. I could live with the auto clean refills ( about 1 every 6 weeks at $10.00 a pop) but the shave was not that clean particularly along the neck.  I tried for three months and thought there had to be something better.  I read the reviews here and was convinced to try the Norelco 7340.  I was pleasantly surprised with the close, clean shave, including the neck area.  Also, it is very easy to clean - just pop the head cover open and rinse with water.  No more cleaning unit refills to buy.  The razor is surprisingly quiet and I get done much faster than with my Braun. For point of comparison, my beard tends to be heavy and course.  This shaver gives me a clean, close and comfortable shave at a very reasonable price.  I paid $38.00 from one of the vendors featured on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When you need a highly effective razor, but do not want to spend 50 dollars, this is very suitable.Mute, long durability.You only need 35 dollars, a good deal!</li>
            <li> I had been using the same razor my entire life that finally died after nearly 15 years of good use.  Wanting not to skimp on something I&#x27;d use everyday for hopefully another 15+ years, I decided to spend a little more and get the 7340.  Now, every morning, I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is fairly quiet, especially in comparison to my old one.  The blades give me a good clean shave and the adjustable heads make it easy to get around the chin and other areas of the face.  The retractable trimmer is very handy for trimming sideburns or really long hairs.  And cleaning is very easy to just open the top and run it under tap water.  And removing the heads (for deeper cleaning) is also easy rather than some of the more complicated ones I&#x27;ve seen.  The battery will last for days at a time, sometimes even a couple weeks, so it saves from bringing a charger for travel. (To comment on a previous review, I find it best to run the battery out before charging rather than leaving it plugged in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, in comparison to some of the other razors out there, this ends up being a great deal.  I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it still works as good as new.  I&#x27;d highley recommend this to anyone looking for a great value from an electric razor.</li>
            <li> When my decade-old Norelco triple header&#x27;s battery began to indicate it was no longer able to provide the necessary power, I began looking for a replacement.  I am very conservative, and just wanted as close to the same thing which served me so well for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  1.  It is lighter, making things a bit easier as I age, though some might say not as sturdy.  2. The heads are held in place better than one of the more expensive models, giving - I feel - more control.  3.  The trimmer, though seemingly lighter in construction, actually does a better job than my previous unit.  4. I don&#x27;t generate much in the way of whiskers, so the deeper \\&quot;reservoir\\&quot; holds many days worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  1 . What&#x27;s the point of the lights?  My previous unit&#x27;s lights at least indicated how much charge I had left, so I could recharge it if I was planning a trip, etc.  I don&#x27;t need a light to tell me I have the unit turned on.  2. The spring/hinge is less sturdy than the older model, meaning I have to take care not to dispose of the head along with the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> good ~ It&#x60;s very beautiful! I like it very much, he is very practical every day I very convenient use but charging rather long time a little too convenient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several days now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I&#x27;ve been using remington shavers for years (both the rotary &amp; screen style).  The Norelco gives a cleaner shave in less time.  The real question will be how long will it run before the blades become dull, which was always the problem with the remingtons.  Even so, the remingtons were never this good new out of the box.  Because it was only $38, I give this a full 5 stars for the performance/value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/7/2013:  I&#x27;m still using this shaver after 2 years.  Still using the original blades and it&#x27;s working great.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco 5601X for almost 10 years, worked great and never needed to do much more than clean it and change the blades when they got dull.  After a while, I decided to upgrade to the 7340XL.  Now that I&#x27;ve had it a year, I can say I am highly disappointed.  This razor seems very underpowered even when fully charged, and although I do not have a heavy beard, it takes a long time to get a clean shave.  This is such a problem that I am bringing back the old 5601X into service and will replace the blades and use it as my primary shaver again.  I&#x27;m not sure what happened in the past ten years, but I don&#x27;t see myself trying another Philips Norelco shaver for a while.  This one&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the product and it arrived very quickly.  I felt the price was very fair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting for the price. The shave is really close but not razor shave. You also have to give your skin two weeks or so to adapt. I would buy it again. Much faster than shaving.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how light and quiet this Norelco 7340 men&#x27;s shaver is. It also cuts close and efficiently and can be cleaned with water.  My only complaint is that the blade guard doesn&#x27;t clip low enough to prevent the head from springing up to disgorge its hairy contents in transit. It did this once in my travel bag, so now I just empty it of  hair whenever I travel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product, for two key reasons. First, it simply doesn&#x27;t provide a quality shave. I spend so much time going over the same area that I might as well just use a blade. Second, the top part of the shaver falls apart EVERY TIME I travel with it. Even when I wrap it in something in my luggage, the top pops off, and the parts-- there are 7-8 pieces-- fall out. Re-assembling this thing is NOT enjoyable. I suggest that you select another product.</li>
            <li> same o same o, been using this product for over 30 years, the shave hasn&#x27;t improved that much but, the material to making it has, today it&#x27;s all plastic compared to the old ones where metal was predominate.</li>
            <li> Having a Norelco razor for many years with excellent results, I first tried to find a replacement battery as it had reached the end of life.  Little did I know that you have to be a technician to replace the battery - a bummer and very foolish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I began the search for a replacement razor - going over many reviews on many sites of many different models.  I decided on this one for the price point AND the quality claimed by the reviewers.  They were not wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet, charges quickly and the charge lasts at least a week of shaving as I charge every Sunday after carrying it many times for a week on the road.  The shave is excellent and the feel of the unit is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for the value and price point!</li>
            <li> great shaver I get one of closet shaves. I have had it over a month I and have not had to recharge it yet.</li>
            <li> This is the second Norelco razor I&#x27;ve owned.  The first lasted many years and finally died.  This razor works well but does not provide quite as good a shave as my first.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to have the power or rpm that my first one had.  However, one has to consider that the first razor did cost twice as much as this one.</li>
            <li> Always hated placing a sharp instrument so close to my jugular in the early early morning, i.e., shaving sucks. But I have tried many electric razors with limited success. Most of the time they would leave random hairs, or you would go around and around your face so much that your face thought it was a massage. But this Norelco is actually doing a great job... clean, fast, no pulling or missing misc hairs. My last electric was a Braun, which was okay, but I expected so much more for the money. And it was a tedious effort to keep it ready to go. The Norelco is still working on its first charge, (over a month ago), and still shaving strong. Not sure how long my luck will hold with its quality, but couldn&#x27;t beat the price. Only con is no battery charge indicator. (Oh did I mention that its extremely quiet...)</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor as I had the identical one for 2 years and was time to replace it as the replacement blades were almost as expensive as the razor.&lt;br /&gt;When the razor arrived, I began removing it from the carton.  The cord was wrapped in a cardboard sleeve.  As I began pulling the cord out, it snapped in half.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I was able to use the old cord I had saved.&lt;br /&gt;Shoddy workmanship on part of Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelcos for years and each model just seems to get better and beter. This shaver gives me the fastest and closest shave yet.</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco for a long time, and decided I needed to replace it due to age, batteries failing, and blades dulling over time. This razor was reasonably priced, holds charge a long time, cuts better, and is much quieter than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I Recently purchased this item and am really impressed with the results that I have achieved.  I have been using the razor as directed along with a little pre-electric shaving tonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resulting shave is very close and without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I save myself at least seven minutes a day and nearly fifty dollars on month (gilette razor cartridges) with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second electric razor, the first being a Panasonic that did not work well.  I imagine that the reason why this razor is only 49.99 is because money was saved in production by way of the materials used in construction.  The $78-$200 units that were on display at my local store seemed to be heavier; made from stronger blends of plastic and metal.  They also came with more significant charging stations and accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, I cannot imagine that the performance of the more expensive units justify spending nearly double what this razor costs.  This is a no frills, all business razor that performs as well as my Gilette Pro Glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best grooming investment I have made in some time.</li>
            <li> I waited 6 months to review the Norelco 7340.  I am extremely pleased.  It replaced my &gt;10 year old Norelco.  It is unbelievably quiet.  I have yet to charge the battery (used ~twice a week for &gt;6 months), so the battery life is excellent.  Oh yeah, it shaves great too.  As to those who complain that they can&#x27;t predict the battery dying like the old NiCad battery models, the Lithium Ion battery in the new models is a vast improvement.  It is an electrical requirement that LiIon batteries shut down before they are dead-dead (like NiCads) so you don&#x27;t get the slow down, it just shuts down.  I doubt that you could really tell the difference with this shaver it is so quiet.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent shaver and a well designed piece of electronics.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco razor. The previous one lasted over 10 years, and I&#x27;ll still use it for trips. The two downsides, compared to my previous one, is that there isn&#x27;t a good way to see if it needs charging, and it doesn&#x27;t come with a good travel case. On the brightside, it&#x27;s low-cost, light-weight, and the charge lasts 4ever. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still reliable after a year.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews here, but after using the 7340 for a month, I love it. My 7825XL lasted over 7 years until the on/off button broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7340 is much lighter and quieter than my old 7825XL. Those are both GOOD things! As long as it still gives a decent shave, and it does. It was pretty amazing, actually, that such a quiet, light thing could shave so well. Much better than my 7825XL was doing (but I had never changed the heads, so that&#x27;s probably to be expected). It lasted almost 3 weeks after the initial charge, which is about 2x as long as my 7825XL was giving me (again as expected, considering the batteries were over 7 years old).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative, and it&#x27;s a slight one for me, is the recharging time: instead of less than half an hour, it&#x27;s more like 6-8 hours. That&#x27;s really a non-issue for me, but maybe it matters to some. One small surprise was plugging it in right after it \\&quot;died\\&quot; from lack of charge, it would not turn on. It seems to need about a minute or less of charging for some reason before it could be used corded. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m completely pleased with my purchase, and I can use the carrying case (such as it is) that came with my 7825XL.</li>
            <li> Battery does not seem to give enough power, doesn&#x27;t feel strong, though it Feels like it gives a close shave</li>
            <li> At age 62 I&#x27;ve been shaving for many years. Most of those years have been with a Norelco rechargable razor.  Never before would I expect as close a shave as I&#x27;d get with a conventional razor (Good News, Bic etc). This is by far the best Electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had (7340). And for the price just above the cost of new replacement shaving head. It&#x27;s certainly the best razor deal and closest shave ever!! I&#x27;m not one to praise new products however this time I must make an exception.  Buy it!! You&#x27;ll not regret it!  Eddie S.</li>
            <li> After going from a 10+ year old shaver to this one, it was like starting to shave all over again.  The pleasure of using this new shaver was hard to describe.  My old shaver had me tethered to an electrical outlet since the batteries were so worn out.  Now I have new freedom to walk around the house shaving.  Even more fun, I can wash the shavings out rather than using that little annoying brush. More freedom!  And, boy, does it shave close!  I have had Norelco&#x27;s for about 30 years and I have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> After over thirty years of wearing a full beard, I decided it was time for a change.  First, I went to a Remington beard trimmer.  (See my review).  It was very good for a stubble effect, but then I thought I&#x27;d go the full clean-shaved route.  After trying a few different blades and aftershaves, and not liking the hassle, I recalled having a Norelco as a young guy in the &#x27;60&#x27;s, and so decided to give one a try.  I&#x27;m very glad I did.  This model gives me a close shave, and without much irritation.  It is very quiet, and is easy to clean.  It&#x27;s ergonomically designed, and is very comfortable to hold.  It holds the charge for quite some time.  Upon inspection, one can tell that it is skillfully engineered and well-manufactured.  It should be; after all, Norelco has been around for decades.  Amazon&#x27;s good price was a plus.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with blades for 20 years but it seems like my blades are wearing out quickly lately and cutting me more frequently.  I have tried electric in the past with disappointment but I&#x27;m keeping this one.  The first few shaves were a bit irritating to my face but the manual asks you to try the product for 21 days in order to get used to it so I did this.  It took about 1.5 weeks for me to get used to the razor and I think it will take a few months to really be comfortable with it.  It does shave as close a blade but requires practice to shave quickly and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the unit is lightweight and does not slip or slide with wet hands.  Cleanup is very easy and only requires water.  The battery life is good and charge lasted about 10-12 shaves. The battery ran out mid shave but I plugged the charger right in and finished shaving.  I like the fact that the blades did not get really slow slower until the batteries die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using Lectric Shave prior to shaving and an aftershave product when you are done.  For those considering this product or the 7310 the difference is that this razor has better blades.</li>
            <li> You get a good, close shave with this without my skin getting irritated. It feels very durable and was worth the money to get a good shaver.</li>
            <li> My face had already got &#x27;used&#x27; to a rotary, I managed to acquire an ancient (12 yrs old?) norelco &amp; had been using that for several weeks. Even so I was amazed at the speed &amp; quality of this products shave, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more. I shave everyday &amp; have rough stubble, I use the Remington face saver powder to help the Norelco glide across my skin. Anyone interested in an affordable, easy &amp; quiet shave should buy this Norelco 7340.  ******It&#x27;s September 7th &amp; I still haven&#x27;t re-charged it. The first 8/9 hour charge has lasted 10 days plus. That&#x27;s with a typical morning shave of between 3 &amp; 5 minutes &amp; using the trimmer once on the back of my neck. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this philips shaver******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---So after several charges &amp; recharges, as per manufacturers instructions, I&#x27;m barely getting 3-4 shaves (15 mins max) out of this Norelco. Contacted customer service a few days ago (Nov 12th), explained the problem &amp; they&#x27;ve agreed to send another one out on a return basis. I&#x27;m knocking points off my score for this - It&#x27;s not acceptable for an item to only work properly a few months, is it? I hope this new&#x27;un lasts longer. Regards---</li>
            <li> Pros: Long battery life, cheap($35), and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not a super smooth shave, razor burn, feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details: I had a Panasonic Foil shaver(older version of this one [..]).  After two years the battery finally died.  I really liked it, and it gave a great shave for a low cost.  But, I kind of wanted to try a Norelco again and this one was $15 less than the Panasonic(I&#x27;m too cheap).  Bad idea.  Everything I was afraid of came back.  If I miss a day of shaving, it feels like my hair is being ripped off my face.  It&#x27;s painfully annoying to shave with this razor.  My old Panasonic was great, and always gave me a great share.  This one will leave my neck/under chin all red and irritated.  And, it&#x27;s not even a good shave for the pain.  Spend the extra $15 and get a nice foil shaver that will still not break the bank, but not break your face.</li>
            <li> I started realizing my old razor wasn&#x27;t doing the job. To replace the heads would cost about the same price and I&#x27;d still have an old battery. When this arrived, it was about the smoothest and closest shave I&#x27;ll had in years. Everything works great on it. About the only negative is I wish it had a warning of when to recharge the battery. (May even be in the directions). But for the price, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product--have used a 5000 series Norelco for ~20 yrs still works but wanted a backup. Never even changed cutters, never needed new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the new one, so far, is improved and cost $40. Can&#x27;t imagine that a $240 razor can be 6X better.</li>
            <li> This was my first electrical razor and I didn&#x27;t like it. As recommended by philips, I used it for a month before coming to any conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes more time than you would take if you use a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, shave is not close enough and leaves hairs at some places. So, finally you end up using the manual razor to clean those places.</li>
            <li> Was weary switching from straight razor, am SO happy I did.  I&#x27;ll never go back to razor cuts ever again. Break in period for skin was minimal. Value for the price sets this electric apart, no need to spend 100&#x27;s of dollars. Go with this one first</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how quiet this thing is. I was previously using a braun micromesh electric. One that I bought on the cheap side something like 5 years ago. Needless to say, the Braun is in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, gentlemen, there is nothing better than this razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric razors and this one works the best for me. I can shave my whole face in about 2 minutes, and it cuts very close. I bought this razor 4 years ago, and was still using that one until last week. The original blades lasted 4 years and still cut very well. I decided to get a new one because a new one costs less than the blades do. Even so, after 4 years the older razor still cuts fine. If you are looking for a high-quality, cheap, durable razor- this is the one.</li>
            <li> Got this shaver as a gift for Christmas so this is my first day really using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never owned an electric shaver before so I&#x27;m not too savy on what it should and shouldn&#x27;t be able to do. Compared to my old method of shaving (disposable razors) the shave I got from this is just as close, I can&#x27;t tell the difference. However, it took considerably longer to complete the process as compared to a disposable that I only have to swipe a few times. I&#x27;m not sure if it is because of the shape of my face being small and narrow which forced me to have to manoeuvre the shaver in various angles. I&#x27;ve also read that I need to use it for a couple times and the shave will get better in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to remember to update this review in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Edit from 5/24/09:&lt;br /&gt;While my initial experience with this razor was very positive, after the first week I started to notice that the quality of the shave it gave was deteriorating rapidly.  It got so bad that I had returned the product for the promised refund a few weeks later.  I have since found another electric razor (the Remington MS2-390, a non-rotary shaver) that&#x27;s suited my needs much better.&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor two days ago, after extensively poring over the reviews of every electric razor in its price range ($80 and below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with this one, and boy am I glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is adequately constructed (for the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get a piece of solid iron).  I like that it&#x27;s light.  I don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s plastic, or made in China (since everything is these days).  The features are fine; I had a Remington a couple years back that had a battery charge indicator and -- surprise! -- it was never accurate.  Why pay an extra $40 or $50 for a case and a battery indicator that doesn&#x27;t work?  The only feature I wish it had would be pure-corded operation; I would rather this model were twenty dollars cheaper and had no battery, but for this head assembly that&#x27;s not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding shave quality, the usual comment on most electrics is \\&quot;well, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.\\&quot;  I suppose that&#x27;s true--if I shave twice with a Quattro, once with the grain and once against, and don&#x27;t mind that I&#x27;ll cut gouges in my face and irritate my skin so much I can&#x27;t stand shaving more than every other day, then yes, I could get closer with a blade.  On the other hand, even after just two days&#x27; use (so during the adjustment period) with the Norelco 7340 I can get a shave that&#x27;s just as close (feels perfectly smooth and passes the \\&quot;my girlfriend will let me rub her face with mine\\&quot; test) but that actually lets me shave every day.  Advantage: Norelco.  It takes some extra attention to the jaw line, which is always a challenge with my beard, and to the throat, which isn&#x27;t completely perfect, but at least in my own experience I would never complain about the quality of this shave.  That goes double when you realize I would not be able to shave this close with a razor on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell if the razor lasts for a long time or if the battery eventually drives me crazy, but for now at least, I&#x27;m already pleased.  And I have another 2.6 weeks for the shave quality to get better and better.o the throat, which isn&#x27;t completely perfect, but at least in my own experience I would never complain about the quality of this shave.

            <li> nothing shaves as close as a blade but this is okay on the days you don&#x27;t want to scrape your face.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  Maybe if you buy the one that costs 225.00 it would shave a little closer, but for 225.00 you can buy a whole lot of razor blades.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  Granted, I don&#x27;t use it that often because I&#x27;m not a hairy individual, but works well when I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used another electric razor like this before but this one seems to work as advertised.  I like the fact that you just rinse out the product after each use to keep it clean.  My shave doesn&#x27;t seem much closer than my old electric razor but it&#x27;s okay.  I don&#x27;t know that any kind of electric product can do as well as a regular blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a happy Norelco user for 30 years.  When my 6863XL finally died (unable to use even replacement batteries), I bought the 7340XL, expecting that it would be a lot better than the 6863XL after a decade of techological development.  NOT!  Norelco removed the transformer from the body into the cord, but failed to use that space for more battery/longer life.  Instead, the running time is pathetically short!  Rather than multiple LEDs that reveal the battery&#x27;s state of charge, the razor just runs for a bit and then stops dead - always in the middle of a shave.  Every week like clockwork, when this lame little shaver dies on me mid-shave, I find myself glaring at it and am tempted to hurl it across the room!  It is incredible to me that Norelco would intentionally make the shaving experience worse, presumably to increase profits.  Despite my deeply ingrained allegiance to Norelco, I&#x27;ve vowed to buy my next razor from someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve rated this razor 2 stars because it is very quiet, which I like.  Other users, however, have a different explanation for quiet!</li>
            <li> Product works very well. Shaves very close, and so far is holding its charge for about 6 days of shaving.</li>
            <li> great value, i have been using electrics for 30+ years. went from norelco to remington the last time. glad i bought this one. it does excellent.</li>
            <li> I usually like recent Philips electronics but disappointed with this item. The problem is the cutting power is very poor. My previous electronic shaver was Browns. It did not take more than 3 minutes to finish the job but was very noisy and I decided to shop a quiet model. This Novelco is very quiet but takes more than 5 minutes to finish the job and the job is not good. The battery life is good but does not seem strong enough. I tried using A/C power but still shaving was not good.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this unit needs more shaving ability. The size is also pretty big and weight is not light.[[ASIN:B001AJ8YGC Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
            <li> I had a very old Norelco 800 series razor whose battery failed to hold a charge although it would still shave plugged in.  In searching for an inexpensive razor I came back to Norelco.  The model I was looking at had a review that said the only difference between it and this one, besides $30-$40, was the charging time. So I  went with the cheaper one.  Other reviewers commented on the lighter weight than previous models.  They are right, it is not as substanial feeling.  However, as long as it works and lasts, I am satisfied with a light weight model.  The one issue most have with it is the lack of an battery life indicator.  This has not been a problem.  The first charge has lasted over a month. Since I shave where I keep the charger, it should never be an issue.  I just carry the charger with me when I travel. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a carry case is also not an issue for me; however, the cap could fit a bit tighter. It shaves best on dry skin.  If you want a wet/dry shaver, this is not for you.  The quality of the shave is better than with my older razor and it does better on my neck hairs. I will admit the shave is not as smooth as some reviewer seem to want, but for me it is fine. For the money it is an excellent razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 7, 2010 --I have now used this razor for several months.  I have gotten used to the lightweight.  The shave is still good,  So far each charge lasts about a month.  Since I travel with the charger, this has never been a problem.  Although there is little warning that the battery is dying, you can sense a bit of slow down as a warning. I am still pleased wth the razor.</li>
            <li> I have used the shaver for a couple of weeks. It was so quiet I was very surprised. It cuts very well and is a much faster shave then my previous shaver. I am very pleased and I got it at a great price too.</li>
            <li> Have only used this from Amazon for about a week. Was fully charged when received. Was taken aback a little by previous reviewer&#x27;s comment that razor runs out of juice without warning (which, of course hasn&#x27;t happened yet)--am keeping old Norelco charged up just in case this happens at \\&quot;half-shave!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Over a span of 30 years I have owned at least six Norelco shavers. All have provided years of dependable service but the 7300 series is the best yet.  The washable feature and cutting head design have made this product unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Shaves closer and faster than my Braun.</li>
            <li> Certainly not the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought, but it is good for the price I paid.  It&#x27;s lightweight, which is good, except that&#x27;s mostly due to the cheap plastic construction.  It does provide a good shave, but it gives no warning when it is low on battery power. It just stops completely.  Considering I paid less than $35 (on sale), I&#x27;d do it again for that price.  If you want quality and aren&#x27;t afraid to spend the money to get it, you should.  If you just need a good close shave at a low price without any fancy bells and whistles, this is for you.</li>
            <li> It has become so expensive. I bought one a few days ago as 34.99$, so when now I want to buy another one for my father, however I found the price become almost 58$. I cannot bear this! I will never buy this product unless its price goes down.</li>
            <li> At first, I was not sure about buying a machine like this online, but now I think i will srart buying everything online.</li>
            <li> Razor is everything I expected.  I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in 30+ years.</li>
            <li> I have this shaver for use in my second home, very close shave that does what it says it does.  No hassles just shave and rinses clean everytime.</li>
            <li> I have had several Norelcos over my 30+ year shaving career, and its not stretching it to say this is the best yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I was surprised by how quiet it is. I could actually hear the blades doing their job on my beard, and with very little motor noise. I thought, as have several previous reviewers that Norelco had slowed the motor down for the sake of noise. I was happily relieved by Norelco&#x27;s tech support who said that the motor has not been slowed. They told me that all norelco&#x27;s have always run at 2000 RPMS, and that the motor has been updated with the new \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; to reduce the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave was a dream - a very close comfortable shave provided by the new HQ8 type heads, which is as good as it gets for a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple weeks, I gave it the ultimate \\&quot;4 days without a shave\\&quot; test. Normally if I waited that long to shave there was always quite a bit of whisker pulling which is painful. My beard has very thick and stiff whiskers, but this baby plowed through it like it was nothing. There was no pulling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last few shavers Ive had were corded only, because I didn&#x27;t like the earlier versions of the rechargeable ones, but after running this new one a few weeks off of the first single charge, I can say I am converted and like the freedom of not being tethered to a wall socket. The first time the battery ran out, and the shaver stopped, I plugged it in, and it ran full speed for the rest of the shave, nulike the older rechargeable types that had to be charged fully to run at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about getting this shaver because you like Norelco&#x27;s but have doubts, dont worry, you will love it!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it shaves closer than my old Remington, but it feels nicer on the skin.  Noise level about the same.  Automatic worldwide voltage.  I&#x27;ve been recharging every 7 to 10 days.  On/off button easy to press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was horrible, a welded clamshell.  Used a box cutter, scratched a finger while pulling it out.  It takes some effort to attach and remove the charging cord.  Charging cord is not coiled.  The wall plug is ok, not as big as others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I got it for my birthday on July and it is the best gift ever, since I have a very sensitive face and shave one day in between, I use to soar my face and even cut myself with a standard razor, now I only use my Norelco even on my car! I just 10 minutes or less I have a clean non soar, nor red face! I have charged it only 4 times since July 30th, the battery lasts a lot! It is amazing that I can use it a whole month (15 times or more per month) and it is like new.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this razor as it reaches the whole face, it shaves fast and good.</li>
            <li> This shaver has the better HQ-8 heads as compared to the 7310.&lt;br /&gt;The heads cost almost as much as I paid for the entire shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works great but don&#x27;t leave home without the cord/charger&lt;br /&gt;because the battery lasts a fairly long time but when it goes it goes quick.</li>
            <li> Someone gave me a panasonic razor about a year ago and I tried to use it but it irritated my face.  I purchased a Norelco 7340 and am very happy with it.  No more irritation and it is quick and does a good job.  I get a bunch of shaves on one battery charge.  Nice razor at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> The comfortable, close shave of my new Phillips Norelco 7340 men&#x27;s razor is by far&lt;br /&gt;the best I have ever experienced in my life. No more blade, hot water, soap, and messy&lt;br /&gt;clean up.  My Phillips Norelco is the most no fuss, convenient, quickest way to start&lt;br /&gt;my day.  Thanks to my present from my wife via Amazon, shaving now is a real pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GW</li>
            <li> My first complaint with this shaver is the battery. It uses a NiCd battery, which means that if you don&#x27;t follow the directions EXACTLY the battery will quickly be ruined. You can only plug it in when the battery is ALMOST dead. You MUST keep it plugged in until the battery is fully charged and then you must quickly remove it when it is charged. My battery life is down to just one shave after only a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it takes a long time to shave with the razor, it seems like you have to go over the same spot many times to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Norelco&#x27;s other razors are better, but this one is certainly not very good. Avoid.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco&#x27;s for over 50 years.  I still have a battery operated Norelco (1965)  which I used in the Army.&lt;br /&gt;Like a blog above the older Norelco were better made than today&#x27;s models.  When the batteries ran down I used to bring the shaver to Norelco&#x27;s in NYC or Macy&#x27;s shaver repair.&lt;br /&gt;There are best buys for rotary shavers such as Remington&#x27;s model.&lt;br /&gt;Like other shavers the blades have to be replaced once a year.  I have been buying my blades from EBAY.&lt;br /&gt;The protective plastic head is cheaply made.  Use tape and glue to repair the plastic protective device rather than buy a new one.  Also the rotaries are fragile.  Made of plastic.  The rotaries in the older models were made of metal.  Probably true of other company&#x27;s shavers as well.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does give you a close shave.  A very close shave.</li>
            <li> I had bought my father an expensive electric shaver for christmas which he liked well enough, but he dropped it and it broke.  I bought this one as a replacement.  It was less than half the price of the other one and he loves it.  He likes it better.  This is a good shaver at a good price.</li>
            <li> Charged it for 8 hrs as stated in instructions. Turned it on and it sounded like it couldn&#x27;t cut one whisker. But, it really works great. Good close shave, not irritating. Only had it for 3 weeks now, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it at a really good price.</li>
            <li> nice looking and great feel on hand. the gift for Dad, he haven&#x27;t used it yet, but i think he will like it</li>
            <li> Works fine. But it doesn&#x27;t give a shave equal to a razor. Need to have patience to handle this. Sometimes it pinches the skin. Even after rubbing many times..it still leaves some hair here and there. They have mentioned to try it for 3 weeks for the skin to adjust with this. But after three weeks I switched back my Proglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good part is, you don&#x27;t need to use shaving cream and run it through tap water every time.</li>
            <li> Worst razor I ever purchased... No adjustments, poor battery life, sounds like a weak, cheap razor.  DO NOT buy!  Going back to remington.  Cheaply made, will not buy Phillips again.</li>
            <li> a decent shaver in a long time. gives me one of the closest shaves ever.</li>
            <li> It works fine and about the price of new blades-what&#x27;s up with blades being so expensive in relation to the whole razor?  I have now exceeded the 20 word minimum.</li>
            <li> The Norelco shaver is very reliable and gives a close shave everytime. You have to make sure that the heads are clean so one can assure a consistent shave each time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the gift for my father. it&#x27;s great with good performance in shaving, especailly concerning about 41 bucks price. well, though a couple of days later I found a lower price of 34.77 in Walmart, I still think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> Upon receiving item, it ran coming out of the package.  It sounds very weak.&lt;br /&gt;Suspect that impression is from my distant past where I recall much louder electric shavers.  Bought this after many years of using disposable blade razors; but was getting upset with the rising costs. I do not shave daily (retired and don&#x27;t care), but, try to look presentable on heavy social occasions--like going to Costco. And I would certainly use in the event of a (God forbid) date, or going to church. After a few hours charge, I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  Used on 3 day old beard without any pre-shave lotion and found abrasion discomfort minimal, but did use face balm after. Despite its lack of loud irritating buzz, it doe the job. My face was RELATIVELY smooth and have had over 2 months now without discomfort. Thanks Norelco. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors and many, if not all, failed to beat this razor.  The price cost is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> The Best razor I have owned. Better than any other battery or electric razor.  The only drawback is it did freeze in the car in the winter whereas the older model I have did not.</li>
            <li> For those of you considering switching from a blade to an electric, be cautioned that no matter how slick the advertising an electric (in my experience) just doesn&#x27;t give quite as close a shave. Now on to my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably my third Norelco as my last one finally gave up for good after several years of reliable service and I have been shaving with an electric for some years now. I have found this latest Norelco to be lightweight, comfortable to hold and to the point - it gives me a very good shave. After my initial charge (8 hours or so) the battery lasted about 12 days worth of shaves - not bad at all. Even if I had run the battery down, you can shave with the cord as well - something my prior Norelco wouldn&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head pops open for cleaning with running water, green lights tell you when it&#x27;s charging (steady light) and when it&#x27;s completed charging (blinking green lights). All things considered I&#x27;m very pleased although I DO wish this model gave me some sort of blinking light when the battery was about to die. As it is, you just have to listen and when the RPMs of the shaving heads slow down noticeably - it&#x27;s time for a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hats off to Norelco for another good mid-range priced electric razor. A heads up that it came so packaged in a plastic carton as to need a sledgehammer, scissors and heavy gloves to get it open lest the plastic rips you to shreds.</li>
            <li> This is the first Norelco that I&#x27;ve owned.I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited 65 years to try them out.It&#x27;s a great shaver.I resently went with the full on bald look and this shaver is great for that.It&#x27;s so easy to clean.I just dump out the magority of hair in the garbage and rinse in the sink.I wish I would have went with the lithium-ion batteries,but these are preforming well so far.</li>
            <li> very good. and the surface of the shaving is very confertable.&lt;br /&gt;i use it almost every day and save much time.</li>
            <li> you should buy it. easy to use. will come back again!!!!!!! .good .you should buy it. easy to use. will come back again!!!!!!! .good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 Norelco shavers in my life.  Each lasting more than 10 years.  The local repair shop who has serviced my previous 2 Norelco&#x27;s noted that the new ones aren&#x27;t the quality of the old.  Time will only answer that question but I can state that the 7340 system sold here is a much changed version of what I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the 7430 is light....extremely light.  It is very quiet, something that takes getting used to.  It&#x27;s also the first Norelco I&#x27;ve owned without the comfort control setting.  I was initially reluctant since on my previous 2 Norelco&#x27;s the comfort control setting seemed to affect the closeness of the shave.  This particular razor has the HQ8 heads.  The higher priced models use the HQ9s.  From my research the biggest complaint about the HQ9 head is that it seems to take more time to get a clean shave.  Based on 3 weeks of use of the 7340, even without the comfort control, not only do the HQ8 heads shave as fast as my older Norelco&#x27;s but the shave is also closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver also allows the use of water to rinse the heads clean.  This is a major advantage over my older Norelco&#x27;s since I use a pre shave product that can cause the blades to need frequent cleaning.  Now the after shave rinse to the head assembly keeps things much cleaner without having to disassemble the heads, which was what I previously had to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side the razor is delivered bare bones.  No case to store or transport it in.  It won&#x27;t fit even my older cases.  My previous Norelco had a battery gauge which allowed me to know when to recharge the shaver.  This razor has a charge indicator but its only purpose is to indicate when the shaver is being charged and that it has reached full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older Norelco&#x27;s would slow down as their batteries started to fail. This one just stops when the voltage falls below certain level.  Obviously not a good thing if you have no available AC outlet at the time. To get the best battery life you do need to let the batteries run down.  If you constantly plug it in to keep it \\&quot;topped off\\&quot;, you will be replacing batteries on a more frequent cycle.  Note that this service normally must be done by a service person since the batteries are soldered in.  In past experience I got at least 4-5 years service out of one set of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good lower cost Norelco.  It&#x27;s Chinese made so from my stand point I will have to wait and see if it holds up as well as my former shavers that were Holland manufactured.st battery life you do need to let the batteries run down.

            <li> Bought this electric shaving system for my husband who has a beard.&lt;br /&gt;He says it takes 25 seconds and he is ready for the day.  Wished he had received one before he spent all that time shaving with a regular razor for daily upkeep of his beard.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor. Close shave. No irritation. Instruction book very clear.&lt;br /&gt;Have used Norelco before. Very satisfied. In my opinion it is the best razor out there. Would not hesitate to buy another again.</li>
            <li> I am only slightly disappointed that this razor operates on battery only and not by cord. My fault,I should have looked closer,but I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Norelco 7340 from Best Buy.  The razor is like all of Norelcos units...well made and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is I used 3 other Norelcos...cordless...and this one seems like the battery is &#x27;about to die&#x27; when fully charged.  The heads barely turn...and I can feel them &#x27;cut&#x27; my beard one by one almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly like my old norelco when the battery was dying!  So I took it back and EXCHANGED it for another..thinking the batteries were bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same on the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll take it back and go for the model without the &#x27;double blades&#x27; and see if the battery situation is better.  This just may be the &#x27;new&#x27; technology of batteries but I dunno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically it shaves very well, close as I would expect new &#x27;blades&#x27; to do...with any Norelco.  But the batty thing worries me....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen this addressed on any reviews so it must just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck otherwise!</li>
            <li> Still great after 4 years!</li>
            <li> This thing is great. It&#x27;s quiet, fast, and almost never pinches. A huge improvement over the old Panasonic it replaced. My only minor quibble is that sometimes it takes a few passes to get the bit by the base of each jawbone, and it never seems quite perfect. It&#x27;s definitely very good, though.</li>
            <li> Not the best shaver out there, but this thing has held up strong over the years. I&#x27;ve never replaced the blade heads and it still gets the job done. Worth the money (which was also a big selling point.)</li>
            <li> Arrived late as I was not sure what caused the delay. Once discussed, things went smoothly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older and similar Norelco that I had for 10 years. I didn&#x27;t need a new one, but figured that technology had advanced in 10 years and I was just missing out on a better shave. I should have just put new blades in my older one. I don&#x27;t get nearly as good of a shave, and the construction just feels a little cheaper. Only benefit is that I can wash this one under the faucet, but I seldom do that anyways. Still a nice razor, but not an upgrade!</li>
            <li> This razor is way above other brands in quality and speed.  It&#x27;s also very quiet.and Norelco makes better shavers for a little more money.</li>
            <li> I use this Norelco shaver everyday. Great close shave, battery lasts about three weeks before it needs recharging. Great. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have depended on an electric shaver for about 30 years and have used mid-range price models from Phillips, Remington and Braun, including both rotary and mesh screen models. After three weeks of use, the Norelco 7340 has provided the closest, cleanest shave I have ever had. The shaver is very quiet and may give the impression of being underpowered but the shave is excellent. It fits in my hand very well and is easy to clean. The first charge lasted two weeks. It doesn&#x27;t come in a case but that is not a problem for me. Overall I am delighted with the quality and value of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a replacement for my old one, since day 1 I am very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is good, the shaving it&#x27;s almost as close as with a razor, is not as noisy as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks ago I was in my university final exams, so shaving was no a priority and I let my facial hair grow for a week, when i finally had some time for shaving, I was expecting a lot of pain caused by the pulled hair, but it wasn&#x27;t so... this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had!!</li>
            <li> Excellent battery life, average cutting ability compared to the other three-headed shavers from Norelco. So far it cleans up fairly well with water after a few weeks of use. Time will tell if the battery life holds up over time as the batteries tend to degrade after repeated use.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad experience with this company and I will never do business with them again.  I ordered the product which was displayed on the Amazon site but they delivered a different product.  I wrote to them on two different occasions but they never ever responded.  I cannot do business with a company like this.</li>
            <li> I like it really good, i like it very much. And I believe  Tissot is a good brand. Buy it!</li>
            <li> bought it long time ago as gift for my father, he is happy for what he got it, no issue at all for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> I can find similar models in stores, but none this cheap or nice. I like that it can hold a charge for weeks of use, I like that it is water proof in that I can rinse it out after I am finished as well. I find that it works best just after a shower and moving in circular motions. Its beard and mustache trimmer works very well too.</li>
            <li> have been using it for more than 1 year before I write this.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for the price I got it.</li>
            <li> Review: Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Light weight, quiet, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Poor shave, increased time shave to remove stubble, skin irritation, poor battery life, no storage case, poor packaging design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Poor, do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving System was purchased during a Lightning Deal. Price was about $38. Looked like a good purchase at very good price. Years ago, I had owned a Norelco shaver and had been satisfied by the shave. The new 7340 did not perform as well as my old Norelco. Although my face is angular I thought the newer head design would lead to a closer shave and less stubble, this was not the case. I also spent considerable time going back over face and neck areas that left my face very irritated. Battery life was also a problem, I only received about half as many shaves as advertised before shaver simply stopped. Probably due to more shave time needed to remove stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a disappointing purchase, I have gone back to Gillette M3 blade shave thus  gaining better shave, far less irritation, return of lost time.</li>
            <li> I have been a satisfied Norelco user for many years. This shaver is very quiet. Great battery life. Extremely close shave. The washable head is a significant improvement over my previous model. My only gripe is not with the shaver itself, but with the excessive price of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a safety razor user for years - and a frustrated one at that.  This is a process way too complicated and messy for me at this stage in life.  I was looking for something simple to use and found it in the Norelco 7340 men&#x27;s electric razor.  It&#x27;s quiet and easy to use.  The rotating heads give me a close enough shave that lasts a day or two.  It&#x27;s super easy to clean with warm water by just opening the head.  I wipe the shaver body dry, shake it out with the head closed, re-open the head and air dry it.  The one downside is the lack of a light that signals the need to re-charge the shaver.  I called customer service about this and was told that when the motor slows down, it&#x27;s time for re-charging.  I can live with this.  I was also told that the internal batteries last about 3-5 years.  The customer service rep told me to buy a new razor rather than send it back for a new battery to be installed.  The reason:  the higher cost of replacing the battery.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and recommend it.  For me, it&#x27;s a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the Norelco 7340 for my husband to replace a much older one that he used when he traveled.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> I owned and used a Remington (not rotary heads) and the razor screen had a small tear which cdause cuts and bleeding----the rotary heads make a lot of difference in shaving comfort and it is extremely quiet and easy to clean---I definitely would reommend it&#x27;s purchase</li>
            <li> Nicest Norelco I&#x27;ve had for the past 40 years.  Shaves far closer than I thought possible..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest of unit is up to Norelco&#x27;s fine standard.</li>
            <li> Was a gift. But is a good stuff</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who would like to save some time shaving. I can shave in less than 2 minutes and clean it in 10 seconds. Just pour warm water over it and no worries. I can use the shaver even if I didn&#x27;t shave for 3 days. The battery last long considering you are using it for 2 minutes every day, so it will last up to two weeks without charging it. The battery last for 30 minutes of continuous shaving. Great product.</li>
            <li> After using a Remington Shaver for the last 5 years and many replacement heads I decided to try a new shaver.  When I was shopping I was impressed that I could use the Norelco shaver for 45 days and still be able to return it.  After one shave I realized what I had been missing for the previous 5 years.  I liked it so much I ordered another shaver for my brother.  He is as impressed as I am.  I use the shaver more than every-other-day but not every day and am now 19 days on one charge.  I like being able to use the shaver with the charging cord.  I also like it quietness.  It took a little while getting used to but now I can shave in our bathroom without waking up my wife who likes to sleep in.  A very good product.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for 40+years. This is the best razor I have used. It is very quiet, gives you a great&lt;br /&gt;shave and the battery life has been excellent. Razor is easy to clean. All around this is a great value.</li>
            <li> I have been using a shaver of this model for a year; I ordered this to be a backup and to pack for traveling. The shaver gives fine, smooth shaves, which is all I could ask for. It has a trimmer that works well for evening sideburns and getting the back of my neck. They promised a 10-day charge, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem going for a week and a half before re-charging. If it ever does run out, it can be run using the power cord. They recommend changing the heads annually. Amazon carries the replacement heads [[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8  Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]at least $5 cheaper than any other source I found, local or on line. I bought some, but I&#x27;ll hold up on installing them until I notice a problem.</li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid the battery-trap, but the AC only model I had was truly a waste and lasted only a few months.  This unit seems to operate for a long time on one charge.  If you learn to really take your time and go slowly over the shaved area of the face you can acheive a very smooth shave.  The greatest convenience and best feature is the ability to open the unit and rinse it out under the sink.  The little 3 shafts have seals so the unit can get wet.  This one has lasted so far, so good.  The cleaning feature is a major improvement over older models.  Nobody&#x27;s going to bother to disassemble the whole thing and stick a little brush in there.  This unit is open, rinse, let dry.  You can still take it all apart if the spirit moves you....</li>
            <li> I had a 5885 XL which had served me well for several years and cost over $100. The battery finally died and I found out it wouldn&#x27;t run with the cord attached once the battery is dead. The technology of this 7340 is better. It&#x27;s lighter, quieter, qives a closer shave and you can rinse it with water and run it with the cord. Oh yeah, and it&#x27;s half the price. Very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Shave close without irritation or my skin breaking out, which was always my problem in the past with electric shavers.  Compared against the cost of shaving with shaving cream and blades, a less expensive option by far.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reasonably priced electric shaver for my son, he&#x27;s very happy with it. He says it works very well.</li>
            <li> Norelco is an old friend, I have used them for many years, seldom wear out, always to a good job, Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> pretty much exactly what i was looking for, no frills and works well, battery easily holds a charge long enough for a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  only complaint is that the shaver doesn&#x27;t charge and shave at the same time.  if it&#x27;s plugged in and you are using it, it&#x27;s not charging.</li>
            <li> this is my fourth norelco and it does not compare with the othrs I have owned.I am surprised at the cheapness of this company</li>
            <li> Received the charging stand as ordered.  However it did not come with a power cord and is completely useless without it.  The cost for the power cord is prohibitive and I will not order one.  If they had been clearer up front that the cord was not included and would cost as much as it does, I would not have ordered as I did.  It would have been cheaper to purchase a lesser electric razor.  I&#x27;m really upset over the whole situation.  Unfortunately it even reflects badly on Amazon even though someone else provided the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Love.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He uses it daily and has no complaints.  He likes the close cut.</li>
            <li> Got this unit around April 2010, replacing my 10 year-old wonderful Philips 8555XL which couldn&#x27;t hold a charge for over 6 shaves towards the end (used to hold over 15).&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quiet - it sounds as if the razors are turning too slow, but I can&#x27;t argue with the results - it does provide a quick, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Washable - there&#x27;s always gunk stuck in the chamber, putting it under hot running water is fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Head protector - junk which comes off easy and breaks easily, leading to...&lt;br /&gt;Delicate heads - any little bump will dent the heads, with even the tiniest dent causing a loud and annoying noise. The only remedy is to replace the heads at $35.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves per charge - out of the box held enough charge for 5 shaves! took it in for a repair, got it back after two weeks with enough charge for 8 shaves. In the process they managed to screw up the low battery LED, therefore I often get stuck without juice for a shave when I need it most.&lt;br /&gt;Quality - this unit is made in China. you can feel the difference in the way the head assembly is attached to the body and the reduced robustness.&lt;br /&gt;Power adapter - everyone gets stuck without a power cord, right? well, with this unit you can&#x27;t plug in just any cable, you need the original cord since it includes an adapter. So long integral adapter, so long convenience.&lt;br /&gt;Cheapness - why doesn&#x27;t this come with a pouch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry I threw out my old Philips, it gave me a couple shaves less per charge, but in all other respects it was better. Like most things these days - they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to.</li>
            <li> i shave once or twice a week with a razor so me face gets a little hairy before i shave. a razor pulled at the stuble so i got the electric shaver to preshave. i used a norelco years ago. it worked better than the new one. i bought this norelco that was priced in the middle- $60 more or less. it takes a while to get the stible and must go back and forth over the same area to work- it still leaves a few hairs on the face. i use a razor afterward to get a close shave. i would not stop with the norelco shave</li>
            <li> Have tried a few and this is one of the best I have used.The battery lasts what seems like forever,and that is awesome.</li>
            <li> it is not that what I was expected. particularly for the neck.......&lt;br /&gt;all philips made in Holland whereas this item made in china...</li>
            <li> Shaver is great!  The only thing I wished it had was some type of battery meter showing how much power is left in the battery so that it lets us know when it should be charged.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 7340 is very nice and easy to use, easy to clean, shaving very thoroughly.Amazon delivery soon, parcel packaging is also very good. I will often go to the amazon to shopping.</li>
            <li> After years of using a Norelco Triple Header, ever since my grandfather gave me one when I started shaving late in high school, I switched to a Braun a couple years ago. I have seen the error of my ways, repented and returned from the Dark Side. Forgive me, Norelco, for I had sinned, but if it&#x27;s any consolation, the Braun never made me happy. In fact, I returned it soon after I bought it because the battery kept running down after only three days or so of use. After two returns I realized that&#x27;s just an inherent problem with the Braun. That and it was as loud as a leaf blower and took constant ploughing back and forth across my face until it would finally trim my thickish beard. Fortunately it started acting squirelly, so a couple weeks ago I ordered this Norelco off Amazon. I have but one word: Awesome! I charged it two Saturday nights ago, and used it for the first time before church the next morning. My first shave was reduced to about half the time the Braun took. For the fun of it, I have used it every morning since without recharging to see how long a charge will last. It finally gave out this morning, 12 days after being charged. I was even able to milk a couple more bursts out of it to do most of my face so I won&#x27;t look too shaggy during the workday. I&#x27;m sure over time a charge won&#x27;t last 12 days, but anything was better than the Braun piddling out two days after it was charged. The Norelco is so quiet-running that I don&#x27;t even have to turn up the radio so I can hear \\&quot;Morning Edition\\&quot; if I shave in the car. (Which I only do at stop lights, incidentally!) When shaving at home, I can even hear my roommate when he starts talking to me two rooms away, as is his annoying penchant, especially now that he can&#x27;t hear the tell-tale roar of the Braun that indicates I&#x27;m shaving. The shave itself is much smoother with no 5 o&#x27;clock shadow issues. And unlike the Braun, most of the shorn whiskers are caught in the well beneath the razor heads. (Most of the Braun whiskers fell all over my collar or in the sink.) A simple puff cleans out the well, though on weekends when I have a bit more time, I can rinse out the residue that&#x27;s left. The price was much better than the Braun, and the unit seems to be about half the weight, which I found is nice when packing it in my toiletries it for travel. You&#x27;ll like this puppy. Norelco, thank you for welcoming back into the fold.ell all over my collar or in the sink.)

            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fairly quiet.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be rinsed out for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;- Has a pop-up trimmer for sideburn trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This is technically a dry shaver, as the instructions tell you to \\&quot;use on dry skin for the best results.\\&quot; This is NOT disclosed in the product description; I had to hunt down more details on the product. Personally, I have never liked dry shavers. They just don&#x27;t work for me. Since this shaver is water resistant, I decided to try it with shaving creme. It works pretty well, and I don&#x27;t notice a decrease in performance. Since the instructions recommend blade replacements every year, I have to see what happens down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this shaver as a \\&quot;wet shaver\\&quot; for a few months, I have noticed it does not perform well as such. It will constantly miss hairs, and leave a not-so-smooth shave. I prefer my Norelco Cool Skin shaver much more. It&#x27;s supposed to be a less advanced shaver than the 7340, and yet it provides me with a better shave. I may have to just eat the cost of this disappointment and purchase replacement blades for the Cool Skin. -1 star for the failure to impress.</li>
            <li> I find the Norelco shavers better for my beard than the highly rated Braun model.  I think it is because the Norelco shavers have \\&quot;slots\\&quot; as well as holes to capture hairs while the Braun units only have holes.  Anyway, this model is an exceptional value - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for about 14 years, mostly with semi-disposal razors (your mach 3 types).  I don&#x27;t get the appeal.  It took me about 20 minutes to shave, and I&#x27;m still finding patches of hair here and there.  I followed the instructions, even watched a youtube video on how to use the Norelco, but just couldn&#x27;t speed the process up at all.  I&#x27;ve used it three days in a row. The problem is I can get the job done with disposable razors in less than ten minutes, with almost perfect results everytime.  This machine does cut close, and didn&#x27;t cause me any razor burn, it just takes way to long.  For some reason I thought that was the appeal behind this device was that it was faster than traditional methods, no luck with me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-cheap ($30 bills seems reasonable)&lt;br /&gt;-good build quality&lt;br /&gt;-cuts close&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-takes to long&lt;br /&gt;-always leaves small patches of hair on your face&lt;br /&gt;-while the finish is quite smooth, not as close a shave as a razor, ie: wouldn&#x27;t pass an 9 hour military day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m shaving wrong, if so give your suggestions of how to use the electric razor in the comments below.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 7340 shaver, with its patented \\&quot;floating heads\\&quot; system, is as good as or better than any electric shaver I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  First, it is the quietest shaver I have found. You can shave while you talk on the cellphone without noise interference. I don&#x27;t have a way to measure decibels here, but it&#x27;s roughly the equivalent of a fish-tank air supply or a laptop fan motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Next, it shaves close, REALLY close, virtually indistinguishably from a razor. The close, comfortable, quiet shave makes shaving a genuine pleasure again. My sensitive skin has had no problems with rashes or burning in the month or so that I have used this system, and I don&#x27;t use any before or after electric-shave skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  And C, the price I got at Amazon is an unbelievable bargain. It was priced at nearly $70 by the manufacturer, but on sale for about $30 at the time, and worth every penny of that and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Philips Norelco has a well-engineered and nicely manufactured product in this shaver. I gave it four stars because the first one ceased working in three weeks, but Amazon quickly supplied a replacement at no extra cost. I haven&#x27;t had the new one long enough to assess its length of service, which is my only concern for this product. Having more moving parts, it seems more likely to break down. My last shaver (a Remington micro-screen) gave me two years of continuous service, and my previous one (a Braun) gave me six. So this nicer-seeming product has \\&quot;some big shoes to fill.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Seems to take a while to cut...does NOT beat a straight razor by any means. Satisfied...but could be way better. Battery life seems good.</li>
            <li> The razor is working o.k., but I&#x27;ve noticed that every time I purchase a new razor from Philips they have reduced the quality and value of their products. This razor comes with a straight charging cord instead of the far more convenient coiled cords of the past, no charging stand like in the past, and no travel case like in the past. I suppose soon Philips will eliminate the little cleaning brush, since that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for several years.  This electric shaver does a great job, and  there  is so much less noise from the shaver in this model than in older models.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I use Norelco shavers&#x27;before that I used  pansonic and so on&#x27; Norelco shavers7340  does a great job,  so much less noise from the shaver  than that I used before.</li>
            <li> I originally bought my Norelco 7340 shaver at Walmart.  The razor shaves very close and gets the short stubble as well as the long hairs.  With my lather and regular razor I could never get all my neck hairs and most times I left the bath area bleeding.  However, with the Norelco all of my hairs were shaved and it leaves a very close shave to boot.  I highly recommend this particular shaver over the cheaper Norelco shavers.  God Bless one and all from Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior.</li>
            <li> my fiance is very happy with tbhis razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Phillips Norelco SensoTouch razor on 12/29/2011. It came with a 45 day money back guaranty, after using it for 25 days I contacted Phillips customer service for a return authorization form. I was told they would email me the form. After three weeks and four phone calls, where I was told that I would get the form, still no form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will never buy a Phillips product and I will post this to every review of Phillips products that I can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Phillips for the non existing customer service.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of this razor for my husband and father,they told me that the quality is good and the product is Ok.You will find the sound of this product is a little loud.Of course,I haven&#x27;t buy a quiet razor before.No sound maybe betther for my family</li>
            <li> Ive had this razor for a while now. I&#x27;ve always used it in the shower, and I still do. It still working perfectly fine. I&#x27;ve had it well over a year now. Its real easy to clean too. The documents that came suggested to clean it every 3 months, but I keep forgetting. I end up cleaning it every 4 or 5 months and its still works perfectly fine. Ive had a lot others before this one, and hands down this is better than the rest Ive had. No cuts, no rash, and my skin is smooth after every use.</li>
            <li> Bought for my farther in law,when he got it&lt;br /&gt;He was very happy with the it.&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable,greate shaver!&lt;br /&gt;He said he will tell his friends how good these shalver.</li>
            <li> It caused too much irritation on my skin and takes too long to do a clean shave. If your skin is less sensitive it may work well for you. On the other hand battery life was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I needed a reliable replacement razor when I found this Norelco 7340 on sale here on Amazon. I have not been disappointed with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 5-7 days a week and usually plug it in to charge only once-a-week (I haven&#x27;t yet allowed it to completely die down before needing to charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY drawback is more of an O.C.D. thing - I hate how difficult it is to clean out all of the clippings...</li>
            <li> I have had this for at least three years and it works well.  The battery is holding up well I usually shave 4-5 times between charges.  I don&#x27;t let the battery go all the way down very often so I don&#x27;t know what the maximum life is.</li>
            <li> Would be great except blades replacements cost almost as much as shaver and don&#x27;t last that long.  Product appears to be a victim of programed obsolescence.  Unfortunately, all other brands seem to suffer from the same condition.  Quality products hard to find today.</li>
            <li> Great razor for under $70. What makes this razor such a good buy,in addition to it giving a clean shave is that this razor&#x27;s battery keeps its charge for a surprisingly long time; it has been more than 30 days since I first fully charged it and after more than 30 daily shaves it still has not needed to be recharged... amazing for an electric razor that is so relatively inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I like the shaver i does what it is supposed to shave your two week beard. down side is that it needs several shaves to get better results, and when it gets to perfect shave your skin is very irritated.</li>
            <li> I have use Philips shaver more than 20 years from I was a middle school boy. It gave me very good expression. But I had admit that Philips shaver do not get any more progress in shaving  technics. This Philips Norelco 7340 do not shave clean enough so I take more than 5 mins everyday so that I have to recharge it every 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Compare with other brand take less than 1 hour recharging time, Philips Norelco need 8 hours to recharge, I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t want to waste too much words on the advantage of this shaver, comfortable, quick and clean shaving, light in weight, low noise, but i&#x27;d like to highlight that the power can last for longer time after one charge than my expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the disadvantage, the indicator light of power is bad. I hope there is a yellow light which can remind you about the low power and you can charge it in advance to avoid the situation of automatic power off during your shaving. The manual said the full charge takes about 8 hours and the light will go off after fully charged. But I find the light goes off less than 8 hours. So what should I do? To continue charging to 8 hours or to stop charging it? The manual doesn&#x27;t tell. Also I hope the charging signal can use another color instead of the annoying blinking.</li>
            <li> Well what can I say.  This shaver does not miss a lick.  Quiet like it should be and cleans out easily too.It does a great job and I look great too.&lt;br /&gt;Cricket Kyne</li>
            <li> This electric razor lacks accuracy when shaving and it is next to impossible to shave a beard line with it. I suppose this razor would be suitable for someone who shaves all the hair of there face and has no need to trim a beard. The \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; on this razor pops-up but does not stay in place forcing you to hold it up while in use. I have been using a $100 Braun for the past 6 years. I have never replaced the coils on it and it is still sharper than the new Norelco. I would recommend that if you can afford it you buy a more expensive razor. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a gift for guy,I suggest that this shaving may be the better choice.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a advertisement,it is true</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Norelco&#x27;s for the past 30 years and have had entry level models all the way up to top of the line models. I agree that the quality of Norelco shavers seem to have gone down over the years. This is a simple model without any bells and whistles, but in my opinion it provides a decent shave for the price. If you have a thick beard or are looking for a shave that&#x27;s as close as a blade you should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco (Phillips) electric razors for years. And this one is good, made in China (of course) and does a decent job for an electric razor. But make no mistake that a good blade shaver (Gillette Fusion for example) will be much closer and doesn&#x27;t even draw much blood. Electrics keep me smooth until mid-afternoon, blade shavers all day. But it should last a bunch of years, I use it on weekends when I am too lazy to blade shave.</li>
            <li> This is a gift I got for my bf. It is his first time to use a electric shaver. He likes it. It is easy to use and wash. But it takes a few days to let the skin get used to it. It can shave mostly clean.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  It gives a very close shave and it stays charged for almost a week between recharges!</li>
            <li> I bought it a month ago and I can say its a miracle! Before this one I had more expensive, more stylish one, but it wasn&#x27;t shaving properly, didn&#x27;t cut a lil bit long hair.&lt;br /&gt;This one 7340 is perfect, even my father dropped his shaver and using mine!&lt;br /&gt;Its cheap and productive!</li>
            <li> This is my third or fourth Philips Norelco triple-head model over the past decade...and by far the best of the generally satisfactory lot.  The 7340XL is well-balanced and has a good feel in the hand.  It is extremely comfortable on the face and offers a close shave that rivals a blade.  Once fully charged it offers about two weeks of shaving time without a re-charge.  It is extremely easy to clean in the dry mode and disassembles/re-assembles easily for periodic \\&quot;deep\\&quot; cleans.  I have not used the wet rinse method since the dry clean/shake-out works well and doesn&#x27;t leave the cutting head wet.  Overall it would be difficult to find a better shaver at this mid-level price-point.</li>
            <li> This shaver is EXCELLENT! No negatives whatsoever - anyone who downgrades this product must have received a (rare) \\&quot;lemon\\&quot; and could undoubtedly have obtained a brand-new replacement via Norelco warranty had they spent the effort. Shaving is quick, close &amp; comfortable - even with my heavier-than-average whiskers, AND WITH 5 DAYS GROWTH, the shave I get is, again, quick, close &amp; comfortable. And I have sensitive skin - the overall quality and \\&quot;ergonomics\\&quot; are also top drawer!</li>
            <li> Bought it for &amp;lt;$35..good deal. Meets my basic needs. I like the trimmer at the back. Shaves smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Motor seems slow...even when fully charge. But still can shave well..Been using it for past 2 months already and still works fine.&lt;br /&gt;So far its good.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for 48 years and they have all worked well.  The batteries last for a long long time.  This one also works very well.  A very nice feature is being able to wash out the blade area with running water, eliminating the need to use a brush.</li>
            <li> Good product . Does not feel as substantial as my old one, so not sure how it will hold up. Very quiet</li>
            <li> It cleans my face up well enough. Obviously it&#x27;s not as good as razor shaving. I run my hand across my cheeks and can feel some micro hair sticking up, not always as smooth, but my hair grows in all different directions. I just try to stretch the skin out and keep going over the area, and after a few minutes, my face should be as smooth as it&#x27;ll get with an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is real easy too.&lt;br /&gt;If battery is low, you can just plug it in a socket and still use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always forget to unplug it after charging. Apparently if you leave it in even after fully charge, it degrades the battery. I&#x27;m paranoid about that.</li>
            <li> Very good price, is a good shaving option, is my first of this kind and i&#x27;m still getting better using it!</li>
            <li> Probably the best shaver I have ever purchased.Really smooth shave!!</li>
            <li> I had a previous razor of the same model and it performs flawlessly.  Good battery life before recharging, good trimmer, and balanced in the hand.  Not overly fancy just does the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Missed the return date hoping at some point my face will get used to it and I was able to remove all my facial hair with it. Great mistake when I decided to quit using Remington and gave a try to Philips Norelco following all the hype surrounding this brand. I had to go over the same area dozens of times to remove most, but not all of the hair, and never, ever, could remove all hair from the neck. Lots of skin irritation also. After a few months I throw this crap in the garbage and got a Remington again and I&#x27;m most happy with it.</li>
            <li> 12/24/2014.&lt;br /&gt;DISCONTINUED. No longer manufactured.  Price has risen dramatically as there is a following for this electric shaver.  The replacement models - completely different - apparently have garnered poor reviews - as apparently Philips Norelco has cheapified the entire new product line.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this model for many years.  One of the best at the original price point.  Zero issues.  Clean smooth shave.  These 7310 and the 7340 are excellent shavers.  High quality.  The only difference between the 7310 and the 7340 is the slots in the round stainless steel heads.  And the heads are interchangeable.  HQ8 heads.&lt;br /&gt;Sad to see a good brand such as Philips Norelco discontinue a good product and replace with inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;You will get years and years of good service with any 7310 or the 7340.  Sad to see them discontinued.</li>
            <li> A very good shaver for the price. Performs well and cleans easily. Shave is close and smooth. A charge lasts all week.</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to  but I was finally able to get a smooth shave all over. IT is quiet, light weight and cuts very close. I have to watch the area around the front of the neck was it can irritate if i don&#x27;t watch the direction of cutting. It shaves much better than my old Remington.</li>
            <li> Razor works well; no issues after over a year of use.  Much quieter than the Braun it replaced, and no silly cleaning solution to buy.</li>
            <li> Honest seller. Product exactly as promised. Great eBayer</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I own 2 of these in case #1 breaks.  good price, nice cut (after skin got used to it after 2 weeks), holds a charge for every day use for more than 7 days.  The sideburn trimmer is a little awkward to open, but cuts very nicely.  No problems.</li>
            <li> I have owned my Norelco 7340 for about eighteen months. I like this shaver. I am in the military and I bought this shaver for field use. I hate dry shaving or using cold water when I shave with a razor. I have used my 7340 in the sands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan and it has not failed me. Norelco claims that the charge will only last ten days, my 7340 is on day twenty-three since it&#x27;s last charge. It is nice to be able to wash it out after each use as well. My blades have finally reached their end and need to be replaced now. But, they did last eighteen months. I highly recommend the 7340.</li>
            <li> It cuts close, is easy to use, easy to clean, and has a good battery life. Definitely a good shaver for the price range and time will tell if it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> To start off i owned a braun shaver for the last 4 years and loved it until it recently broke due to my doing. I decided to try a different kind of shaver and went with this norelco and have loved every second of it. Great decision so far. It holds a charge for about 10-12 days. I use it twice a day because i am in the military and require it so much quicker to use then the straight flat ones i am used to it cuts hairs all directions all the time. Only good things to say i will update if that changes.</li>
            <li> Well, I owned a Phillips shaver before, much cheaper model. which worked great for over 3 years. it still works the only problem was the trimmer which ultimately broke down.So I made up my mind to buy a new one and I was sure it would be phillips.I saw the reviews and price an chose Philips Norelco 7340. First I  really liked it, until I used for the first time.It does not shave half as well as my previous shaver did.I have to move it on and on again until my face gets red.the trimmer is awful, it does not shave at all do not even bear in mind to make a shape or sth like with the trimmer it will not simply do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A complete disappointment to me. I would return this item with pleasure if I only could.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. I have had one just like it for the past 6 years and I love em. They are relatively inexpensive and Philips lasts for a very long time. Sure it may take a few passes to get the longer hairs but in the end it is a quick close shave and I will definitely be buying another in 5 years.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these in 2012 for my youngest sons, both new shavers, with light beards.  When they worked, they liked them, But, both of the shavers stopped working (would no longer charge) in 2014.  A razor this expensive should not crap out this quickly.  My oldest son also had a similar Norelco from Costco.  It also quit working after a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I must report the shaver worked great,delivered excellent shaves, I really expected this shaver would hold up for quite a long time&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m really now quite upset the shaver will  no longer hold a charge,and as always I can&#x27;t get a refund or a replacement,i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item to anyone looking for a dependable product,i have owned this item less than six months!  .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this razor. It leaves some razor burn but worst of all rogue hairs! I should of sent this mess back.</li>
            <li> As with any shaver, you have to get used to it.  I think some of the negative reviews on here, are because they did not give it enough time.  After 30 or so shaves, everything is perfect.  Charges quick, and last for a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> I swore I&#x27;d never buy a Philips again, but here I am, using one at least once a week, after finding one over Christmas at a good price. While it works reasonably well, it has a few serious defects. The back cuts pretty well, though it can leave the skin a bit more sore than other heavy groomers. The main head, though, just can&#x27;t seem to do a good job of totally removing already-trimmed, just-washed hair; no matter how many times I go over my skin I&#x27;ll always find some hairs remaining, especially near the adam&#x27;s apple or the nostrils. Whether my hair is dry or damp, it just can&#x27;t seem to cut evenly. It does, however, do a much better job than my previous shaver, giving an extremely close shave that lasts for a couple of days (complete with some razor burn), which I would expect for the higher price... I just didn&#x27;t realize it would only go from 60 to 90% coverage, not 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is very easy to maintain, and really hardly needs any maintenance except emptying. It would be nice if it showed you a battery level or even a warning as it&#x27;s getting low when you first turn it on, but instead you just have to wait until it stops working and start charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: While the clippers in the back are still going strong, the blades on the head are soft and only seem to last 20 uses or so before starting to dull; over the next 40-50 uses it gets to the point where hardly anything is done at all, and it tends to grab instead of cut, leading to more burn and redness. I don&#x27;t have particularly thick hair, maybe medium thickness, so you might get half or double depending on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shaver for about half a year, and recently it had caused minor cuts on me twice. Talked to a Philips online chat agent, and he promptly process a replacement for me. Since this model is no longer manufactured, I will get a newer model as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the product, but I love the customer service!</li>
            <li> The good:  a good shave; plenty of battery life (at least when brand-new); corded or cordless use; when corded, it shaves really well even if the batteries are nearly depleted; easy to clean (the heads can be rinsed under the tap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said:  I would have liked an indicator when the battery is down far enough that recharging is indicated, like my old Norelco had.  I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter, since if it stops dead you can finish up with the cord, but I still would have liked a \\&quot;Time to Recharge\\&quot; indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say that, for best battery life, you should use it cordless as much as possible, and run the batteries almost all the way out before recharging.  I&#x27;d rather have a razor I can use corded all the time, but this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this years after buying it here - still works great, a great close shave, good battery life too. I use it dry and it has traveled a lot and gotten banged around - really could not improve on this shaver!</li>
            <li> I know there are much better electric razors on the market, but you&#x27;ll have to pay a lot for one of those.  This razor gets the job done for the most part.  It worked much better during the first month, but after your skin got used to the razor, the performance was not as good, meaning you had to make more effort such as shaving longer, using different angles, and using more force.  But if you take a break for a few weeks, and then use the razor again, the performance will be just like the first month&#x27;s usage before your skin gets used to it again.  This issue is probably common on all electric razors and not just this one.  A nice feature is that you can rinse off the hair and blades with tap water.  Not sure if you can actually use the razor in the shower so check before you do that.  In sum, if you&#x27;re looking for an affordable razor that will perform good enough, then this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I bought the philips norelco 7340 confident on the brands reputation, unfortunately less than six months later it just shut down one day and never started again, after having it checked by the asistance in my country i was surprised when they told me that its inner carching circuit had damaged and it was completely worthless, it was a pretty lousy deal i wont ever buy again form them.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son &amp; so far is working great.  Easy to use &amp; easy to clean too!  Mustache trimmer makes a straight edge trim line.  Multiple shaves after single eight hour charge.</li>
            <li> It cost the value I spend. I gave the shavers as gifts for 4 friends and all my friends gave me a pretty good feedback after they used it.</li>
            <li> Have had this shaver for 2 1/2 years now and still working strong.  Have had no issues with it, and it still holds a charge for a long period of time.  Good shaver.</li>
            <li> The Philips razor than in Chinese prices cheap 50$  quality is very good I like it very much will come again</li>
            <li> This razor worked okay, until I dropped it from about 3 feet.  The entire top assembly came apart.  I put it back together, but it just isn&#x27;t the same now.  The gears don&#x27;t align properly.  Of course, you should try not to drop your stuff, but this was a lot of destruction for such a short drop.  Even before I dropped it, I had to go over my face again with an actual razor because this didn&#x27;t get close enough.</li>
            <li> Used this shaver for a few months until it really required cleaning.  When I tried to clean it, I dropped one of the razor heads down the sink while trying to unclip the underside of the shaver head.  Really wish it was put together with a bit better clipping mechanism.  But, after replacing the head, the shaver generally works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about replacing the Norelco I was using for 10 years, but the deal was too good to pass up.  It cost me about the same on sale as new blades would&#x27;ve been for the old one.  It took a couple weeks to get used to;  the cut was slightly different from the old one for some reason and this one is really light,  but now it works great.  The only negatives I&#x27;ve found are 1) it doesn&#x27;t have the nice charging stand like the previous one so it just sits on the counter while charging, and 2) the latch is kind of sensitive so it has popped open a couple of time when carrying this in my bag and made a bit of a mess in the leather pouch I keep it in.  But for the money I still think it&#x27;s a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> All good, except I don&#x27;t think I get as close a shave as with my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenaged son, he loved it!</li>
            <li> I had an older model that lasted a long time. This one is doing quite well. I recently bought replacement blades and that also worked out well.</li>
            <li> great product, i would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> My 20$ bargain bin shaver died and I bought this from Walmarts. I have never had it get every hair the first try. Today, I had to go back a fourth time and decided to warn other. The foils on this shaver are so bad they constantly miss long hairs. It catches your skin before it shaves a long hair. The charge holds but I don&#x27;t need to shave everyday. The foils flip out and if you pack it for a trip, it inevitable opens and falls off getting hair dust all over your clothes. Worst razor ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver via Amazon.com.  Questions arose about the shaver.  I submitted the questions to Philips/Norelco twice, and i have the confirmation numbers, but Philips/Norelco has not responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If Philips/Norelco sees this and does finally respond to me, then i might upgrade this negative review.)</li>
            <li> Cheap and gives a decent shave.  Does the job.  Wish it had a low charge warning.  With all of my Norelco shavers in the last 10 years, it flashes when fully charged, not when it&#x27;s charging--strange, IMO.</li>
            <li> It works quite well and the battery last a good while.  The only setback is that it takes 8 hours to recharge.  But, I have more than one rechargeable razor.  So, while this one is recharging, the other one is in use.</li>
            <li> This shaver is one of the best. I have owned Norelco products for years!!! To me they are the best!!!</li>
            <li> I was having problems with old shaver not geting all the wisker, I do not have that problem with this shaver never have any left when I us it and it stays charge for an unbleviable long time.</li>
