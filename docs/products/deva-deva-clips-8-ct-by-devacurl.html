            <li>They add great volume to my hair!</li>
            <li>Wonderful clips!  </li>
            <li>These clips are the perfect way to solve that.  </li>
            <li>These are the best hair clips!  </li>
            <li>The clips did a great job!</li>
            <li>Great value and awesome products!</li>
            <li>The clips are great.</li>
            <li>These are great clips.  </li>
            <li>Clips with great grip.  </li>
            <li>They hold great</li>
            <li>These are great when trying to lift curls from the roots.</li>
            <li>They work great.</li>
            <li>They seem overpriced for what they are, but I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li>Great product, disgraceful price.</li>
            <li>Good size for clipping my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use great product</li>
            <li>This is good as they tend to grip better and stay where they should.</li>
            <li>These really work great!!!</li>
            <li>It is very fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>I find the pixie curl diffuser method to be more effective for medium length, curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Love these for my curly hair - using them all to twist my hair up in curls, pin them to my head with these clips, and sleep on them overnight.</li>
            <li>One way to make sure they do not pull or frizz your hair is to insert them like they&#x27;re pictured on the front of the package, almost perpendicular to your head.  </li>
            <li>It sure makes them easier to pull out and gives more volume as well.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and help my curly hair maintain lift on the top.</li>
            <li>But get easily tangled and stuck in my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Now if I DO end up seeing a HUGE difference between the cheaper clips and the Deva clips and the Deva clips are FAR more superior, I may give in and purchase the box of 50 Deva Clips.  </li>
            <li>They add lift to my baby fine s&#x27;wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>and I was so excited for them.</li>
            <li>However, in order to get the full lift you do have to leave them until your hair dries.  </li>
            <li>They are super sturdy and work well.</li>
            <li>These clips work great on my hair, which is thick but fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pain, but if you have the time totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>They are also very much stronger.</li>
            <li>Much higher quality than the cheaper metal clips that can rust.  </li>
            <li>Work exactly like it says they will.</li>
            <li>Okay, only once did a hair get caught in the spring.</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s no wrong way to use them.</li>
            <li>They are durable and perhaps larger in size than most, but I have never bought clips like these before, so I have nothing to compare them to  </li>
            <li>Good clip, but it couldn&#x27;t firmly hold my curls up.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for letting the curls on the top of your head air dry.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and have always struggled with it being too flat on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>The overall design is great, but of the roughness metal and the sharp edges of the teeth makes them break and tear your hair, even if you follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li>Helps give my long curly hair some volume on top</li>
            <li>No Poo shampoo, conditioner and styling products, I towel dry my hair and put these clips across the top of my head, close to the scalp to lift the hair while it dries.  </li>
            <li>Let it dry for a while and gently remove it for a lovely curl.</li>
            <li>While a little pricey for only 8 clips, these clips work great with the Devacurl system of products</li>
            <li>/&gt;They made of stainless steel, so they will not rust.  </li>
            <li>They really do hold your hair in place though.</li>
            <li>These clips are larger than the ones available at beauty supply or drug stores.</li>
            <li>These are stainless steel.</li>
            <li>These clips work really well.  </li>
            <li>Create as much volume as desired.</li>
            <li>NOTE--four stars because they really work, but</li>
            <li>They work much better than duckbills or any other clip.</li>
            <li>Just simple hair clips, nothing special for the high price.</li>
            <li>I finally splurged for these, and they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>However, once you get the hang of using them, they are useful for adding volume at the roots or freshening up curls that have gone flat.</li>
            <li>An old trick was to wear sunglasses on your head while your hair dried, but these clips give a much better end result.</li>
            <li>I use the DevaCurl system, and originally bought other clips (they were cheaper).</li>
            <li>These clips are super nice but they are heavy duty and too much for my thin curly hair.</li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve gotten the old fashioned ones.</li>
            <li>But overall I really like them.</li>
            <li>I also use them to change my natural part.</li>
            <li>I use these in the crown to give hair a natural looking boost while ajr drying or drying with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>These new clips are larger, easier to handle and hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, the clips are tight and can be challenging to remove without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered that I will need many more clips and am going to purchase a different brand that is less expensive since I can get 80 clips for only $6.</li>
            <li>minus one star because you can get these exact clips in bulk for like 6 dollars, something I found out only AFTER I bought them.  </li>
            <li>I thought these were a bit much at over $1/clip and will certainly not purchase 50 for almost $40.  </li>
            <li>It holds my upper hair higher therefore when dried my hair does not look flat</li>

            <li> These are substantial clips, but be careful because they can also get caught in your hair if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> They are stronger than any other brand of hair clips I bought and are bigger.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these clips along with several other Deva products to start myself out on the Deva Curl system.  </li>
            <li> so my curls dry away from my face rather than falling in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Can be used with a diffuser, hood dryer, or air dry.</li>
            <li> These worked to keep my roots lifted, and I have long coarse heavy curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The springs on them are extremely tight so it takes quite a bit of pressure to open them.</li>
            <li> Even though I removed the clips carefully they still snagged and broke off strands of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that with continued use the damage would be significant.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of heavy thick curly hair and these are the only clips that actually stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they are a bit expensive, but they are very well made and a lot bigger than the usual clips.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used these while my hair was drying to keep the curls from being weighed down and straightening out on my head.</li>
            <li> It pulls on the hair a little, but you just have to be patient removing them.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty...</li>
            <li> Hold firm, but don&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin flat hair....</li>
            <li> Just spritz a small clump of hair and wrap it around your finger and clip it at the roots.</li>
            <li> They do help give some lift to my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> These clips are horrible.  </li>
            <li> Awful</li>

            <li> Perfect companion to the Deva curly hair system.  Just the right size for letting the curls on the top of your head air dry.  Just enough clips, too!</li>
            <li> These had so much potential and I was so excited for them. The overall design is great, but of the roughness metal and the sharp edges of the teeth makes them break and tear your hair, even if you follow the instructions.  This is coming from a diehard Deva Curl user who has used these types of clips for ages for root volume.</li>
            <li> They are super sturdy and work well.</li>
            <li> I have thin flat hair....this helps bring the lift up in the middle that u need without a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use great product</li>

            <li> The clips are larger than ones sold in supermarkets, drugstores , etc.&lt;br /&gt;They made of stainless steel, so they will not rust.  I am satisfied,&lt;br /&gt;and will probably order another set.</li>
            <li> Helps give my long curly hair some volume on top</li>
            <li> The clips are great. It holds my upper hair higher therefore when dried my hair does not look flat</li>

            <li> These clips are horrible.  When I remove them they pull my hair out. I do not recommend buying these.  Awful</li>

            <li> Clips with great grip.  Good size for clipping my curly hair.</li>
            <li> These clips are larger than the ones available at beauty supply or drug stores. They are also very much stronger. The springs on them are extremely tight so it takes quite a bit of pressure to open them. This is good as they tend to grip better and stay where they should. However, it does take some getting used to them. I would recommend them over the drug store variety.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty... But get easily tangled and stuck in my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions in the Curly Girl book and DVD video to the letter. The Deva Clips did add lift/volume to the hair at the crown of my head and along my part. Even though I removed the clips carefully they still snagged and broke off strands of my hair. It is very fine. I am afraid that with continued use the damage would be significant. Would probably work on coarser hair. I find the pixie curl diffuser method to be more effective for medium length, curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are a bit expensive, but they are very well made and a lot bigger than the usual clips. At this price, I&#x27;ll try not to lose any.</li>
            <li> Love these for my curly hair - using them all to twist my hair up in curls, pin them to my head with these clips, and sleep on them overnight. They hold great - I wish they were in brown so I could wear them daily.</li>
            <li> Purchased with towel and three step system. Great value and awesome products!</li>
            <li> While a little pricey for only 8 clips, these clips work great with the Devacurl system of products</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use these properly yet as the result is not what it should be.</li>
            <li> These clips are super nice but they are heavy duty and too much for my thin curly hair. Should&#x27;ve gotten the old fashioned ones. They are smaller, lighter weight but have the same function.</li>
            <li> Wonderful clips!  Much higher quality than the cheaper metal clips that can rust.  These are stainless steel.</li>
            <li> These really work great!!!</li>

            <li> These clips work great on my hair, which is thick but fine.  One way to make sure they do not pull or frizz your hair is to insert them like they&#x27;re pictured on the front of the package, almost perpendicular to your head.  It sure makes them easier to pull out and gives more volume as well.</li>
            <li> Must have for &amp;#34;curly girls&amp;#34; following Lorraine Massey&#x27;s technique. These new clips are larger, easier to handle and hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled.  I use these in the crown to give hair a natural looking boost while ajr drying or drying with a diffuser.</li>
