            <li>I love in it really works</li>
            <li>I love the cream, results really shows.</li>
            <li>The most noticeable results for me were my &amp;#34;mommy pooch&amp;#34; not so much on the thigh area.</li>
            <li>I love it, it works really well</li>
            <li>The lotion smells good and it isn&#x27;t oily; which was a big concern for me.</li>
            <li>The cream came fast and I love it..</li>
            <li>Need to use it more religiously :)</li>
            <li>If I run out I&#x27;m definitely buying more!</li>
            <li>im telling you it works for me HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li>I just bought this product a couple of weeks ago and so far, I love the way it lessened the appearance of my stretch marks around my belly</li>
            <li>im seeing my results super fast!</li>
            <li>o feel a burning sensation when I apply it right after my shower</li>
            <li>Honestly feel like it&#x27;s doing its job as long as you rub in and place the wrap around it even helped some of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s best to use the product searingly a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have been using for only a week now and have noticed a huge difference in my legs!</li>
            <li>The first night using it with my wrap</li>
            <li>but i highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>My stomach started tingling tge first time i used it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 1 month no results as of yet may take more time</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li>First, Had I known this product was sent to me from Puerto Rico, I would have never purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying more and will recommend this product to anyone in need.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t any more special than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It certainly has not given any noticeable differences to the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>the cincher make THAT much of a difference?</li>
            <li>Too soon to really tell bit</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li>It feels like it is working, not seeing much results as yet.  </li>
            <li>Shipping fast</li>
            <li>Havent seen real results as of yet.</li>
            <li>I was using this product in conjunction with my Ann Cherry waist trainer, slim capsule spa treatments and red light therapy at planet beach, and a sensible diet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my review once I utilize the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>but this time not so much</li>
            <li>I hope i can see the results very soon 😉</li>
            <li>Okay so I measured my waist, and wrote it down.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I seen the diff , skin looks more firm, haven&#x27;t lost any inches</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>Nice product, very small bottle</li>
            <li>Only been using 2 weeks consistently.</li>
            <li>I only feel it work the first 3 minutes</li>
            <li>I so far like this product!</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>No results seen so far</li>
            <li>but when used with a shaping corset it makes me much firmer briefly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After further research, it appears that no cream will really get rid of your stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if I&#x27;ll lose inches or whatnot.</li>
            <li>I applied the cream and wrapped myself with clear wrap and only drank water and ate healthy foods, a fruit salad and drank a bottle of water, and a few hours later, I removed the wraps and measured my waist again, it went from being 47&#x27; to 38- 38 inches!</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy again after I&#x27;m done with the one I just got, first of all came in on time and second I have been using it for only 3 days and already see results no lie</li>
            <li>Fast delivery only tried so far did not irritate my skin left it on for 4 hours also used with the waist trainer and definitely helps break a extra sweat.</li>
            <li>cause have only used anout 4 times so far..</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t think my flatter stomach has been due to this product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, no stretch mark removal cream has really worked.</li>
            <li>but the few times I used it really seemed to make a difference in the amount I sweat from my stomach!</li>
            <li>Like the feel of this cream, aborbs fast and smells like muscle rub, also has a slight warming affect.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the clear plastic wrap under my waist cincher, but really do not see changes.</li>

            <li> No results seen so far</li>
            <li> but when used with a shaping corset it makes me much firmer briefly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After further research, it appears that no cream will really get rid of your stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if I&#x27;ll lose inches or whatnot.</li>
            <li> I applied the cream and wrapped myself with clear wrap and only drank water and ate healthy foods, a fruit salad and drank a bottle of water, and a few hours later, I removed the wraps and measured my waist again, it went from being 47&#x27; to 38- 38 inches!</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy again after I&#x27;m done with the one I just got, first of all came in on time and second I have been using it for only 3 days and already see results no lie</li>
            <li> Fast delivery only tried so far did not irritate my skin left it on for 4 hours also used with the waist trainer and definitely helps break a extra sweat.</li>
            <li> cause have only used anout 4 times so far..</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t think my flatter stomach has been due to this product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no stretch mark removal cream has really worked.</li>
            <li> but the few times I used it really seemed to make a difference in the amount I sweat from my stomach!</li>
            <li> Like the feel of this cream, aborbs fast and smells like muscle rub, also has a slight warming affect.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the clear plastic wrap under my waist cincher, but really do not see changes.</li>
            <li> my arms are much tighter but tummy only slimmed a little, but I think that is due to my body being used to my cardio workouts, not the cream.</li>
            <li> but this order recently is not as good as the first its the same container</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend this to other people who are struggling with extra tummy fat.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I see any difference using the caffeine cream, but I have high hopes that I will see some results soon.</li>
            <li> It cane earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if it actually helps wth circulation, breakdown of fatty cells or help with cellulitis.</li>
            <li> I work out but not very much.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of loose skin</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little bit bigger!</li>
            <li> then expected.</li>
            <li> The cream did not give the results I expected even with exercise thee times a week.</li>
            <li> Not really seeing the difference</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> so I wanted to do my due diligence.</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> and I see it getting tighter and even dark</li>
            <li> I applied it at least once a day for a month and saw no obvious change.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not to sure about this product, it has a watery base which I&#x27;m not sure the consistency should be this watery.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cream its a waste of money I read the reviews thinking it was going to work</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just a few days and have began to see results.</li>
            <li> Waste of time!</li>
            <li> I just got it so not sure of the results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the difference I&#x27;m noticing is from the product because I use it in conjunction with my waist cincher.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the cream worked.</li>
            <li> not sure how well it works yet</li>
            <li> Waste of money did not see no results!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Pointless ... it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet</li>
            <li> my stretch marks less noticeable is when I use fake tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> The feel is a cold little burn sensation</li>
            <li> but this helped my ugly dimples dispear</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it really works!</li>
            <li> Wow. I just ordered this cream and I got it a lot sooner then expected. It got the cream in 2 days.  Can&#x27;t wait to try this stuff out and start seeing results. I&#x27;ll write another review once I start seeing results. Because I just had my 3rd child 3 months ago and gained a lot of weight towards the end of my pregnancy so hopefully this stuff works along with the waist trainer :)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a change and am almost done with the product won&#x27;t buy agin</li>
            <li> I put this on every night after getting out of the shower and wrap my stomach with seran wrap and take off in the morning.. I have lost one inch each time!!! Total 3in Yayyy</li>
            <li> I love it. If I run out I&#x27;m definitely buying more! It cane earlier than expected. And has a great tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> I barely received this product and I love it!! The first night using it with my wrap i literally lost an inch off my waist... The feel is a cold little burn sensation but i highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> The cream did not give the results I expected even with exercise thee times a week. Perhaps it has to be use in combination with the waist cinched in addition to the wraps</li>
            <li> I purchased the cream its a waste of money I read the reviews thinking it was going to work very disappointed😒😒😒</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell, sort  if a root beer type of smell.  Didn&#x27;t see any difference and I used it daily until I finished it.  will not be ordering again</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the lotion. I have been using on a somewhat regular basis, but I can&#x27;t tell any deference yet. However I will continue to use it until it finishes and repost  my thoughts.</li>
            <li> Smells good it works ok</li>
            <li> My stomach started tingling tge first time i used it</li>
            <li> Only been using 2 weeks consistently. .firmer, moisturized tummy...cellulite appears to be diminishing! !happy with beginning results</li>
            <li> This Product is What I&#x27;m Telling You It&#x27;s Great!,, :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 1 month no results as of yet may take more time</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product and no damages. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I only feel it work the first 3 minutes</li>
            <li> I have tried many things for my cellulite and stretch marks but this does not work! I did everything by the book but still no results I get better results using homemade products! Waste of time!</li>
            <li> I love it it started working 3-5 days from using it i use it with saranwrap and put my steel bone corset on  a  corset the only thing that would truly train your waist not those latex cinchers... on for 8 hrs tones and tighten my abs i will get another bottle some ppl said it don&#x27;t work for them what work for others may not work for you im telling you it works for me HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any results yet but it smells good.</li>
            <li> The cream is wonderful and in just 4 weeks I am seeing results</li>
            <li> The moment I put this on you can feel it. I just got it so not sure of the results</li>
            <li> I wear this under my waist trainers and it seems to help a lot! Great product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any results as of yet.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product I&#x27;ve read some reviews that weren&#x27;t so good. However, it&#x27;s best to use the product searingly a little goes a long way. I use mines twice a day on two areas stomach and arms and I&#x27;ve been using it for two months ... Still have plenty left</li>
            <li> Received it earlier than expected so far it works ok, could use a bit more of an elaborate description as to how to effectively use the product.</li>
            <li> More of a question. Does adding sadan wrap unxer the cincher make THAT much of a difference? Too soon to really tell bit o feel a burning sensation when I apply it right after my shower</li>
            <li> OMG!!! I have been using for only a week now and have noticed a huge difference in my legs! Definitely would recommend...</li>
            <li> My stretch marks started fading away in 3 days , it works! I just wish the bottle was bigger that part I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> WELL I ONLY USED IT ONCE AND I RETURNED I, AND THEY GAVE MY NOT A PROMBLEM RETURNING !!!</li>
            <li> Used this for 3 weeks now and I don&#x27;t see a difference. Not worth it</li>
            <li> Do not use it often but it seems to be working</li>
            <li> I just got it so I don&#x27;t no yet, I will keep y&#x27;all up dated in two weeks should be enough time , to see a change .</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy, it does not work, used it for over 3 months faithly every day didn&#x27;t see any improvements</li>
            <li> Really works! I love it recommended to all my friends and I am definitely buying this again.</li>
            <li> great product works great</li>
            <li> The Cream came relatively quickly after placing my order, the packaging was excellent... I&#x27;m not to sure about this product, it has a watery base which I&#x27;m not sure the consistency should be this watery. I&#x27;m glad it has no odor, it&#x27;s light brown in color. I&#x27;m not sure if the difference I&#x27;m noticing is from the product because I use it in conjunction with my waist cincher. I use a healthy amount of the cream then I Saran wrap my entire stomach and put on my waist trainer.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 5 days along with my waist cincher and results are amazing already.</li>
            <li> Works well! You can feel the burning sensation once you put it on!</li>
            <li> I was allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I really don&#x27;t think my flatter stomach has been due to this product. I&#x27;ve also been working out and wearing a waist cincher</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I see any difference using the caffeine cream, but I have high hopes that I will see some results soon.</li>
            <li> $10.94 for one bottle?</li>
            <li> No results seen so far</li>
            <li> I really like it.. helped me a lot u also have to work out some but this helped my ugly dimples dispear, I couldn&#x27;t do it on my own I work out but not very much.</li>
            <li> Did not help with anything it said it would.</li>
            <li> I love everything I&#x27;ve received from Ann Chery. Quality line of products</li>
            <li> I really like it. I already see respite..</li>
            <li> I just reordered the product. I work out daily, pretty soon I will be able to see a one line definition of what&#x27;s supposed to be my abs....I think.</li>
            <li> great produce it really worked for me</li>
            <li> Okay so I measured my waist, and wrote it down. I applied the cream and wrapped myself with clear wrap and only drank water and ate healthy foods, a fruit salad and drank a bottle of water, and a few hours later, I removed the wraps and measured my waist again, it went from being 47&#x27; to 38- 38 inches! This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and the product is excellent. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the cream worked. I used it along with the waist training garment, and exercised 3 days a week.</li>
            <li> Product was as described!</li>
            <li> I like this dont know if it actually works but im stills trying it</li>
            <li> Love it  ... it works</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much but the few times I used it really seemed to make a difference in the amount I sweat from my stomach! I so far like this product!</li>
            <li> I totally love this product im seeing my results super fast! I use it with my waist cincher also from ann chery!!!</li>
            <li> Dont see any difference</li>
            <li> It has been making my skin very soft and flawless and its tightening up my belly area</li>
            <li> Great service. I love this product. Will always have in my home.</li>
            <li> I use it with the clear plastic wrap under my waist cincher, but really do not see changes.</li>
            <li> The delivery came on time  no complaints</li>
            <li> Arrived on time..not sure how well it works yet cause have only used anout 4 times so far..</li>
            <li> It feels like it is working, not seeing much results as yet.  Need to use it more religiously :)</li>
            <li> thanks it works very good</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help fade my stretch marks. I ordered it with a waist trainer. I put it on 2x a day (morning &amp; night) with or without my waist trainer. I do think that it helped fade my stetch marks and will be ordering another bottle. I don&#x27;t really think it tightened my skin, but I do think it did firm it up.</li>
            <li> Waste of money did not see no results!</li>
            <li> I dont think this product did anything for me it kind of tingled but i didnt see a difference at all</li>
            <li> it works well for a day or two.  It doesnt actually make me lose weight but when used with a shaping corset it makes me much firmer briefly.</li>
            <li> Smooth looking skin light weight .light scent</li>
            <li> I love in it really works</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good with Ann cherry</li>
            <li> my arms are much tighter but tummy only slimmed a little, but I think that is due to my body being used to my cardio workouts, not the cream. works great for me otherwise.</li>
            <li> Caffeine was like the last ingredient, it shouldn&#x27;t be called Caffeine Cream.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t work.  Won&#x27;t order from that seller again.</li>
            <li> Good product can&#x27;t really tell a difference but I can tell it makes me sweat slot more..</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy again after I&#x27;m done with the one I just got, first of all came in on time and second I have been using it for only 3 days and already see results no lie I have a lot of loose skin and I see it getting tighter and even dark stretch marks disappear.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just a few days and have began to see results. I use it around my mid-drift area and upper thighs. I will be purchasing this product again. :-)</li>
            <li> What should have been obvious before buying it, is this product doesn&#x27;t work lol I applied it at least once a day for a month and saw no obvious change. I&#x27;ve found that to be the case with most of these creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After further research, it appears that no cream will really get rid of your stretch marks. The reason being, stretch marks are not on the surface of your skin. The only proven method of removing them is some sort of surgery like laser-removal or a tummy tuck (removing the skin entirely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a paler complexion and the only way I&#x27;ve seen that my skin looks thicker, tighter, and my stretch marks less noticeable is when I use fake tanning lotions. Other than that, no stretch mark removal cream has really worked.</li>
            <li> Yuck. First, Had I known this product was sent to me from Puerto Rico, I would have never purchased it.  Second, I didn&#x27;t like the smell of lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice product, very small bottle I thought it was a little bit bigger! I believe that it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost quite a bit of weight and needed to tighten and tone some extra skin and let me tell you I love this stuff. I started to see results immediately. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone. And I just bought another bottle</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!!! THIS IS MY SECOND YEAR USING ANN CHERY AND I HAD REMARKABLE RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;-Smoother/Tighter skin on my thighs&lt;br /&gt;-Flatter/firm tummy&lt;br /&gt;-No cellulite&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend using this with a waist trainer during a workout and apply again after a shower at night and re apply in the AM!!!!</li>
            <li> Not rely seeing any results</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS CREAM! I use it under my corset at night. It;s so bomb!</li>
            <li> I seen the diff , skin looks more firm, haven&#x27;t lost any inches but I&#x27;m guessing that would happen if I would workout.. Lol&lt;br /&gt;But over all I&#x27;m happy with what I see and the product ..&lt;br /&gt; Only 4 starts because I wish the bottle would&#x27;ve been bigger for the price I paid..</li>
            <li> It did not tingle at all. I wear it with my Ann Chery waist cincher and it still did nothing. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Like the feel of this cream, aborbs fast and smells like muscle rub, also has a slight warming affect.  I haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if it actually helps wth circulation, breakdown of fatty cells or help with cellulitis.</li>
            <li> I love the cream, results really shows.</li>
            <li> Shipping fast but I didn&#x27;t see any change to fare only use couple times .</li>
            <li> Honestly feel like it&#x27;s doing its job as long as you rub in and place the wrap around it even helped some of my stretch marks. It arrived on time it&#x27;s worth it for a great price too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! It doesn&#x27;t deserve even one star</li>
            <li> No change,  smells like ben gay</li>
            <li> theres not a big diffrence</li>
            <li> used it a week and have noticed a difference in appearance of the skin.</li>
            <li> Very very smooth on the skin assuming it&#x27;s to be worn with a wrap butt I like the feel</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for almost two week and i dont see any difference on my stomach, it probably takes time to see the difference</li>
            <li> Noche visto resultados notables aún.</li>
            <li> This cream is great you actually feel it working I lost 1 inch off my waist since I began</li>
            <li> Havent seen real results as of yet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change or improvement</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping me to do what it says it can do.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost three weeks now and I dont think i can see any difference! I will keep using it until it finish,,,however, I don&#x27;t think it works!</li>
            <li> Not really seeing the difference</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, I started putting on every night and I suddenly got a rash from it. I am just going to finish the product but only wear it once or twice a week. Not what I expected</li>
            <li> lOVE IT !!!!  I WILL SOON NEED TO ORDER MORE THE SENSATION ON MY BELLY FELT LIKE THE FAT WAS MELTING OFF AND SMELLS VERY GOOD</li>
            <li> I just bought this product a couple of weeks ago and so far, I love the way it lessened the appearance of my stretch marks around my belly and it&#x27;s helping slimming my waist. I&#x27;m definitely buying more and will recommend this product to anyone in need.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent delivery</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away! I was using this product in conjunction with my Ann Cherry waist trainer, slim capsule spa treatments and red light therapy at planet beach, and a sensible diet. The most noticeable results for me were my &amp;#34;mommy pooch&amp;#34; not so much on the thigh area. I&#x27;d def purchase again!</li>
            <li> Effective and affordable</li>
            <li> 7/2015 Fast delivery only tried so far did not irritate my skin left it on for 4 hours also used with the waist trainer and definitely helps break a extra sweat. Update later on how it works</li>
            <li> Pointless ... it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> Yes I was amazed by the results from the Ann Cherry Caffeine Cream I used the cream along with the Ann Cherry waist trainer the results were amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet but it smells yummy</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I purchased this product based on reviews so I wanted to do my due diligence. I love it, it works really well and I can see a difference. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference at all even with religious application.</li>
            <li> Just got it about a week ago and its goin pretty good I see results..</li>
            <li> came on time product is great</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results in using this product..</li>
            <li> I got this lotion very quickly and that was satisfying. I&#x27;ve been applying it both generously and religiously. It isn&#x27;t any more special than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used. It certainly has not given any noticeable differences to the appearance of my skin. It smells nice and isn&#x27;t oily or sticky so I use it as an after sun moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So far this cream seems to be good. I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in cellulite in the areas used. I think I&#x27;m going to try more</li>
            <li> Works amazing and makes your belly look much firmer. Definitely would recommend this to other people who are struggling with extra tummy fat. Works best if you apply it after a shower.</li>
            <li> Works amazing! Definitely can feel the burn and works great when applied and you put saran wrap over. I definitely noticed that it has helped burn the fat on my stomach</li>
            <li> Not impress, the smell is good but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change on my cellulite</li>
            <li> Works great n feels great too!!!</li>
            <li> I joined the fab of waist training and bought this product to combine with the trainer. I haven&#x27;t received the trainer yet but I did use the lotion on my belly along with a Pro-Foam zip-up trainer I used for months. I mowed the lawn yesterday and I was left sweaty! It&#x27;s too early to tell if I&#x27;ll lose inches or whatnot. The lotion smells good and it isn&#x27;t oily; which was a big concern for me. I&#x27;ll update my review once I utilize the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Work great! Wear it under workout belt before and during exercising.</li>
            <li> It worked great the first I purchased it but this order recently is not as good as the first its the same container but the product does not have the tingling sensation and is thicker .... This is why I purchased it again because I liked the sensation and it worked but this time not so much</li>
            <li> I hope i can see the results very soon 😉</li>
            <li> I loved it I seen results right away</li>
            <li> I seen no results ! Very disappointed. I was not expecting it to be so lil.</li>
            <li> The cream came fast and I love it..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    </ol>
