            <li>I really love these irons!  </li>
            <li>, my hair looks super good, for the price</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to return it.</li>
            <li>I thought we would of used it more often.</li>
            <li>Just perfect for my daughter&#x27;s short do.</li>
            <li>but that was my mistake because the measurements where on the description.&lt;br /&gt;its perfect and considering getting a bigger one.</li>
            <li>and I immediately fell in love with them.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li>quick shipment and great price for what is worth.....</li>
            <li>I ordered this for travelling and it is ok but full size</li>
            <li>It would be fine to use on just bangs.  </li>
            <li>Instead it came in a huge vinyl gift</li>
            <li>I have it in the larger size and it is great</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see the price, I ignored the size.</li>
            <li>works good but need a larger one.</li>
            <li>They provide just the right amount of heat to give a smooth and silky feel and appearance.  </li>
            <li>They are so PRECISE and they really get the job done!  </li>
            <li>Really gives my hair that shine look..the iron really does a good job on heating up fast.</li>
            <li>just have to much hair!!</li>
            <li>We rarely use it.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling but just too small.</li>
            <li>There are several mini-irons on the market, most with dual-voltage.  </li>
            <li>it was exactly what I thought was going to be.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>Love this tiny hair iron.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I ordered these CHI flat irons!</li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t do the job to straight it.  </li>
            <li>I called Farouk Systems thinking it was the real thing</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say too much because I bought it for a gift and haven&#x27;t given it to the person yet.</li>
            <li>cause it doesent take that much place.</li>
            <li>Thanks chi and Amazon for taking care of my delivery issue.</li>
            <li>Great for small hair but not long hair, took forever ....</li>
            <li>, simply an \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; switch that heats up to one fixed temperature (which feels nowhere near the 400 degrees or so on most quality irons)</li>
            <li>This iron would be ok for travel and a few strand quick fix possibly.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend I ownn exact item prior and ha\d to buy again.</li>
            <li>The smaller plates on the Chi make it easier to get to the hairs without burning my forehead, but this is an average flat iron, at best, and not worth $60.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s small enough to get all of my baby hair got to love that!</li>
            <li>Go on their website and click \\&quot;Locations\\&quot; to find one near you.</li>
            <li>i will not be purchasing anything from amazon directly anymore</li>
            <li>This flat iron did not get hot enough to straighten it.</li>
            <li>This iron does an adequate job of straightening the hair, but if I am careful I can get the same results with my standard 1.5&#x27; Sedu or 2&#x27; HAI iron.</li>
            <li>This iron is really too small to work on anyone&#x27;s hair that is not already relatively straight.  </li>
            <li>So.... no adjustable heat setting,  will not straigten my hair,  the hinged end will pinch your hand if you&#x27;re not careful, AND no  thermal storage case.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> To small and not a real Chi Have return label ready for shipping.</li>
            <li> I have long frizzy hair and this iron</li>
            <li> Thanks for the small size!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected and doesn&#x27;t emit nearly enough heat, so I found it pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not Worth it to buy the big one.</li>
            <li> It broke less than a year later.</li>
            <li> â€™s a little smaller than expected</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected it to be</li>
            <li> I tried cheap one really expensive ones none of them work like this one I curl my hair everyday with it !!</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> When it is on, it emmits an odd odor like plastic is burning.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bough other products in the past, and always had problems.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all very small.</li>
            <li> The iron is to small.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll just have to go through the process and spend the money having to buy another one in no time. :-/</li>
            <li> I have used Chi straightening irons in the past and purchased the 5/8 plate iron specifically for bangs and shorter hairs around the front of my face.    </li>
            <li> The regular size Chi iron works well, but this one is useless.</li>
            <li> but this product is too small and does not do the job.</li>
            <li> If you have very thick or difficult hair, then I would advise using the regular size Chi</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I will have to order something different.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed .</li>
            <li> Be wary.</li>
            <li> Turns out the serial number was a fake.</li>
            <li> It was a fake.</li>
            <li> maybe I read it wrong</li>
            <li> Also I was disappointed to discover there is no temperature switch/dial</li>
            <li> It is the worst purchase I have ever made.</li>

            <li> I was so excited to see the price, I ignored the size. I received the iron and got to work....works good but need a larger one. I like the portability of this one, and it works really good just have to much hair!!</li>
            <li> This iron would be ok for travel and a few strand quick fix possibly.  I have long frizzy hair and this iron just didn&#x27;t do the job to straight it.  The iron is to small.</li>

            <li> I bought this thinking it was a good option for travel, but didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s not set up with dual-voltage.  There are several mini-irons on the market, most with dual-voltage.  I&#x27;m disappointed that I will have to order something different.</li>
            <li> This iron is really too small to work on anyone&#x27;s hair that is not already relatively straight.  It would be fine to use on just bangs.  It doesn&#x27;t have a temperature gauge.  It only has an on or off switch.  When it is on, it emmits an odd odor like plastic is burning.</li>
            <li> Be wary. I bought a CHI Flatiron on Amazon last year.  It broke less than a year later. My Chi before this one had lasted 6 years! I called Farouk Systems thinking it was the real thing and they would honor the warranty.... Turns out the serial number was a fake. It was a fake. They shared with me their certified retailers- No online retailers are, including anything on AMAZON. Go on their website and click \\&quot;Locations\\&quot; to find one near you. JCPenny is one of them. Don&#x27;t waste your money here. You&#x27;ll just have to go through the process and spend the money having to buy another one in no time. :-/</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected and doesn&#x27;t emit nearly enough heat, so I found it pretty much useless. Definitely not worth the price. And my seller didn&#x27;t \\&quot;guarantee satisfaction\\&quot; so I wasn&#x27;t able to return it.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling but just too small. We rarely use it. I thought we would of used it more often.</li>
            <li> So.... no adjustable heat setting,  will not straigten my hair,  the hinged end will pinch your hand if you&#x27;re not careful, AND no  thermal storage case.  Mini suggests it&#x27;s for travel and no travel storage case!!!!????.....  Instead it came in a huge vinyl gift case????!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going to be donated.</li>

            <li> Bought this for a Christmas gift for a friend. I&#x27;ve bough other products in the past, and always had problems. Stick with a chi and you&#x27;ll never have a problem.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly wavy. This flat iron did not get hot enough to straighten it. The regular size Chi iron works well, but this one is useless.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for my daughter&#x27;s short do.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I would highly recommend I ownn exact item prior and ha\d to buy again. Best ever for quick fix.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all very small. Should have read how big it was before buying the hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I have it in the larger size and it is great but this product is too small and does not do the job.</li>
            <li> Great purchase!!! It&#x27;s a very good iron, my hair looks super good, for the price it&#x27;s not Worth it to buy the big one.</li>

            <li> I really love these irons!  They were recommended by one of my clients.  Actually she allowed me to use hers and I immediately fell in love with them.  They are so PRECISE and they really get the job done!  They provide just the right amount of heat to give a smooth and silky feel and appearance.  I am so glad that I ordered these CHI flat irons!</li>

            <li> Love this tiny hair iron. I can take it when we are traveling cause it doesent take that much place. And the heat is instantly.</li>
            <li> The best travel iron on the market ! I tried cheap one really expensive ones none of them work like this one I curl my hair everyday with it !! Really gives my hair that shine look..the iron really does a good job on heating up fast. I have really short hair and it&#x27;s small enough to get all of my baby hair got to love that!
