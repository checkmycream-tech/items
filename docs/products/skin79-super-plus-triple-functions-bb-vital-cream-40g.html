            <li>which cream is best suited for your skin color and type.</li>
            <li>As for the skin79 orange label, it was stated on the skin79 website that the skin should be well moisturized before applying, thus having the moisturizing cream and sunscreen is just perfect before using it.  </li>

            <li>It also has spf, which makes it great for summer!</li>
            <li>ALL OF THEM ARE VERY GOOD!</li>
            <li>Best BB cream I have found to date</li>
            <li>In conclusion with the skin79 BB cream, it is very good BB cream</li>
            <li>It has very good coverage though, if that is what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>My mother is 48, caucasian, very fair, and has rosacea.</li>
            <li>This product has very good coverage.</li>
            <li>I am very fair</li>
            <li>I think that this product is great, and I even did a 5 star review bragging about how awesome the texture is, but I deleted my review because it was misleading.  </li>
            <li>but it looks great because it brightens me around my eyes but blends into the rest of my face perfectly.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, great buildable coverage and best of all leaves a nice matte</li>

            <li>It worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>The BB Cream came in very cute packaging from Korea and there were four samples with it!  </li>
            <li>but I am very pleased with my service from amazon!</li>
            <li>The shipping and service were great.  </li>
            <li>I think it is great for the skin but not so great to use during daytime.</li>
            <li>&quot; LOL yes with a g.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it&#x27;s great if you have to use foundation in your day to day.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>it is great for my oily skin</li>
            <li>Skin79 products had great reviews</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - I&#x27;m one happy gal.</li>
            <li>, the seller was great.  </li>
            <li>Which is great since I am NC15.  </li>
            <li>I am writing this review for my mom since she is not too great with computers, but she still wanted to give a review.</li>
            <li>when my mother saw how great my skin looked, she wanted to try a BB cream as well.</li>
            <li>It also dries semi-matte which is great because it just glows instead of looking oily.</li>
            <li>Great for my skin.</li>
            <li>Another thing, this smells really great.</li>
            <li>If you like citrusy scents, this will be great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smelled great, will give it props for that.</li>
            <li>it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin look great</li>
            <li>Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>but I still did I still came out great</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>so this works great for me.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>For the color, it was great on my hand.</li>
            <li>and it still looks great for happy hour.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream has great coverage</li>
            <li>but when you do you&#x27;ll be so happy.  </li>
            <li>ANOTHER GREAT BB CREAM PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>all around great product, 1st bb cream ive ever used</li>
            <li>Love it!!  </li>
            <li>Its the best foundation I&#x27;ve purchased to match my skin tone which is very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>This product goes amazing with my skin tone!</li>
            <li>The coverage was amazing!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think using a brush with this product would be successful, and a sponge would just be wasteful.</li>
            <li>This is the best, most silky cream for porcelain skin tone.</li>
            <li>it stays nice for hours!</li>
            <li>but this bb cream didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at alll  :o)</li>
            <li>love the packaging, great coverage!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the scent was pleasant, not too scented but didnt smell like makeup either.</li>
            <li>Amazing price, great product</li>
            <li>though I didn&#x27;t like this cream I think it does a good job controlling oily</li>
            <li>I have fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Fair</li>
            <li>This product is not, I repeat, IS NOT, for truly fair skinned gals.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite all that, yes, it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I like to recommend this BB cream to who has a fair skin.</li>
            <li>Good Luck~</li>
            <li>I found the color a bit too light, but the coverage was great!</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t be too fair for my color</li>
            <li>i find that the best way to apply this is with your fingers in a light swiping motion in one direction.</li>
            <li>If you have fair skin color, this well work really good on you.</li>
            <li>This gave me good coverage and stays put.</li>
            <li>It feels good to have on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s drier, but it may be good.</li>
            <li>It appears to work just as good as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I had one pimple that this covered beautifully with a couple layers/dabs on top of it.</li>
            <li>It is my second purchase form this seller and they are awesome and of course those creams are excellent!  </li>
            <li>I liked the coverage of the orange best but all of skin79 are too light.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product for someone with more oily skin..</li>
            <li>This one will be great for summer since it is a more matte finish.</li>
            <li>This is authentic Skin 79 and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so (surprisingly) happy with it that I just bought another one :)</li>
            <li>I purchased this product about a month ago and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Based on my skin tone (extremely fair), she thought this would be the best match for a first timer.  </li>
            <li>I really do love this because the coverage it great.</li>
            <li>Very light and very effective.</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be good because it gave a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>Also very nice the Seller included MORE samples than they had in their description.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have used the BB detox cleanser and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE this BB cream!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better my face looks!</li>
            <li>I really Love this product!</li>
            <li>okay!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>So much more simpler in the morning (and money saving since I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying all these additional products!)</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It is, however, perfect for those of you who have light beige skin, and who tan fairly easy...</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>and I thank God that the creator of this amazing product was born with the wisdom to make it.</li>
            <li>My husband even noticed, that i look fresh and perfect this days :)</li>
            <li>finish.&lt;br /&gt;Lightly scented with a nice texture,suitable for fair/light skin tones.</li>
            <li>I tried many BB Creams from this brand and loved all of them - except this one.  </li>
            <li>so it spreads nicely.</li>
            <li>I have found that applying it with my fingers can cause it to look streaky, so I dab it on with a makeup sponge to get nice coverage.</li>
            <li>Some of the marks I get can honestly stay for months but with this I have seen them fade dramatically faster.</li>
            <li>Your skin has a pearl type glow to it and it feels nice.</li>
            <li>and it still has staying power on its own.  </li>
            <li>But when I look in the mirrow, I cannot believe how good my skin looks, better than I have ever seen it and</li>
            <li>It gives a very nice light to medium coverage that leaves a dewy finish.</li>
            <li>This is very good pruduct, it matches my skin tone very well!</li>
            <li>(I use a darker toned finishing powder than what I normally use and that gives me a perfect</li>
            <li>/&gt;However if you have normal skin and aren&#x27;t acne prone this is perfect for you!</li>
            <li>It is okay on my oily/combinations skin, it feels very light textured!</li>
            <li>I like the consistency and the fact that it covers most of my blemishes very well, but it doesn&#x27;t match my skintone perfectly.</li>
            <li>She is super happy with the bb cream, she no longer needs to use primer, concealer and pounds of foundation to hide her redness.</li>
            <li>Over all I will never use this product and it smells very strongly of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>rather keep using my  Lioele and my Peter Thomas Roth, they are the best for far!</li>
            <li>The consistency of the cream is great, smells good, and high in SPF.</li>
            <li>light - it works for me because I am very fair, but it may be too light in the summer when I am getting more</li>
            <li>I am able to wear this alone and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizer/ sunscreen/ make-up I have ever used!*$&amp;@%</li>
            <li>i am sure to buy a product i tried and liked before.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I will sometimes use a finishing powder when I want more of a matte finish.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best and most cost effective.</li>
            <li>and I liked that better.  </li>
            <li>It had great skin benefits, good coverage, felt moisturizing and looked very natural.</li>
            <li>Bought this on with the higher XP for my mom for Christmas and her skin looks much more even with whitening tint in it and is good for you!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, completely covering, and blends into her skin perfectly (she is very light).  </li>
            <li>I tried so many BB creams, and so far, this is the best color match.</li>
            <li>This is a great product  , Pale but very good, you can add your own color with a tinted primer</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, the products coverage was just like that of a foundation but very light weight on the skin.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to wear with matte finish.  </li>
            <li>And the seller was very nice and the shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>Very very light.</li>
            <li>, this is very light.</li>
            <li>It blends well and goes on easily, and I have already noticed an amazing difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>for this bb cream, it is a very light color - as most people will tell you.  </li>
            <li>I love the look and no makeup needed.</li>
            <li>like, most of the time when I buy makeup shades that say \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; or \\&quot;fair\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more the medium/heavy side.  </li>
            <li>If you are, I say you&#x27;re better off not wasting your money for a product you have to hide under layers of makeup.  </li>
            <li>of Application:  Missha is better, I can use only one pump and apply all over my face to have a perfect finish.  </li>
            <li>I basically use BB creams instead of foundation, and they are better than foundation in providing so many properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one I got was legit, many of seoulglamour&#x27;s things are.  </li>
            <li>And on the box, when it says \\&quot;Triple Functions\\&quot; MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>still better then any foundation i tried, even Lancome, Ester Lauder and Chanel)</li>
            <li>I love this bb cream.</li>
            <li>I love about this BB cream</li>
            <li>still love the medium coverage and neutral undertone as well as the oil control.</li>
            <li>OK now for the review.</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>The price is also not outrageous.</li>
            <li>You can add more and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Revlon Colorstay in Ivory is the next best makeup in color and texture, but of course it doesn&#x27;t have all the added SPF and benefits of BB cream.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I got more acne than before.</li>
            <li>I am sure, I will recommend this product to my friend.  </li>
            <li>For peace of mind,  I will look for a BB cream from a reputable company in the USA that has a much better selection of hues and try again.  </li>
            <li>so I wear this over the top of a primer and then put a bit of powder over the top and</li>
            <li>so this wasn&#x27;t the appropriate Skin79 BB cream for me</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Korean skin care and this is my fave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>You can blend it with a favorite tinted moisturizer to get the desired hue.</li>
            <li>With UVA and UVB protection -  Most sunscreens leave you feeling oily.</li>
            <li>It covers and works way better than foundation makeup.</li>
            <li>but since using this, I&#x27;ve been breaking out much more and have noticed my skin getting worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad I gave it a try</li>
            <li>I wish they had some more tint variations.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like it because of the color, but some people may have more luck.</li>
            <li>Plus, I LOVE that it&#x27;s SPF 50!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>and I have to wait for more stock to come in before it ships.</li>
            <li>I love how it even it looks even after dabbing more in some areas because with foundation you can always tell where you added more.</li>
            <li>It was moisturizing for sure</li>
            <li>and this one does have slightly more coverage,</li>
            <li>If you use more than 1 layer of this, you will need a finishing/setting powder, which Skin79 does sell.</li>
            <li>This does have a more pinkish color, which I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>and I am in LOVE.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something magical about this BB cream.</li>
            <li>This stuff matches even better</li>
            <li>and I think the coverage might be better.</li>
            <li>It also seems to have a nicer, more even coverage.</li>
            <li>so I could give a more educated review, but there ya go :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use this when I&#x27;m tanner in the summer (</li>
            <li>you do need to make sure you wash your face well after a day of wear.</li>
            <li>The gold one lasts a bit longer but is a bit more drying.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love that it also has SPF as I am so fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also provides better coverage.</li>
            <li>I love BB cream</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br</li>
            <li>more foundation on top of that</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t ever change it. :)</li>
            <li>Most of them would make me break out on my chin.</li>
            <li>so I add some tinted moisturizer or just dust bronzer on top.</li>
            <li>This is ok.  </li>
            <li>I like the gold one better.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly it didnt break me out!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is different from any BB or CC cream or foundation I&#x27;ve tried in a wonderful way.  </li>
            <li>Think Anna and Elsa from Frozen; Elsa is more of a pink/cool undertone, and Anna is more yellow/</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this BB cream.</li>
            <li>This one is for sure the legit one.</li>
            <li>For sure, i&#x27;ll be buying again from Thinkpretty.</li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s winter, I&#x27;m sure that is not helping either, but I&#x27;m considering giving the gold label and try and saving this for the warmer months.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>The gold label was more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Does seem kind of light beige going on it</li>
            <li>It blends in very nicely, and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The packaging is super cute too!</li>
            <li>I loved my first one.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty fair complexion.</li>
            <li>I thought my foundation was a pretty good match, but</li>
            <li>The color is pretty fair for the summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very yellow and light when it comes out, but after it oxidizes and blends in it matches my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>First off - great quick shipping -I ordered this on the 11th and received it on the 22nd.  </li>
            <li>I also want to state that the color is very light-- even light for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>in addtion, when you put it on, it&#x27;s very cool to feel.</li>
            <li>Im very fair skinned, and this is the only foundation i found that doesn&#x27;t have an orange tinge to it.</li>
            <li>too light for me but great spf 50 and nice coverage overall.</li>
            <li>MOST IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li>I ordered this from Seoulglamour and was so happy when it arrived 4 weeks early</li>
            <li>I love the texture and coverage of this cream but it is extremely light.  </li>
            <li>It stays on the skin very well, moisturizes, while keeping your skin fairly matte.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for those who are much beyond the fair side on the complexion spectrum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This all combined with the price makes this the best money I have every spent on my face!e best money I have every spent on my face!</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian, but tan easily</li>
            <li>I have tried only two BB creams, Missha Perfect Cover and this one, and I think it will be useful for those who are searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, the main reason why I bought this cream was because of all the rave reviews from \\&quot;fair skinned\\&quot; girls.  </li>
            <li>Too great actually--I don&#x27;t like foundation in general</li>
            <li>I even use it to mask my dark circle, and it&#x27;s works perfect.</li>
            <li>My daughter is much better at applying a full coverage product like this.</li>
            <li>I can go a full work day without touching up</li>
            <li>This highlighted every fine line on my face and settled on the sides of my nostrils like nobody&#x27;s business, looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I will say, that my super&#x3D;pale skin looked just fine with this color match.</li>
            <li>The orange label has excellent coverage, and definitely does not have the \\&quot;grey\\&quot; color issue for me, even upon first application.  </li>
            <li>If you have a warmer skin tone, this is probably a fine choice.</li>
            <li>The coverage is pertty good, and gives a natural skin look!</li>
            <li>It is light weight and goes on easily and smoothly with medium coverage for blemish.  </li>
            <li>It may take a little experiment to figure out your best color in this line</li>
            <li>If I get a little oily by end of day I use the Skin79 powder compact, oil gone, look is perfect.  </li>
            <li>also got several free samples, which is great.  </li>
            <li>Overall, cheap price and great coverage.</li>
            <li>Great cream but only for people with extremely light skin.</li>
            <li>I used this product for about a week, primarily wearing it under powder.  </li>
            <li>It does not feel heavy on my face and makes my skin look flawless, even when I&#x27;m breaking out.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, I get this fabulous lit-from-within glow that doesn&#x27;t look sparkly or shiny--just a smooth, youthful complexion.</li>
            <li>, it is for light skinned,</li>
            <li>It never slides out from my face after few hours and my face stays perfectly touchable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but makes a difference.</li>
            <li>it is smooth and light</li>
            <li>and I am happy to finally find a product that truly does it all.  </li>
            <li>but the inside gold part came free from the orange exterior and flew across my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It also feels light on your skin, sometimes I forget that I even have it on.</li>
            <li>The reason it is receiving 4 starts is because of its light tint.</li>
            <li>I believe it will not be appropriate for everyone, good only for women with light medium skin tones or even ivory.</li>
            <li>light in color - if you even have a hint of a tan you&#x27;ll look washed out&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also leave a Matti look meaning shine free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 with yellow/neutral undertones and light skin (in MAC around nc15-20, although their colors look peachy on me), and I have combination skin.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the coverage</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li>Its light</li>
            <li>and it is still too light for me.</li>
            <li>This orange label is better for those golden tones.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for all skin type with porcelain and light color skin.</li>
            <li>I found this BB cream to be way too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It dries matte so all you need is a light dusting of powder to set</li>
            <li>A coworker introduced me to BB cream, and I liked it so much</li>
            <li>and this was a touch too light on me.</li>
            <li>She switched back to a brand available at the cosmetic counter but loved this so much better</li>
            <li>It just looks like you naturally have good</li>
            <li>Skin79 BB creams are far superior to what passes for BB creams from Maybelline and L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>I very rarely have pimples and I&#x27;d say my skin is \\&quot;normal\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The color is also lighter than the Hot Pink version, which will not work for everyone but is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also liked that this particular product had SPF</li>
            <li>After having tried the hot pink and silver Skin79 BB creams, I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>It went on super light and then even after oxidation was still to light.</li>
            <li>I love Missha, but I like skin79 orange label as well, if I haven&#x27;t found Missha first.  </li>
            <li>And NO breakouts :) ;)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to try it this weekend.</li>
            <li>I think this would be good for a short amount of time, maybe a date night or a school picture, but it seems that over time it looses its flawless appearance and looks messy.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it for weddings or a night out in town because of the SPF which is not camera friendly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes sure your skintone has more of a warm yellow/golden undertone than a pink undertone.  </li>
            <li>The samples of the gold label were impressive; the pink didn&#x27;t really do much for me, seemed a bit light.</li>
            <li>I even use my fingers (clean) to pat spots around a nose</li>
            <li>However, if the pink bottle has the more rosey cream, this one has a plaster whitish one that does not look too good, does not blend in as well, and makes your face look greasy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a great everyday healthy makeup/sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to continue using my primer, just a clean face with my moisturizer, apply my BB cream</li>
            <li>Because my skin looked naturally clean like with no make up.</li>
            <li>and I own many Asian bb creams.  </li>
            <li>I have the pink cream, and it was great.</li>
            <li>Golden Fair in Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>Totally recommend this BB for fair and dry-normal-combination with oily zones skin.</li>
            <li>I am fair to medium with yellow undertone.</li>
            <li>Ordered Skin75 BB Balm on 4/1/12 &amp; it was delivered on 4/8/12, was pleased with fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>this is an advantage as well as sweet</li>
            <li>The color is pretty light, I am Irish and fair skinned and it is too light for me.</li>
            <li>I always like to do some contouring with any foundation because it just gives you more dimension to your face and brings out areas that make your face look much nicer.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and this was okay in controlling it.</li>
            <li>I kept hearing good things about this and decided I&#x27;d finally try it out, thinking I could replace my foundation with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I really wanted to love this</li>
            <li>It also makes my face look much brighter and more awake.  </li>
            <li>It has a light fresh scent that does fade.</li>
            <li>haha :-)  </li>
            <li>First and foremost, again, I&#x27;d like to say that Seoulglamour delivered this product very quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I used very small amount and applied three times to get perfect finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually have a very fair skin colour) with a strong yellow tinge.</li>
            <li>#: After I turned back to use Missha, I have a second thought on the coverage that Skin79 orange and Missha perfect cover are equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>would never recommend this to anyone over 30 unless they had super greasy skin and needed to control it.</li>
            <li>There are a couple quick quizzes and comparisons you can take online with a quick google search if you&#x27;re unsure.  </li>
            <li>I received the product fairly quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li>I did try it on my daughter who has a darker skin tone than myself (she has a nice tan/beige complexion) to see if it really were self adjusting and didn&#x27;t get very satisfactory results.</li>
            <li>However, they sent me a sample of the gold label super 79 bb cream</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to love this and really did love the way my skin looked the first day I tried it.</li>
            <li>The good:&lt;br /&gt;- Great coverage (covers my freckles and red spots)&lt;br /&gt;- Light feeling and natural looking&lt;</li>
            <li>It seems light at first but quiclkly absorbs into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Be aware, the product is lightly scented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light in color</li>
            <li>This is the first bb cream I&#x27;ve had to mix with a darker one because it was too light.  </li>
            <li>I now need to order a new bottle, hopefully this time it will be authentic.</li>
            <li>but I always put something to make my face look more lively.</li>
            <li>MakeupAlley has tons of more detailed reviews on this BB cream, but here are the bare bones of it in my experience -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if applied with full coverage, you dnt need a lot of this product per use, its very blendable with light hand and drys with powder finish.</li>
            <li>One thing to to be aware of is this is a fair color with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other skin 72 BB Creams and loved them (pink &amp; gold) and decided to give the orange a try since it seemed like it would be a good fit for my skin.</li>
            <li>I received a genuine sample of this product, so I am positive it&#x27;s not counterfeit.</li>
            <li>I have only used this bb cream for two days, but i can say its climbed to the top of my list!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really excited to try this, because the Skin79 hot orange and hot pink bottles are very popular with a lot of folks.</li>
            <li>It smells like oranges, clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got good coverage, and I do enjoy it, but it always seems to make me look a little pasty.</li>
            <li>The coverage is good, not too greasy, but a little too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Its a very nice product, it made the dry areas of my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, has great coverage, completely concealed my dark under eye circles, and even made me look as if I had a full night&#x27;s sleep after studying all night for my midterm.</li>
            <li>but after a few minutes it seems to adjust great to my skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how lightly I try and apply this product so it&#x27;s not cakey, the whitening effect is way too intense.</li>
            <li>Its okay to have one or two pimples, but dont depend on this cream to cover it cuz you&#x27;ll clearly see it.</li>
            <li>Ordering it on Amazon every time I run out is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple BB creams since they have become popular and reviews exploded all over YouTube.</li>
            <li>With it&#x27;s small but it is beautiful to use and did not take the time to ship the product and</li>
            <li>I own several drug store versions and dept store versions.  </li>
            <li>It even felt like my skin was constricting when I tried to smile.</li>
            <li>I rarely wore it, it just felt unneeded.)</li>
            <li>And I rarely even leave the house.</li>
            <li>While it does require a couple touch ups every six hours or so, it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite one.</li>
            <li>to the product itself, I cannot review as now I am  more careful of where I buy SKIN 79 and will have to buy from more reliable resource.</li>
            <li>so I could try it on a fresh face.</li>
            <li>I feel if you lean towards more of the yellowish tinge, then this is much better than the pink.</li>
            <li>LIVING IN THE SOUTH.WE LOVE FOR OUR SKIN TO LOOK SOFT AND DEWY.I</li>
            <li>I highly and strongly recommend this product to every man and woman.</li>
            <li>I was really interested because of the super sun protection.  </li>
            <li>You have to really take the time to blend this in, but it is worth it!  </li>
            <li>right away you can tell you have makeup on.</li>
            <li>I tried it right away.</li>
            <li>The color of BB cream is very light and has no pink undertones.</li>
            <li>and I had read that this brand was better than most of the new American made ones.  </li>
            <li>I find the best way to do this is a sponge and this BB Cream is not absorbed into the sponge as regular foundations are.</li>
            <li>finish is very natural and it blends easily with my fingers.</li>
            <li>(very useful if you live in California) and went on smooth, even when I accidentally applied too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not particularly pale and live in California, so I&#x27;d argue this one works best for those with normal Asian skin tones,</li>
            <li>Aside from the that, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 50 and with 1 layer, it did feel super soft and smooth to the touch after maybe 10minutes.</li>
            <li>I usually need to use a lot of lotion before putting this product on, but it looks great.</li>
            <li>I top it with Bare Essentials Mineral Veil with SPF, and my skin is protected.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE the fact that my face does not chalk up from the heat and humidity like with other BB creams, and at the end of the day when I wash it off it leaves my face healthy white and elastic.</li>
            <li>However, this BB cream has great coverage with just a small amount of the product.  </li>
            <li>After I spread the bb cream all over evenly, I then dab some more in those spots that need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>I have really fair skin, similar to a natural redhead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s look so very super natural on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and burns easily, and does not tan.</li>
            <li>As long as you apply the product properly, spread it light and even, it works good.</li>
            <li>but if you need to cover up thick it works, goes on pretty light but use a powder to even it out and its good</li>
            <li>the climate here right now is pretty hot.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews for other products, I noticed this particular product name cropping up from time to time, always mentioned as the better in comparison.</li>
            <li>so you have to blend very fast</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very very light(and</li>
            <li>This one I feel is only for those with a very light completion.</li>
            <li>No matter how little I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good color for me though.</li>
            <li>This absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;Whitens dark spots&lt;br /&gt;Chamomile to sooth any irritation and calm redness&lt;br /&gt;Has a matte finish and is very light weight&lt;br /&gt;Medium to full coverage</li>
            <li>I have the pink, wanted the gold, but bought the orange bottled BB because it had a high SPF and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just so much better than any western bb cream.</li>
            <li>It really helped me at a wedding too because everyone else got sunburnt, and I didn&#x27;t because this has a powerful sunscreen.</li>
            <li>So fast!</li>
            <li>and it matches pretty well.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping to be able to get away from using multiple products on my face.</li>
            <li>A few days or weeks of use and my skin is bright, even, and glowing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this for months (and ordering my second bottle of it) I wanted to update my review :)&lt;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my cheeks/pores feel hot and flushed like some foundations/creams do.</li>
            <li>You only need a small dot of the BB cream and it gives awesome coverage all over your face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to use powder on those hot days ever again.</li>
            <li>Naturally I don&#x27;t get quite as smooth of coverage when blending with moisturizer(more</li>
            <li>This bb cream has full coverage and is light enough for my skin tone..</li>
            <li>It looks like skin the only problem for most people is coverage or color.</li>
            <li>This is much better than traditional foundation and powder.</li>
            <li>First-</li>
            <li>so I pretty sure it well do the same too.</li>
            <li>At first putting this bb cream on it seemed like a miracle.</li>
            <li>I played with it and ended up washing it off and then applied a primer first.</li>
            <li>it is very well worth it.</li>
            <li>First off, this was an impulse buy.</li>
            <li>When the package first arrived, it was opened already, the box falling apart.</li>
            <li>Higher coverage.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Then I use a primer with dimethicone, even though this bb cream has one in it, I always find that it&#x27;s better to use primer for oil-control and making makeup last longer, plus the makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this version of bb cream because it had a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Feels lightweight (even on hot, humid</li>
            <li>A lot of things about it are close to traditional foundations (texture, consistency, etc) which I like. :)</li>
            <li>but most are too yellow or too dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is thicker and more yellow based, you have to blend this in!  </li>
            <li>I felt I have to in order to make sure future customer is aware of the chance of receiving an expired or non-authentic</li>
            <li>It has a natural coverage and feels really light on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li>You have to moisturize your face pretty well before you use it.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li>This is not my first BB cream</li>
            <li>It does provide more complete coverage than the Skin79 Pink and the SPF is better.</li>
            <li>I will save this for hot months.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried bb creams, try this brand first.  </li>
            <li>So we just have to make sure we order before we run out next time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m NC15 combination (dry/normal) fair skin, neutral undertone, green eyes, blond.</li>
            <li>previously ordered the Skin79 BB cream miniature sampler set to see which one would work best, and while I agree with reviewers that once properly blended even the whitest ones are more or less okay, for me to have a glowing complexion vs an ashier one, I need a little more yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a very subtle scent when you put it on, but it&#x27;s not a heavy fragrance, more like a pleasant &amp;#34;fresh clothes out of the dryer&amp;#34; scent and it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m really liking e.l.f HD powder.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a fantastic product with a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more full coverage than other BB Creams I&#x27;ve used and</li>
            <li>It changes into a nice matte finish, which is not what I expected at all since it has so much SPF.</li>
            <li>It is the only makeup with SPF that does not make me break out, and has superior coverage..also low price.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel soft and smooth and feels very lite on.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good coverage, close to my (pale but tans easily- English/Northern Italian) skin tone, and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very hot and humid state and often work outdoors, so they just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a BB cream and decided on this because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I felt a positive difference for the SKIN79.  </li>
            <li>The first couple times I used it, I just put it straight on my face.  </li>
            <li>This is slightly more yellow toned than the Pink BB Cream, but the consistency is better for oilier skin.</li>
            <li>I wear loreal true match powder to set it (soft Ivory n1).</li>
            <li>It offers a decent amount of coverage and does a better job at hiding the dark circles under my eyes than most foundation I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coverage:  Skin79 covers the dark spot very well, my spots and freckles are less noticeable with it, however Missha does cover all the pores and it does what it says \\&quot;perfect cover\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#Edited</li>
            <li>and when I remove it at night my skin actually looks better - my old acne scars look lighter and my overall complexion appears more even.</li>
            <li>is the coverage is slightly more than the Hot Pink version</li>
            <li>, it was a fresh scent(that does not linger), higher SPF, and looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and will get irritated over anything,</li>
            <li>It hides red areas easily.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The hot pink and gold are more suited to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>, it has really started to dry out my face, and this BB cream doesn&#x27;t look great on a dry face.  </li>
            <li>I have large pore problem around my nose, cheeks, and forehead.  </li>
            <li>For one, this is definitely the real thing, genuine Skin79 BB</li>
            <li>This one somehow feels light, stays put, gives moderate coverage and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m perfectly ready for my contouring + blush+mascara.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need powder, it&#x27;s ruining whole point to use BB and become noticeable.</li>
            <li>Although I have not used it yet, all of the packaging seems real</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin that can get very oily but now is now getting dryer because of my age.</li>
            <li>This product is better then expected.</li>
            <li>The product is authentic as well just like my pink label BB Cream that I purchased from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is greasy and doesn&#x27;t cover very well.  </li>
            <li>I found it very \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very oily</li>
            <li>I normally have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone really well and doesn&#x27;t sink into my pores.</li>
            <li>It is also a very unattractive grayish shade.  </li>
            <li>with all SPF products this does not look well in photos - SPF makes light reflect back</li>
            <li>I look so very well rested and radiant with it on my face.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try out a bb cream and went to Amazon to order some.</li>
            <li>The rest of the bottle looks like the real thing-I think I will be ordering from skin79 website from now on.</li>
            <li>everything else on the bottle looks real.</li>
            <li>Always appreciated ^ ^</li>
            <li>I was thankful for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really has negated any need for concealer as it works as a primer/concealer.  </li>
            <li>I am very oily and this has worked very well with my skin.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much thinner</li>
            <li>and the coverage is much lighter.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really understand what \\&quot;evens out skin tone\\&quot; meant until I put this stuff on.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t really look like I&#x27;m wearing anything.</li>
            <li>I think the skin79 pink label bb cream is the most moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have very Oily Skin</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy as it seemed settled into my pores and creases making them appear even worse.</li>
            <li>Better than the pink one for me or the gold.</li>
            <li>but others in the Skin79 series), is that I really dislike the packaging.</li>
            <li>This is a MUST HAVE for summers and intense sunny days.</li>
            <li>The creams I&#x27;ve used have felt oily, don&#x27;t have staying power, and don&#x27;t have much coverage at all.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly to a smooth matte finish, feels like instant photoshop for my face with no primer or effort</li>
            <li>Skin79 makes a pink label that might work better for you if you&#x27;re in the pinkish undertone category.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Authentication on these product has been a much debated issue on beauty forums.</li>
            <li>&quot; to verify it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>The smell is also much better than the pink one.</li>
            <li>Yes, the pink is more hydrating, but it smeared for me.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t &#x27;luminous&#x27; at all for me, though, there isn&#x27;t really a sheen to it like some BB creams have.  </li>
            <li>And the smell is thankfully not too intense.</li>
            <li>This was actually too light for me.</li>
            <li>It came fast without any problems.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>You have to follow instructions, do not need much.  </li>
            <li>I occasionally break out and most products irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product can be very white looking so especially for those cases you want to do some kind of contouring</li>
            <li>However the sample I received of the pink label bb cream went perfectly on my skin and wasn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li>I want the most natural looking finish and it&#x27;s fairly obvious (even at medium distance) that I&#x27;m wearing something.</li>
            <li>I decided on the orange version because I heard it was slightly more moisturizing (although I can&#x27;t verify because this is the only one I have personally tried) and my face has recently been changing and becoming more dry.</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The product sets VERY quickly</li>
            <li>The coverage is excellent, I usually dust with some light powder following the application, but have gone without doing so a few times</li>
            <li>After blending in, my skin was a little lighter than usual, but looked flawless.  </li>
            <li>I first tried pink package BB cream from the same brand and liked it, but though that this will give me more matte coverage according to some other reviews.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be repurchasing since I want to try other BB creams, and hopefully find a better match for my olive skin.</li>
            <li>The other Skin79 BB creams are better than this one.</li>
            <li>one provides more protection than some of the other lines, in terms of UV protection</li>
            <li>It is too light for my nw 35 complexion, but I mix a little bit of True Match n6 and it comes out</li>
            <li>I love this bb cream other than the color...</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the formula, it doesn&#x27;t make me oily at all.</li>
            <li>I used to use the hot pink label and it gave off a pinkish white skin kind of glow.</li>
            <li>Then I started noticing how dark it really was after I looked at pictures of myself in better</li>
            <li>When I saw the new orange bb cream released, I looked up reviews on korean websites and they seemed really positive.  </li>
            <li>Before this only bare minerals matched my skin,I mixed the light and golden fair together, but I don&#x27;t like how bare minerals doesn&#x27;t cover well and amplifies any dry spots or acne spots.</li>
            <li>I let a friend with severe eczema try mine, and she turned right around the next day and ordered some, saying it is the first product that does not burn or irritate her skin during flareups, and also evens her skin</li>
            <li>I used maybelline bb cream and though I liked it, it left my face dry.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight yellow undertone but other than that it matched my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>look for the silver sticker at the back of the bottle, it should be there, I just tried to take it off and it completely wrinkled up so it has to be real right?</li>
            <li>I hope I got the real deal not a fake one, but the difference in quality of two seemingly only slightly different products from the same line is astounding.</li>
            <li>While it is a light color than the other two, it adjusts pretty well to my NC 25 skintone.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the matte texture and heavy sunscreen shine actually PREVENT your face from looking too chalky because they make you look like you are wearing sunscreen with just a little bit of coloring, which actually makes your face look much more natural than many other foundations/BB creams that have more fuller color (even those that have darker color).</li>
            <li>With previous liquid makeup I had to use much more to get the coverage I wanted.</li>
            <li>It might help improving my wrinkles, as recently I found that the deep line under my eyes are more tolerable.</li>
            <li>Next, make sure there is no chinese on the box!</li>
            <li>I always come back to my skin79 super plus line.</li>
            <li>The thing is that my skin is not even tan and this bb cream is way too light for me.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, mainly because the product is way too dry even with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I only got lucky.</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering from Seoulglamour and have gotten the product quickly.  </li>
            <li>It offers better coverage than the pink and gold, is thinner in consistency</li>
            <li>this particular case</li>
            <li>I first tried it on after applying my usual moisturizer and primer because I read others had a better experience that way.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never ever expected that in a first place, but this stuff like a facial, when you look more rested after you take it of).</li>
            <li>I do like the cream because it&#x27;s warm toned, and the other 2 BB creams I mentioned give me a pinky-gray cast that I can more or less fix with a tiny pump of this.</li>
            <li>Also, I had ordered the Skin79 Super Pink BB Cream before with SPF 25 and just figured the difference in the orange bottle would be higher SPF</li>
            <li>But just a few strokes with my Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80 on clean face</li>
            <li>High SPF (keeps the freckles away)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Since the SPF is so high - 50 - you look like a ghost in pictures.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product because I was looking for a high rated sunscreen BB cream.</li>
            <li>I CHOSE THIS FORMULA BECAUSE OF THE HIGH SUNSCREEN</li>
            <li>I happen to live in hot and humid climate for the summer, and this BB cream not only makes me not having to worry about UVA rays because of its intense protection (which works!)</li>
            <li>Do your research a little better than I did.  </li>
            <li>about the product, it says &#x27;whitening&#x27;, that DOES NOT mean it makes your skin whiter</li>
            <li>Like most BB creams, it is a little gray, but that goes away after a while and blends to your skin.  </li>
            <li>This worked a little better.</li>
            <li>I have used the skin 79 oriental which is a little darker and more moisturizing than this cream.</li>
            <li>I also felt like it provided a little more cover up for sunspots and freckles than the paler shades by Skin79.</li>
            <li>Next time I used it, I used a face primer first and Viola!</li>
            <li>Is pat a little more under my eyes and over red/discolored areas.</li>
            <li>I prefer a little more color though</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is FAR better than the Hot Pink version, No grey under tones&lt;br /&gt;Shrinks</li>
            <li>Even when I slip up and get a little too much sun, it looks good because it helps minimize the pink.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t blend very well with my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>I will note that if I use it as an overnight cream by the time I wake up I look normal again.  </li>
            <li>This \\&quot;ashiness\\&quot; may be popular with the Asian complexion, but as I am not Asian, am 56 yrs old , I do not like the grey hue and that it goes straight to my wrinkles, stays there, and accentuates them!  </li>
            <li>But it faded to my normal skin tone in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother as an alternative to the American BB creams (which are pretty much just tinted goo).</li>
            <li>, it also makes sure that I don&#x27;t get a tan from being outside in the sun because of the simultaneous whitening, AND, I completely disagree with people who say that it&#x27;s too \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; or that it&#x27;s too white</li>
            <li>on the official SKIN 79 website they state in fine print that expiry date will not be honored from other seller which points that they are indeed using expiration date instead of manufacturing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if people with medium to darker skin tones would be able to wear it because of the pale color.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like new again</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona so</li>
            <li>Nothing else, no matter how expensive, has every done this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been very happily using the SKIN79 pink cream and decided to try this one because of the increase in SPF.  </li>
            <li>earlier than I expected :)  .</li>
            <li>While they were nice, they didn&#x27;t offer much coverage and fell behind my tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This bb cream gives a radiant effect and looks very natural on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It does fade after about 6 hours for me, but still looks very natural and not at all blotchy like foundations when they fade.</li>
            <li>All you need is a very little on face; blend it well around the hair lines nose and make sure you get the neck and ears area.</li>
            <li>this one appears to be significantly lighter than other.  </li>
            <li>Ijust recieved my cream from skin79 website and the bottle looksa exactly the same as the one I recieved from here.</li>
            <li>consistency is alot lighter than the others and it has a more yellowish tint instead of the usual grayish</li>
            <li>I look pretty white on pictures when I used this.</li>
            <li>I am just so excited that I finally found a product that I can use in place of regular foundation.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a product that evens my skin tone so completely!</li>
            <li>However, that problem is easily solved with a little bronzer.</li>
            <li>I have used the hot pink super plus as well as the VIP Gold label, the Vital bb is my fave followed close by the hot pink label.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple Skin79 BB creams in the past and this one by far is my favorite!</li>
            <li>clearly she&#x27;s never used some of the new stuff out there</li>
            <li>I have their pink bottle version of this BB cream and while I adore the pink bottle cream consistency, when  I saw is one, I bought it because I thought - the more SPF the better for my pale skin.</li>
            <li>but much &amp;#34;greasier&amp;#34; than the hot pink version.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Much, much lighter than the hot pink and gold Skin79 BB</li>
            <li>I tried the orange for the first time today and it is much lighter in color than the pink and gold.</li>
            <li>If you have pale, pinkish skin that burns easily-</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, packed well and the product container looks like something that should be much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the skin 79 gold and pink, and those left me grey, this one is much lighter and more of a peach color.</li>
            <li>And we all know that pump would only work to a certain volume.</li>
            <li>recently bought one from Letif Beauty due to high seller profile review and also last time I bought one it was authentic.</li>
            <li>Skin79 products have drastically cut our getting ready time in half, perhaps more, and helped us treat our very different skin issues with similar products.</li>
            <li>and/or I just use a little bit darker powder foundation with a brush lightly after applying the product by itself instead and that equals it out evenly to match my skin tone as well.</li>
            <li>Although, the shade if a little too light for my skin</li>
            <li>but this bb cream look a little too light for my skin..</li>
            <li>I have tanned east asian skin (i am Korean but i am little darker than most Koreans) tone</li>
            <li>I have pale skin with yellow undertones (about a MAC NC20), but this cream is still very light on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to toss out all my half-used bottles of the old stuff because I&#x27;m never going back!  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this BB cream to work for me, but it simply did not.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of bloggers out there that are crazy about BB creams, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s one with a skin tone similar to yours that help you better judge</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried Lioele Beyond The Solution BB Cream</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve thought I like it, even if it&#x27;s darker then I&#x27;m without a tan, and it wasn&#x27;t perfectly smooth, and I couldn&#x27;t wear it without heavy moisturizer...</li>
            <li>The coverage is natural looking and blends well to my skin.</li>
            <li>After reading so much hype about BB creams, I finally decided to give one a try.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it after 2 weeks, the whole bottle still had 80% left...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to say that I am completely un-nerved</li>
            <li>I tried a couple different primers and none seemed to really do the trick.</li>
            <li>Since their is some pigment in this vital cream, it matched my skin well.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was so extra fast</li>
            <li>After reading more and more about the bb cream after I ordered it, I felt instant remorse over my purchase because it was very likely that my product which had already shipped was a fake.</li>
            <li>i did order the triple functions vital cream from the SKIN79 north america website</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how natural it looked in daylight.</li>
            <li>However, this made my pores look really visible and it looked like I have a lot of white spots on my nose!!!</li>
            <li>as far as oily/dry goes.</li>
            <li>I think it is very close overall to Lioele Triple Function bb cream.  </li>
            <li>and this helps control it for at least 6 hours without touching up.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and are acne prone like me</li>
            <li>Use it sparingly, it covers very well with a tiny bead.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve also ordered from China directly</li>
            <li>BRIGHTER.I AM A SIXTY YEAR OLD CAUCASIAN,</li>
            <li>When I use this BB cream, it doesn&#x27;t exactly cover my flaws, but blurs them enough that they are barely visible--almost an airbrushed quality.</li>
            <li>If I put too much on, which is easy because a little bit goes a long way, I can get ghost</li>
            <li>This product is for those woman with pale and light skin.</li>
            <li>And for dry skin, it moisturizes really well!  </li>
            <li>At first, I like it a lot; however, it can make your face dry after awhile.</li>
            <li>However, in my opinion it gave better coverage and lasted quite long too, but there was this slightly tight feeling which I found uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also - A little goes a long way with this product, and make sure to use a moisturizer first if you have any dry skin.</li>
            <li>It does not stop me from getting oily, but I don&#x27;t get oily as quickly as the other BB Creams!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The few light freckles I have on my nose have actually disappeared thanks to the higher SPF and other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Her skin looks softer and more even and the high SPF prevents the rosacea from getting worse.</li>
            <li>control: As the sunscreen is a must for me, as I live in very hot, humid, and extremely sunny country, I didn&#x27;t trust that the sunscreen property from teh BB cream will be enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Too dark and yellow for my neutral skin tone and too light on coverage.</li>
            <li>My main problem is that it&#x27;s so white</li>
            <li>I assume the texture issue is because it&#x27;s such a high SPF, but</li>
            <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t match with my skin tone, it makes for a high quality present.</li>
            <li>I purchased from PinkGelee (fab seller) and along with the standard size orange, received samples of the pink and gold label to try as well, so I was lucky to have some comparison.  </li>
            <li>This one has more of a yellow tone that works well with my neutral very pale skin.</li>
            <li>It gives light to medium coverage with just a small amount of application.  </li>
            <li>but I will stick to the hot pink.</li>
            <li>i may try hot pink as others rave about it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the gold and got samples of the hot pink and orange.</li>
            <li>The consistency is creamier and thinner than the hot pink and gold as well.</li>
            <li>I have the hot pink too-</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I will stick with the BB cream in the Hot Pink bottle.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this cream color is literary white and it will stay like that even on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>can definitely feel comfortable leaving the house wearing nothing else on my face but this and a little mascara.  </li>
            <li>The pump and hard plastic tube design prevent the user from retrieving the last bit of BB cream after you&#x27;ve used up most of it because there is no way you can squeeze out the content.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my skin79 absolute total which is a little too pink but matches enough and has better coverage. .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m recently new to makeup and heard about BB creams recently as well.</li>
            <li>This is the BB cream you would want for summer, especially if you happen to live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge, you only need the tiniest amount, so it will probably last a very long time, even with daily use.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I always set with a sheer powder because that it what really makes the makeup just stay put</li>
            <li>This is much better than American BB creams, it has at least a medium coverage &amp; it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s due to the higher SPF content?</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin and when its hot it can become greasy or shiny keep a setting powder with you.</li>
            <li>No breakouts or blackheads from using this product but my skin still feels soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually used this in dry heat, moderate climates and even hot + humid climates - it lasts and controls oil in all of them.</li>
            <li>ahem* mature skin, and this product minimizes pores and doesn&#x27;t seem to settle into lines if worked into the skin enough.</li>
            <li>but then, when I left the house (I wasn&#x27;t even in direct sunlight), my face looked darker.</li>
            <li>I have always used Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I expected this to have a shimmer to it, but it is very matte.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does this one blend well into my skin, it offers medium/heavy coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne since i was ten years old.</li>
            <li>I should have just stuck to the hot pink because the orange was a big disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought this would make me look younger and cover well, just made me look white, still had to do all my normal makeup routine after so</li>
            <li>I had tried samples of the pink and gold bb creams by skin79, but never really felt the desire to purchase them in full size.</li>
            <li>This made my face everywhere else other than the t-zone SUPER dry that it looked cakey.</li>
            <li>(I actually found the Mizon Snail Cream to make your face look much whiter and chalkier, and I have pretty pale skin!).</li>
            <li>I said before, I&#x27;m new to makeup, and I don&#x27;t really wear it that often, but this stuff makes me want to prettyup EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li>overall, I recommend this for oily type skin people, not so much for really dry skin types.</li>
            <li>Liquid foundations don&#x27;t seem to come in the right tone for my skin and feel too heavy, and powder foundations don&#x27;t have staying power and won&#x27;t blend with my concealers well.  </li>
            <li>Not a fan, but could be right for someone with drier or normal skin and less pink skin tones.</li>
            <li>Much less moisturising than hot pink/gold</li>
            <li>You can pile this stuff on and don&#x27;t really need other foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li>The Super Plus Orange bottle is a very heavy coverage.  </li>
            <li>The main difference between this one and the pink one is the shade of the cream-</li>
            <li>I also have many acne scars which need heavy coverage or my skin appears really uneven.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my mom (54)  who has dry skin with large pores and some minor sun damage.</li>
            <li>I was a little alarmed when I applied it the first time, the color was grey-ish.  </li>
            <li>Recently there has been updates from blogs and forum that SKIN 79 has stopped using manufacturing date as of 2013 and all products manufactured on 2013 will have expiration date instead, I am unable to link external links so if you are interested in the link feel free to reply to the comment or PM me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I am a user of the Hot Pink and VIP Gold BB Cream, I had acne and was looking for a product that would cut my morning routine in half and help heal my scars and prevent new blemishes from appearing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white and VERY pale with cool undertones.</li>
            <li>Just using it by itself with no other makeup products, it helps cover up the spots on my face a little and my eye circles don&#x27;t show too much.</li>
            <li>My skin is quite fair and with very few freckles, and a few dark spot from acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I had read reviews all over the internet about how this product is too thick when applying, but I find it is fine as long as you know what you are doing.</li>
            <li>My main problem with other foundations and tinted moisturizers is that by the end of the day my face is covered in grease.  </li>
            <li>and I can say I really do think it has helped with the dark marks that I get after the occasional blemish.</li>
            <li>The SKIN79 orange BB cream is the first that I&#x27;ve tried, after recommendation from my sister in law, who has used quite a few different brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very cheap and blindly picked the cheapest price I could find, which was from the seller package_go_fast.</li>
            <li>But the other two of snail and hot pink with a Anti-fake label on each of bottle.</li>
            <li>This effect is particularly noticeable when I use it under my eyes alone for dark circle coverage.</li>
            <li>I have large pours and an uneven coloring on my face.</li>
            <li>It is very matte and it will accentuate even the smallest dry spot on the face which I found somewhat extreme for a BB</li>
            <li>My skin had a yellowish tint to it, but I chocked it up to the bad lighting and the bright yellow paint on the bathroom walls.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good because it&#x27;s drying it out but bad because it draws attention to them.</li>
            <li>A bad product from an overall good brand.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As for the skin79 orange label, it was stated on the skin79 website that the skin should be well moisturized before applying, thus having the moisturizing cream and sunscreen is just perfect before using it.  </li>

            <li> Best BB cream I have found to date</li>
            <li> In conclusion with the skin79 BB cream, it is very good BB cream</li>
            <li> It has very good coverage though, if that is what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> My mother is 48, caucasian, very fair, and has rosacea.</li>
            <li> This product has very good coverage.</li>
            <li> I am very fair</li>
            <li> I think that this product is great, and I even did a 5 star review bragging about how awesome the texture is, but I deleted my review because it was misleading.  </li>
            <li> but it looks great because it brightens me around my eyes but blends into the rest of my face perfectly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great buildable coverage and best of all leaves a nice matte</li>

            <li> It worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> The BB Cream came in very cute packaging from Korea and there were four samples with it!  </li>
            <li> but I am very pleased with my service from amazon!</li>
            <li> The shipping and service were great.  </li>
            <li> I think it is great for the skin but not so great to use during daytime.</li>
            <li> &quot; LOL yes with a g.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it&#x27;s great if you have to use foundation in your day to day.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> it is great for my oily skin</li>
            <li> Skin79 products had great reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - I&#x27;m one happy gal.</li>
            <li> , the seller was great.  </li>
            <li> Which is great since I am NC15.  </li>
            <li> I am writing this review for my mom since she is not too great with computers, but she still wanted to give a review.</li>
            <li> when my mother saw how great my skin looked, she wanted to try a BB cream as well.</li>
            <li> It also dries semi-matte which is great because it just glows instead of looking oily.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin.</li>
            <li> Another thing, this smells really great.</li>
            <li> If you like citrusy scents, this will be great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smelled great, will give it props for that.</li>
            <li> it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin look great</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but I still did I still came out great</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> so this works great for me.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> For the color, it was great on my hand.</li>
            <li> and it still looks great for happy hour.  </li>
            <li> This BB cream has great coverage</li>
            <li> but when you do you&#x27;ll be so happy.  </li>
            <li> ANOTHER GREAT BB CREAM PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> all around great product, 1st bb cream ive ever used</li>
            <li> Love it!!  </li>
            <li> Its the best foundation I&#x27;ve purchased to match my skin tone which is very light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li> This product goes amazing with my skin tone!</li>
            <li> The coverage was amazing!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think using a brush with this product would be successful, and a sponge would just be wasteful.</li>
            <li> This is the best, most silky cream for porcelain skin tone.</li>
            <li> it stays nice for hours!</li>
            <li> but this bb cream didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at alll  :o)</li>
            <li> love the packaging, great coverage!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the scent was pleasant, not too scented but didnt smell like makeup either.</li>
            <li> Amazing price, great product</li>
            <li> though I didn&#x27;t like this cream I think it does a good job controlling oily</li>
            <li> I have fair skin.  </li>
            <li> Fair</li>
            <li> This product is not, I repeat, IS NOT, for truly fair skinned gals.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite all that, yes, it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> I like to recommend this BB cream to who has a fair skin.</li>
            <li> Good Luck~</li>
            <li> I found the color a bit too light, but the coverage was great!</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t be too fair for my color</li>
            <li> i find that the best way to apply this is with your fingers in a light swiping motion in one direction.</li>
            <li> If you have fair skin color, this well work really good on you.</li>
            <li> This gave me good coverage and stays put.</li>
            <li> It feels good to have on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s drier, but it may be good.</li>
            <li> It appears to work just as good as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I had one pimple that this covered beautifully with a couple layers/dabs on top of it.</li>
            <li> It is my second purchase form this seller and they are awesome and of course those creams are excellent!  </li>
            <li> I liked the coverage of the orange best but all of skin79 are too light.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product for someone with more oily skin..</li>
            <li> This one will be great for summer since it is a more matte finish.</li>
            <li> This is authentic Skin 79 and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so (surprisingly) happy with it that I just bought another one :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Based on my skin tone (extremely fair), she thought this would be the best match for a first timer.  </li>
            <li> I really do love this because the coverage it great.</li>
            <li> Very light and very effective.</li>
            <li> so I thought this would be good because it gave a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> Also very nice the Seller included MORE samples than they had in their description.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used the BB detox cleanser and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this BB cream!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better my face looks!</li>
            <li> I really Love this product!</li>
            <li> okay!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> So much more simpler in the morning (and money saving since I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying all these additional products!)</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It is, however, perfect for those of you who have light beige skin, and who tan fairly easy...</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> and I thank God that the creator of this amazing product was born with the wisdom to make it.</li>
            <li> My husband even noticed, that i look fresh and perfect this days :)</li>
            <li> finish.&lt;br /&gt;Lightly scented with a nice texture,suitable for fair/light skin tones.</li>
            <li> I tried many BB Creams from this brand and loved all of them - except this one.  </li>
            <li> so it spreads nicely.</li>
            <li> I have found that applying it with my fingers can cause it to look streaky, so I dab it on with a makeup sponge to get nice coverage.</li>
            <li> Some of the marks I get can honestly stay for months but with this I have seen them fade dramatically faster.</li>
            <li> Your skin has a pearl type glow to it and it feels nice.</li>
            <li> and it still has staying power on its own.  </li>
            <li> But when I look in the mirrow, I cannot believe how good my skin looks, better than I have ever seen it and</li>
            <li> It gives a very nice light to medium coverage that leaves a dewy finish.</li>
            <li> This is very good pruduct, it matches my skin tone very well!</li>
            <li> (I use a darker toned finishing powder than what I normally use and that gives me a perfect</li>
            <li> /&gt;However if you have normal skin and aren&#x27;t acne prone this is perfect for you!</li>
            <li> It is okay on my oily/combinations skin, it feels very light textured!</li>
            <li> I like the consistency and the fact that it covers most of my blemishes very well, but it doesn&#x27;t match my skintone perfectly.</li>
            <li> She is super happy with the bb cream, she no longer needs to use primer, concealer and pounds of foundation to hide her redness.</li>
            <li> Over all I will never use this product and it smells very strongly of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> rather keep using my  Lioele and my Peter Thomas Roth, they are the best for far!</li>
            <li> The consistency of the cream is great, smells good, and high in SPF.</li>
            <li> light - it works for me because I am very fair, but it may be too light in the summer when I am getting more</li>
            <li> I am able to wear this alone and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer/ sunscreen/ make-up I have ever used!*$&amp;@%</li>
            <li> i am sure to buy a product i tried and liked before.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I will sometimes use a finishing powder when I want more of a matte finish.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best and most cost effective.</li>
            <li> and I liked that better.  </li>
            <li> It had great skin benefits, good coverage, felt moisturizing and looked very natural.</li>
            <li> Bought this on with the higher XP for my mom for Christmas and her skin looks much more even with whitening tint in it and is good for you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, completely covering, and blends into her skin perfectly (she is very light).  </li>
            <li> I tried so many BB creams, and so far, this is the best color match.</li>
            <li> This is a great product  , Pale but very good, you can add your own color with a tinted primer</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the products coverage was just like that of a foundation but very light weight on the skin.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to wear with matte finish.  </li>
            <li> And the seller was very nice and the shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> Very very light.</li>
            <li> , this is very light.</li>
            <li> It blends well and goes on easily, and I have already noticed an amazing difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> for this bb cream, it is a very light color - as most people will tell you.  </li>
            <li> I love the look and no makeup needed.</li>
            <li> like, most of the time when I buy makeup shades that say \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; or \\&quot;fair\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more the medium/heavy side.  </li>
            <li> If you are, I say you&#x27;re better off not wasting your money for a product you have to hide under layers of makeup.  </li>
            <li> of Application:  Missha is better, I can use only one pump and apply all over my face to have a perfect finish.  </li>
            <li> I basically use BB creams instead of foundation, and they are better than foundation in providing so many properties.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one I got was legit, many of seoulglamour&#x27;s things are.  </li>
            <li> And on the box, when it says \\&quot;Triple Functions\\&quot; MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> still better then any foundation i tried, even Lancome, Ester Lauder and Chanel)</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream.</li>
            <li> I love about this BB cream</li>
            <li> still love the medium coverage and neutral undertone as well as the oil control.</li>
            <li> OK now for the review.</li>
            <li> I am in love.</li>
            <li> The price is also not outrageous.</li>
            <li> You can add more and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Revlon Colorstay in Ivory is the next best makeup in color and texture, but of course it doesn&#x27;t have all the added SPF and benefits of BB cream.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I got more acne than before.</li>
            <li> I am sure, I will recommend this product to my friend.  </li>
            <li> For peace of mind,  I will look for a BB cream from a reputable company in the USA that has a much better selection of hues and try again.  </li>
            <li> so I wear this over the top of a primer and then put a bit of powder over the top and</li>
            <li> so this wasn&#x27;t the appropriate Skin79 BB cream for me</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Korean skin care and this is my fave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> You can blend it with a favorite tinted moisturizer to get the desired hue.</li>
            <li> With UVA and UVB protection -  Most sunscreens leave you feeling oily.</li>
            <li> It covers and works way better than foundation makeup.</li>
            <li> but since using this, I&#x27;ve been breaking out much more and have noticed my skin getting worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> glad I gave it a try</li>
            <li> I wish they had some more tint variations.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it because of the color, but some people may have more luck.</li>
            <li> Plus, I LOVE that it&#x27;s SPF 50!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> and I have to wait for more stock to come in before it ships.</li>
            <li> I love how it even it looks even after dabbing more in some areas because with foundation you can always tell where you added more.</li>
            <li> It was moisturizing for sure</li>
            <li> and this one does have slightly more coverage,</li>
            <li> If you use more than 1 layer of this, you will need a finishing/setting powder, which Skin79 does sell.</li>
            <li> This does have a more pinkish color, which I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> and I am in LOVE.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something magical about this BB cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff matches even better</li>
            <li> and I think the coverage might be better.</li>
            <li> It also seems to have a nicer, more even coverage.</li>
            <li> so I could give a more educated review, but there ya go :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use this when I&#x27;m tanner in the summer (</li>
            <li> you do need to make sure you wash your face well after a day of wear.</li>
            <li> The gold one lasts a bit longer but is a bit more drying.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love that it also has SPF as I am so fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also provides better coverage.</li>
            <li> I love BB cream</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br</li>
            <li> more foundation on top of that</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t ever change it. :)</li>
            <li> Most of them would make me break out on my chin.</li>
            <li> so I add some tinted moisturizer or just dust bronzer on top.</li>
            <li> This is ok.  </li>
            <li> I like the gold one better.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly it didnt break me out!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is different from any BB or CC cream or foundation I&#x27;ve tried in a wonderful way.  </li>
            <li> Think Anna and Elsa from Frozen; Elsa is more of a pink/cool undertone, and Anna is more yellow/</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this BB cream.</li>
            <li> This one is for sure the legit one.</li>
            <li> For sure, i&#x27;ll be buying again from Thinkpretty.</li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s winter, I&#x27;m sure that is not helping either, but I&#x27;m considering giving the gold label and try and saving this for the warmer months.  </li>
            <li> and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> The gold label was more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Does seem kind of light beige going on it</li>
            <li> It blends in very nicely, and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The packaging is super cute too!</li>
            <li> I loved my first one.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty fair complexion.</li>
            <li> I thought my foundation was a pretty good match, but</li>
            <li> The color is pretty fair for the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very yellow and light when it comes out, but after it oxidizes and blends in it matches my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> First off - great quick shipping -I ordered this on the 11th and received it on the 22nd.  </li>
            <li> I also want to state that the color is very light-- even light for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> in addtion, when you put it on, it&#x27;s very cool to feel.</li>
            <li> Im very fair skinned, and this is the only foundation i found that doesn&#x27;t have an orange tinge to it.</li>
            <li> too light for me but great spf 50 and nice coverage overall.</li>
            <li> MOST IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Seoulglamour and was so happy when it arrived 4 weeks early</li>
            <li> I love the texture and coverage of this cream but it is extremely light.  </li>
            <li> It stays on the skin very well, moisturizes, while keeping your skin fairly matte.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for those who are much beyond the fair side on the complexion spectrum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This all combined with the price makes this the best money I have every spent on my face!e best money I have every spent on my face!</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian, but tan easily</li>
            <li> I have tried only two BB creams, Missha Perfect Cover and this one, and I think it will be useful for those who are searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, the main reason why I bought this cream was because of all the rave reviews from \\&quot;fair skinned\\&quot; girls.  </li>
            <li> Too great actually--I don&#x27;t like foundation in general</li>
            <li> I even use it to mask my dark circle, and it&#x27;s works perfect.</li>
            <li> My daughter is much better at applying a full coverage product like this.</li>
            <li> I can go a full work day without touching up</li>
            <li> This highlighted every fine line on my face and settled on the sides of my nostrils like nobody&#x27;s business, looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I will say, that my super&#x3D;pale skin looked just fine with this color match.</li>
            <li> The orange label has excellent coverage, and definitely does not have the \\&quot;grey\\&quot; color issue for me, even upon first application.  </li>
            <li> If you have a warmer skin tone, this is probably a fine choice.</li>
            <li> The coverage is pertty good, and gives a natural skin look!</li>
            <li> It is light weight and goes on easily and smoothly with medium coverage for blemish.  </li>
            <li> It may take a little experiment to figure out your best color in this line</li>
            <li> If I get a little oily by end of day I use the Skin79 powder compact, oil gone, look is perfect.  </li>
            <li> also got several free samples, which is great.  </li>
            <li> Overall, cheap price and great coverage.</li>
            <li> Great cream but only for people with extremely light skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a week, primarily wearing it under powder.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy on my face and makes my skin look flawless, even when I&#x27;m breaking out.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, I get this fabulous lit-from-within glow that doesn&#x27;t look sparkly or shiny--just a smooth, youthful complexion.</li>
            <li> , it is for light skinned,</li>
            <li> It never slides out from my face after few hours and my face stays perfectly touchable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but makes a difference.</li>
            <li> it is smooth and light</li>
            <li> and I am happy to finally find a product that truly does it all.  </li>
            <li> but the inside gold part came free from the orange exterior and flew across my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It also feels light on your skin, sometimes I forget that I even have it on.</li>
            <li> The reason it is receiving 4 starts is because of its light tint.</li>
            <li> I believe it will not be appropriate for everyone, good only for women with light medium skin tones or even ivory.</li>
            <li> light in color - if you even have a hint of a tan you&#x27;ll look washed out&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also leave a Matti look meaning shine free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 with yellow/neutral undertones and light skin (in MAC around nc15-20, although their colors look peachy on me), and I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the coverage</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li> Its light</li>
            <li> and it is still too light for me.</li>
            <li> This orange label is better for those golden tones.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for all skin type with porcelain and light color skin.</li>
            <li> I found this BB cream to be way too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It dries matte so all you need is a light dusting of powder to set</li>
            <li> A coworker introduced me to BB cream, and I liked it so much</li>
            <li> and this was a touch too light on me.</li>
            <li> She switched back to a brand available at the cosmetic counter but loved this so much better</li>
            <li> It just looks like you naturally have good</li>
            <li> Skin79 BB creams are far superior to what passes for BB creams from Maybelline and L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> I very rarely have pimples and I&#x27;d say my skin is \\&quot;normal\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The color is also lighter than the Hot Pink version, which will not work for everyone but is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also liked that this particular product had SPF</li>
            <li> After having tried the hot pink and silver Skin79 BB creams, I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> It went on super light and then even after oxidation was still to light.</li>
            <li> I love Missha, but I like skin79 orange label as well, if I haven&#x27;t found Missha first.  </li>
            <li> And NO breakouts :) ;)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to try it this weekend.</li>
            <li> I think this would be good for a short amount of time, maybe a date night or a school picture, but it seems that over time it looses its flawless appearance and looks messy.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for weddings or a night out in town because of the SPF which is not camera friendly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes sure your skintone has more of a warm yellow/golden undertone than a pink undertone.  </li>
            <li> The samples of the gold label were impressive; the pink didn&#x27;t really do much for me, seemed a bit light.</li>
            <li> I even use my fingers (clean) to pat spots around a nose</li>
            <li> However, if the pink bottle has the more rosey cream, this one has a plaster whitish one that does not look too good, does not blend in as well, and makes your face look greasy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise a great everyday healthy makeup/sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to continue using my primer, just a clean face with my moisturizer, apply my BB cream</li>
            <li> Because my skin looked naturally clean like with no make up.</li>
            <li> and I own many Asian bb creams.  </li>
            <li> I have the pink cream, and it was great.</li>
            <li> Golden Fair in Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this BB for fair and dry-normal-combination with oily zones skin.</li>
            <li> I am fair to medium with yellow undertone.</li>
            <li> Ordered Skin75 BB Balm on 4/1/12 &amp; it was delivered on 4/8/12, was pleased with fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> this is an advantage as well as sweet</li>
            <li> The color is pretty light, I am Irish and fair skinned and it is too light for me.</li>
            <li> I always like to do some contouring with any foundation because it just gives you more dimension to your face and brings out areas that make your face look much nicer.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and this was okay in controlling it.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing good things about this and decided I&#x27;d finally try it out, thinking I could replace my foundation with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I really wanted to love this</li>
            <li> It also makes my face look much brighter and more awake.  </li>
            <li> It has a light fresh scent that does fade.</li>
            <li> haha :-)  </li>
            <li> First and foremost, again, I&#x27;d like to say that Seoulglamour delivered this product very quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I used very small amount and applied three times to get perfect finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually have a very fair skin colour) with a strong yellow tinge.</li>
            <li> #: After I turned back to use Missha, I have a second thought on the coverage that Skin79 orange and Missha perfect cover are equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> would never recommend this to anyone over 30 unless they had super greasy skin and needed to control it.</li>
            <li> There are a couple quick quizzes and comparisons you can take online with a quick google search if you&#x27;re unsure.  </li>
            <li> I received the product fairly quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li> I did try it on my daughter who has a darker skin tone than myself (she has a nice tan/beige complexion) to see if it really were self adjusting and didn&#x27;t get very satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> However, they sent me a sample of the gold label super 79 bb cream</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love this and really did love the way my skin looked the first day I tried it.</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;- Great coverage (covers my freckles and red spots)&lt;br /&gt;- Light feeling and natural looking&lt;</li>
            <li> It seems light at first but quiclkly absorbs into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Be aware, the product is lightly scented.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light in color</li>
            <li> This is the first bb cream I&#x27;ve had to mix with a darker one because it was too light.  </li>
            <li> I now need to order a new bottle, hopefully this time it will be authentic.</li>
            <li> but I always put something to make my face look more lively.</li>
            <li> MakeupAlley has tons of more detailed reviews on this BB cream, but here are the bare bones of it in my experience -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if applied with full coverage, you dnt need a lot of this product per use, its very blendable with light hand and drys with powder finish.</li>
            <li> One thing to to be aware of is this is a fair color with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other skin 72 BB Creams and loved them (pink &amp; gold) and decided to give the orange a try since it seemed like it would be a good fit for my skin.</li>
            <li> I received a genuine sample of this product, so I am positive it&#x27;s not counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I have only used this bb cream for two days, but i can say its climbed to the top of my list!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really excited to try this, because the Skin79 hot orange and hot pink bottles are very popular with a lot of folks.</li>
            <li> It smells like oranges, clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got good coverage, and I do enjoy it, but it always seems to make me look a little pasty.</li>
            <li> The coverage is good, not too greasy, but a little too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Its a very nice product, it made the dry areas of my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, has great coverage, completely concealed my dark under eye circles, and even made me look as if I had a full night&#x27;s sleep after studying all night for my midterm.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes it seems to adjust great to my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how lightly I try and apply this product so it&#x27;s not cakey, the whitening effect is way too intense.</li>
            <li> Its okay to have one or two pimples, but dont depend on this cream to cover it cuz you&#x27;ll clearly see it.</li>
            <li> Ordering it on Amazon every time I run out is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple BB creams since they have become popular and reviews exploded all over YouTube.</li>
            <li> With it&#x27;s small but it is beautiful to use and did not take the time to ship the product and</li>
            <li> I own several drug store versions and dept store versions.  </li>
            <li> It even felt like my skin was constricting when I tried to smile.</li>
            <li> I rarely wore it, it just felt unneeded.)</li>
            <li> And I rarely even leave the house.</li>
            <li> While it does require a couple touch ups every six hours or so, it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> and this is by far my favorite one.</li>
            <li> to the product itself, I cannot review as now I am  more careful of where I buy SKIN 79 and will have to buy from more reliable resource.</li>
            <li> so I could try it on a fresh face.</li>
            <li> I feel if you lean towards more of the yellowish tinge, then this is much better than the pink.</li>
            <li> LIVING IN THE SOUTH.WE LOVE FOR OUR SKIN TO LOOK SOFT AND DEWY.I</li>
            <li> I highly and strongly recommend this product to every man and woman.</li>
            <li> I was really interested because of the super sun protection.  </li>
            <li> You have to really take the time to blend this in, but it is worth it!  </li>
            <li> right away you can tell you have makeup on.</li>
            <li> I tried it right away.</li>
            <li> The color of BB cream is very light and has no pink undertones.</li>
            <li> and I had read that this brand was better than most of the new American made ones.  </li>
            <li> I find the best way to do this is a sponge and this BB Cream is not absorbed into the sponge as regular foundations are.</li>
            <li> finish is very natural and it blends easily with my fingers.</li>
            <li> (very useful if you live in California) and went on smooth, even when I accidentally applied too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly pale and live in California, so I&#x27;d argue this one works best for those with normal Asian skin tones,</li>
            <li> Aside from the that, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 50 and with 1 layer, it did feel super soft and smooth to the touch after maybe 10minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually need to use a lot of lotion before putting this product on, but it looks great.</li>
            <li> I top it with Bare Essentials Mineral Veil with SPF, and my skin is protected.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE the fact that my face does not chalk up from the heat and humidity like with other BB creams, and at the end of the day when I wash it off it leaves my face healthy white and elastic.</li>
            <li> However, this BB cream has great coverage with just a small amount of the product.  </li>
            <li> After I spread the bb cream all over evenly, I then dab some more in those spots that need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> I have really fair skin, similar to a natural redhead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s look so very super natural on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and burns easily, and does not tan.</li>
            <li> As long as you apply the product properly, spread it light and even, it works good.</li>
            <li> but if you need to cover up thick it works, goes on pretty light but use a powder to even it out and its good</li>
            <li> the climate here right now is pretty hot.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews for other products, I noticed this particular product name cropping up from time to time, always mentioned as the better in comparison.</li>
            <li> so you have to blend very fast</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very very light(and</li>
            <li> This one I feel is only for those with a very light completion.</li>
            <li> No matter how little I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good color for me though.</li>
            <li> This absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;Whitens dark spots&lt;br /&gt;Chamomile to sooth any irritation and calm redness&lt;br /&gt;Has a matte finish and is very light weight&lt;br /&gt;Medium to full coverage</li>
            <li> I have the pink, wanted the gold, but bought the orange bottled BB because it had a high SPF and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so much better than any western bb cream.</li>
            <li> It really helped me at a wedding too because everyone else got sunburnt, and I didn&#x27;t because this has a powerful sunscreen.</li>
            <li> So fast!</li>
            <li> and it matches pretty well.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to be able to get away from using multiple products on my face.</li>
            <li> A few days or weeks of use and my skin is bright, even, and glowing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this for months (and ordering my second bottle of it) I wanted to update my review :)&lt;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my cheeks/pores feel hot and flushed like some foundations/creams do.</li>
            <li> You only need a small dot of the BB cream and it gives awesome coverage all over your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to use powder on those hot days ever again.</li>
            <li> Naturally I don&#x27;t get quite as smooth of coverage when blending with moisturizer(more</li>
            <li> This bb cream has full coverage and is light enough for my skin tone..</li>
            <li> It looks like skin the only problem for most people is coverage or color.</li>
            <li> This is much better than traditional foundation and powder.</li>
            <li> First-</li>
            <li> so I pretty sure it well do the same too.</li>
            <li> At first putting this bb cream on it seemed like a miracle.</li>
            <li> I played with it and ended up washing it off and then applied a primer first.</li>
            <li> it is very well worth it.</li>
            <li> First off, this was an impulse buy.</li>
            <li> When the package first arrived, it was opened already, the box falling apart.</li>
            <li> Higher coverage.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Then I use a primer with dimethicone, even though this bb cream has one in it, I always find that it&#x27;s better to use primer for oil-control and making makeup last longer, plus the makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this version of bb cream because it had a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Feels lightweight (even on hot, humid</li>
            <li> A lot of things about it are close to traditional foundations (texture, consistency, etc) which I like. :)</li>
            <li> but most are too yellow or too dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is thicker and more yellow based, you have to blend this in!  </li>
            <li> I felt I have to in order to make sure future customer is aware of the chance of receiving an expired or non-authentic</li>
            <li> It has a natural coverage and feels really light on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li> You have to moisturize your face pretty well before you use it.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li> This is not my first BB cream</li>
            <li> It does provide more complete coverage than the Skin79 Pink and the SPF is better.</li>
            <li> I will save this for hot months.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried bb creams, try this brand first.  </li>
            <li> So we just have to make sure we order before we run out next time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NC15 combination (dry/normal) fair skin, neutral undertone, green eyes, blond.</li>
            <li> previously ordered the Skin79 BB cream miniature sampler set to see which one would work best, and while I agree with reviewers that once properly blended even the whitest ones are more or less okay, for me to have a glowing complexion vs an ashier one, I need a little more yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a very subtle scent when you put it on, but it&#x27;s not a heavy fragrance, more like a pleasant &amp;#34;fresh clothes out of the dryer&amp;#34; scent and it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m really liking e.l.f HD powder.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a fantastic product with a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more full coverage than other BB Creams I&#x27;ve used and</li>
            <li> It changes into a nice matte finish, which is not what I expected at all since it has so much SPF.</li>
            <li> It is the only makeup with SPF that does not make me break out, and has superior coverage..also low price.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin feel soft and smooth and feels very lite on.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good coverage, close to my (pale but tans easily- English/Northern Italian) skin tone, and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very hot and humid state and often work outdoors, so they just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a BB cream and decided on this because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I felt a positive difference for the SKIN79.  </li>
            <li> The first couple times I used it, I just put it straight on my face.  </li>
            <li> This is slightly more yellow toned than the Pink BB Cream, but the consistency is better for oilier skin.</li>
            <li> I wear loreal true match powder to set it (soft Ivory n1).</li>
            <li> It offers a decent amount of coverage and does a better job at hiding the dark circles under my eyes than most foundation I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coverage:  Skin79 covers the dark spot very well, my spots and freckles are less noticeable with it, however Missha does cover all the pores and it does what it says \\&quot;perfect cover\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#Edited</li>
            <li> and when I remove it at night my skin actually looks better - my old acne scars look lighter and my overall complexion appears more even.</li>
            <li> is the coverage is slightly more than the Hot Pink version</li>
            <li> , it was a fresh scent(that does not linger), higher SPF, and looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive and will get irritated over anything,</li>
            <li> It hides red areas easily.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The hot pink and gold are more suited to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> , it has really started to dry out my face, and this BB cream doesn&#x27;t look great on a dry face.  </li>
            <li> I have large pore problem around my nose, cheeks, and forehead.  </li>
            <li> For one, this is definitely the real thing, genuine Skin79 BB</li>
            <li> This one somehow feels light, stays put, gives moderate coverage and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m perfectly ready for my contouring + blush+mascara.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need powder, it&#x27;s ruining whole point to use BB and become noticeable.</li>
            <li> Although I have not used it yet, all of the packaging seems real</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin that can get very oily but now is now getting dryer because of my age.</li>
            <li> This product is better then expected.</li>
            <li> The product is authentic as well just like my pink label BB Cream that I purchased from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is greasy and doesn&#x27;t cover very well.  </li>
            <li> I found it very \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very oily</li>
            <li> I normally have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li> It matches my skin tone really well and doesn&#x27;t sink into my pores.</li>
            <li> It is also a very unattractive grayish shade.  </li>
            <li> with all SPF products this does not look well in photos - SPF makes light reflect back</li>
            <li> I look so very well rested and radiant with it on my face.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try out a bb cream and went to Amazon to order some.</li>
            <li> The rest of the bottle looks like the real thing-I think I will be ordering from skin79 website from now on.</li>
            <li> everything else on the bottle looks real.</li>
            <li> Always appreciated ^ ^</li>
            <li> I was thankful for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really has negated any need for concealer as it works as a primer/concealer.  </li>
            <li> I am very oily and this has worked very well with my skin.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much thinner</li>
            <li> and the coverage is much lighter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really understand what \\&quot;evens out skin tone\\&quot; meant until I put this stuff on.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t really look like I&#x27;m wearing anything.</li>
            <li> I think the skin79 pink label bb cream is the most moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have very Oily Skin</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy as it seemed settled into my pores and creases making them appear even worse.</li>
            <li> Better than the pink one for me or the gold.</li>
            <li> but others in the Skin79 series), is that I really dislike the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST HAVE for summers and intense sunny days.</li>
            <li> The creams I&#x27;ve used have felt oily, don&#x27;t have staying power, and don&#x27;t have much coverage at all.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly to a smooth matte finish, feels like instant photoshop for my face with no primer or effort</li>
            <li> Skin79 makes a pink label that might work better for you if you&#x27;re in the pinkish undertone category.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Authentication on these product has been a much debated issue on beauty forums.</li>
            <li> &quot; to verify it was the real deal.</li>
            <li> The smell is also much better than the pink one.</li>
            <li> Yes, the pink is more hydrating, but it smeared for me.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t &#x27;luminous&#x27; at all for me, though, there isn&#x27;t really a sheen to it like some BB creams have.  </li>
            <li> And the smell is thankfully not too intense.</li>
            <li> This was actually too light for me.</li>
            <li> It came fast without any problems.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> You have to follow instructions, do not need much.  </li>
            <li> I occasionally break out and most products irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product can be very white looking so especially for those cases you want to do some kind of contouring</li>
            <li> However the sample I received of the pink label bb cream went perfectly on my skin and wasn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> I want the most natural looking finish and it&#x27;s fairly obvious (even at medium distance) that I&#x27;m wearing something.</li>
            <li> I decided on the orange version because I heard it was slightly more moisturizing (although I can&#x27;t verify because this is the only one I have personally tried) and my face has recently been changing and becoming more dry.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The product sets VERY quickly</li>
            <li> The coverage is excellent, I usually dust with some light powder following the application, but have gone without doing so a few times</li>
            <li> After blending in, my skin was a little lighter than usual, but looked flawless.  </li>
            <li> I first tried pink package BB cream from the same brand and liked it, but though that this will give me more matte coverage according to some other reviews.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be repurchasing since I want to try other BB creams, and hopefully find a better match for my olive skin.</li>
            <li> The other Skin79 BB creams are better than this one.</li>
            <li> one provides more protection than some of the other lines, in terms of UV protection</li>
            <li> It is too light for my nw 35 complexion, but I mix a little bit of True Match n6 and it comes out</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream other than the color...</li>
            <li> Other than that I love the formula, it doesn&#x27;t make me oily at all.</li>
            <li> I used to use the hot pink label and it gave off a pinkish white skin kind of glow.</li>
            <li> Then I started noticing how dark it really was after I looked at pictures of myself in better</li>
            <li> When I saw the new orange bb cream released, I looked up reviews on korean websites and they seemed really positive.  </li>
            <li> Before this only bare minerals matched my skin,I mixed the light and golden fair together, but I don&#x27;t like how bare minerals doesn&#x27;t cover well and amplifies any dry spots or acne spots.</li>
            <li> I let a friend with severe eczema try mine, and she turned right around the next day and ordered some, saying it is the first product that does not burn or irritate her skin during flareups, and also evens her skin</li>
            <li> I used maybelline bb cream and though I liked it, it left my face dry.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight yellow undertone but other than that it matched my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> look for the silver sticker at the back of the bottle, it should be there, I just tried to take it off and it completely wrinkled up so it has to be real right?</li>
            <li> I hope I got the real deal not a fake one, but the difference in quality of two seemingly only slightly different products from the same line is astounding.</li>
            <li> While it is a light color than the other two, it adjusts pretty well to my NC 25 skintone.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the matte texture and heavy sunscreen shine actually PREVENT your face from looking too chalky because they make you look like you are wearing sunscreen with just a little bit of coloring, which actually makes your face look much more natural than many other foundations/BB creams that have more fuller color (even those that have darker color).</li>
            <li> With previous liquid makeup I had to use much more to get the coverage I wanted.</li>
            <li> It might help improving my wrinkles, as recently I found that the deep line under my eyes are more tolerable.</li>
            <li> Next, make sure there is no chinese on the box!</li>
            <li> I always come back to my skin79 super plus line.</li>
            <li> The thing is that my skin is not even tan and this bb cream is way too light for me.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, mainly because the product is way too dry even with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I only got lucky.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering from Seoulglamour and have gotten the product quickly.  </li>
            <li> It offers better coverage than the pink and gold, is thinner in consistency</li>
            <li> this particular case</li>
            <li> I first tried it on after applying my usual moisturizer and primer because I read others had a better experience that way.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never ever expected that in a first place, but this stuff like a facial, when you look more rested after you take it of).</li>
            <li> I do like the cream because it&#x27;s warm toned, and the other 2 BB creams I mentioned give me a pinky-gray cast that I can more or less fix with a tiny pump of this.</li>
            <li> Also, I had ordered the Skin79 Super Pink BB Cream before with SPF 25 and just figured the difference in the orange bottle would be higher SPF</li>
            <li> But just a few strokes with my Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80 on clean face</li>
            <li> High SPF (keeps the freckles away)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Since the SPF is so high - 50 - you look like a ghost in pictures.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because I was looking for a high rated sunscreen BB cream.</li>
            <li> I CHOSE THIS FORMULA BECAUSE OF THE HIGH SUNSCREEN</li>
            <li> I happen to live in hot and humid climate for the summer, and this BB cream not only makes me not having to worry about UVA rays because of its intense protection (which works!)</li>
            <li> Do your research a little better than I did.  </li>
            <li> about the product, it says &#x27;whitening&#x27;, that DOES NOT mean it makes your skin whiter</li>
            <li> Like most BB creams, it is a little gray, but that goes away after a while and blends to your skin.  </li>
            <li> This worked a little better.</li>
            <li> I have used the skin 79 oriental which is a little darker and more moisturizing than this cream.</li>
            <li> I also felt like it provided a little more cover up for sunspots and freckles than the paler shades by Skin79.</li>
            <li> Next time I used it, I used a face primer first and Viola!</li>
            <li> Is pat a little more under my eyes and over red/discolored areas.</li>
            <li> I prefer a little more color though</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is FAR better than the Hot Pink version, No grey under tones&lt;br /&gt;Shrinks</li>
            <li> Even when I slip up and get a little too much sun, it looks good because it helps minimize the pink.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t blend very well with my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> I will note that if I use it as an overnight cream by the time I wake up I look normal again.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;ashiness\\&quot; may be popular with the Asian complexion, but as I am not Asian, am 56 yrs old , I do not like the grey hue and that it goes straight to my wrinkles, stays there, and accentuates them!  </li>
            <li> But it faded to my normal skin tone in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as an alternative to the American BB creams (which are pretty much just tinted goo).</li>
            <li> , it also makes sure that I don&#x27;t get a tan from being outside in the sun because of the simultaneous whitening, AND, I completely disagree with people who say that it&#x27;s too \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; or that it&#x27;s too white</li>
            <li> on the official SKIN 79 website they state in fine print that expiry date will not be honored from other seller which points that they are indeed using expiration date instead of manufacturing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if people with medium to darker skin tones would be able to wear it because of the pale color.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like new again</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona so</li>
            <li> Nothing else, no matter how expensive, has every done this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been very happily using the SKIN79 pink cream and decided to try this one because of the increase in SPF.  </li>
            <li> earlier than I expected :)  .</li>
            <li> While they were nice, they didn&#x27;t offer much coverage and fell behind my tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This bb cream gives a radiant effect and looks very natural on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It does fade after about 6 hours for me, but still looks very natural and not at all blotchy like foundations when they fade.</li>
            <li> All you need is a very little on face; blend it well around the hair lines nose and make sure you get the neck and ears area.</li>
            <li> this one appears to be significantly lighter than other.  </li>
            <li> Ijust recieved my cream from skin79 website and the bottle looksa exactly the same as the one I recieved from here.</li>
            <li> consistency is alot lighter than the others and it has a more yellowish tint instead of the usual grayish</li>
            <li> I look pretty white on pictures when I used this.</li>
            <li> I am just so excited that I finally found a product that I can use in place of regular foundation.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a product that evens my skin tone so completely!</li>
            <li> However, that problem is easily solved with a little bronzer.</li>
            <li> I have used the hot pink super plus as well as the VIP Gold label, the Vital bb is my fave followed close by the hot pink label.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple Skin79 BB creams in the past and this one by far is my favorite!</li>
            <li> clearly she&#x27;s never used some of the new stuff out there</li>
            <li> I have their pink bottle version of this BB cream and while I adore the pink bottle cream consistency, when  I saw is one, I bought it because I thought - the more SPF the better for my pale skin.</li>
            <li> but much &amp;#34;greasier&amp;#34; than the hot pink version.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Much, much lighter than the hot pink and gold Skin79 BB</li>
            <li> I tried the orange for the first time today and it is much lighter in color than the pink and gold.</li>
            <li> If you have pale, pinkish skin that burns easily-</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, packed well and the product container looks like something that should be much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the skin 79 gold and pink, and those left me grey, this one is much lighter and more of a peach color.</li>
            <li> And we all know that pump would only work to a certain volume.</li>
            <li> recently bought one from Letif Beauty due to high seller profile review and also last time I bought one it was authentic.</li>
            <li> Skin79 products have drastically cut our getting ready time in half, perhaps more, and helped us treat our very different skin issues with similar products.</li>
            <li> and/or I just use a little bit darker powder foundation with a brush lightly after applying the product by itself instead and that equals it out evenly to match my skin tone as well.</li>
            <li> Although, the shade if a little too light for my skin</li>
            <li> but this bb cream look a little too light for my skin..</li>
            <li> I have tanned east asian skin (i am Korean but i am little darker than most Koreans) tone</li>
            <li> I have pale skin with yellow undertones (about a MAC NC20), but this cream is still very light on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to toss out all my half-used bottles of the old stuff because I&#x27;m never going back!  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this BB cream to work for me, but it simply did not.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of bloggers out there that are crazy about BB creams, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s one with a skin tone similar to yours that help you better judge</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried Lioele Beyond The Solution BB Cream</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve thought I like it, even if it&#x27;s darker then I&#x27;m without a tan, and it wasn&#x27;t perfectly smooth, and I couldn&#x27;t wear it without heavy moisturizer...</li>
            <li> The coverage is natural looking and blends well to my skin.</li>
            <li> After reading so much hype about BB creams, I finally decided to give one a try.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it after 2 weeks, the whole bottle still had 80% left...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say that I am completely un-nerved</li>
            <li> I tried a couple different primers and none seemed to really do the trick.</li>
            <li> Since their is some pigment in this vital cream, it matched my skin well.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was so extra fast</li>
            <li> After reading more and more about the bb cream after I ordered it, I felt instant remorse over my purchase because it was very likely that my product which had already shipped was a fake.</li>
            <li> i did order the triple functions vital cream from the SKIN79 north america website</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how natural it looked in daylight.</li>
            <li> However, this made my pores look really visible and it looked like I have a lot of white spots on my nose!!!</li>
            <li> as far as oily/dry goes.</li>
            <li> I think it is very close overall to Lioele Triple Function bb cream.  </li>
            <li> and this helps control it for at least 6 hours without touching up.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and are acne prone like me</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly, it covers very well with a tiny bead.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve also ordered from China directly</li>
            <li> BRIGHTER.I AM A SIXTY YEAR OLD CAUCASIAN,</li>
            <li> When I use this BB cream, it doesn&#x27;t exactly cover my flaws, but blurs them enough that they are barely visible--almost an airbrushed quality.</li>
            <li> If I put too much on, which is easy because a little bit goes a long way, I can get ghost</li>
            <li> This product is for those woman with pale and light skin.</li>
            <li> And for dry skin, it moisturizes really well!  </li>
            <li> At first, I like it a lot; however, it can make your face dry after awhile.</li>
            <li> However, in my opinion it gave better coverage and lasted quite long too, but there was this slightly tight feeling which I found uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also - A little goes a long way with this product, and make sure to use a moisturizer first if you have any dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does not stop me from getting oily, but I don&#x27;t get oily as quickly as the other BB Creams!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The few light freckles I have on my nose have actually disappeared thanks to the higher SPF and other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Her skin looks softer and more even and the high SPF prevents the rosacea from getting worse.</li>
            <li> control: As the sunscreen is a must for me, as I live in very hot, humid, and extremely sunny country, I didn&#x27;t trust that the sunscreen property from teh BB cream will be enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Too dark and yellow for my neutral skin tone and too light on coverage.</li>
            <li> My main problem is that it&#x27;s so white</li>
            <li> I assume the texture issue is because it&#x27;s such a high SPF, but</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t match with my skin tone, it makes for a high quality present.</li>
            <li> I purchased from PinkGelee (fab seller) and along with the standard size orange, received samples of the pink and gold label to try as well, so I was lucky to have some comparison.  </li>
            <li> This one has more of a yellow tone that works well with my neutral very pale skin.</li>
            <li> It gives light to medium coverage with just a small amount of application.  </li>
            <li> but I will stick to the hot pink.</li>
            <li> i may try hot pink as others rave about it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the gold and got samples of the hot pink and orange.</li>
            <li> The consistency is creamier and thinner than the hot pink and gold as well.</li>
            <li> I have the hot pink too-</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I will stick with the BB cream in the Hot Pink bottle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream color is literary white and it will stay like that even on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> can definitely feel comfortable leaving the house wearing nothing else on my face but this and a little mascara.  </li>
            <li> The pump and hard plastic tube design prevent the user from retrieving the last bit of BB cream after you&#x27;ve used up most of it because there is no way you can squeeze out the content.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my skin79 absolute total which is a little too pink but matches enough and has better coverage. .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recently new to makeup and heard about BB creams recently as well.</li>
            <li> This is the BB cream you would want for summer, especially if you happen to live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge, you only need the tiniest amount, so it will probably last a very long time, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I always set with a sheer powder because that it what really makes the makeup just stay put</li>
            <li> This is much better than American BB creams, it has at least a medium coverage &amp; it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s due to the higher SPF content?</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and when its hot it can become greasy or shiny keep a setting powder with you.</li>
            <li> No breakouts or blackheads from using this product but my skin still feels soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually used this in dry heat, moderate climates and even hot + humid climates - it lasts and controls oil in all of them.</li>
            <li> ahem* mature skin, and this product minimizes pores and doesn&#x27;t seem to settle into lines if worked into the skin enough.</li>
            <li> but then, when I left the house (I wasn&#x27;t even in direct sunlight), my face looked darker.</li>
            <li> I have always used Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> I expected this to have a shimmer to it, but it is very matte.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does this one blend well into my skin, it offers medium/heavy coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since i was ten years old.</li>
            <li> I should have just stuck to the hot pink because the orange was a big disappointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this would make me look younger and cover well, just made me look white, still had to do all my normal makeup routine after so</li>
            <li> I had tried samples of the pink and gold bb creams by skin79, but never really felt the desire to purchase them in full size.</li>
            <li> This made my face everywhere else other than the t-zone SUPER dry that it looked cakey.</li>
            <li> (I actually found the Mizon Snail Cream to make your face look much whiter and chalkier, and I have pretty pale skin!).</li>
            <li> I said before, I&#x27;m new to makeup, and I don&#x27;t really wear it that often, but this stuff makes me want to prettyup EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> overall, I recommend this for oily type skin people, not so much for really dry skin types.</li>
            <li> Liquid foundations don&#x27;t seem to come in the right tone for my skin and feel too heavy, and powder foundations don&#x27;t have staying power and won&#x27;t blend with my concealers well.  </li>
            <li> Not a fan, but could be right for someone with drier or normal skin and less pink skin tones.</li>
            <li> Much less moisturising than hot pink/gold</li>
            <li> You can pile this stuff on and don&#x27;t really need other foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li> The Super Plus Orange bottle is a very heavy coverage.  </li>
            <li> The main difference between this one and the pink one is the shade of the cream-</li>
            <li> I also have many acne scars which need heavy coverage or my skin appears really uneven.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my mom (54)  who has dry skin with large pores and some minor sun damage.</li>
            <li> I was a little alarmed when I applied it the first time, the color was grey-ish.  </li>
            <li> Recently there has been updates from blogs and forum that SKIN 79 has stopped using manufacturing date as of 2013 and all products manufactured on 2013 will have expiration date instead, I am unable to link external links so if you are interested in the link feel free to reply to the comment or PM me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I am a user of the Hot Pink and VIP Gold BB Cream, I had acne and was looking for a product that would cut my morning routine in half and help heal my scars and prevent new blemishes from appearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white and VERY pale with cool undertones.</li>
            <li> Just using it by itself with no other makeup products, it helps cover up the spots on my face a little and my eye circles don&#x27;t show too much.</li>
            <li> My skin is quite fair and with very few freckles, and a few dark spot from acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I had read reviews all over the internet about how this product is too thick when applying, but I find it is fine as long as you know what you are doing.</li>
            <li> My main problem with other foundations and tinted moisturizers is that by the end of the day my face is covered in grease.  </li>
            <li> and I can say I really do think it has helped with the dark marks that I get after the occasional blemish.</li>
            <li> The SKIN79 orange BB cream is the first that I&#x27;ve tried, after recommendation from my sister in law, who has used quite a few different brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cheap and blindly picked the cheapest price I could find, which was from the seller package_go_fast.</li>
            <li> But the other two of snail and hot pink with a Anti-fake label on each of bottle.</li>
            <li> This effect is particularly noticeable when I use it under my eyes alone for dark circle coverage.</li>
            <li> I have large pours and an uneven coloring on my face.</li>
            <li> It is very matte and it will accentuate even the smallest dry spot on the face which I found somewhat extreme for a BB</li>
            <li> My skin had a yellowish tint to it, but I chocked it up to the bad lighting and the bright yellow paint on the bathroom walls.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good because it&#x27;s drying it out but bad because it draws attention to them.</li>
            <li> A bad product from an overall good brand.</li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t know whether only small amount of BB cream will provide enough sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> With some research we decided to buy the Orange Vital Cream since it had an SPF of 40 and was a bit lighter than the other BB&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent base to use during the day, perhaps no more than 4 hours</li>
            <li> Thanks for those little samples!  </li>
            <li> but I use very little because too much will make the makeup look cakey.</li>
            <li> The orange label was designed for dry skin, but I would recommend using your regular moisturizer underneath as this does not provide enough hydration on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had my bb cream long enough to review it</li>
            <li> You still may need to use a little concealer on bigger spots (undereyes, flared pimples, etc), but it completely evens out the redness in my cheeks and makes the pores on my cheeks and nose vanish.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I am sometimes skeptical when reading reviews due to I think people are more likely to write one when they have a negative experience rather than a positive one, which has inclined me to share my thoughts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands like Bobby Brown, Boscia, Garnier, Lioele, Peter Thomas Roth, Tarte and this skin79 is the worst for far!&lt;br /&gt;Is too light and grayish, and make me look like if I had been wearing a mask on my  face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem is i have combo oily dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that it will make current acne dry up</li>
            <li> But I have a pink undertone to my skin and this initially has a yellow undertone to it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think my next purchase will be the pink label bb cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hopes that I could cut some steps and use less products and hopefully save time to get out the door faster OR sleep in a little longer ;).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blends to my skin tone very well (though I am naturally very pale...)  </li>
            <li> consistency and coverage is much heavier than other BB creams so a little goes</li>
            <li> and it drives me insane, ESPECIALLY when I go outside and my face looks completely a different color from the rest of me, even though in-store it looks great.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though, you only need about a half a pump to do your whole face.</li>
            <li> I seldom ever review on Amazon mainly because it has usually been satisfactory experience</li>
            <li> My only problem was the formula was kinda dry for my skin type ( I have really dry skin).</li>
            <li> I have average skin (not oily/ not dry), but I do tend to get dry patches in the winter, and extra oily in the summer.  </li>
            <li> You still need concealer on bad days just on spot, and you can build it up little more (but not much, it become noticeable with too much product)  because BB tend to seep in the skin and leave only a sheen of color...</li>
            <li> but I might switch back to the pink cream because of the shade difference.</li>
            <li> Just use small pea size and work with brush in normal speed, it&#x27;s glides like butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been a problem trying to find a makeup that doesn&#x27;t make me orange or pink with an obvious makeup line.</li>
            <li> I prefer the pink one over this, but SPF 25 is not enough for me!</li>
            <li> I may go back to the pink version.</li>
            <li> The pink one is what I have now, but once it&#x27;s done, I&#x27;m going back to gold.</li>
            <li> The cream is really thick, and covers really well.  </li>
            <li> The little dry patches that would become very noticeable after only a few hours after applying make-up are no longer a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if i say this it is extreme because i wear pretty heavy makeup to cover up acne scars and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> This product is very thick (probably because of the high spf) and feels greasy and cakey even when only applying a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> I have very pale, oily caucasian skin prone to breakouts and found both this and the pink version work very well.  </li>
            <li> cannot comment on other properties as I have used lots and lots of facial care products.  </li>
            <li> Questioning I went and got my other bbcream box (I kept it) and saw that they were completely different.</li>
            <li> This is definitely for people who have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> When I have a blemish I just dab a little extra with the tip of my finger until it&#x27;s covered (only on a fewoccasions I used my concealer.)</li>
            <li> Ive tried numerous other brands too, Garneir, Philosophy, Loreal and others.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last very long; it wears off within a few hours, even after having used setting powder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with getting dry patchy spots, it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen or break me out.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin after I wash my face-</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin use a moisturizer or serum before application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> # Let me give you a background on my skin; I have dry skin during the winter and oil skin during the summer.</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I use witch hazel as toner then apply oil-free moisturizer and wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, which the t-zone is oily and the rest can be dry.</li>
            <li> Still, the fact that it seems to form a dry mask on the skin would probably preclude me ever recommending it to anyone, ever.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I tried it as soon as it arrived on my dry face.</li>
            <li> so you may have dry patches at the end of the day on your pimples.</li>
            <li> It may be great for your skin but the white color was awful.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t nearly as dry as it used to be.</li>
            <li> This does cling to dry spots though, so if you have dry flaky skin, I would not recommend it unless you exfoliate well before applying.</li>
            <li> Which really sucks, because I did like the high SPF</li>
            <li> Because of this I was not able to blend it any way (tried hands, sponges, brushes) with my skin to make it look natural.</li>
            <li> and this bb cream doesn&#x27;t have a grey undertone to it like the pink skin 79 one.</li>
            <li> For one thing, when I ordered I was notified that the expected shipping date 4 - 6 weeks which seems like way too long to wait.</li>
            <li> This is different from the other 2 bb creams I have ordered from Skin 79!  </li>
            <li> I tried a small sample before committing to the big bottle, but it wasn&#x27;t enough apparently to realize that this cream is too heavy for my combination skin.  </li>
            <li> Plus my skin was tight and dry after I washed this stuff off, so it&#x27;s definitely not for anyone but</li>
            <li> However the next day I woke up to a pimple, I brushed it off and just applied my usual zit cream.</li>
            <li> (Natural redhead, so very pale)</li>
            <li> On my skin it would rub off on clothes and made my face look very dry, flaky, and pale.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bronzer helped bring some color back into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also pat a little bit extra over pimples, and it covers them well.</li>
            <li> only use a little and it will streak that goes away after oxidation</li>
            <li> start with a little in the middle of your face and then spread outward.  </li>
            <li> never slightly chalky like Lioele tend to left my face, lasts ALL DAY - eventually after few hours i did see slight moist sheen, but just few strokes with kabuki brush</li>
            <li> A lot whiter than I expected though.</li>
            <li> One for the pink BB, one for the gold, a wrinkle filler BB, and a face cleanser BB.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;- Not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I have tried the orange, pink, and gold blends</li>
            <li> I recieved my bb cream faster than expected.</li>
            <li> it arrived, but it came to my job and the office is closed on Saturday).  </li>
            <li> I can almost never find my color in foundations because they always look too peachy or pink</li>
            <li> So, hopefully that gives some hope to people that may have trouble with it being too white or staying on.</li>
            <li> In the mirror I could see that this made a network of webby looking lines on my face, it actually AGED me.</li>
            <li> She noticed the skin whitening and brightening after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Missha, the pink Skin79, Bobbi Brown, Smashbox, Dr. Jart Blk Label, and Boscia.</li>
            <li> I have now tried elisha coy, hanskin control bb cream, gold, pink and orange, liz k color veil.  </li>
            <li> The only problem that I&#x27;ve noticed is if you put it on to heavy it will settle into wrinkles.</li>
            <li> 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how thick the BB cream was.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got pale skin, like NW15 in MAC, rosey undertones, red hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale asian girl to begin with</li>
            <li> , I have asked a few friends to get it from Korea for me for half a year and finally one of my friends found it at the airport.  </li>
            <li> I will keep rotating between this and one other BB cream</li>
            <li> and already I don&#x27;t see a need for any other product.</li>
            <li> Other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Just so you know though a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I also received two samples of other Korean cosmetic items.</li>
            <li> Oh, and in extreme heat, I cannot tell it is on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I use small amounts like 1/4 a pump it oxidizes enough</li>
            <li> and I agree with what other users states in their review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came with three other samples in the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I apply it like other BB creams, it looks like I&#x27;m verging into kabuki makeup in pictures.</li>
            <li> ALL DAY.WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT.SAMPLES OF OTHER BB CREAMS</li>
            <li> if you are typically fair/pale or medium get the pink one</li>
            <li> Now that the BB Cream trend is so hot, some of the American makers have stepped it up with SPF protection, but it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> the color is a very pale yellow that didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m redheaded, irish, very, very pale.</li>
            <li> The only thing not good is the shipping time is too long, it almost over 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> I have purchased but may change to one other if I can find one that doesn&#x27;t have the whitener for when I have dark tanned skin in the Summer.</li>
            <li> Not to mention SPF 50, the final push that got me to buy this, what with summer hitting hard and</li>
            <li> My skin looks even, still looks like real skin and there is no dreaded make up line at the jaw, even when my blending has been careless.</li>
            <li> It also suffers from a strange grey-ish tint that stood out on my skin no matter how much I blended.  </li>
            <li> I really think these creams on here have been tampered with and are fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and even put on half my face and clinque on the other half</li>
            <li> When I first put this on I look scary pale and ghost-like</li>
            <li> You will NOT need any other coverage even with acne scars and dark eye circles...trust me!</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I tried and I&#x27;m disappointed to see that other creams are different colors like gray-ish.</li>
            <li> This bbcream was also missing the official tag that came on my other bbcream, stating that it was made in korea.</li>
            <li> Will buy from SeoulGlamour!UPDATE- After a few weeks I noticed the BB and skin79 letters have rubbed off also I compared the sticker to my other skin 79 cream that I recieved from skin79 website and it looks tampered-</li>
            <li> now use the BB cream half and half with my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Slight shimmers to it (but prob.</li>
            <li> (I have slightly oily skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I received the product from seoulglamour in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> are less pronounced.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this and one other skin79 bb cream, they both past the authenticity test, I researched everything about what a real and fake looks like and these have everything the actual/original product has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a very pink pale person.</li>
            <li> A down side is the dewy finish can sometimes be a little cloying (</li>
            <li> This Skin79 product made it feel like I had a mask on my face, that was tight and webby-looking.</li>
            <li> single one complaint I have</li>
            <li> It covers up my dark circles and redness and minimizes my pores without feeling like anything is on my face at all!</li>
            <li> I could see a little of the letters void on the sticker.</li>
            <li> After the primer dries a little I use my fingers to put on the bb cream.</li>
            <li> For my undereye circles and any spots that still show through I blend a little bit of concealer.</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;d call the finish a little on the matte side.</li>
            <li> I opened it up as soon as I could and checked for all the little \\&quot;go-to&#x27;s\\</li>
            <li> Now all I have to do in the morning is wash, moisturize, BB cream, sometimes a little powder</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to mention that my crow lines, dryness and uneven skin disappeared</li>
            <li> Especially the texture is thin, so I can apply on my face easier.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used it a few times.</li>
            <li> product is so heavy and doesn&#x27;t let your skin breathe.</li>
            <li> It sat heavy on my face all day and was hell to scrub off at night.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered the gold skin79 cream and the letters rubbed off after a few weeks on the bottle</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but this product dried me out</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t look dead.</li>
            <li> After a couple hours it felt heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> But I have mostly-dry skin, with a few oily places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been moisturizing with jojoba oil the night before or a few hours before putting this on and there&#x27;s no issues</li>
            <li> This BB cream does not break me out either (even in the heavy humidity!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made me look dead.</li>
            <li> I have been using this just about everyday since I got it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also worn this out to a few night clubs and have not come close to dancing off my face,</li>
            <li> But here comes the missing star - after using it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> but I never liked thick foundations or creams especially with problem skin</li>
            <li> Usually if I cake on foundation-like products too thick, dry problem areas on my face, like between my brow eyes and brow line, tend to look dried out.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s so hard to know when you get fake Skin79 and other products unless they come directly from the source!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even after the adjustment period, it is still too pale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pale and this also made me look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> matched the skin of a pale woman.</li>
            <li> It gets one star off because the color is on the pale side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium pale caucasian (probably around NC25).</li>
            <li> but it makes me look too pale.</li>
            <li> While for skin79 orange label, I need to apply little by little, as it is quite thick when applied.  </li>
            <li> I had a few small pimples on my forehead when I took it off</li>
            <li> Inthose few minutes while it&#x27;s adjusting, I usually just do my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I was an oil slick after a few hours.</li>
            <li> (It reaked of sunscreen but matched my porcelain skin) and aveeno&#x27;s bb cream (it was thick and moisturizing, but had sparkles and was too dark for my skin)</li>
            <li> Ain&#x27;t nothing wrong with a little color, Asian ladies!</li>
            <li> It takes very little BB cream to cover my face.</li>
            <li> A little too thick for me.</li>
            <li> It does have a whitener, so I find that it needs either some mixing with my usual foundation to match with my skin tone</li>
            <li> although I like it usually).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have blemishes</li>
            <li> This is what usually happens when you remove the sticker.</li>
            <li> while i did not try the product i am not sure of the authenticity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well, but doesnt make my oily skin look like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I usually use a face lotion before applying this BB cream</li>
            <li> I think this is a deceptive marketing strategy to make us buy more and buy sooner, but it&#x27;s a terrible waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which makes me to believe this is either not authentic or expired.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seller respond that this is the manufacturing date, which makes me to suspect this is not authentic.</li>
            <li> I usually have issues with perfumed items, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I used to have to put on powder a few times day to cover up oily shine but not anymore!</li>
            <li> I have sinced ordered the gold label and am anxiously awaiting it.  </li>
            <li> USUALLY ARE INCLUDED</li>
            <li> A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF FOUNDATION.A LITTLE POWDER</li>
            <li> so it looked a little awkward having a chalk white face.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, Caucasian</li>
            <li> She has very pale skin</li>
            <li> SORRY, ITS KINDA LONG.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find tinted moisturizers/foundations/</li>
            <li> and it is hard to get it blended</li>
            <li> I tried to cancel my order but it was too late.</li>
            <li> I felt like I wasted about 15 dollars on a fake bb cream just to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> the vendor raphasoul is not nice.</li>
            <li> I know it was at least 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The product came 1 day late, but it didn&#x27;t matter to me at all.</li>
            <li> blends to complextion, as least it did for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick like a foundation almost.</li>
            <li> It is thick and controls oil.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with it.</li>
            <li> that, even after checking everything,  I am still not sure I have an authenic product here!  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re not extremely fair like myself, then grab this product.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is not good</li>
            <li> its so thick and oddly colored that its impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> (I am not sure which one is worse expired or fake).  </li>
            <li> It is very thick, however I look like a geisha girl when I put it on.</li>
            <li> It can go on very thick, which may have been my problem.</li>
            <li> The consistency in comparison to the others, out of the bottle it came out thin but applied very thick.</li>
            <li> The pink one is not too bad</li>
            <li> I have freckles, sun spots, eczema patches, broken capillaries, redness.</li>
            <li> The staying power is not great.</li>
            <li> Leaving baby-face behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> This cream would obviously not be ideal for evenings/nights and cloudy/no sun days.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is extremely thick and impossible to blend into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It it quite difficult to buy this BB cream in Korea</li>
            <li> (I know, complicated, but</li>
            <li> I also feel kinda guilty.</li>
            <li> I could tell from the box that it was fake</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was not for me</li>
            <li> but it was weird.</li>
            <li> And I guess maybe it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this time when I wanted to try the Triple Function BB cream from SKIN 79</li>
            <li> Sadly, it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> After a week of using this, my face was very broken out with cystic acne.</li>
            <li> and I use very little of it as a cover up, base and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> See if any of the letters rub/scratch off the bottle, dont go crazy with a knife but dont use a feather either.</li>
            <li> Also, I hate how fake foundation looks in daylight and</li>
            <li> I end up looking like I&#x27;m wearing bad self tanner.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t my shade.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated with all the work I had to do each morning with primers and moisturizers and serums and finishing powders and on and on and on...</li>
            <li> however it broke me out bad :(</li>
            <li> i was disappointed when applying it</li>
            <li> I hate to say I was incredibly disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have never once had cystic zits on my face before and they were very painful.</li>
            <li> She has an oily T-Zone and some enlarged pores that causes her makeup to slide off during the day and it would look horrible.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the worst BB Creams I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> skin 79 triple function BB cream is so like makeup and so goo for the skin. I love the look and no makeup needed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s wonderful, I have recently bought a couple of bb creams, macs bb cream (It reaked of sunscreen but matched my porcelain skin) and aveeno&#x27;s bb cream (it was thick and moisturizing, but had sparkles and was too dark for my skin) I&#x27;ve tried the skin 79 gold and pink, and those left me grey, this one is much lighter and more of a peach color. It blends in very nicely, and is very moisturizing. I don&#x27;t have a problem with getting dry patchy spots, it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen or break me out. It&#x27;s just so much better than any western bb cream. I feel like this product actually helps my acne. It really helped me at a wedding too because everyone else got sunburnt, and I didn&#x27;t because this has a powerful sunscreen. A little goes a long way though, you only need about a half a pump to do your whole face.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands like Bobby Brown, Boscia, Garnier, Lioele, Peter Thomas Roth, Tarte and this skin79 is the worst for far!&lt;br /&gt;Is too light and grayish, and make me look like if I had been wearing a mask on my  face.&lt;br /&gt;My complexions is NC25 and this BB cream made me look so badly!&lt;br /&gt;This cream  melted on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Even though I didn&#x27;t like this cream I think it does a good job controlling oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rather keep using my  Lioele and my Peter Thomas Roth, they are the best for far!</li>
            <li> Love this line although it was a weird color for me if you&#x27;re Asian or use foundation with yellow hue to brighten your skin this is for you, if you are typically fair/pale or medium get the pink one</li>
            <li> I like how this product finishes. I have dry skin after I wash my face- I usually need to use a lot of lotion before putting this product on, but it looks great. A lot whiter than I expected though.</li>
            <li> I have very pale, oily caucasian skin prone to breakouts and found both this and the pink version work very well.  My main problem with other foundations and tinted moisturizers is that by the end of the day my face is covered in grease.  This one somehow feels light, stays put, gives moderate coverage and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  Nothing else, no matter how expensive, has every done this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been very happily using the SKIN79 pink cream and decided to try this one because of the increase in SPF.  The main difference between this one and the pink one is the shade of the cream- this one appears to be significantly lighter than other.  If I put too much on, which is easy because a little bit goes a long way, I can get ghost face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with this purchase but I might switch back to the pink cream because of the shade difference.</li>
            <li> The shipping and service were great.  I have used the BB detox cleanser and absolutely love it! So I thought I would try this product. I like the SPF rating.  It is very thick, however I look like a geisha girl when I put it on. I am Caucasian, but tan easily and my face does not match the rest of me when I used it.  I will note that if I use it as an overnight cream by the time I wake up I look normal again.  I think it is great for the skin but not so great to use during daytime.</li>
            <li> I think that this product is great, and I even did a 5 star review bragging about how awesome the texture is, but I deleted my review because it was misleading.  I really wanted this BB cream to work for me, but it simply did not.  I have fair skin.  Fair like, most of the time when I buy makeup shades that say \\&quot;ivory\\&quot; or \\&quot;fair\\&quot; I end up looking like I&#x27;m wearing bad self tanner.  So, the main reason why I bought this cream was because of all the rave reviews from \\&quot;fair skinned\\&quot; girls.  They&#x27;re liars.  This product is not, I repeat, IS NOT, for truly fair skinned gals.  It is, however, perfect for those of you who have light beige skin, and who tan fairly easy... If you have pale, pinkish skin that burns easily- this is not the product for you.  I used this product for about a week, primarily wearing it under powder.  My skin had a yellowish tint to it, but I chocked it up to the bad lighting and the bright yellow paint on the bathroom walls.  Then I started noticing how dark it really was after I looked at pictures of myself in better light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all that, yes, it is a good product.  The cream is really thick, and covers really well.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more the medium/heavy side.  And for dry skin, it moisturizes really well!  Hence the 4 star rating!  So if you&#x27;re not extremely fair like myself, then grab this product.  If you are, I say you&#x27;re better off not wasting your money for a product you have to hide under layers of makeup.  Do your research a little better than I did.  There are a lot of bloggers out there that are crazy about BB creams, and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s one with a skin tone similar to yours that help you better judge which cream is best suited for your skin color and type.</li>
            <li> LOVE this BB cream! It does not feel heavy on my face and makes my skin look flawless, even when I&#x27;m breaking out.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I have freckles, sun spots, eczema patches, broken capillaries, redness. I also have what would be called *ahem* mature skin, and this product minimizes pores and doesn&#x27;t seem to settle into lines if worked into the skin enough. When I use this BB cream, it doesn&#x27;t exactly cover my flaws, but blurs them enough that they are barely visible--almost an airbrushed quality. My skin looks even, still looks like real skin and there is no dreaded make up line at the jaw, even when my blending has been careless. Not to mention, I get this fabulous lit-from-within glow that doesn&#x27;t look sparkly or shiny--just a smooth, youthful complexion. The orange label was designed for dry skin, but I would recommend using your regular moisturizer underneath as this does not provide enough hydration on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it only 4/5 stars for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The staying power is not great. I find that I have to reapply after about 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I have pale skin with yellow undertones (about a MAC NC20), but this cream is still very light on me. Even after the adjustment period, it is still too pale. (I use a darker toned finishing powder than what I normally use and that gives me a perfect match.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, despite the drawbacks, I am happier with this BB cream than I ever have been with any foundation. (Nars Sheer Glow came close, but only lasted about 2-4 hours on me.) The bottle is huge, you only need the tiniest amount, so it will probably last a very long time, even with daily use.</li>
            <li> This is very good pruduct, it matches my skin tone very well! I tried so many BB creams, and so far, this is the best color match. The coverage is pertty good, and gives a natural skin look! I like to recommend this BB cream to who has a fair skin.Thanks for those little samples!  The only thing not good is the shipping time is too long, it almost over 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> It it quite difficult to buy this BB cream in Korea, I have asked a few friends to get it from Korea for me for half a year and finally one of my friends found it at the airport.  I have a combination skin.  My skin is quite fair and with very few freckles, and a few dark spot from acne scars.  I have large pore problem around my nose, cheeks, and forehead.  I have tried only two BB creams, Missha Perfect Cover and this one, and I think it will be useful for those who are searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Application:  Missha is better, I can use only one pump and apply all over my face to have a perfect finish.  While for skin79 orange label, I need to apply little by little, as it is quite thick when applied.  I used very small amount and applied three times to get perfect finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil control: As the sunscreen is a must for me, as I live in very hot, humid, and extremely sunny country, I didn&#x27;t trust that the sunscreen property from teh BB cream will be enough for me.  I trust one teaspoon rule of the sunscreen for the entire face.  So I really don&#x27;t know whether only small amount of BB cream will provide enough sunscreen.  Thus I always apply sunscreen before applying BB cream.  As for the skin79 orange label, it was stated on the skin79 website that the skin should be well moisturized before applying, thus having the moisturizing cream and sunscreen is just perfect before using it.  My face would start dewy before noon when using skin79 (5 hours of application) while Missha stayed matt longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage:  Skin79 covers the dark spot very well, my spots and freckles are less noticeable with it, however Missha does cover all the pores and it does what it says \\&quot;perfect cover\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;#Edited#: After I turned back to use Missha, I have a second thought on the coverage that Skin79 orange and Missha perfect cover are equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on other properties as I have used lots and lots of facial care products.  It might help improving my wrinkles, as recently I found that the deep line under my eyes are more tolerable. I basically use BB creams instead of foundation, and they are better than foundation in providing so many properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would think I am quite bias towards Missha, I admitted it.  I love Missha, but I like skin79 orange label as well, if I haven&#x27;t found Missha first.  In conclusion with the skin79 BB cream, it is very good BB cream but you need to be well moisturised before applying.</li>
            <li> . _ .LOL SORRY, ITS KINDA LONG. I ordered it on 1/25 and it came 2/4! So fast! And it came with 3 samples instead of 2!  . _ .So as you might have heard, there are alot of fakes. The one I got was legit, many of seoulglamour&#x27;s things are.  . _ .I already did all my research so I hope this helps. MOST IMPORTANT: look for the silver sticker at the back of the bottle, it should be there, I just tried to take it off and it completely wrinkled up so it has to be real right? See if any of the letters rub/scratch off the bottle, dont go crazy with a knife but dont use a feather either. Next, make sure there is no chinese on the box! And on the box, when it says \\&quot;Triple Functions\\&quot; MAKE SURE it doesnt say \\&quot;Fungtions\\&quot; LOL yes with a g. On the bottle, it shouldnt have the website anywhere AND there shouldnt be a cap on your probehead (where the make-up comes out). So yup, check those!  . _ .Now about the product, it says &#x27;whitening&#x27;, that DOES NOT mean it makes your skin whiter, it just makes it look bight and flawless. It does have a light,fresh scent, but it goes away after a while. Like most BB creams, it is a little gray, but that goes away after a while and blends to your skin.  . _ .Btw, it is for light skinned, im about NC20 and it matches pretty well. I have almost no acne, but some blackheads and an occasional pimple. Its okay to have one or two pimples, but dont depend on this cream to cover it cuz you&#x27;ll clearly see it. Not recommended to cake it on!! Good Luck~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NC15 combination (dry/normal) fair skin, neutral undertone, green eyes, blond. So far I&#x27;ve tried Lioele Beyond The Solution BB Cream and I&#x27;ve thought I like it, even if it&#x27;s darker then I&#x27;m without a tan, and it wasn&#x27;t perfectly smooth, and I couldn&#x27;t wear it without heavy moisturizer...(I know, complicated, but still better then any foundation i tried, even Lancome, Ester Lauder and Chanel) But then I got this orange perfectness by mail (month ago)... This is my HG, I swear. I don&#x27;t want to mention that my crow lines, dryness and uneven skin disappeared (I&#x27;ve never ever expected that in a first place, but this stuff like a facial, when you look more rested after you take it of). But just a few strokes with my Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80 on clean face and I&#x27;m perfectly ready for my contouring + blush+mascara. It&#x27;s lighting my face up, but still don&#x27;t change my color...it&#x27;s like it glowing from within, because you can&#x27;t see product on your face ones it&#x27;s there. You still need concealer on bad days just on spot, and you can build it up little more (but not much, it become noticeable with too much product)  because BB tend to seep in the skin and leave only a sheen of color... but for the rest of issues - redness, unevenness, dryness and simply tiredness - this BB just wipes everything off. Leaving baby-face behind. I even use it to mask my dark circle, and it&#x27;s works perfect. Seriously. never slightly chalky like Lioele tend to left my face, lasts ALL DAY - eventually after few hours i did see slight moist sheen, but just few strokes with kabuki brush and it&#x27;s like new again (I think, it&#x27;s a moistener in product coming out. You don&#x27;t need powder, it&#x27;s ruining whole point to use BB and become noticeable. I even use my fingers (clean) to pat spots around a nose and it worked). All cosmetics - shadows, blush, contour - all staying perfectly. My husband even noticed, that i look fresh and perfect this days :) And NO breakouts :) ;)Or, forget to mention. It never slides out from my face after few hours and my face stays perfectly touchable. It&#x27;s amazing!  Totally recommend this BB for fair and dry-normal-combination with oily zones skin. Just use small pea size and work with brush in normal speed, it&#x27;s glides like butter.</li>
            <li> The BB Cream came in very cute packaging from Korea and there were four samples with it!  One for the pink BB, one for the gold, a wrinkle filler BB, and a face cleanser BB.  Although I have not used it yet, all of the packaging seems real and I&#x27;m excited to try it this weekend.</li>
            <li> My daughter received her  BB cream today! earlier than I expected :)  . It is my second purchase form this seller and they are awesome and of course those creams are excellent!  I am very happy and my daughter is happier</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to be able to get away from using multiple products on my face. I have acne prone skin that can get very oily but now is now getting dryer because of my age. I found the color a bit too light, but the coverage was great! Too great actually--I don&#x27;t like foundation in general so I gave it to my daughter who loves it, and am back to using just sunscreen and some concealer and powder. It can go on very thick, which may have been my problem. My daughter is much better at applying a full coverage product like this.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great buildable coverage and best of all leaves a nice matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;Lightly scented with a nice texture,suitable for fair/light skin tones. I have used the hot pink super plus as well as the VIP Gold label, the Vital bb is my fave followed close by the hot pink label. I&#x27;ve also tried out Misha B as well as Lioele and found them to be heavily scented and very oily causing havoc on my already oily skin. I always come back to my skin79 super plus line.</li>
            <li> This product is better then expected. It does have a whitener, so I find that it needs either some mixing with my usual foundation to match with my skin tone and/or I just use a little bit darker powder foundation with a brush lightly after applying the product by itself instead and that equals it out evenly to match my skin tone as well. I had read reviews all over the internet about how this product is too thick when applying, but I find it is fine as long as you know what you are doing. As long as you apply the product properly, spread it light and even, it works good. I find the best way to do this is a sponge and this BB Cream is not absorbed into the sponge as regular foundations are. I will keep rotating between this and one other BB cream I have purchased but may change to one other if I can find one that doesn&#x27;t have the whitener for when I have dark tanned skin in the Summer.</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream. The coverage is natural looking and blends well to my skin. It&#x27;s light but makes a difference. It&#x27;s one of there lighter BBS I&#x27;ve tried. One of the best features of this product the brightening/evening serum effect. Washing the bb off after one day of wearing out shows skin improvement. A few days or weeks of use and my skin is bright, even, and glowing. A down side is the dewy finish can sometimes be a little cloying (although I like it usually).</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Seoulglamour and was so happy when it arrived 4 weeks early and it was authentic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this BB cream is the coverage is slightly more than the Hot Pink version, it was a fresh scent(that does not linger), higher SPF, and looks and feels natural. I have never used a face product that made my skin look so perfect. It covers up my dark circles and redness and minimizes my pores without feeling like anything is on my face at all! Lasted all day and keeps shine and oil to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;The finish is very natural and it blends easily with my fingers. I don&#x27;t think using a brush with this product would be successful, and a sponge would just be wasteful. The color is also lighter than the Hot Pink version, which will not work for everyone but is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT//&lt;br /&gt;After using this for months (and ordering my second bottle of it) I wanted to update my review :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love the medium coverage and neutral undertone as well as the oil control. If you have dry skin use a moisturizer or serum before application.&lt;br /&gt;The few light freckles I have on my nose have actually disappeared thanks to the higher SPF and other ingredients. No breakouts or blackheads from using this product but my skin still feels soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually used this in dry heat, moderate climates and even hot + humid climates - it lasts and controls oil in all of them.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent base to use during the day, perhaps no more than 4 hours BUT if you have blackheads or pimples marks, this it&#x27;s not an option. This product is for flawless skin, will not work if you are trying to cover pimple marks or  anything like that..&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s great if you have to use foundation in your day to day. Oh and It smells a lot like sunscreen. Like, a lot. I would buy it again but for use it if i have to go to the beach.</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 BB creams in hopes of finding my perfect cream.  The Super Plus Orange bottle is a very heavy coverage.  I have only used it today, and hope with prolonged usage I will see a difference.  I have average skin (not oily/ not dry), but I do tend to get dry patches in the winter, and extra oily in the summer.  I was looking for a good coverage, close to my (pale but tans easily- English/Northern Italian) skin tone, and moisturizing.  I haven&#x27;t seen any sign of moisture, but with continued use this may change.  I also want to state that the color is very light-- even light for my skin tone.  I have to add bronzer so I don&#x27;t look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> First off - great quick shipping -I ordered this on the 11th and received it on the 22nd.  OK now for the review. I&#x27;ve got pale skin, like NW15 in MAC, rosey undertones, red hair. This product goes amazing with my skin tone! It&#x27;s so hard to find tinted moisturizers/foundations/etc that match me and this is perfect. Also - A little goes a long way with this product, and make sure to use a moisturizer first if you have any dry skin. I would describe this product like a tinted moisturizer meets foundation. It&#x27;s all I use on my face aside from moisturizer. It helps cover the redness in my cheeks. It doesn&#x27;t make my cheeks/pores feel hot and flushed like some foundations/creams do. I am in love. I want to get another so that I&#x27;ve got a backup in case they ever discontinue it!  I also feel kinda guilty. I just bought some foundations from sephora and I may need to return them , I haven&#x27;t even received them yet and already I don&#x27;t see a need for any other product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  it is smooth and light and I use very little of it as a cover up, base and sunscreen.  it is great for my oily skin and I am happy to finally find a product that truly does it all.  The price is also not outrageous.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this BB cream. I loved my first one. It had great skin benefits, good coverage, felt moisturizing and looked very natural. I hate to say I was incredibly disappointed with this one. I could tell from the box that it was fake and then the bottle didn&#x27;t have the authentication sticker. I tried to use it anyway and shook up the bottle but the inside gold part came free from the orange exterior and flew across my bathroom. The look and smell of it are different as well. I now need to order a new bottle, hopefully this time it will be authentic.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST makeup ever. I have really fair skin, similar to a natural redhead. It&#x27;s always been a problem trying to find a makeup that doesn&#x27;t make me orange or pink with an obvious makeup line. I also have many acne scars which need heavy coverage or my skin appears really uneven. The color of BB cream is very light and has no pink undertones. I don&#x27;t know if people with medium to darker skin tones would be able to wear it because of the pale color. You only need a small dot of the BB cream and it gives awesome coverage all over your face. You can add more and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey. With previous liquid makeup I had to use much more to get the coverage I wanted. It&#x27;s so amazing. It changes into a nice matte finish, which is not what I expected at all since it has so much SPF. I don&#x27;t even need to use sunscreen under this since it&#x27;s SPF 50. Along with the SPF, it has whitening properties, so I&#x27;m hoping it speeds up the fading of my scars. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to use powder on those hot days ever again. This BB cream is everything you need in one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revlon Colorstay in Ivory is the next best makeup in color and texture, but of course it doesn&#x27;t have all the added SPF and benefits of BB cream. I will definitely be using BB cream over Colorstay from now on! Ordering it on Amazon every time I run out is worth it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Do not get this unless you are white as hell. I am fair to medium with yellow undertone. I looked like I had chalk on my face.</li>
            <li> After reading so much hype about BB creams, I finally decided to give one a try.  Skin79 products had great reviews and I had read that this brand was better than most of the new American made ones.  I also liked that this particular product had SPF 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how thick the BB cream was.  The first couple times I used it, I just put it straight on my face.  The coverage was amazing!  After blending in, my skin was a little lighter than usual, but looked flawless.  A little bronzer helped bring some color back into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use the BB cream half and half with my moisturizer.  My skin gets flaky and I find there&#x27;s not enough moisturizing in the BB cream alone.  If I try and wear it alone, my face looks like it&#x27;s peeling off.  Naturally I don&#x27;t get quite as smooth of coverage when blending with moisturizer(more shine in my case), but the coverage is still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again.  I can&#x27;t believe how much better my face looks!</li>
            <li> First and foremost, again, I&#x27;d like to say that Seoulglamour delivered this product very quickly and efficiently. The product is authentic as well just like my pink label BB Cream that I purchased from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the products coverage was just like that of a foundation but very light weight on the skin. It has a slight yellow undertone but other than that it matched my skin perfectly. I&#x27;m extremely pale so I don&#x27;t suggest anyone with skin darker than a drugstore \\&quot;Ivory\\&quot; or \\&quot;Porcelain\\&quot; try this out. I had a few small pimples on my forehead when I took it off but I haven&#x27;t seen them since; I&#x27;m going to assume it was because of Urban Decays All Night Setting Spray that did it.</li>
            <li> This bb cream has full coverage and is light enough for my skin tone.. My only problem was the formula was kinda dry for my skin type ( I have really dry skin). The coverage is beautiful n it&#x27;s a great product for someone with more oily skin.. Unfortunately this product was not for me&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> I tried many BB Creams from this brand and loved all of them - except this one.  This one is greasy and doesn&#x27;t cover very well.  It also wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> this product is too oily...I got more acne than before. I stopped using it after 2 weeks, the whole bottle still had 80% left...and I throw it away.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot.  Especially the texture is thin, so I can apply on my face easier.  I am sure, I will recommend this product to my friend.  It came as the date promise.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple BB creams since they have become popular and reviews exploded all over YouTube. This is the best, most silky cream for porcelain skin tone. It has become the only make up I use apart from mascara.LOOOOOOOVE it</li>
            <li> It looks like skin the only problem for most people is coverage or color. this isn&#x27;t a problem for me because i mix some of my foundation with the bb cream so it won&#x27;t be too fair for my color and this bb cream doesn&#x27;t have a grey undertone to it like the pink skin 79 one. it says that this comes with 2 samples but i got 4 2 from the brand hanskin and 2 from skin79. i find that the best way to apply this is with your fingers in a light swiping motion in one direction. when i worked this in circular motions it then to lift and emphasize some flakiness.</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;- Great coverage (covers my freckles and red spots)&lt;br /&gt;- Light feeling and natural looking&lt;br /&gt;- High SPF (keeps the freckles away)&lt;br /&gt;- No pore clogging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;- Not very moisturizing (it gets flaky sometimes)&lt;br /&gt;- My face looks whiter than my neck (maybe I&#x27;m just paranoid??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I&#x27;m one happy gal. I prefer the pink one over this, but SPF 25 is not enough for me! This is much better than traditional foundation and powder.</li>
            <li> First- I&#x27;d like to say that I am completely un-nerved that, even after checking everything,  I am still not sure I have an authenic product here!  That said- I found it very \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; on my skin.  This \\&quot;ashiness\\&quot; may be popular with the Asian complexion, but as I am not Asian, am 56 yrs old , I do not like the grey hue and that it goes straight to my wrinkles, stays there, and accentuates them!  I am still a fan of \\&quot;BB creams\\&quot; and what they might can do for me,  BUT,  I will not purchase this ashy product or from this company, again.  For peace of mind,  I will look for a BB cream from a reputable company in the USA that has a much better selection of hues and try again.  Hope this has been helpful.</li>
            <li> Ordered Skin75 BB Balm on 4/1/12 &amp; it was delivered on 4/8/12, was pleased with fast delivery.  I was a little alarmed when I applied it the first time, the color was grey-ish.  But it faded to my normal skin tone in about 5 minutes.  Very comfortable to wear with matte finish.  Will be buying again</li>
            <li> Too dark and yellow for my neutral skin tone and too light on coverage. I&#x27;ll stick with my skin79 absolute total which is a little too pink but matches enough and has better coverage. .</li>
            <li> If you have fair skin color, this well work really good on you. Just using it by itself with no other makeup products, it helps cover up the spots on my face a little and my eye circles don&#x27;t show too much. I don&#x27;t have scars but my daughter uses the vip gold collection one(silver/grey one) and it covers up hers so I pretty sure it well do the same too. It also feels light on your skin, sometimes I forget that I even have it on. I will be purchasing this again in the future. (:</li>
            <li> I like the consistency and the fact that it covers most of my blemishes very well, but it doesn&#x27;t match my skintone perfectly. I would need to add another liquid foundation to make it match my skin tone. Other than that I have no complaints. It stays on the skin very well, moisturizes, while keeping your skin fairly matte. My skin is very oily so I wear this over the top of a primer and then put a bit of powder over the top and it stays nice for hours!</li>
            <li> At first putting this bb cream on it seemed like a miracle. All my scars and blemishes were covered and my face looked flawless. Then I looked into my close up vanity mirror to see how cakey it looked. I played with it and ended up washing it off and then applied a primer first. This worked a little better. Not as cakey. I normally have pretty oily skin so I thought this would be good because it gave a nice matte finish. But within an hour my chin was peeling and the oil on my forehead was clumping up the bb cream. I washed it off and started yet again, not losing hope. I tried a couple different primers and none seemed to really do the trick. My t-zone would make the cc cream separate and clump and for some reason it made my chin peel and flake. I live in Arizona so the climate here right now is pretty hot. Maybe that has something to do with it. Either way I will continue to try it because of what I paid for it. I think this would be good for a short amount of time, maybe a date night or a school picture, but it seems that over time it looses its flawless appearance and looks messy.</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream. I bought it for my mother but I&#x27;ve used it a few times. I&#x27;m in my 20s and have combination skin so this wasn&#x27;t the appropriate Skin79 BB cream for me but I do like the coverage that it gives. You can pile this stuff on and don&#x27;t really need other foundation or concealer. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last very long; it wears off within a few hours, even after having used setting powder. I also noticed that it made my skin look whiter when I applied it but then, when I left the house (I wasn&#x27;t even in direct sunlight), my face looked darker. Once I went indoors again, my face looked whiter again. So I can&#x27;t say that it actually oxidizes but it was weird. My mother loves it though so I&#x27;ll probably keep purchasing it for her.</li>
            <li> With it&#x27;s small but it is beautiful to use and did not take the time to ship the product and this is an advantage as well as sweet</li>
            <li> The consistency of the cream is great, smells good, and high in SPF. Only downside is that it makes my skin look ghostly</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Korean skin care and this is my fave.  It matches my skin tone really well and doesn&#x27;t sink into my pores. I am able to wear this alone and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> awesome feel, coverage and moisturizer, my face loves it. Bought this on with the higher XP for my mom for Christmas and her skin looks much more even with whitening tint in it and is good for you! Amazing price, great product, Not only would I recommend this product but I have bough it to share with family members!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but much &amp;#34;greasier&amp;#34; than the hot pink version. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and this &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; container BB Cream seems to slide off of my face during the day. Some may find that they like it but it was not for me.  Will stick to the &amp;#34;Hot Pink&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is extremely thick and impossible to blend into the skin.  It is also a very unattractive grayish shade.  I assume the texture issue is because it&#x27;s such a high SPF, but its so thick and oddly colored that its impossible to use.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have their pink bottle version of this BB cream and while I adore the pink bottle cream consistency, when  I saw is one, I bought it because I thought - the more SPF the better for my pale skin. However, if the pink bottle has the more rosey cream, this one has a plaster whitish one that does not look too good, does not blend in as well, and makes your face look greasy. I hope I got the real deal not a fake one, but the difference in quality of two seemingly only slightly different products from the same line is astounding.</li>
            <li> Didnt like its ..lighter than my skin although i heard lots about its effect i was disappointed when applying it</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I like how it glides into your skin and make you seem flawless. It gives light to medium coverage with just a small amount of application.  The reason it is receiving 4 starts is because of its light tint. I believe it will not be appropriate for everyone, good only for women with light medium skin tones or even ivory. You can blend it with a favorite tinted moisturizer to get the desired hue. Overall, it is a fantastic product with a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer/ sunscreen/ make-up I have ever used!*$&amp;@%# Let me give you a background on my skin; I have dry skin during the winter and oil skin during the summer. I occasionally break out and most products irritate my sensitive skin. I have always used Bare Minerals but, I find the product to be quite drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend using blush or bronzer over this as it can wash you out a little&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This products has Vitamin F, E, C and A&lt;br /&gt;SPF 50! With UVA and UVB protection -  Most sunscreens leave you feeling oily. This absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;Whitens dark spots&lt;br /&gt;Chamomile to sooth any irritation and calm redness&lt;br /&gt;Has a matte finish and is very light weight&lt;br /&gt;Medium to full coverage&lt;br /&gt;This is FAR better than the Hot Pink version, No grey under tones&lt;br /&gt;Shrinks pores and helps with wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Very light in color - if you even have a hint of a tan you&#x27;ll look washed out&lt;br /&gt;As with all SPF products this does not look well in photos - SPF makes light reflect back&lt;br /&gt;The bottle does not allow you to see when you are running out.&lt;br /&gt;No way to lock this shut when traveling&lt;br /&gt;There is not ingredient list (all in Korean)</li>
            <li> Since their is some pigment in this vital cream, it matched my skin well.  Just so you know though a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product is for those woman with pale and light skin. The thing is that my skin is not even tan and this bb cream is way too light for me.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, mainly because the product is way too dry even with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This miracle working cream is the very best I have ever used. It covers and works way better than foundation makeup. All you need is a very little on face; blend it well around the hair lines nose and make sure you get the neck and ears area. It have me glowing so beautifully. I look so very well rested and radiant with it on my face. I actually look like I can be a celebrity. I&#x27;m very happy and I thank God that the creator of this amazing product was born with the wisdom to make it. I highly and strongly recommend this product to every man and woman. You will not ever regret it. It also leave a Matti look meaning shine free. It&#x27;s look so very super natural on my skin. It&#x27;s totally unbelievable. Shipping was so extra fast and I pray that millions of people buy this product it is very well worth it. So purchase it and  be Blessed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other skin 72 BB Creams and loved them (pink &amp; gold) and decided to give the orange a try since it seemed like it would be a good fit for my skin. I should have just stuck to the hot pink because the orange was a big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency and coverage is much heavier than other BB creams so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The product sets VERY quickly so you have to blend very fast and it is hard to get it blended evenly.&lt;br /&gt;The product is so heavy and doesn&#x27;t let your skin breathe. I don&#x27;t usually have blemishes but since using this, I&#x27;ve been breaking out much more and have noticed my skin getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try so now I know but I will stick to the hot pink. I just wish I could return it....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely white !!</li>
            <li> The coverage is good, not too greasy, but a little too light for my skin tone. I have tried the orange, pink, and gold blends and I I liked the coverage of the orange best but all of skin79 are too light. I wish they had some more tint variations.</li>
            <li> This gave me good coverage and stays put. I really Love this product! A tiny bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The coverage is not good</li>
            <li> I expected this to have a shimmer to it, but it is very matte.  It has very good coverage though, if that is what you are looking for.  The color is pretty light, I am Irish and fair skinned and it is too light for me.</li>
            <li> Hey everyone. I haven&#x27;t had my bb cream long enough to review it but I am very pleased with my service from amazon! First off, this was an impulse buy. I really wanted to try out a bb cream and went to Amazon to order some. I&#x27;m very cheap and blindly picked the cheapest price I could find, which was from the seller package_go_fast. After reading more and more about the bb cream after I ordered it, I felt instant remorse over my purchase because it was very likely that my product which had already shipped was a fake. I tried to cancel my order but it was too late. I felt like I wasted about 15 dollars on a fake bb cream just to save a few dollars. Three days later I received my bb cream in the mail, waaay earlier than the estimated shipping date which is in about a month. I opened up the package and started examining it immediately. I searched for every sign of a copy product. No signs! I also received two samples of other Korean cosmetic items. I will not make the mistake of ordering from a seller without any reviews again. Please check the reviews and look out for signs of fakes! I only got lucky. Thank you package_go_fast for not ripping me off.</li>
            <li> I first tried pink package BB cream from the same brand and liked it, but though that this will give me more matte coverage according to some other reviews. Unfortunately, this cream color is literary white and it will stay like that even on my fair skin. Because of this I was not able to blend it any way (tried hands, sponges, brushes) with my skin to make it look natural. It is very matte and it will accentuate even the smallest dry spot on the face which I found somewhat extreme for a BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it because of the color, but some people may have more luck. I may go back to the pink version.</li>
            <li> Best make up I have ever used and I&#x27;ve tried them all! It is the only makeup with SPF that does not make me break out, and has superior coverage..also low price. It will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> too light for me but great spf 50 and nice coverage overall. i use this with bronzer to add color.</li>
            <li> It fell apart after one week .. I was shaking the can and the inside flew out and broke apart ..</li>
            <li> I have the pink cream, and it was great. When the package first arrived, it was opened already, the box falling apart. Questioning I went and got my other bbcream box (I kept it) and saw that they were completely different. This bbcream was also missing the official tag that came on my other bbcream, stating that it was made in korea. Over all I will never use this product and it smells very strongly of sunscreen. It also has a yellow color and overall I will end up not using this product.</li>
            <li> MakeupAlley has tons of more detailed reviews on this BB cream, but here are the bare bones of it in my experience -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Much, much lighter than the hot pink and gold Skin79 BB creams.&lt;br /&gt;- Yellow undertone.&lt;br /&gt;- Slight shimmers to it (but prob. only noticeable up close).&lt;br /&gt;- Higher coverage.&lt;br /&gt;- This highlighted every fine line on my face and settled on the sides of my nostrils like nobody&#x27;s business, looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;- Much less moisturising than hot pink/gold version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the basics. I do like the cream because it&#x27;s warm toned, and the other 2 BB creams I mentioned give me a pinky-gray cast that I can more or less fix with a tiny pump of this. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing since I want to try other BB creams, and hopefully find a better match for my olive skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this BB cream.  I tried a small sample before committing to the big bottle, but it wasn&#x27;t enough apparently to realize that this cream is too heavy for my combination skin.  It sat heavy on my face all day and was hell to scrub off at night.  It also suffers from a strange grey-ish tint that stood out on my skin no matter how much I blended.  Not a fan, but could be right for someone with drier or normal skin and less pink skin tones.</li>
            <li> never got the entire package. I ordered 5 but got 3 in return. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this BB cream.  It offers a decent amount of coverage and does a better job at hiding the dark circles under my eyes than most foundation I&#x27;ve tried. It blends to my skin tone very well (though I am naturally very pale...)  Plus, I LOVE that it&#x27;s SPF 50!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the seller was great.  My order got sent out within 24 hours and I got the package within a week.</li>
            <li> I recieved my bb cream faster than expected. I have used the skin 79 oriental which is a little darker and more moisturizing than this cream. This one will be great for summer since it is a more matte finish. I also recieved 3 samples which was great!! Will buy from SeoulGlamour!UPDATE- After a few weeks I noticed the BB and skin79 letters have rubbed off also I compared the sticker to my other skin 79 cream that I recieved from skin79 website and it looks tampered-I could see a little of the letters void on the sticker. This is what usually happens when you remove the sticker. The rest of the bottle looks like the real thing-I think I will be ordering from skin79 website from now on. I have ordered the gold skin79 cream and the letters rubbed off after a few weeks on the bottle everything else on the bottle looks real. i did order the triple functions vital cream from the SKIN79 north america website and I have to wait for more stock to come in before it ships. When I recieve it I will compare the cream with the one i bought here. I really think these creams on here have been tampered with and are fake. Ijust recieved my cream from skin79 website and the bottle looksa exactly the same as the one I recieved from here. The only thing different was that the letters do not rub off and the scent of the cream was slightly different.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on March 28th and received the product on April 9th (could&#x27;ve been April 7th it arrived, but it came to my job and the office is closed on Saturday).  This is my second time ordering from Seoulglamour and have gotten the product quickly.  I had ordered this and one other skin79 bb cream, they both past the authenticity test, I researched everything about what a real and fake looks like and these have everything the actual/original product has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this bb cream, it is a very light color - as most people will tell you.  Which is great since I am NC15.  But I have a pink undertone to my skin and this initially has a yellow undertone to it.  But once I put it on and it set in - it matched my skin perfectly.  This bb cream gives a radiant effect and looks very natural on the skin.  It just looks like you naturally have good skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got several free samples, which is great.  Always appreciated ^ ^</li>
            <li> I am writing this review for my mom since she is not too great with computers, but she still wanted to give a review. I am a user of the Hot Pink and VIP Gold BB Cream, I had acne and was looking for a product that would cut my morning routine in half and help heal my scars and prevent new blemishes from appearing. My skin is super sensitive and will get irritated over anything, when my mother saw how great my skin looked, she wanted to try a BB cream as well. With some research we decided to buy the Orange Vital Cream since it had an SPF of 40 and was a bit lighter than the other BB&#x27;s. My mother is 48, caucasian, very fair, and has rosacea. She has an oily T-Zone and some enlarged pores that causes her makeup to slide off during the day and it would look horrible. She is super happy with the bb cream, she no longer needs to use primer, concealer and pounds of foundation to hide her redness. Her skin looks softer and more even and the high SPF prevents the rosacea from getting worse. I had to order her a second tube because she is so paranoid of it selling out. Skin79 products have drastically cut our getting ready time in half, perhaps more, and helped us treat our very different skin issues with similar products.</li>
            <li> I like moist supple looking skin.  This does the trick.  Although, the shade if a little too light for my skin so I  use it with a darker shade of make up. IT has excellent coverage  to hide those pesky brown spots.. just blend it well.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but this product dried me out and I&#x27;m pale and this also made me look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 with yellow/neutral undertones and light skin (in MAC around nc15-20, although their colors look peachy on me), and I have combination skin. I can almost never find my color in foundations because they always look too peachy or pink and it drives me insane, ESPECIALLY when I go outside and my face looks completely a different color from the rest of me, even though in-store it looks great. Also, I hate how fake foundation looks in daylight and right away you can tell you have makeup on. Not with this though. This bb cream matches my skin the best out of anything I&#x27;ve ever tried (which is a lot)and I couldn&#x27;t believe how natural it looked in daylight. It also dries semi-matte which is great because it just glows instead of looking oily. Before this only bare minerals matched my skin,I mixed the light and golden fair together, but I don&#x27;t like how bare minerals doesn&#x27;t cover well and amplifies any dry spots or acne spots. Sooooo with this bb cream I&#x27;ve done some trial and error to get the best results and this is what works for me: After washing my face, I use witch hazel as toner then apply oil-free moisturizer and wait for it to dry. Then I use a primer with dimethicone, even though this bb cream has one in it, I always find that it&#x27;s better to use primer for oil-control and making makeup last longer, plus the makeup goes on smoother. After the primer dries a little I use my fingers to put on the bb cream. I&#x27;ve tried using a foundation brush but find that it just makes it look cakey with this bb cream. After I spread the bb cream all over evenly, I then dab some more in those spots that need a little more coverage. I love how it even it looks even after dabbing more in some areas because with foundation you can always tell where you added more. For my undereye circles and any spots that still show through I blend a little bit of concealer. When I first put this on I look scary pale and ghost-like but after a few minutes it seems to adjust great to my skin. Inthose few minutes while it&#x27;s adjusting, I usually just do my eye makeup. I always like to do some contouring with any foundation because it just gives you more dimension to your face and brings out areas that make your face look much nicer. Sometimes, I&#x27;ll just use a blush on my cheeks but I always put something to make my face look more lively. This product can be very white looking so especially for those cases you want to do some kind of contouring so you don&#x27;t look dead. Lastly, I always set with a sheer powder because that it what really makes the makeup just stay put but I use very little because too much will make the makeup look cakey. Right now I&#x27;m really liking e.l.f HD powder. And that&#x27;s it! So, hopefully that gives some hope to people that may have trouble with it being too white or staying on. It does fade after about 6 hours for me, but still looks very natural and not at all blotchy like foundations when they fade. The only way to see if you will like it is to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I use the product under my foundation, and it covers all my flaws and levels out my face for the foundation to sit on.</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t match with my skin tone, it makes for a high quality present. I was thankful for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The lotion is extremely white; therefore, it makes you look greenish, paleish and I have a pretty fair complexion. Not very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this version of bb cream because it had a higher SPF. Although it went on smoothly, it left my face looking chalky. After a couple hours it felt heavy on my skin. It didn&#x27;t blend very well with my natural skin tone. Maybe it&#x27;s due to the higher SPF content? However the sample I received of the pink label bb cream went perfectly on my skin and wasn&#x27;t too thick. Overall, I think my next purchase will be the pink label bb cream.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin. It seems light at first but quiclkly absorbs into my skin.  It hides red areas easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the American version of BB Creams and they are basically tinted moisturizers!!  Now that the BB Cream trend is so hot, some of the American makers have stepped it up with SPF protection, but it is very expensive.  I own several drug store versions and dept store versions.  You simply cannot get this type of SPF protection for the price!  I use it as a primer under my makeup to even out my skin tone and to provide SPF 50 protection!  It really has negated any need for concealer as it works as a primer/concealer.  I am very oily and this has worked very well with my skin.  It does not stop me from getting oily, but I don&#x27;t get oily as quickly as the other BB Creams!  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The other Skin79 BB creams are better than this one. This one just felt like tinted moisturizer. It was moisturizing for sure but it&#x27;s much thinner and the coverage is much lighter. Recommended for people without acne, but I have some and this definitely didn&#x27;t cover it at all. Meh.</li>
            <li> If your skin has never seen a ray of sun in your life then this may be for you. Its so white. Consider yourself warned.</li>
            <li> it is almost white! i dont think it will match white skin either (it has yellow tone). I have tanned east asian skin (i am Korean but i am little darker than most Koreans) tone and this was waaaaay too white and opaque. i put powder foundation on it and i looked like a clown or call it geisha. if i say this it is extreme because i wear pretty heavy makeup to cover up acne scars and dark spots.  i may try hot pink as others rave about it. i wont touch this again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken. The central part was seperated from the orange plastic cover! And I guess maybe it&#x27;s fake. Because there is no Anti-fake label on this bottle. But the other two of snail and hot pink with a Anti-fake label on each of bottle.</li>
            <li> the vendor raphasoul is not nice. his product did not have a seal and he did not authorize the return. while i did not try the product i am not sure of the authenticity. i am sure to buy a product i tried and liked before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2 bb creams. 1 is the Skin79 VIP gold collection bb cream and this one does have slightly more coverage, but it&#x27;s still medium like the VIP. However, this made my pores look really visible and it looked like I have a lot of white spots on my nose!!! That is the only reason why I am giving it 2 out of 5 stars. Aside from the that, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 50 and with 1 layer, it did feel super soft and smooth to the touch after maybe 10minutes. I know it was at least 5 minutes. If you use more than 1 layer of this, you will need a finishing/setting powder, which Skin79 does sell. This is definitely for people who have extremely oily skin. I have combination skin, which the t-zone is oily and the rest can be dry. This made my face everywhere else other than the t-zone SUPER dry that it looked cakey. And my t-zone was the oily opposite. So this is just not for me. Which really sucks, because I did like the high SPF and I thought I might use this for the summer. This does have a more pinkish color, which I would have preferred. Another thing, this smells really great. If you like citrusy scents, this will be great. It smells like oranges, clean and crisp. It&#x27;s not overwhelming either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I&#x27;m sticking to the VIP gold.</li>
            <li> You have to use enough moisturizer to make this spread evenly.  I use a Beauty Blender and I enjoy the coverage and it blends in well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Feels lightweight (even on hot, humid days)&lt;br /&gt;good medium coverage&lt;br /&gt;evens out skin appearance&lt;br /&gt;SPF sun protection&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me (I have slightly oily skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very light - it works for me because I am very fair, but it may be too light in the summer when I am getting more sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product overall!</li>
            <li> I received a genuine sample of this product, so I am positive it&#x27;s not counterfeit. (It&#x27;s so hard to know when you get fake Skin79 and other products unless they come directly from the source!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try this, because the Skin79 hot orange and hot pink bottles are very popular with a lot of folks. I will say, that my super&#x3D;pale skin looked just fine with this color match. You don&#x27;t get to pick your color with this product, it is what it is. I&#x27;m pasty white so if this color matches me, you won&#x27;t want to try it if you are darker. It did have a bit of white reflectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled great, will give it props for that. But I have mostly-dry skin, with a few oily places. This Skin79 product made it feel like I had a mask on my face, that was tight and webby-looking. It even felt like my skin was constricting when I tried to smile. In the mirror I could see that this made a network of webby looking lines on my face, it actually AGED me. This was just the product and not actually making me wrinkle, but anyone who looked at my skin would think that I have the skin of someone twice my age. Oh hell no. Plus my skin was tight and dry after I washed this stuff off, so it&#x27;s definitely not for anyone but perhaps oily-skinned younger ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend this to anyone over 30 unless they had super greasy skin and needed to control it. Still, the fact that it seems to form a dry mask on the skin would probably preclude me ever recommending it to anyone, ever.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and this was okay in controlling it. My main problem is that it&#x27;s so white and my skin is tannish so it looked a little awkward having a chalk white face. i have returned to my maybelline foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recently new to makeup and heard about BB creams recently as well. I kept hearing good things about this and decided I&#x27;d finally try it out, thinking I could replace my foundation with it. (I&#x27;ve been using Sonia Kashuk&#x27;s foundation in Bisque and I think that makes me an NC20. I rarely wore it, it just felt unneeded.) So I tried this stuff and I am in LOVE. There&#x27;s something magical about this BB cream. It&#x27;s... I don&#x27;t know... beautifying. I didn&#x27;t really understand what \\&quot;evens out skin tone\\&quot; meant until I put this stuff on. And it doesn&#x27;t really look like I&#x27;m wearing anything. I thought my foundation was a pretty good match, but no. This stuff matches even better and I think the coverage might be better. Not to mention SPF 50, the final push that got me to buy this, what with summer hitting hard and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;d call the finish a little on the matte side. It feels good to have on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s -there- like my foundation feels to me. It also seems to have a nicer, more even coverage. I very rarely have pimples and I&#x27;d say my skin is \\&quot;normal\\&quot; as far as oily/dry goes. I&#x27;ve been moisturizing with jojoba oil the night before or a few hours before putting this on and there&#x27;s no issues there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said before, I&#x27;m new to makeup, and I don&#x27;t really wear it that often, but this stuff makes me want to prettyup EVERYDAY. And I rarely even leave the house. SO I think that says a lot. I wish I was an expert in this so I could give a more educated review, but there ya go :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as an alternative to the American BB creams (which are pretty much just tinted goo). She loves it!  It&#x27;s moisturizing, completely covering, and blends into her skin perfectly (she is very light).  She noticed the skin whitening and brightening after only a few uses.  I would totally buy this again! If only it came in a darker shade...</li>
            <li> I had tried samples of the pink and gold bb creams by skin79, but never really felt the desire to purchase them in full size. While they were nice, they didn&#x27;t offer much coverage and fell behind my tinted moisturizers. When I saw the new orange bb cream released, I looked up reviews on korean websites and they seemed really positive.  I have only used this bb cream for two days, but i can say its climbed to the top of my list! It offers better coverage than the pink and gold, is thinner in consistency so it spreads nicely. While it is a light color than the other two, it adjusts pretty well to my NC 25 skintone. I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use this when I&#x27;m tanner in the summer (NC30). I think it is very close overall to Lioele Triple Function bb cream.  If you&#x27;re into asian bb creams, I would definitely give this one a try! A lot of things about it are close to traditional foundations (texture, consistency, etc) which I like. :)</li>
            <li> Its a very nice product, it made the dry areas of my face soft and smooth. It covers well. The only problem is i have combo oily dry skin. I was an oil slick after a few hours. I gave it to my mom (54)  who has dry skin with large pores and some minor sun damage. It makes her skin look 20 years younger. FYI for anyone who uses BB creams...you do need to make sure you wash your face well after a day of wear. They are made to cover, they will stick around if you dont wash well. A facewash with an enzyme or grit to it will help. All in all it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have the pink, wanted the gold, but bought the orange bottled BB because it had a high SPF and had good reviews. However, it&#x27;s very very light(and I actually have a very fair skin colour) with a strong yellow tinge. The consistency in comparison to the others, out of the bottle it came out thin but applied very thick. On my skin it would rub off on clothes and made my face look very dry, flaky, and pale.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller though so i&#x27;ll probably buy the gold from them to use instead.</li>
            <li> I think the skin79 pink label bb cream is the most moisturizing. The gold one lasts a bit longer but is a bit more drying. I found that this orange bb cream is the dryest among all 3 of them. However, in my opinion it gave better coverage and lasted quite long too, but there was this slightly tight feeling which I found uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is alot lighter than the others and it has a more yellowish tint instead of the usual grayish tint.&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I recommend this for oily type skin people, not so much for really dry skin types.</li>
            <li> I received this from my daughter for Christmas and just reordered.  I love this product.  Makes your skin look great</li>
            <li> This is the best BB Cream I have tried.  I have tried the Missha and Lioele ones and this is the best for my skin.  I have very Oily Skin and this helps control it for at least 6 hours without touching up.  It also makes my skin feel soft and smooth and feels very lite on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly pale and live in California, so I&#x27;d argue this one works best for those with normal Asian skin tones, that is to say, those of us without the coveted porcelain white skin. Ain&#x27;t nothing wrong with a little color, Asian ladies! Don&#x27;t let kdrama and variety shows tell you otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously ordered the Skin79 BB cream miniature sampler set to see which one would work best, and while I agree with reviewers that once properly blended even the whitest ones are more or less okay, for me to have a glowing complexion vs an ashier one, I need a little more yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one provides more protection than some of the other lines, in terms of UV protection (very useful if you live in California) and went on smooth, even when I accidentally applied too much. Usually if I cake on foundation-like products too thick, dry problem areas on my face, like between my brow eyes and brow line, tend to look dried out. Wasn&#x27;t an issue with this one. I also felt like it provided a little more cover up for sunspots and freckles than the paler shades by Skin79.</li>
            <li> I read  all the reviews of all the BB creams her at Amazon and decided to buy this one after reading it matched the skin of a pale woman. Wish the description would describe the shade, show the shade or even offer different shades. Anyway, I tried it as soon as it arrived on my dry face. I wasn&#x27;t happy as it seemed settled into my pores and creases making them appear even worse. Next time I used it, I used a face primer first and Viola! It worked beautifully. It takes very little BB cream to cover my face. Is pat a little more under my eyes and over red/discolored areas. I have Roseacea and this evens out my skin tone. I had one pimple that this covered beautifully with a couple layers/dabs on top of it. I can use this as my foundation now. I love that it also has SPF as I am so fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Bottom line, I won&#x27;t need all different powders or liquid foundation anymore! Oh, and in extreme heat, I cannot tell it is on my skin. A must have item from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Also very nice the Seller included MORE samples than they had in their description.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product. For one thing, when I ordered I was notified that the expected shipping date 4 - 6 weeks which seems like way too long to wait. However, I received the product from seoulglamour in less than 2 weeks. Score! Also, I had ordered the Skin79 Super Pink BB Cream before with SPF 25 and just figured the difference in the orange bottle would be higher SPF but no! It also provides better coverage. My suggestion is to use a stippling brush and buff the bb cream into your skin. You will NOT need any other coverage even with acne scars and dark eye circles...trust me! Your skin will look airbrushed.</li>
            <li> The hardest part about finding a BB Cream is finding one that matches your skin tone. This one has more of a yellow tone that works well with my neutral very pale skin. Even when I slip up and get a little too much sun, it looks good because it helps minimize the pink. For reference, I have reddish blonde hair and blue/green eyes. My skin is sensitive and burns easily, and does not tan. I use this as my moisturizer/sunscreen/foundation in the morning. I top it with Bare Essentials Mineral Veil with SPF, and my skin is protected. I have found that applying it with my fingers can cause it to look streaky, so I dab it on with a makeup sponge to get nice coverage. I also pat a little bit extra over pimples, and it covers them well. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Also, SeoulGlamour shipped it within two weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a very pink pale person. I love BB cream but most are too yellow or too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this one blend well into my skin, it offers medium/heavy coverage. It moisturizes well, but doesnt make my oily skin look like an oil slick. It has helped even out my skin tone and protect me from the sun all summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the scent was pleasant, not too scented but didnt smell like makeup either.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love this and really did love the way my skin looked the first day I tried it. However the next day I woke up to a pimple, I brushed it off and just applied my usual zit cream. After a week of using this, my face was very broken out with cystic acne. I have never once had cystic zits on my face before and they were very painful. If you have sensitive skin and are acne prone like me then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However if you have normal skin and aren&#x27;t acne prone this is perfect for you! :) It&#x27;s light weight, has great coverage, completely concealed my dark under eye circles, and even made me look as if I had a full night&#x27;s sleep after studying all night for my midterm. And the seller was very nice and the shipping was very fast :)&lt;br /&gt;Again, I really wanted to love this however it broke me out bad :(</li>
            <li> A little too thick for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since i was ten years old. I&#x27;ve always had to use foundation, then concealer, then more foundation on top of that and you can still see the acne through it all after a couple of hours. But now that I&#x27;ve been using this for just a week, it&#x27;s too the point where that&#x27;s all the makeup i have to wear. While it does require a couple touch ups every six hours or so, it&#x27;s completely worth it. It blends well and goes on easily, and I have already noticed an amazing difference in my skin. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is different from the other 2 bb creams I have ordered from Skin 79!  It is thicker and more yellow based, you have to blend this in!  It is too light for my nw 35 complexion, but I mix a little bit of True Match n6 and it comes out okay!  You have to really take the time to blend this in, but it is worth it!  It is okay on my oily/combinations skin, it feels very light textured!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright but I never liked thick foundations or creams especially with problem skin but if you need to cover up thick it works, goes on pretty light but use a powder to even it out and its good, only use this when I get chemical peels done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick like a foundation almost. The color was perfect for me. This is the first BB cream I tried and I&#x27;m disappointed to see that other creams are different colors like gray-ish. This one is perfect. I think I might be sticking with this one forever. Please don&#x27;t ever change it. :)</li>
            <li> After having tried the hot pink and silver Skin79 BB creams, I like this one the best.  Excellent coverage and color.  Skin79 BB creams are far superior to what passes for BB creams from Maybelline and L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several American and Korean BB Creams out there and this is by far my favorite one. I&#x27;ve tried Missha, the pink Skin79, Bobbi Brown, Smashbox, Dr. Jart Blk Label, and Boscia. Most of them would make me break out on my chin. The orange Skin79 is the only BB cream that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out and when I remove it at night my skin actually looks better - my old acne scars look lighter and my overall complexion appears more even. It gets one star off because the color is on the pale side. I&#x27;m a pale asian girl to begin with and when I get color matched at department stores they always match me to the lightest or second lightest shade. I prefer a little more color though so I add some tinted moisturizer or just dust bronzer on top. Since the SPF is so high - 50 - you look like a ghost in pictures. I try to keep that in mind when I know I&#x27;ll be photographed that day and use a different product. I usually use a face lotion before applying this BB cream and I&#x27;ve noticed that it will make current acne dry up so you may have dry patches at the end of the day on your pimples. It&#x27;s good because it&#x27;s drying it out but bad because it draws attention to them.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the worst BB Creams I&#x27;ve ever used. This product is very thick (probably because of the high spf) and feels greasy and cakey even when only applying a tiny bit. I bought this for summer and it made my face feel like it was melting. It&#x27;s much more full coverage than other BB Creams I&#x27;ve used and the color is a very pale yellow that didn&#x27;t work for me. A bad product from an overall good brand.</li>
            <li> Great! This is authentic Skin 79 and it works great. Just enough coverage for me and protects my skin with ample SPF.</li>
            <li> My skin looks flawless I get compliments on my skin alot while working retail this is an awesome product. Better than the pink one for me or the gold. Its light I&#x27;m a NC 30 but I use small amounts like 1/4 a pump it oxidizes enough I buff it in real Good..only use a little and it will streak that goes away after oxidation but it looks great because it brightens me around my eyes but blends into the rest of my face perfectly. I have extremely oily skin and when its hot it can become greasy or shiny keep a setting powder with you. Otherwise a great everyday healthy makeup/sunscreen. I don&#x27;t recommend it for weddings or a night out in town because of the SPF which is not camera friendly but I still did I still came out great so its up to you. But I&#x27;m telling you I get compliments on my skin being flawless and glowing alot!!! One customer when told it was makeup even said you have to be born with skin like that its not just makeup clearly she&#x27;s never used some of the new stuff out there lol.</li>
            <li> This is ok.  I like the gold one better.  The pink one is not too bad (it&#x27;s a close second to the gold).  I have now tried elisha coy, hanskin control bb cream, gold, pink and orange, liz k color veil.  The pink one is what I have now, but once it&#x27;s done, I&#x27;m going back to gold.</li>
            <li> The reason why I say this is because this is the BB cream that actually does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, which is coverage, sunscreen, moisturizer, skin health, and whitening all at the same time. This is the BB cream you would want for summer, especially if you happen to live in a humid climate. I happen to live in hot and humid climate for the summer, and this BB cream not only makes me not having to worry about UVA rays because of its intense protection (which works!), it also makes sure that I don&#x27;t get a tan from being outside in the sun because of the simultaneous whitening, AND, I completely disagree with people who say that it&#x27;s too \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; or that it&#x27;s too white (I actually found the Mizon Snail Cream to make your face look much whiter and chalkier, and I have pretty pale skin!). Honestly, the matte texture and heavy sunscreen shine actually PREVENT your face from looking too chalky because they make you look like you are wearing sunscreen with just a little bit of coloring, which actually makes your face look much more natural than many other foundations/BB creams that have more fuller color (even those that have darker color). I LOVE LOVE the fact that my face does not chalk up from the heat and humidity like with other BB creams, and at the end of the day when I wash it off it leaves my face healthy white and elastic. This BB cream does not break me out either (even in the heavy humidity!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single one complaint I have (and it&#x27;s not just for this BB cream but others in the Skin79 series), is that I really dislike the packaging. The pump and hard plastic tube design prevent the user from retrieving the last bit of BB cream after you&#x27;ve used up most of it because there is no way you can squeeze out the content. And we all know that pump would only work to a certain volume. I think this is a deceptive marketing strategy to make us buy more and buy sooner, but it&#x27;s a terrible waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, there is definitely no point in buying this BB cream if you are not in it for the sunscreen. This is a MUST HAVE for summers and intense sunny days. This cream would obviously not be ideal for evenings/nights and cloudy/no sun days. But it&#x27;s a valuable collection. I&#x27;m so (surprisingly) happy with it that I just bought another one :)</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream other than the color... my skin tone is mac nc 30 ish but this bb cream look a little too light for my skin.. Other than that I love the formula, it doesn&#x27;t make me oily at all. Most importantly it didnt break me out! I have super sensitive skin but this bb cream didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at alll  :o)</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Very very light. I am very pale, Caucasian and it is still too light for me.</li>
            <li> For one, this is definitely the real thing, genuine Skin79 BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is different from any BB or CC cream or foundation I&#x27;ve tried in a wonderful way.  Liquid foundations don&#x27;t seem to come in the right tone for my skin and feel too heavy, and powder foundations don&#x27;t have staying power and won&#x27;t blend with my concealers well.  The creams I&#x27;ve used have felt oily, don&#x27;t have staying power, and don&#x27;t have much coverage at all.  I live in a very hot and humid state and often work outdoors, so they just didn&#x27;t work for me.  However, this BB cream has great coverage with just a small amount of the product.  You still may need to use a little concealer on bigger spots (undereyes, flared pimples, etc), but it completely evens out the redness in my cheeks and makes the pores on my cheeks and nose vanish.  It also makes my face look much brighter and more awake.  It does have a very subtle scent when you put it on, but it&#x27;s not a heavy fragrance, more like a pleasant &amp;#34;fresh clothes out of the dryer&amp;#34; scent and it fades quickly.  Some people have claimed this dries them out, but I haven&#x27;t had that issue.  It dries quickly to a smooth matte finish, feels like instant photoshop for my face with no primer or effort required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes sure your skintone has more of a warm yellow/golden undertone than a pink undertone.  There are a couple quick quizzes and comparisons you can take online with a quick google search if you&#x27;re unsure.  This orange label is better for those golden tones.  Skin79 makes a pink label that might work better for you if you&#x27;re in the pinkish undertone category.  Think Anna and Elsa from Frozen; Elsa is more of a pink/cool undertone, and Anna is more yellow/warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely feel comfortable leaving the house wearing nothing else on my face but this and a little mascara.  I&#x27;m ready to toss out all my half-used bottles of the old stuff because I&#x27;m never going back!  This all combined with the price makes this the best money I have every spent on my face!e best money I have every spent on my face!</li>
            <li> It is light weight and goes on easily and smoothly with medium coverage for blemish.  I would recommend this for all skin type with porcelain and light color skin.</li>
            <li> I seldom ever review on Amazon mainly because it has usually been satisfactory experience and I agree with what other users states in their review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this particular case I felt I have to in order to make sure future customer is aware of the chance of receiving an expired or non-authentic item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought one from Letif Beauty due to high seller profile review and also last time I bought one it was authentic. Unfortunately this time when I wanted to try the Triple Function BB cream from SKIN 79 that was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authentication on these product has been a much debated issue on beauty forums. Recently there has been updates from blogs and forum that SKIN 79 has stopped using manufacturing date as of 2013 and all products manufactured on 2013 will have expiration date instead, I am unable to link external links so if you are interested in the link feel free to reply to the comment or PM me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on the official SKIN 79 website they state in fine print that expiry date will not be honored from other seller which points that they are indeed using expiration date instead of manufacturing date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received had the date mark at the bottom of the bottle 20130311. Which makes me to believe this is either not authentic or expired. So I returned the item and left seller feedback to advise seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller respond that this is the manufacturing date, which makes me to suspect this is not authentic. (I am not sure which one is worse expired or fake).  The review is to inform potential customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the product itself, I cannot review as now I am  more careful of where I buy SKIN 79 and will have to buy from more reliable resource.</li>
            <li> I found this makeup by accident about a year ago and it&#x27;s all I use now! It has a natural coverage and feels really light on my skin. I should buy 2 at a time because I want to give a bottle to my friends to try it!</li>
            <li> It may be great for your skin but the white color was awful. It made me look dead. I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> I ordered the gold and got samples of the hot pink and orange. I tried the orange for the first time today and it is much lighter in color than the pink and gold. I&#x27;m a medium pale caucasian (probably around NC25). I found this BB cream to be way too light for my skin tone. It went on super light and then even after oxidation was still to light. The hot pink and gold are more suited to my skin tone. The consistency is creamier and thinner than the hot pink and gold as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I looks dewy and naturally flawless wearing it. It&#x27;s very yellow and light when it comes out, but after it oxidizes and blends in it matches my skin perfectly. I wear loreal true match powder to set it (soft Ivory n1). I have the hot pink too- that one is darker than this one but it works for me too. I prefer the color of Orange one though. I ordered from Seoul Glamour and both of my bottles seem to be legit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago and have been very pleased with it. I have been searching for a BB cream and decided on this because of all the positive reviews. I am sometimes skeptical when reading reviews due to I think people are more likely to write one when they have a negative experience rather than a positive one, which has inclined me to share my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;  I decided on the orange version because I heard it was slightly more moisturizing (although I can&#x27;t verify because this is the only one I have personally tried) and my face has recently been changing and becoming more dry. I was frustrated with all the work I had to do each morning with primers and moisturizers and serums and finishing powders and on and on and on... I bought this in the hopes that I could cut some steps and use less products and hopefully save time to get out the door faster OR sleep in a little longer ;).&lt;br /&gt;  I received the product fairly quickly after ordering. I opened it up as soon as I could and checked for all the little \\&quot;go-to&#x27;s\\&quot; to verify it was the real deal. Everything was legit and in it&#x27;s place like the foil sticker, no misspellings and no website info. It came with three other samples in the box.&lt;br /&gt;  I waited until the next morning so I could try it on a fresh face. I first tried it on after applying my usual moisturizer and primer because I read others had a better experience that way. I found for my skin I didn&#x27;t need to continue using my primer, just a clean face with my moisturizer, apply my BB cream and I&#x27;m set to go! So much more simpler in the morning (and money saving since I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying all these additional products!) It has a light fresh scent that does fade. It gives a very nice light to medium coverage that leaves a dewy finish. Honestly, I will sometimes use a finishing powder when I want more of a matte finish. When I have a blemish I just dab a little extra with the tip of my finger until it&#x27;s covered (only on a fewoccasions I used my concealer.) I have been using this just about everyday since I got it and I can say I really do think it has helped with the dark marks that I get after the occasional blemish. Some of the marks I get can honestly stay for months but with this I have seen them fade dramatically faster. My skin isn&#x27;t nearly as dry as it used to be. The little dry patches that would become very noticeable after only a few hours after applying make-up are no longer a problem.&lt;br /&gt;  One thing to to be aware of is this is a fair color with yellow undertones. I wear 117 in Make Up Forever and Golden Fair in Bare Minerals so this works great for me. I did try it on my daughter who has a darker skin tone than myself (she has a nice tan/beige complexion) to see if it really were self adjusting and didn&#x27;t get very satisfactory results. It was very obvious where we applied it. I would not recommend this for those who are much beyond the fair side on the complexion spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;  I am so glad I found this BB cream. Now all I have to do in the morning is wash, moisturize, BB cream, sometimes a little powder and I&#x27;m ready to go! Yay for simplicity!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I expected it to be. Its the best foundation I&#x27;ve purchased to match my skin tone which is very light. It is thick and controls oil. It covers but doesn&#x27;t look cakey. Your skin has a pearl type glow to it and it feels nice. I&#x27;ve noticed improved skin quality-lighter sunspots and my &#x27;creases&#x27; are less pronounced. The only problem that I&#x27;ve noticed is if you put it on to heavy it will settle into wrinkles. This one I feel is only for those with a very light completion. If you have to buy the lightest everything for foundation try it..</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because I was looking for a high rated sunscreen BB cream. After reading many reviews for other products, I noticed this particular product name cropping up from time to time, always mentioned as the better in comparison. So I decided to try it. It works great. But it took me a while to adjust to the application amount. Use it sparingly, it covers very well with a tiny bead. And do not use powder with it unless you favor a recently-plastered-wall look. Be aware, the product is lightly scented. I usually have issues with perfumed items, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing on my dad&#x27;s accoutn. The product came 1 day late, but it didn&#x27;t matter to me at all. For the color, it was great on my hand. I used to use the hot pink label and it gave off a pinkish white skin kind of glow. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t my shade. This one is for sure the legit one. The BB cream silver label doesn&#x27;t scrape off. in addtion, when you put it on, it&#x27;s very cool to feel. The smell is also much better than the pink one. It&#x27;s drier, but it may be good. For sure, i&#x27;ll be buying again from Thinkpretty. I also got two samples of skin 79 bb creams. I feel if you lean towards more of the yellowish tinge, then this is much better than the pink. Yes, the pink is more hydrating, but it smeared for me. This one is wonderful. I put a dab on my hand before it started writing this, and now when i look at my hand, it looks great.well matched. Totally recomend!</li>
            <li> Yellow/white undertone&lt;br /&gt;heavy white cast if applied with full coverage, you dnt need a lot of this product per use, its very blendable with light hand and drys with powder finish.</li>
            <li> I got this awhile back. At first, I like it a lot; however, it can make your face dry after awhile. You have to moisturize your face pretty well before you use it. The color is pretty fair for the summer. I look pretty white on pictures when I used this. Overall, cheap price and great coverage.</li>
            <li> Im very fair skinned, and this is the only foundation i found that doesn&#x27;t have an orange tinge to it. This is the only foundation I have been devastated to run out of</li>
            <li> I struggle with oily skin, especially later in the day. I used to have to put on powder a few times day to cover up oily shine but not anymore! I have tried multiple Skin79 BB creams in the past and this one by far is my favorite! Its the thickest and for me provides the best coverage without looking caked on. It dries matte so all you need is a light dusting of powder to set and you&#x27;re ready to go! I have large pours and an uneven coloring on my face. This stuff smooths and blends everything. I am just so excited that I finally found a product that I can use in place of regular foundation. Ive tried numerous other brands too, Garneir, Philosophy, Loreal and others. This one is by far the best and most cost effective.</li>
            <li> A coworker introduced me to BB cream, and I liked it so much, I had to order some myself. I have never seen a product that evens my skin tone so completely! I have had fewer pimples and my skin has stopped drying out. I let a friend with severe eczema try mine, and she turned right around the next day and ordered some, saying it is the first product that does not burn or irritate her skin during flareups, and also evens her skin so she is not blotchy or spotted.</li>
            <li> This is slightly more yellow toned than the Pink BB Cream, but the consistency is better for oilier skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product  , Pale but very good, you can add your own color with a tinted primer</li>
            <li> The SKIN79 orange BB cream is the first that I&#x27;ve tried, after recommendation from my sister in law, who has used quite a few different brands.  Based on my skin tone (extremely fair), she thought this would be the best match for a first timer.  I purchased from PinkGelee (fab seller) and along with the standard size orange, received samples of the pink and gold label to try as well, so I was lucky to have some comparison.  The orange label has excellent coverage, and definitely does not have the \\&quot;grey\\&quot; color issue for me, even upon first application.  It isn&#x27;t &#x27;luminous&#x27; at all for me, though, there isn&#x27;t really a sheen to it like some BB creams have.  The coverage is excellent, I usually dust with some light powder following the application, but have gone without doing so a few times and it still has staying power on its own.  I can go a full work day without touching up and it still looks great for happy hour.  I&#x27;ve also worn this out to a few night clubs and have not come close to dancing off my face, haha :-)  Within a week or so of using the product, I could definitely tell a difference in my skin tone, it definitely seemed a bit brighter.  But here comes the missing star - after using it for a couple of weeks, it has really started to dry out my face, and this BB cream doesn&#x27;t look great on a dry face.  As it&#x27;s winter, I&#x27;m sure that is not helping either, but I&#x27;m considering giving the gold label and try and saving this for the warmer months.  The samples of the gold label were impressive; the pink didn&#x27;t really do much for me, seemed a bit light.</li>
            <li> This BB cream has great coverage but it makes me look too pale. I have to put bronzer over it so I don&#x27;t look like a ghost. I will stick with the BB cream in the Hot Pink bottle. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white and VERY pale with cool undertones. It doesn&#x27;t matter how lightly I try and apply this product so it&#x27;s not cakey, the whitening effect is way too intense. I want the most natural looking finish and it&#x27;s fairly obvious (even at medium distance) that I&#x27;m wearing something. This effect is particularly noticeable when I use it under my eyes alone for dark circle coverage. If I apply it like other BB creams, it looks like I&#x27;m verging into kabuki makeup in pictures. This is not my first BB cream so I know how to apply it properly, and this just doesn&#x27;t work for me. If you have a warmer skin tone, this is probably a fine choice. It does provide more complete coverage than the Skin79 Pink and the SPF is better. And the smell is thankfully not too intense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got good coverage, and I do enjoy it, but it always seems to make me look a little pasty. Not white, but like my makeup is a bit caked on. No matter how little I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good color for me though. (Natural redhead, so very pale)</li>
            <li> I used maybelline bb cream and though I liked it, it left my face dry.  I took a chance on this stuff and I really love it.  However, they sent me a sample of the gold label super 79 bb cream and I liked that better.  I have sinced ordered the gold label and am anxiously awaiting it.  The gold label was more moisturizing.  I will save this for hot months.  If you&#x27;ve never tried bb creams, try this brand first.  My daughter and I tried several at the drug stores, they are just not comparable to this product.  The quantity that you receive will last, as it goes on sparingly and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I tried this along with the BB cream craze. I&#x27;m redheaded, irish, very, very pale. This was actually too light for me.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is great for oily skin! It also has spf, which makes it great for summer! Just a warning though, this is very light. I&#x27;m and NC15 in mac foundations and this was a touch too light on me. However, that problem is easily solved with a little bronzer. I really do love this because the coverage it great. This does cling to dry spots though, so if you have dry flaky skin, I would not recommend it unless you exfoliate well before applying.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews. Sadly, it did not work for me. I used it one time, but had severe breakouts from it.</li>
            <li> This product has very good coverage. It&#x27;s pretty light in color so I use it as a concealer and highlight when I use my darker BB cream. This is much better than American BB creams, it has at least a medium coverage &amp; it stays on all day. The packaging is super cute too!</li>
            <li> My teenage granddaughter loves this stuff.  It appears to work just as good as advertised.  She switched back to a brand available at the cosmetic counter but loved this so much better she asked to go back.  So we just have to make sure we order before we run out next time.  I&#x27;ve used this and even put on half my face and clinque on the other half and I have to say I felt a positive difference for the SKIN79.  It may take a little experiment to figure out your best color in this line but when you do you&#x27;ll be so happy.  She has very pale skin and I use ivory bisque in the clinque line just to give you a clue.  We&#x27;ve also ordered from China directly but this product is just the same without any issues.  Love it!!  Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> It came fast without any problems. I tried it right away. Everything&#x27;s like people say. Very light and very effective. My bf came home and noticed \\&quot;something different\\&quot; about my face immediately. Because my skin looked naturally clean like with no make up. And it does give you this dewy look</li>
            <li> I love the texture and coverage of this cream but it is extremely light.  I am very fair and I own many Asian bb creams.  This is the first bb cream I&#x27;ve had to mix with a darker one because it was too light.  Great cream but only for people with extremely light skin.</li>
            <li> I thought this would make me look younger and cover well, just made me look white, still had to do all my normal makeup routine after so this just added a step</li>
            <li> ANOTHER GREAT BB CREAM PRODUCT. I CHOSE THIS FORMULA BECAUSE OF THE HIGH SUNSCREEN CONTENT.IT MAKES MY SKIN SO MUCH BRIGHTER.I AM A SIXTY YEAR OLD CAUCASIAN,LIVING IN THE SOUTH.WE LOVE FOR OUR SKIN TO LOOK SOFT AND DEWY.I USE A MOISTURIZER,BB CREAM,THEN A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF FOUNDATION.A LITTLE POWDER AND IT LASTS ALL DAY.WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT.SAMPLES OF OTHER BB CREAMS USUALLY ARE INCLUDED ALL OF THEM ARE VERY GOOD!</li>
            <li> love the packaging, great coverage! all around great product, 1st bb cream ive ever used so i cant compare to others</li>
            <li> You have to follow instructions, do not need much.  start with a little in the middle of your face and then spread outward.  Does seem kind of light beige going on it blends to complextion, as least it did for me.  I was really interested because of the super sun protection.  But when I look in the mirrow, I cannot believe how good my skin looks, better than I have ever seen it and it lasts all day.  If I get a little oily by end of day I use the Skin79 powder compact, oil gone, look is perfect.  Best BB cream I have found to date and I have used others.  Shipping was quick, packed well and the product container looks like something that should be much more expensive.</li>
