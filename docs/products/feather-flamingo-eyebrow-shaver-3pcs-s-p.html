            <li>It&#x27;s great to getting rid of unwanted peach fuzz on your face and neck.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for women with peach fuzz on the face that want to remove hair without wax.</li>
            <li>This product is the equivalent of a pocket knife with a razor instead of a blade--a great idea.</li>
            <li>Great for eyebrows and all the fuzzy hair that you get in your cheeks and lip don&#x27;t stimulate hair grothw</li>

            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>It was so easy to use and was perfect for getting rid of any stray hairs without the pain of plucking.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t lose its sharped blade and because it is so good to use!&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>If you want a straighter brow that is not so arched, this is a great product, much better than tweezers.</li>
            <li>And as an added bonus, the colors are absolutely adorable!</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s your first time using this type of shaver, this is the perfect one to try.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Fold nicely and can stash in purse, glove compartment, etc.</li>
            <li>This thing is so handy</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how good it is :)</li>
            <li>Nice for cleaning up around the beard.</li>
            <li>They are a very easy tool to create the popular straight-Korean eyebrow look.</li>
            <li>Used to dermaplane; safe, effective.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many options for eyebrow shavers that can do this.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;an area&amp;#34; , need a better way to take care of strays...</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>So glad I got it instead of a refund.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve used for all over facial hair</li>
            <li>If you are looking for more of a dermaplane result, try the Shiseido FT.</li>
            <li>I will order more.......</li>
            <li>Continue having success with this item and have given many as gifts to friends who wonder how I do it!</li>
            <li>I still have to pluck out some stubborn black hairs, but this device is awesome.</li>
            <li>These little razors are just wonderful and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Amazing, this very well may have changed my life.  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks so smooth.</li>
            <li>Perfect for girls on the go who don&#x27;t have time to waste tweezing pesky micro hairs.</li>
            <li>extremely cheaply made....</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon consistently has it available in their marketplace because I have never seen them for sale in box retail.</li>
            <li>Quick, accurate and</li>
            <li>These razors are easy to use and keep your brows looking fresh.</li>
            <li>They are super accurate.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, but this product is effective.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;ve had no such mishaps so far and am very happy with my result.</li>
            <li>Shape but safe very well.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as waxing or plucking.</li>
            <li>It is very sharp, love the handle and love that you fold it to enclose the blade - makes it more sanitary.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Also great for all you brunettes out there who have that pesky, slightly noticeable upper-lip hair.</li>
            <li>I bought them after watching a video review from my favorite Australian YouTube-er.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using the first razor out of the 3 that it brings....</li>
            <li>I purchased this after watching a Youtube beauty tutorial and instantly fell in love after using it.</li>
            <li>(I mean, it IS a razor), and you&#x27;ll be a happy lady.</li>
            <li>This product is so good not only to wisp away stray facial hair but to use as a razor as well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the feather flamingo eyebrow shaver for a long time and just placed an order for more.</li>
            <li>These work great for getting those little fuzzy patches above and to the side of eye brows.</li>
            <li>I really like how convenient these eyebrow shavers are-</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll always be ready to take care of things.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all!</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do that much for the eyebrows</li>
            <li>, if you don&#x27;t really know how to use them, ask someone to help you.</li>
            <li>It is not too sharp like most facial razors it gives the face a nice look without actually shaving your face.</li>
            <li>I use these eyebrown shavers at home to clean up the back of my husbands neck in between haircuts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Just place it horizontally on top of your brow and move it slowly back and forth (not up and down, or else</li>
            <li>I used to pay around $200 each month by professionals to get a dermaplanning procedure done to remove slight facial hair in a safe way.</li>
            <li>It removes dead skin cells and the fine fuzzy hair on the face</li>
            <li>I really like that the blade flips back</li>
            <li>, the women folk have discovered it for it&#x27;s intended purpose of above eyebrow finish work and they&#x27;re going fast.</li>
            <li>Be very careful when using, you can end up shaving more than expected.</li>
            <li>Do not go up and down or you might accidentally slip and take off your whole brow - yikes!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp, even though they&#x27;re in cheap plastic holders (who cares?)&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re sharp and productive.</li>
            <li>It shaves off your eyebrow hairs without much effort and can be used in other areas.</li>
            <li>I think this makes these shavers a much safer option storing in open drawers or places where other people might be digging around (i.e. children, spouse, burglars).</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re sharp, even though they&#x27;re in cheap plastic holders (who cares?)&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re sharp and productive.</li>
            <li> It shaves off your eyebrow hairs without much effort and can be used in other areas.</li>
            <li> I think this makes these shavers a much safer option storing in open drawers or places where other people might be digging around (i.e. children, spouse, burglars).</li>
            <li> It is not as rough or harsh as the other available ones</li>
            <li> I like that the blade is really long, so they get a larger amount of your skin&#x27;s surface, and ultimately make it an easier process.</li>
            <li> It was sharp enough to get rid of even the smallest hairs and definitely helped for achieving &amp;#34;straighter&amp;#34; brows!</li>
            <li> However, the concept of facial shaving causes hairs to grow back after just a couple days--so shaving is not nearly as efficient as other forms of hair removal.</li>
            <li> Just be careful around your eyebrows - roommate got too close and has been trying to grow one side back for a year now!</li>
            <li> You must practice carefully to get the hang of it and to get the proper angle of the shaver to your face.</li>
            <li> but it works wonders on other facial areas.</li>
            <li> I needed something to trim without giving me major shaving cuts since I don&#x27;t usually need to shave.</li>
            <li> Especially below the nose where you need a little gap.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay sharp very long..</li>
            <li> The product arrived about two weeks after the expected timeframe given, but once it came</li>
            <li> careful though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharper, but dulls faster.</li>
            <li> but you must be careful when you do this.</li>
            <li> but the last batch I purchased are not sharp and are are having to be tossed as they are irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I also like that the blade is retractable, so you could take this wherever you needed, and not have to worry about keeping up with the caps that come on other razors.</li>
            <li> forget to use nivea cream or any other</li>
            <li> The blade is extremely sharp and requires little effort.</li>
            <li> Well, that&#x27;s a half truth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mess with it.</li>
            <li> you have little hairs that pop up out of nowhere, worried about &amp;#34;cleaning up</li>
            <li> This little tool has changed my life.</li>
            <li> Just gotta be careful not to scrape against your skin too hard</li>
            <li> Be careful not to overdo it, use your common sense</li>
            <li> dont waste your money</li>
            <li> That razor gets the dead skin layer too.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the blades can tend to catch some smaller hairs which makes the process a bit painful.</li>
            <li> Still, I use the razors to remove the peach fuzz on my upper lip every few days because it is less painful than waxing/threading and faster than attempting to pluck.</li>
            <li> I have been using one shaver for a couple weeks and it hasn&#x27;t even gotten dull at all.</li>
            <li> You should lay the tool against your eyebrow at the level you want the line to start and use a slow back-and-forth motion.</li>
            <li> Very sad they they have either gone down the cheap-manufacturing-bad-product path, or that they are fake.  </li>
            <li> absolutely horrible don&#x27;t bother if I can get my money back</li>
            <li> Sounds weird, but you don&#x27;t want to lose your eyebrows, unless that&#x27;s what you want</li>
            <li> Terrible product doesn&#x27;t work not worth the money</li>
            <li> I think that was the biggest disappointment of the purchase.</li>
            <li> They are so bad I now have to find an alternative.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in this purchase!</li>
            <li> Horrible product....</li>

            <li> Amazing, this very well may have changed my life.  Used to dermaplane; safe, effective.</li>
            <li> I really like how convenient these eyebrow shavers are- I bought them after watching a video review from my favorite Australian YouTube-er. They are a very easy tool to create the popular straight-Korean eyebrow look. You should lay the tool against your eyebrow at the level you want the line to start and use a slow back-and-forth motion. Do not go up and down or you might accidentally slip and take off your whole brow - yikes!! Luckily, I&#x27;ve had no such mishaps so far and am very happy with my result. I really like that the blade flips back so it is covered! There aren&#x27;t many options for eyebrow shavers that can do this. I think this makes these shavers a much safer option storing in open drawers or places where other people might be digging around (i.e. children, spouse, burglars). The only complaint I have is that the blades can tend to catch some smaller hairs which makes the process a bit painful. But, it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as waxing or plucking. And as an added bonus, the colors are absolutely adorable!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;1. Easier than plucking for sure!&lt;br /&gt;2. Quick, accurate and done!&lt;br /&gt;3. Fold nicely and can stash in purse, glove compartment, etc. for long&lt;br /&gt;commutes and you&#x27;ll always be ready to take care of things.&lt;br /&gt;4. Doesn&#x27;t take up any space in makeup storage at home either.&lt;br /&gt;5. They&#x27;re sharp, even though they&#x27;re in cheap plastic holders (who cares?)&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re sharp and productive. That&#x27;s the point.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll purchase again and again. Good price point!&lt;br /&gt;If you have little hairs that pop up out of nowhere, worried about &amp;#34;cleaning up&lt;br /&gt;an area&amp;#34; , need a better way to take care of strays...understand that this is&lt;br /&gt;the best solution I&#x27;ve found so am happy to pass that along. Go for it.</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for - wish the blade was smaller/shorter though</li>
            <li> Love these. I had been epilating my face, PAIN!!!! This thing is so handy and my skin looks so smooth. I still have to pluck out some stubborn black hairs, but this device is awesome. And a great price!</li>
            <li> This little tool has changed my life. Perfectly groomed brows always. Wish I&#x27;d discovered this years ago. I highly recommend this to all!</li>
            <li> My roommate had one of these and I just had to get one for myself. It&#x27;s great to getting rid of unwanted peach fuzz on your face and neck. Also great for all you brunettes out there who have that pesky, slightly noticeable upper-lip hair. Just be careful around your eyebrows - roommate got too close and has been trying to grow one side back for a year now!</li>
            <li> These work great for getting those little fuzzy patches above and to the side of eye brows.</li>
            <li> These are the best face shavers I have ever used. I like that the blade is really long, so they get a larger amount of your skin&#x27;s surface, and ultimately make it an easier process. I have been using one shaver for a couple weeks and it hasn&#x27;t even gotten dull at all. If it&#x27;s your first time using this type of shaver, this is the perfect one to try. I also like that the blade is retractable, so you could take this wherever you needed, and not have to worry about keeping up with the caps that come on other razors.</li>
            <li> Let me never be without the flamingo feather! This product is so good not only to wisp away stray facial hair but to use as a razor as well.  I use it daily and it lasts forever.  So glad Amazon consistently has it available in their marketplace because I have never seen them for sale in box retail. You will not be disappointed in this purchase!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay sharp very long..</li>
            <li> It is not too sharp like most facial razors it gives the face a nice look without actually shaving your face. It is a great product for women with peach fuzz on the face that want to remove hair without wax. I love this product!</li>
            <li> If this product were any use with eyebrows, I would give it 5 stars. I bought these razors to avoid the pain of waxing/threading my eyebrows and upper lip. This product is the equivalent of a pocket knife with a razor instead of a blade--a great idea. However, the concept of facial shaving causes hairs to grow back after just a couple days--so shaving is not nearly as efficient as other forms of hair removal. I think that was the biggest disappointment of the purchase. Still, I use the razors to remove the peach fuzz on my upper lip every few days because it is less painful than waxing/threading and faster than attempting to pluck.</li>
            <li> Great for eyebrows and all the fuzzy hair that you get in your cheeks and lip don&#x27;t stimulate hair grothw so you can use all over the face without fear</li>
            <li> It has been over a year now and I&#x27;m still using the first razor out of the 3 that it brings....that&#x27;s how good it is :)</li>
            <li> Continue having success with this item and have given many as gifts to friends who wonder how I do it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never plucking my eyebrows again. Well, that&#x27;s a half truth. These razors are easy to use and keep your brows looking fresh. Perfect for girls on the go who don&#x27;t have time to waste tweezing pesky micro hairs. The fact that the shaver folds might just be a novelty, but one that I personally appreciate. Be careful not to overdo it, use your common sense (I mean, it IS a razor), and you&#x27;ll be a happy lady.</li>
            <li> absolutely horrible don&#x27;t bother if I can get my money back I&#x27;m going too! Terrible product doesn&#x27;t work not worth the money</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly - excellent quality</li>
            <li> WARNING: Horrible product....doesn&#x27;t work...extremely cheaply made....dont waste your money</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not the feather  flamingo brand I don&#x27;t mess with it. Very good for precision eye brow shaping.</li>
            <li> Shape but safe very well. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for awhile, works for me!</li>
            <li> The product arrived about two weeks after the expected timeframe given, but once it came and I tried it....Wow! So glad I got it instead of a refund. It is very sharp, love the handle and love that you fold it to enclose the blade - makes it more sanitary.  It shaves off your eyebrow hairs without much effort and can be used in other areas. Just LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I used to pay around $200 each month by professionals to get a dermaplanning procedure done to remove slight facial hair in a safe way. My skin is very sensitive, but this product is effective. Happy to have been recommended to this product!</li>
            <li> These things are awesome! They are super accurate. Just gotta be careful not to scrape against your skin too hard or else you might start to scrape your skin! haha Great Product tho.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review: perfect grooming tools</li>
            <li> I needed something to trim without giving me major shaving cuts since I don&#x27;t usually need to shave. This worked out perfectly for my needs and it&#x27;s quite manageable.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Thank you Amazon for getting my order to me. Without these, I would have looked like a Sasquatch.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. Be very careful when using, you can end up shaving more than expected. Just take your time.</li>
            <li> These little razors are just wonderful and so easy to use. Must have them in my stock at all time.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have always used tweezers, but when I found out about this product I decided to give it a try. It was so easy to use and was perfect for getting rid of any stray hairs without the pain of plucking. It was sharp enough to get rid of even the smallest hairs and definitely helped for achieving &amp;#34;straighter&amp;#34; brows!</li>
            <li> Nice for cleaning up around the beard. Especially below the nose where you need a little gap. Finally found something that reaches it.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, the women folk have discovered it for it&#x27;s intended purpose of above eyebrow finish work and they&#x27;re going fast.</li>
            <li> Best ones I have used !</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose. I use it for eyebrow shaping and upper lip. It is not as rough or harsh as the other available ones</li>
            <li> Amazing! It doesn&#x27;t do that much for the eyebrows but it works wonders on other facial areas. The blade is extremely sharp and requires little effort. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> If you want a straighter brow that is not so arched, this is a great product, much better than tweezers. Just place it horizontally on top of your brow and move it slowly back and forth (not up and down, or else it will literally erase your entire eyebrow). I purchased this after watching a Youtube beauty tutorial and instantly fell in love after using it. Also, it comes in packs of three, enough to last you for years.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used for all over facial hair</li>
            <li> Something has happened to these razors. I&#x27;ve used them for years but the last batch I purchased are not sharp and are are having to be tossed as they are irritating my skin. I went to the actual Feather Japan web site and don&#x27;t see them listed. I wonder if Feather even makes these any more and whether the ones I got are fake.  They are so bad I now have to find an alternative.  These were the best product.  Very sad they they have either gone down the cheap-manufacturing-bad-product path, or that they are fake.  No longer even acceptable.</li>
            <li> Because it doesn&#x27;t lose its sharped blade and because it is so good to use!&lt;br /&gt;Be careful though, if you don&#x27;t really know how to use them, ask someone to help you. Sounds weird, but you don&#x27;t want to lose your eyebrows, unless that&#x27;s what you want then I don&#x27;t judge you.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to use nivea cream or any other so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using them over 10 years but they have been discontinued in the stores</li>
            <li> Great item. Works as described. Will purchase again when these wear out.</li>
            <li> I like the Feather Flamingo for removing facial peach fuzz and hair on my neck. The blade lasts 4-5 uses. If you are looking for more of a dermaplane result, try the Shiseido FT. That razor gets the dead skin layer too. It&#x27;s sharper, but dulls faster. I like to alternate between the two brands. My hairdresser uses a feather blade for neck hair and swears by them.</li>
            <li> Received the razors within a couple days of ordering. I&#x27;ve used these for over 15 years to shape my eyebrows and remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I will order more.......I shared with my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have been using the feather flamingo eyebrow shaver for a long time and just placed an order for more. I am an aesthetic nurse so I am trained in skin care. I use these eyebrown shavers at home to clean up the back of my husbands neck in between haircuts. I use them to remove the hair on my upper lip and I also use to &amp;#34;dermaplane&amp;#34; my face. It removes dead skin cells and the fine fuzzy hair on the face but you must be careful when you do this. You must practice carefully to get the hang of it and to get the proper angle of the shaver to your face. I absolutely love this product and highly recommend.</li>
