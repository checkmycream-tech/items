            <li>but I sure do smell good.</li>
            <li>Paco Rabanne is no longer sold in department stores, and majority of drugstores, so I was thrilled to find it on-line.  </li>
            <li>I got him this as a gift and he loved it, since it&#x27;s his favorite.</li>
            <li>This cologne is so nice, and it smells divine on just about everyone.  </li>
            <li>I could not find this product anywhere for this kind of price.</li>
            <li>cheap, good, and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>best pricing by far, is from Amazon.com  </li>
            <li>Great smell always get positive responses from women.</li>
            <li>Been using this cologne for 26 years and love it as does my wife</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for over 20 years and it still is a favorite for me and my wife.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Paco Rabanne for Men Eau de Toilette for many, many years.</li>
            <li>I recommend you to buy it from this seller because their are many people selling fakes of this.</li>
            <li>My favorite for years.</li>
            <li>i just could not pass this up for a X Mas present for my dad perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>OK I had never smelled this before</li>
            <li>Otherwise, everything looks ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this cologne on my husband.</li>
            <li>For its clean and elegant smell, I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Paco and I&#x27;m glad to see that I can still get it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this perfume for a friend that ask me fot it, he likes it, for me is too strong, but he likes it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not so strong.  </li>
            <li>Nice to smell great.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for the first time since, and works like I remember it did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfume smells somewhat cheap.</li>
            <li>Not only did I find it on Amazon, I found it at a great price.</li>
            <li>Another legacy left to us by the great Paco Rabanne.  </li>
            <li>Paco left us with this great cologne.  </li>
            <li>It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li>I can see it being used by older users, which seems to be more appropriate.  </li>
            <li>Seems this product is original, so</li>
            <li>Good for a standard every day cologne</li>
            <li>my husband loved this, it&#x27;s the only one he wears!</li>
            <li>anymore I&#x27;ll be lucky if it lasts 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li>When I arrive back home, I wash my face with cold water, and I am always impressed that I can smell myself the nice and refreshing flavour of Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li>A favorite, the Eau Paco Rabanne for men was exactly what I ordered and was delivered more quickly than expected.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really refreshing and gives you confident in yourself, whenever I feel I&#x27;m down, I wear this, my wife, friends, coworkers all love it and identify my directly from the smell!</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>if you really like something, then enjoy it as much as you can.</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous as it always has, very masculine, not perfumy like a lot of the newer mens cologne.</li>
            <li>In the last week I have been working for more than 16 hours a day.</li>
            <li>It was hot, I stunk.</li>
            <li>and it is still my favorite scent 15 years later.</li>
            <li>is Av Musk is a cheap aftershave and kind it only last on my skin like 5 minuts</li>
            <li>My order with Amazon was easy and simple.  </li>
            <li>The price is great, about half of what I can find it for locally when I can find it around Christmas.</li>
            <li>This particular size works will for every day use and lasts me almost one year!  </li>
            <li>This perfume is not that great, it even lasts only for few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely satisfactory.</li>
            <li>The seller had a very competitive listed price for Paco Rabanne.  </li>
            <li>I really  like this perfume for my husband.  </li>
            <li>No one complains I reek of too much, yet I use it every day.</li>
            <li>The packaging was sealed in plastic and nice, but the bottle itself has a totally different logo with a big \\&quot;P R\\&quot; on it.  </li>
            <li>classic fresh natural and irresistible fragrance of Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li>The Paco Rabanne I received on line does not smell the same as the original eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>Timeless appeal, a classic.  </li>
            <li>I call it the classic of all eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different colognes, but I always come back to Paco.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommendeable.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores in California any more - something about too much alcohol in product.</li>
            <li>Fresh, light, subtle....  </li>
            <li>It is subtle, elegant, and classic.</li>
            <li>This is one of the colognes my husband has been wearing, but this one has been around for many years and it has become hard to find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so masculine</li>
            <li>For college and under 25 year old users, try something else.</li>
            <li>so I looked around my house for a old aqua velva musk aftershave</li>
            <li>Subtle, masculine, and I have received many compliments on the scent.  </li>
            <li>Not only did he do the costumes and set designs for (now) classic \\&quot;Barbarella,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It is the real deal; clearly not a knockoff.</li>
            <li>I never fully appreciated other scents from the 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s like Brut or Jovan.  </li>
            <li>The only other reasonable source is Perfumania.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as my 8 year old bottle of Paco Rabanne.</li>

            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as my 8 year old bottle of Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne for anyone who wants their man&#x27;s cologne to make their knees weak!!</li>
            <li> Through love, hate, death, worn out romances and taxes, I&#x27;ve had it on almost daily for over thirty years.</li>
            <li> He told me the fragrance smell is stronger then the ones he has bought in the past and that it last longer.</li>
            <li> This cologne is among two that I use the other is Angel.</li>
            <li> I think you only need a small amount</li>
            <li> I usually order the much smaller vial for traveling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would def reccomend, he gets lots of compliments from other ppl while wearing..</li>
            <li> It actually smells like it was stale or from an old batch.</li>
            <li> and it certainly will make you look twice at any guy who is wearing it, if you can faintly detect it.</li>
            <li> but if you have very small hands you might want a smaller size if you use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few products for him that don&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The only thing to know is that the size and bottle shape makes it a little uncomfortable to hold the bottle with one hand and to spray .</li>
            <li> Not sure if the style has changed or it&#x27;s a knock off from China.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the fragrance I remembered it is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> hardly anything else) in department stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Paco since the late seventies.</li>
            <li> 1 spritz can mean a world of difference when it comes to the ladies...</li>
            <li> a little expensive</li>
            <li> Basenotes have a hint of tobacco, making it somewhat unpleasant for me.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Paco was good before stuff like Aqua by Armani came out. Now Paco has a stinky smell..e[...] dont know one woman who likes PACO anymore.</li>
            <li> Superb fragance, light aroma, I would recommend the 3.4 oz Eau de Toilette Spray than the cologne. Love this product!! Highly recommendeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Paco since the late seventies. Through love, hate, death, worn out romances and taxes, I&#x27;ve had it on almost daily for over thirty years. Now, I know what you&#x27;re thinking.............another dinosaur stuck in the seventies. My take on it is if you really like something, then enjoy it as much as you can. And yeah, I&#x27;ve got some miles on me but I sure do smell good. Buy some and start your own relationship with the best thing to come out of France since Bridget Bardot.</li>
            <li> cheap, good, and prompt delivery. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Been using this cologne for 26 years and love it as does my wife</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for over 20 years and it still is a favorite for me and my wife.  And at Amazon&#x27;s prices, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li> This is one of the colognes my husband has been wearing, but this one has been around for many years and it has become hard to find. The price is great, about half of what I can find it for locally when I can find it around Christmas. It smells fabulous as it always has, very masculine, not perfumy like a lot of the newer mens cologne. I highly recommend this cologne for anyone who wants their man&#x27;s cologne to make their knees weak!!</li>
            <li> This is my favourite parfum ever. It is subtle, elegant, and classic. I use it every day. In the last week I have been working for more than 16 hours a day. When I arrive back home, I wash my face with cold water, and I am always impressed that I can smell myself the nice and refreshing flavour of Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li> Everything perfect (for this price under $30)!!!  Delivered in time and in perfect condition. Absolutely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> My order with Amazon was easy and simple.  The seller had a very competitive listed price for Paco Rabanne.  I am happy with my product.  I arrived in time for the holidays.</li>
            <li> Have worn this for over 30 years, and cannot begin to tally the complements received.  Timeless appeal, a classic.  Fresh, light, subtle....  Still turns heads!</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for a friend that ask me fot it, he likes it, for me is too strong, but he likes it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Paco Rabanne for Men Eau de Toilette for many, many years. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores in California any more - something about too much alcohol in product. The Paco Rabanne I received on line does not smell the same as the original eau de toilette. It&#x27;s perfume smells somewhat cheap.</li>
            <li> Paco Rabanne is no longer sold in department stores, and majority of drugstores, so I was thrilled to find it on-line.  Both my husband and I like the fragrance plus it works well to soothe his skin.</li>
            <li> My dad has been using this fragrance for over 40 years. I got him this as a gift and he loved it, since it&#x27;s his favorite. He told me the fragrance smell is stronger then the ones he has bought in the past and that it last longer. Seems this product is original, so I recommend you to buy it from this seller because their are many people selling fakes of this.</li>
            <li> A favorite, the Eau Paco Rabanne for men was exactly what I ordered and was delivered more quickly than expected.</li>
            <li> My favorite for years. I will never forget about it. I call it the classic of all eau de toilette. C&#x27;est chic forever and ever.</li>
            <li> Super happy great deal i just could not pass this up for a X Mas present for my dad perfect.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the fragrance I remembered it is not very pleasant. It actually smells like it was stale or from an old batch.</li>
            <li> I really  like this perfume for my husband.  It&#x27;s so masculine but it&#x27;s not so strong.  I buy it for him.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent and a wonderful price.  My husband was very happy to get this gift!</li>
            <li> Basenotes have a hint of tobacco, making it somewhat unpleasant for me. I can see it being used by older users, which seems to be more appropriate.  For college and under 25 year old users, try something else.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories from trip to Europe after college 25 years ago. It was hot, I stunk. Purchased Paco Rabanne in France. Nice to smell great.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for the first time since, and works like I remember it did. Great value, and you will smell great.</li>
            <li> This cologne is among two that I use the other is Angel. The only other reasonable source is Perfumania. Who do you trust.?</li>
            <li> Subtle, masculine, and I have received many compliments on the scent.  This 100 ml bottle meets TSA guidelines, so I take it with me on trips.</li>
            <li> This cologne is so nice, and it smells divine on just about everyone.  Both girls and guys can use this scent as it smells great!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragance, not too strong and not too light just right and the price was excellent also.&lt;br /&gt;I been using it for a while now.</li>
            <li> This has been my only cologne for years. No one complains I reek of too much, yet I use it every day. The price must be good here; otherwise I would have bought it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product anywhere for this kind of price. It is the real deal; clearly not a knockoff. If you like Paco por homme, this is the way to buy it.</li>
            <li> Great smell always get positive responses from women.</li>
            <li> Good for a standard every day cologne</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Great accompaniment to After-Shave</li>
            <li> This is my L&#x27;Air De Pinache ... 1 spritz can mean a world of difference when it comes to the ladies... My dad introduced me to this as a teenager and it is still my favorite scent 15 years later.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff and Macy&#x27;s stopped carrying it.  Not only did I find it on Amazon, I found it at a great price.</li>
            <li> my husband loved this, it&#x27;s the only one he wears!</li>
            <li> I like paco unisex, one million. This perfume is not that great, it even lasts only for few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all depends on your personal preferences when buying a perfume, try them before buying the product. i got this perfume as a gift, so i don&#x27;t regret for it.</li>
            <li> I remember that when I was in college, my best friend&#x27;s boyfriend used to wear this cologne.  My friend could not keep her hands off of him.  She always talked about &#x27;how great he smelled&#x27;.  Through the years this fragrance has always been in my mind as a sort of aphrodisiac!  I think you only need a small amount or else it could probably become overdone but I do remember the smell as &#x27;beautiful&#x27; and it certainly will make you look twice at any guy who is wearing it, if you can faintly detect it.</li>
            <li> This is the best-smelling cologne/aftershave, whatever, created my &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; for men.  Very sexy smelling without being perfume&#x27;y&#x27;.  Love it.  Recommend this for any guy out there!</li>
            <li> Another legacy left to us by the great Paco Rabanne.  Not only did he do the costumes and set designs for (now) classic \\&quot;Barbarella,\\&quot; Paco left us with this great cologne.  I never fully appreciated other scents from the 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s like Brut or Jovan.  For its clean and elegant smell, I&#x27;ve always enjoyed Paco and I&#x27;m glad to see that I can still get it through Amazon.  This particular size works will for every day use and lasts me almost one year!  I usually order the much smaller vial for traveling.  I&#x27;ve tried many different colognes, but I always come back to Paco.  Happily, it&#x27;s one of my wife&#x27;s favorites!</li>
            <li> i recomend this product is really great hop you buy because i like iy is a gerat price so buy</li>
            <li> OK I had never smelled this before but I bought it to try it and my fist impression was I&#x27;ve smelled this before so I looked around my house for a old aqua velva musk aftershave and there it was the almost Identical only difference is Av Musk is a cheap aftershave and kind it only last on my skin like 5 minuts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve buying buying Paco Rabanne for quite some time,I did notice used to last up to 12 hours but&lt;br /&gt;not anymore I&#x27;ll be lucky if it lasts 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> The only thing to know is that the size and bottle shape makes it a little uncomfortable to hold the bottle with one hand and to spray . You can do it but if you have very small hands you might want a smaller size if you use it almost every day. (It&#x27;s not a big deal, but just reporting my observation.)</li>
            <li> Great smell. a little expensive</li>
            <li> Bought this for my father in law and received it smells great. Great fragrance. With just a spray everyone in the house loved it.</li>
            <li> I couldnt find this item on my country, Dad loves it, I dont like how it smells jejeje, but he does.</li>
            <li> The packaging was sealed in plastic and nice, but the bottle itself has a totally different logo with a big \\&quot;P R\\&quot; on it.  Not sure if the style has changed or it&#x27;s a knock off from China.  Haven&#x27;t researched it with Paco Rabanne yet.  Otherwise, everything looks ok.  The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as my 8 year old bottle of Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne on my husband. It is one of the few products for him that don&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Smells Amazing on my Honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤&lt;br /&gt;Would def reccomend, he gets lots of compliments from other ppl while wearing..&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I have used Paco Rabanne Eau de Toilette for 40 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried countless others, but, always have the Paco&lt;br /&gt;standing by, which is always returned to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Paco!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Stevan. :-)&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;The best pricing by far, is from Amazon.com  I never buy Paco&lt;br /&gt;(or hardly anything else) in department stores anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stevan.</li>
            <li> My dad used to wear this cologne, ever since, it&#x27;s mine now, it&#x27;s really refreshing and gives you confident in yourself, whenever I feel I&#x27;m down, I wear this, my wife, friends, coworkers all love it and identify my directly from the smell!</li>
