            <li>Great score!</li>
            <li>In the way it feels on my skin, the weightless, flawless coverage, even in sunlight, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything!</li>

            <li>feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>IQ had good reviews</li>
            <li>Pair this kit with a good moisturizer and primer</li>
            <li>I am a redhead, thus I go the fair kit.</li>
            <li>I also feel that this mineral makeup is good for my skin</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my wife and she loved it.</li>
            <li>all the kits are too good.</li>
            <li>I have tried EVERY known mineral makeup on the market, none remotely as good as this product.</li>
            <li>Or if you have a good skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>However it provides good coverage and for the price I think is a good value and works well.</li>
            <li>The makeup does work good for coverage.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really good.  </li>
            <li>As well as the bronzer and eyeshadow is good as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I ordered fair, and you get 2 shades of fair.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this makeup!!!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I do LOVE the eyeshadow in tan that came with this kit!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Very impressed after first application, will follow up in a week or so.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and had great staying power even in the humidity.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It is light and feels great on.  </li>
            <li>how much I liked this kit.  </li>
            <li>Included brushes were nice too.</li>
            <li>I feel like my face is flawless without feeling cakey or looking like I&#x27;m wearing too much.</li>
            <li>this stuff is like going to the club, kind of sparkly.</li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>For the fair, the coverage was okay,</li>
            <li>but I ended up using my own kabuki for the powder.</li>
            <li>I went to a retailer and had a mini makeover and was very impressed, however, my purse...not so much but all in all</li>
            <li>think the mini kit is a good investment for any of the women (and maybe some men) looking into mineral makeup without having to commit :)</li>
            <li>nice product.</li>
            <li>excellent makeup - almost as good as bare minerals.</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage when I use my professional grade brushes.</li>
            <li>I love love love the eyeshadow !</li>
            <li>The brushes look to be as good as my original brushes...time will tell...</li>
            <li>, i was on amazon one day when i came accross this makeup set and decided to try it, other reviews said to order one shade darker because it runs light but with how fair my skin is i stuck with the fair which makes my face look awesome!!!!</li>
            <li>This was shipped very, very FAST!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this make-up.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this was the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I love this make up</li>
            <li>I am guessing that those who wrote favorable reviews have not had better quality to compare this make-up  too.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff-</li>
            <li>I Love this product.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This kit was OK and didn&#x27;t contain bismuth which I thought might be better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even more matte/cakey then bareminerals matte collection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more pigmented I think then bareminerals-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this make up.</li>
            <li>Love the bronzer and have used that for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The brushes were ok</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The product was fantastic, the kind of makeup that you can&#x27;t even feel on your skin after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>and I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>I just wish the brushes were better for blending the mineral powder into your skin.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need better brushes.</li>
            <li>has too much sparkle, but the rest of the kit is wonderful and well worth the $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the color of the blush and the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great and the whole kit is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>just fine; ok color for me; love the veil.</li>
            <li>The foundations provide light coverage that lets your skin breathe, and if you want it slightly more opaque</li>
            <li>It looks great, lasts all day and it feels so natural that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I am wearing anything.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(I just ordered the &#x27;original&#x27; BE foundation which is much more like IQ</li>
            <li>It blends easily and is not cakey in the slightest.</li>
            <li>As far as the make-up itself, the coverage is okay, not as good as what I&#x27;d hoped for, I don&#x27;t know if the brush size contributes to poorer coverage.</li>
            <li>Just as good or better than bare minerals.</li>
            <li>HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this powder is light and gives you a nice and healthy glow.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and airy</li>
            <li>but I had already bought myself a really nice brush set so that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.</li>
            <li>Incredibly light.</li>
            <li>They were cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had experience with bareminerals with better success.</li>
            <li>While the bisque has ok coverage, the rest just sits on top of your skin and doesn&#x27;t really blend or hide anything.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely buy again and recommend to friends and family!!!,</li>
            <li>It is ok but does not go on as nice as bare minerals products.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this</li>
            <li>There is no &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; like bareminerals original (probably because it contains no bismuth).</li>
            <li>I will be interested in ordering more of your line.</li>
            <li>others(most women have more than a few brushes lol).  </li>
            <li>I was really looking for a nice mineral makeup because I felt like sporting a more natural look.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to apply too much powder or it will be visible to others that you are wearing a lot of make up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned, freckled, with blue eyes.</li>
            <li>It may be the reason the make up lasts a good ten hours, but I haven&#x27;t tried it without it</li>
            <li>The concealer, bronzer, eye shadow, setting powder, two full size mineral foundation -</li>
            <li>it was one of those true \\&quot;TA DA\\&quot; moments..</li>
            <li>have some of the warmth actually) and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I am a fair for BE and ordered the same in IQ, which is a bit lighter, but it&#x27;s not a huge issue unless you are more of a fair toward medium...may be too light for</li>
            <li>And, lastly, the eyeshadow was a good, tan or taupe color, but super glittery.</li>
            <li>This is a great little product for a fantastic price .</li>
            <li>I decided to give this makeup a chance after using a friend&#x27;s Bare Minerals makeup and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>DELIVERY WAS QUICK</li>
            <li>I am extremely fair skinned, I have yet to find someone more pale than me and makeups have always had an orange tint on me until i found iq naturals.</li>
            <li>Excellent, true to the description it is an even, long lasting product.</li>
            <li>The other Fair is so light</li>
            <li>than BE&#x27;s new foundation), I do like the IQ&#x27;s all over face color better than BE</li>
            <li>The foundation colors actually blend and adjust to your own skin tone, the coverage is exceptional, it actually covered my freckles without having to put layer upon layer of the foundation, which often times leads to a \\&quot;cakey\\</li>
            <li>The rest of the make up was very soft, just make sure to use a primer before applying so it doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li>Soft, light, easy.</li>
            <li>u look more like a old lady who caked on makeup.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>For once I can put make up on my whole face and love how natural and smooth it looks while still providing coverage.</li>
            <li>I could probably buy the same set at Walmart, honestly.</li>
            <li>I would say that the color is more true to my skin tone than Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It would be nice however if they added a bag for the actual mineral powders.</li>
            <li>I only really liked the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s affordable and all natural.</li>
            <li>So far they love it.</li>
            <li>The brushes were of surprisingly good quality; though not top of the line they held together well and don&#x27;t shed the way cheap brushes do.</li>
            <li>I am overall happy with the purchase, but I think BE is a bit better quality, the foundation goes on a little &#x27;nicer&#x27; and &#x27;smoother&#x27; than IQ</li>
            <li>I would remove half a star because the way it is packaged more of the mineral comes out into the top of the container when I am traveling.  </li>
            <li>It covers better than bare minerals in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The second lightest powder provides a nice, even coverage while being comfortable and nearly invisible.</li>
            <li>This makeup works better than bare minerals in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The products are smaller than if you purchased them individually, but this is great for anyone looking to test out mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the make up, but the brushes seemed pretty cheap, as expected.</li>
            <li>The makeup brush kit is decent, nothing special...</li>
            <li>The foundation is fantastic for those, like me, who have experienced burning, itching, swelling, and hives from those other so-called \\&quot;au natural\\&quot;  mineral makeup, especially those that advertise that they are specifically and specially formulated for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only drawbacks are that the brushes aren&#x27;t the best quality, though certainly usable, and all of the makeup is messy.</li>
            <li>But the makeup itself works pretty well --</li>
            <li>So using it for the first time</li>
            <li>When I found this I was pretty hesitant, tons of companies trying to pass off an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; product as God-sent.</li>
            <li>However, I did want to be able to use it and not look like I was a middle schooler first learning how to put it on.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li>IT WAS MY FIRST TIME TRYING IT.  </li>
            <li>I cannot get used to it, this is my first experience with mineral products</li>
            <li>No fake smells, or shiny sparkles (except in the eyeshadow).</li>
            <li>This was a first for me trying any type of mineral makeup</li>
            <li>It works ok for a back up plan.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s been okay, typically only using the foundation, blush or that face color stuff, veil and mascara....</li>
            <li>, PACKAGING WAS GOOD,  ONLY CONCERN WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY OPENING THE TINY &amp;#34;JARS&amp;#34; WITHOUT SPILLING.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly, isn&#x27;t quite as easy to use as Bare Escensuals, especially the setting veil and blusher.</li>
            <li>The main reason I chose this brand (besides the price) is that it contains no bismuth!</li>
            <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t very high quality</li>
            <li>And a help full hint with the mineral veil- apply it to your brush and tap the end of your brush down, not hard but lightly, it kinda spreads it all over the brush and creates a more even look and helps with fallout, you can do this with the actual foundation too!</li>
            <li>The brushes work great and the makeup provided full coverage with only having to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li>Yes the colors match nice, but it seems to cake up in some areas no mater how little i apply.</li>
            <li>I ordered a mini sample kit, it was very inexpensive and the reviews were pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit lighter, I found the BE \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; was a little much, but the IQ&#x27;s version is nice.  </li>
            <li>Thought it would be better for the price I spent</li>
            <li>Either way, the products were sticker sealed, so I was comfortable enough with that.</li>
            <li>The instructions show a much wider, rounder, fuller brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately it&#x27;s very matte- almost cakey.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and still had a problem with how it looked.</li>
            <li>The eye shadow doesn&#x27;t have much pigment</li>
            <li>It is everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>I  have to really work with it.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this makeup.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even really want to use them.</li>
            <li>The day after I used it, many of the red bumps on my checks were completely GONE.</li>
            <li>i was looking for a cheap replacement for my original product to try and save a few bucks.</li>
            <li>I started using Bare Escentuals last September and fell in LOVE..</li>
            <li>This is why I will most likely buy a bare minerals brush to use with this makeup.</li>
            <li>but when I received the package, 2 were open ( both full sized powders)</li>
            <li>At 30 years old, this is the first make-up I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I like the bronzer and the coverup power, and the brushes are decent.</li>
            <li>But after some hormonal changes I&#x27;m breaking out like a sophomore in high school and had to do something about my complexion.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this makeup to anyone</li>
            <li>Got my IQ natural miners set!!</li>
            <li>love the brushes, and it even comes with a little pouch for carrying the brushes in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually ran out of the little concealer type powder, and just use the bigger powder for now, and it still covers pretty good.</li>
            <li>and I no longer breakout because of clogged pores because it&#x27;s so much lighter compare to my old choice of make up.</li>
            <li>I love this  product, it did not feel like I was wearing heavy makeup.</li>
            <li>all the products are normal size.</li>
            <li>IQ Natural is my new GO-TO mineral makeup and I am looking forward to purchasing IQ Natural makeup for my daughters and my mother!!!</li>
            <li>My first time ever using this kind of make up, I really like it minus the bronzer part because I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>so you know it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>This IQ Naturals foundation is my new Holy Grail.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a person who wears a lot, if any makeup, even on special occasions.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this kit, looks like I have 0-to very little makeup on</li>
            <li>Very comparable to bare minerals.</li>
            <li>I like this product as much as the Bare Minerals product.  </li>
            <li>The finishing spray is a necessity, but since I didn&#x27;t order it, I use a small bottle of water mixed with a bit of my favorite face moisturizer and voila: finishing spray!</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the price, because it is so much cheaper than bare minerals.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look unnatural but a little pale so the next shade should suit me more with more coverage.  </li>
            <li>Made a huge glittery mess all over myself.</li>
            <li>The concealer is a little tricky to use though, you need to have a light touch when applying.</li>
            <li>Given the low price, it was a real surprise</li>
            <li>I saw IQ Natural on Amazon and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big makeup user, and dont really use make up</li>
            <li>The powder looks natural and feels like you aren&#x27;t even wearing make up.</li>
            <li>The brushes were individually wrapped, so, that wasn&#x27;t too much of an issue.</li>
            <li>I did receive two foundations, but one was marked as &amp;</li>
            <li>I am just completely blown away.</li>
            <li>For having a natural look, I must suggest to use this makeup set.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and so far none of them have fallen out.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a makeup that&#x27;s all natural and affordable.</li>
            <li>The brush set is pretty cheap and not great quality but still for the money you&#x27;re spending</li>
            <li>The brushes are a little harsh however, but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I ended up putting it aside and going back to my normal brand.</li>
            <li>The brush pouch, however, was disappointing, rather cheaply made, we&#x27;re talking the everything&#x27;s a dollar stores cheap.</li>
            <li>My third purchase of this brand and plan to remain loyal customer!Brushes in this particular package not top of line , but get the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Bare Minerals user for a while.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals products have an odor that stays on your brushes and your skin.</li>
            <li>Trust me bare minerals is what u want.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to Bare Minerals so for the cost I thought I would try this product.</li>
            <li>it was a lot like the Bare Minerals brand, but cheaper.</li>
            <li>I suffer from rosacea and extremely sensitive skin, but this makeup causes no irritation and I think it is actually clearing my skin!!!!</li>
            <li>The make-up was nothing like bare mineral make-up.  </li>
            <li>I had bare minerals years ago(still</li>
            <li>I recommend IQ if your looking for a little less expensive alternative to some of the more popular brands of mineral</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend spending the extra money buying bare minerals.</li>
            <li>The only foundations tht dont cause me to breakout is physicians formula and bare minerals.</li>
            <li>It looks incredibly cheap when you open it up -- the cheesy red bag went straight into the trash, and there were a lot a lot of plastic baggies.  </li>
            <li>i should of updated this earlier but due to my sensitive skin this makeup caused me to break out and it also caused my sister to break out if u have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I admit I was hesitant to try this brand when it arrived; to my embarrassment, after applying the makeup, I did not experience the break outs or the unbearable burning sensations that other \\&quot;high end (overly priced)\\&quot; mineral makeup caused.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because the product is bad, just wasn&#x27;t as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>which could be a good or bad thing for others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is good and bad to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a clear plastic flap inside that is designed to lay over the brushes before the pouch is rolled and snapped closed.</li>

            <li> feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> IQ had good reviews</li>
            <li> Pair this kit with a good moisturizer and primer</li>
            <li> I am a redhead, thus I go the fair kit.</li>
            <li> I also feel that this mineral makeup is good for my skin</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife and she loved it.</li>
            <li> all the kits are too good.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY known mineral makeup on the market, none remotely as good as this product.</li>
            <li> Or if you have a good skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However it provides good coverage and for the price I think is a good value and works well.</li>
            <li> The makeup does work good for coverage.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really good.  </li>
            <li> As well as the bronzer and eyeshadow is good as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I ordered fair, and you get 2 shades of fair.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this makeup!!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I do LOVE the eyeshadow in tan that came with this kit!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> Very impressed after first application, will follow up in a week or so.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and had great staying power even in the humidity.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It is light and feels great on.  </li>
            <li> how much I liked this kit.  </li>
            <li> Included brushes were nice too.</li>
            <li> I feel like my face is flawless without feeling cakey or looking like I&#x27;m wearing too much.</li>
            <li> this stuff is like going to the club, kind of sparkly.</li>
            <li> received this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> For the fair, the coverage was okay,</li>
            <li> but I ended up using my own kabuki for the powder.</li>
            <li> I went to a retailer and had a mini makeover and was very impressed, however, my purse...not so much but all in all</li>
            <li> think the mini kit is a good investment for any of the women (and maybe some men) looking into mineral makeup without having to commit :)</li>
            <li> nice product.</li>
            <li> excellent makeup - almost as good as bare minerals.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage when I use my professional grade brushes.</li>
            <li> I love love love the eyeshadow !</li>
            <li> The brushes look to be as good as my original brushes...time will tell...</li>
            <li> , i was on amazon one day when i came accross this makeup set and decided to try it, other reviews said to order one shade darker because it runs light but with how fair my skin is i stuck with the fair which makes my face look awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> This was shipped very, very FAST!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this make-up.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this was the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I love this make up</li>
            <li> I am guessing that those who wrote favorable reviews have not had better quality to compare this make-up  too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff-</li>
            <li> I Love this product.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This kit was OK and didn&#x27;t contain bismuth which I thought might be better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even more matte/cakey then bareminerals matte collection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is more pigmented I think then bareminerals-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this make up.</li>
            <li> Love the bronzer and have used that for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The brushes were ok</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The product was fantastic, the kind of makeup that you can&#x27;t even feel on your skin after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> and I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> I just wish the brushes were better for blending the mineral powder into your skin.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need better brushes.</li>
            <li> has too much sparkle, but the rest of the kit is wonderful and well worth the $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the color of the blush and the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great and the whole kit is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> just fine; ok color for me; love the veil.</li>
            <li> The foundations provide light coverage that lets your skin breathe, and if you want it slightly more opaque</li>
            <li> It looks great, lasts all day and it feels so natural that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I am wearing anything.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (I just ordered the &#x27;original&#x27; BE foundation which is much more like IQ</li>
            <li> It blends easily and is not cakey in the slightest.</li>
            <li> As far as the make-up itself, the coverage is okay, not as good as what I&#x27;d hoped for, I don&#x27;t know if the brush size contributes to poorer coverage.</li>
            <li> Just as good or better than bare minerals.</li>
            <li> HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this powder is light and gives you a nice and healthy glow.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and airy</li>
            <li> but I had already bought myself a really nice brush set so that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.</li>
            <li> Incredibly light.</li>
            <li> They were cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had experience with bareminerals with better success.</li>
            <li> While the bisque has ok coverage, the rest just sits on top of your skin and doesn&#x27;t really blend or hide anything.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely buy again and recommend to friends and family!!!,</li>
            <li> It is ok but does not go on as nice as bare minerals products.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this</li>
            <li> There is no &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; like bareminerals original (probably because it contains no bismuth).</li>
            <li> I will be interested in ordering more of your line.</li>
            <li> others(most women have more than a few brushes lol).  </li>
            <li> I was really looking for a nice mineral makeup because I felt like sporting a more natural look.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to apply too much powder or it will be visible to others that you are wearing a lot of make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned, freckled, with blue eyes.</li>
            <li> It may be the reason the make up lasts a good ten hours, but I haven&#x27;t tried it without it</li>
            <li> The concealer, bronzer, eye shadow, setting powder, two full size mineral foundation -</li>
            <li> it was one of those true \\&quot;TA DA\\&quot; moments..</li>
            <li> have some of the warmth actually) and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I am a fair for BE and ordered the same in IQ, which is a bit lighter, but it&#x27;s not a huge issue unless you are more of a fair toward medium...may be too light for</li>
            <li> And, lastly, the eyeshadow was a good, tan or taupe color, but super glittery.</li>
            <li> This is a great little product for a fantastic price .</li>
            <li> I decided to give this makeup a chance after using a friend&#x27;s Bare Minerals makeup and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> DELIVERY WAS QUICK</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair skinned, I have yet to find someone more pale than me and makeups have always had an orange tint on me until i found iq naturals.</li>
            <li> Excellent, true to the description it is an even, long lasting product.</li>
            <li> The other Fair is so light</li>
            <li> than BE&#x27;s new foundation), I do like the IQ&#x27;s all over face color better than BE</li>
            <li> The foundation colors actually blend and adjust to your own skin tone, the coverage is exceptional, it actually covered my freckles without having to put layer upon layer of the foundation, which often times leads to a \\&quot;cakey\\</li>
            <li> The rest of the make up was very soft, just make sure to use a primer before applying so it doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li> Soft, light, easy.</li>
            <li> u look more like a old lady who caked on makeup.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> For once I can put make up on my whole face and love how natural and smooth it looks while still providing coverage.</li>
            <li> I could probably buy the same set at Walmart, honestly.</li>
            <li> I would say that the color is more true to my skin tone than Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It would be nice however if they added a bag for the actual mineral powders.</li>
            <li> I only really liked the eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s affordable and all natural.</li>
            <li> So far they love it.</li>
            <li> The brushes were of surprisingly good quality; though not top of the line they held together well and don&#x27;t shed the way cheap brushes do.</li>
            <li> I am overall happy with the purchase, but I think BE is a bit better quality, the foundation goes on a little &#x27;nicer&#x27; and &#x27;smoother&#x27; than IQ</li>
            <li> I would remove half a star because the way it is packaged more of the mineral comes out into the top of the container when I am traveling.  </li>
            <li> It covers better than bare minerals in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The second lightest powder provides a nice, even coverage while being comfortable and nearly invisible.</li>
            <li> This makeup works better than bare minerals in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The products are smaller than if you purchased them individually, but this is great for anyone looking to test out mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the make up, but the brushes seemed pretty cheap, as expected.</li>
            <li> The makeup brush kit is decent, nothing special...</li>
            <li> The foundation is fantastic for those, like me, who have experienced burning, itching, swelling, and hives from those other so-called \\&quot;au natural\\&quot;  mineral makeup, especially those that advertise that they are specifically and specially formulated for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only drawbacks are that the brushes aren&#x27;t the best quality, though certainly usable, and all of the makeup is messy.</li>
            <li> But the makeup itself works pretty well --</li>
            <li> So using it for the first time</li>
            <li> When I found this I was pretty hesitant, tons of companies trying to pass off an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; product as God-sent.</li>
            <li> However, I did want to be able to use it and not look like I was a middle schooler first learning how to put it on.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li> IT WAS MY FIRST TIME TRYING IT.  </li>
            <li> I cannot get used to it, this is my first experience with mineral products</li>
            <li> No fake smells, or shiny sparkles (except in the eyeshadow).</li>
            <li> This was a first for me trying any type of mineral makeup</li>
            <li> It works ok for a back up plan.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s been okay, typically only using the foundation, blush or that face color stuff, veil and mascara....</li>
            <li> , PACKAGING WAS GOOD,  ONLY CONCERN WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY OPENING THE TINY &amp;#34;JARS&amp;#34; WITHOUT SPILLING.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly, isn&#x27;t quite as easy to use as Bare Escensuals, especially the setting veil and blusher.</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose this brand (besides the price) is that it contains no bismuth!</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t very high quality</li>
            <li> And a help full hint with the mineral veil- apply it to your brush and tap the end of your brush down, not hard but lightly, it kinda spreads it all over the brush and creates a more even look and helps with fallout, you can do this with the actual foundation too!</li>
            <li> The brushes work great and the makeup provided full coverage with only having to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Yes the colors match nice, but it seems to cake up in some areas no mater how little i apply.</li>
            <li> I ordered a mini sample kit, it was very inexpensive and the reviews were pretty decent.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit lighter, I found the BE \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; was a little much, but the IQ&#x27;s version is nice.  </li>
            <li> Thought it would be better for the price I spent</li>
            <li> Either way, the products were sticker sealed, so I was comfortable enough with that.</li>
            <li> The instructions show a much wider, rounder, fuller brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately it&#x27;s very matte- almost cakey.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and still had a problem with how it looked.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow doesn&#x27;t have much pigment</li>
            <li> It is everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> I  have to really work with it.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this makeup.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even really want to use them.</li>
            <li> The day after I used it, many of the red bumps on my checks were completely GONE.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a cheap replacement for my original product to try and save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I started using Bare Escentuals last September and fell in LOVE..</li>
            <li> This is why I will most likely buy a bare minerals brush to use with this makeup.</li>
            <li> but when I received the package, 2 were open ( both full sized powders)</li>
            <li> At 30 years old, this is the first make-up I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I like the bronzer and the coverup power, and the brushes are decent.</li>
            <li> But after some hormonal changes I&#x27;m breaking out like a sophomore in high school and had to do something about my complexion.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this makeup to anyone</li>
            <li> Got my IQ natural miners set!!</li>
            <li> love the brushes, and it even comes with a little pouch for carrying the brushes in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually ran out of the little concealer type powder, and just use the bigger powder for now, and it still covers pretty good.</li>
            <li> and I no longer breakout because of clogged pores because it&#x27;s so much lighter compare to my old choice of make up.</li>
            <li> I love this  product, it did not feel like I was wearing heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> all the products are normal size.</li>
            <li> IQ Natural is my new GO-TO mineral makeup and I am looking forward to purchasing IQ Natural makeup for my daughters and my mother!!!</li>
            <li> My first time ever using this kind of make up, I really like it minus the bronzer part because I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> so you know it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> This IQ Naturals foundation is my new Holy Grail.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a person who wears a lot, if any makeup, even on special occasions.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this kit, looks like I have 0-to very little makeup on</li>
            <li> Very comparable to bare minerals.</li>
            <li> I like this product as much as the Bare Minerals product.  </li>
            <li> The finishing spray is a necessity, but since I didn&#x27;t order it, I use a small bottle of water mixed with a bit of my favorite face moisturizer and voila: finishing spray!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the price, because it is so much cheaper than bare minerals.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look unnatural but a little pale so the next shade should suit me more with more coverage.  </li>
            <li> Made a huge glittery mess all over myself.</li>
            <li> The concealer is a little tricky to use though, you need to have a light touch when applying.</li>
            <li> Given the low price, it was a real surprise</li>
            <li> I saw IQ Natural on Amazon and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup user, and dont really use make up</li>
            <li> The powder looks natural and feels like you aren&#x27;t even wearing make up.</li>
            <li> The brushes were individually wrapped, so, that wasn&#x27;t too much of an issue.</li>
            <li> I did receive two foundations, but one was marked as &amp;</li>
            <li> I am just completely blown away.</li>
            <li> For having a natural look, I must suggest to use this makeup set.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and so far none of them have fallen out.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a makeup that&#x27;s all natural and affordable.</li>
            <li> The brush set is pretty cheap and not great quality but still for the money you&#x27;re spending</li>
            <li> The brushes are a little harsh however, but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I ended up putting it aside and going back to my normal brand.</li>
            <li> The brush pouch, however, was disappointing, rather cheaply made, we&#x27;re talking the everything&#x27;s a dollar stores cheap.</li>
            <li> My third purchase of this brand and plan to remain loyal customer!Brushes in this particular package not top of line , but get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Bare Minerals user for a while.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals products have an odor that stays on your brushes and your skin.</li>
            <li> Trust me bare minerals is what u want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to Bare Minerals so for the cost I thought I would try this product.</li>
            <li> it was a lot like the Bare Minerals brand, but cheaper.</li>
            <li> I suffer from rosacea and extremely sensitive skin, but this makeup causes no irritation and I think it is actually clearing my skin!!!!</li>
            <li> The make-up was nothing like bare mineral make-up.  </li>
            <li> I had bare minerals years ago(still</li>
            <li> I recommend IQ if your looking for a little less expensive alternative to some of the more popular brands of mineral</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend spending the extra money buying bare minerals.</li>
            <li> The only foundations tht dont cause me to breakout is physicians formula and bare minerals.</li>
            <li> It looks incredibly cheap when you open it up -- the cheesy red bag went straight into the trash, and there were a lot a lot of plastic baggies.  </li>
            <li> i should of updated this earlier but due to my sensitive skin this makeup caused me to break out and it also caused my sister to break out if u have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I admit I was hesitant to try this brand when it arrived; to my embarrassment, after applying the makeup, I did not experience the break outs or the unbearable burning sensations that other \\&quot;high end (overly priced)\\&quot; mineral makeup caused.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because the product is bad, just wasn&#x27;t as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> which could be a good or bad thing for others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is good and bad to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a clear plastic flap inside that is designed to lay over the brushes before the pouch is rolled and snapped closed.</li>
            <li> I then have to tap a little onto the included brush and pat it in the upside down cap to get the right amount on my brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly like bare minerals</li>
            <li> All other mineral makeup made my skin red and gave me blackheads, so I had low expectations for this . . .</li>
            <li> and So NOT natural...</li>
            <li> I guess I expected actual packaging.</li>
            <li> Because it is extremely &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; I looked like I haven&#x27;t seen the sun in my entire life!</li>
            <li> I have not used the original products which I felt were way to expensive, but my sister does use that product and felt my look was comparable to hers.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to wear mineral foundation so badly that I tried BE many times, only to find out</li>
            <li> and if your face is dry at all it will look like it is cracked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have used bare minerals before and it looked a little orange tinted on my face</li>
            <li> I got this instead of bare minerals, waste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little dry overall</li>
            <li> and I was shocked I could use this foundation without it drying my skin out even more.</li>
            <li> The colors were not as they were described and the brushes were too rough on my skin that I started breaking out.</li>
            <li> #34;Fair II&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m still not certain why.</li>
            <li> them comes the concealer and all the other stuff</li>
            <li> A little powder goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on prescription medication and laser treatments that have never lived up to the cost, and along comes this $20 makeup that accomplishes what none of that stuff has done?!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Using it regularly stopped breakouts, but I never really liked how it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> , it helps cover the dark circles underneath my eyes....</li>
            <li> The bronzer seems a bit dark for me, I&#x27;ve chosen not to use it because it gives my skin tone an orange hue.</li>
            <li> QUALITY OF COVERAGE WAS AVERAGE.  </li>
            <li> I had understood the description to mean I would get two containers of the same.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the name brand mineral makeup for less money.</li>
            <li> The products arrived in a zip lock sandwich bag, which I found odd.</li>
            <li> The only thing I still use is the eye shimmer because it is subtle and goes with everything.</li>
            <li> I had paid half price at the time</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> omg what if it doesn&#x27;t work, meaning not covering the little blemishes I have</li>
            <li> but I lighten it a little with the foundation.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with the brushes is that there isn&#x27;t one included that looks like the one used for application in the little instruction pamphlet I received with the kit.</li>
            <li> I use aloe and a little coconut oil for primer and shop the finishing spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little yellow-ish orange-ish, tint though.</li>
            <li> The darker of the two works for me if I add a little of the Warmth to it.  </li>
            <li> Do  not like, does not cover well Waste of money,</li>
            <li> and it was missing the concealer</li>
            <li> I used my own brushes because the onea it came with were horrible.</li>
            <li> Not something I would use for everyday wear...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge make-up user</li>
            <li> I used bare minerals for a while but was not impressed with the coverage.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the point of the &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; is, but I use it.</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> Not very good coverage</li>
            <li> Brushes were hard amd hurt my face.</li>
            <li> The brushes are awful cheap and a lot of bristles came out and broke off.</li>
            <li> Not really thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a lot of negative reviews about the brush set, but I have not noticed any problems with it.</li>
            <li> It is thick and doesn&#x27;t spread evenly,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not touching it again!</li>
            <li> I have horrible bags under my eyes and it covers it right up!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes except for the eyeshadow brush are not good.</li>
            <li> The concealer is not good.</li>
            <li> just as heavy, dirty, greesy feeling.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the brushes as that was the main reason I ordered the product for.</li>
            <li> I have been using Almay&#x27;s smart shade light/medium foundation for years and decided to buy this in the fair/fair 2 because the medium shades always look horrible on me, like I put on a fake tan.  </li>
            <li> I gave these cosmetics a try, no good!</li>
            <li> But I was wrong...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not all that flashy, so</li>
            <li> My disappointment is that it did not come with the brushes shown.</li>
            <li> The brush shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> That is crazy!</li>
            <li> I hate make up.</li>
            <li> this stuff is crap...</li>
            <li> and I always HATED how they made my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to this shipment.</li>
            <li> It was a horrible buy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this makeup!!! The brushes work great and the makeup provided full coverage with only having to use a very small amount. This is now my make up of choice!</li>
            <li> I gave these cosmetics a try, no good! It does not go on smoothly no matter how much I tried.  This product goes on in clumps!  WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> Just as good or better than bare minerals.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the colors</li>
            <li> Given the low price, it was a real surprise how much I liked this kit.  It looks incredibly cheap when you open it up -- the cheesy red bag went straight into the trash, and there were a lot a lot of plastic baggies.  But the makeup itself works pretty well -- I like the bronzer and the coverup power, and the brushes are decent.</li>
            <li> Great kit for the buck!  Has the foundation, brushes, and makeup case for travel!  Go for it!</li>
            <li> good stuff, great price on a set plus brushes.  feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this make-up. My favorite part about this was the eyeshadow. But over all loved everything!</li>
            <li> Great  Product . I love this make up so I bought this kit for my friend for her birthday, 64th. She loves it! We couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Her hubby loves it when she wears it. Great score!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have sensitive skin, but this powder is light and gives you a nice and healthy glow. It looks very natural as well. It blends easily and is not cakey in the slightest. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Do  not like, does not cover well Waste of money, wish I could get it back</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this but when I received the package, 2 were open ( both full sized powders) and it was missing the concealer, only the setting powder had the sticker on it so you know it&#x27;s new. The brushes are awful cheap and a lot of bristles came out and broke off. I am so disappointed. It was a horrible buy.</li>
            <li> Not really thrilled.  Yes the colors match nice, but it seems to cake up in some areas no mater how little i apply.</li>
            <li> Product is great. Works as well as the name brand mineral makeup for less money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 40 now and over liquid foundation. I&#x27;ve been a Bare Minerals user for a while. Using it regularly stopped breakouts, but I never really liked how it felt on my skin. Bare Minerals products have an odor that stays on your brushes and your skin. I saw IQ Natural on Amazon and decided to give it a try. BIG difference. HUGE difference. In the way it feels on my skin, the weightless, flawless coverage, even in sunlight, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything! Included brushes were nice too. I&#x27;d buy IQ again and again.</li>
            <li> Got my IQ natural miners set!! I&#x27;m not a big makeup user, and dont really use make up what so ever..only because when you put a liquid foundation you also use a second layer of the powder them comes the concealer and all the other stuff so my point is....it looks so caked on and So NOT natural... So using it for the first time I was like omg what if it doesn&#x27;t work, meaning not covering the little blemishes I have.... But I was wrong... It looks so beautiful and natural and the concealer is so wonderful and awesome, it helps cover the dark circles underneath my eyes.... Would absolutely buy again and recommend to friends and family!!!,😁</li>
            <li> I was really looking for a nice mineral makeup because I felt like sporting a more natural look. When I found this I was pretty hesitant, tons of companies trying to pass off an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; product as God-sent. But I was so impressed by this makeup, it goes on wonderfully and stays on all day. Now like everything it has its flaws, it settles into lines and creases but every makeup does that over time.  Also its kinda cakey in sweaty situations.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this!</li>
            <li> Sucks. I got this instead of bare minerals, waste. It is thick and doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, u look more like a old lady who caked on makeup. Trust me bare minerals is what u want.</li>
            <li> Great value for the quality of the products!</li>
            <li> Soft, light, easy. Worth it. Very comparable to bare minerals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to Bare Minerals so for the cost I thought I would try this product. I used my own brushes because the onea it came with were horrible. The powder didn&#x27;t glide on, it just stuck where ever I put the brush. However the eye shadow went all over my face. I threw it all away.</li>
            <li> The quality of both the make-up and brushes are so below par that I am recommending going to Walmart for your make up as an alternative.  I am used to using mineral make-up, but needed an inexpensive option at the moment.  IQ had good reviews so I took a chance.  I am guessing that those who wrote favorable reviews have not had better quality to compare this make-up  too.</li>
            <li> This was shipped very, very FAST!!! So I was very pleased with that!!! I have only used the makeup one time. I purchased it in &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; but, I should have gotten it in the next color up. Because it is extremely &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; I looked like I haven&#x27;t seen the sun in my entire life! It made me so white!!! And like some others have posted,  it does have that baby powder feel to it. But, I&#x27;m still going to give it another shot!!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff- it&#x27;s inexpensive and covers so well. I feel like my face is flawless without feeling cakey or looking like I&#x27;m wearing too much. It doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup it just looks like you have naturally beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;The bronzer is a bit darker but I lighten it a little with the foundation. I have had people at work compliment my sunkissed glow. I definitely recommend this product. The brush set is pretty cheap and not great quality but still for the money you&#x27;re spending it&#x27;s a great deal. ❤️</li>
            <li> I Love this product.  It covers imperfections it&#x27;s light and airy, the colors matched my skin tone which is very light perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a person who wears a lot, if any makeup, even on special occasions. However, I did want to be able to use it and not look like I was a middle schooler first learning how to put it on. I&#x27;ve tried out various liquid foundations and I always HATED how they made my skin look and feel. I decided to go the mineral route, because it is supposedly lighter feeling and looking while still providing plenty of coverage. I am happy to say that I LOVE it! For once I can put make up on my whole face and love how natural and smooth it looks while still providing coverage. Pair this kit with a good moisturizer and primer and you are set! The brushes aren&#x27;t the best but I had already bought myself a really nice brush set so that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Especially for people who either don&#x27;t like to wear make up or those you don&#x27;t wear a lot. The powder looks natural and feels like you aren&#x27;t even wearing make up. It covers better than bare minerals in my opinion. Make sure not to apply too much powder or it will be visible to others that you are wearing a lot of make up. A little powder goes a long way! Would definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Thought it would be better for the price I spent</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was a lot like the Bare Minerals brand, but cheaper. Overall, I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied. The product arrived as seen in the photo. I am a redhead, thus I go the fair kit. The products arrived in a zip lock sandwich bag, which I found odd. I guess I expected actual packaging. Either way, the products were sticker sealed, so I was comfortable enough with that. The makeup brush kit is decent, nothing special...I could probably buy the same set at Walmart, honestly. The brush pouch, however, was disappointing, rather cheaply made, we&#x27;re talking the everything&#x27;s a dollar stores cheap. There&#x27;s a clear plastic flap inside that is designed to lay over the brushes before the pouch is rolled and snapped closed. This flap on mine was bent (folded over andcreased), and had obviously been that way for a while. It was a struggle to get that to lay properly. The brushes were individually wrapped, so, that wasn&#x27;t too much of an issue. My biggest problem with the brushes is that there isn&#x27;t one included that looks like the one used for application in the little instruction pamphlet I received with the kit. The instructions show a much wider, rounder, fuller brush. As far as the make-up itself, the coverage is okay, not as good as what I&#x27;d hoped for, I don&#x27;t know if the brush size contributes to poorer coverage. Within a couple of hours, my face felt like I had regular foundation on...just as heavy, dirty, greesy feeling. I did receive two foundations, but one was marked as &amp;#34;Fair II&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m still not certain why. I had understood the description to mean I would get two containers of the same. The bronzer seems a bit dark for me, I&#x27;ve chosen not to use it because it gives my skin tone an orange hue. Not cool. And, lastly, the eyeshadow was a good, tan or taupe color, but super glittery. Not something I would use for everyday wear...this stuff is like going to the club, kind of sparkly. I&#x27;m not all that flashy, so I doubt I&#x27;d ever use the shadow. I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because the product is bad, just wasn&#x27;t as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> IT WAS MY FIRST TIME TRYING IT.  DELIVERY WAS QUICK, PACKAGING WAS GOOD,  ONLY CONCERN WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY OPENING THE TINY &amp;#34;JARS&amp;#34; WITHOUT SPILLING.  QUALITY OF COVERAGE WAS AVERAGE.  BUT  REGARDING THE  COST OF THE KIT, I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS.</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing and the mineral powder is too!  I would totally recommend this makeup kit !</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time, in a beautiful package.  However, it looks hideous when applied.  I cannot get used to it, this is my first experience with mineral products and I&#x27;m not touching it again! The white powder makes me look like a clown. It does not blend well and it looks anything BUT &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34; This is not for everyone, obviously.</li>
            <li> I hate make up. Haven&#x27;t worn it in a decade. But after some hormonal changes I&#x27;m breaking out like a sophomore in high school and had to do something about my complexion. This make up has been perfect. Incredibly light. Not noticeable at all. I&#x27;ve been wearing it a couple of weeks, my acne is covered well, my confidence is up, it hasn&#x27;t increased my break outs, and no one has noticed I&#x27;ve started to wear make up. I&#x27;m fair skinned, freckled, with blue eyes. Still, the second lightest worked for me. I haven&#x27;t used the eye shadow or blush. The bisque is a flawless concealer, great for hiding redness. The second lightest powder provides a nice, even coverage while being comfortable and nearly invisible. I&#x27;m not sure what the point of the &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; is, but I use it. It may be the reason the make up lasts a good ten hours, but I haven&#x27;t tried it without it so I can&#x27;t be sure. The only drawbacks are that the brushes aren&#x27;t the best quality, though certainly usable, and all of the makeup is messy. Very messy. However, for the price and quality, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I suffer from rosacea and extremely sensitive skin, but this makeup causes no irritation and I think it is actually clearing my skin!!!! The day after I used it, many of the red bumps on my checks were completely GONE. That is crazy! I have spent hundreds of dollars on prescription medication and laser treatments that have never lived up to the cost, and along comes this $20 makeup that accomplishes what none of that stuff has done?! I&#x27;m just floored. All other mineral makeup made my skin red and gave me blackheads, so I had low expectations for this . . . I am just completely blown away. It&#x27;s not froofy at all. No fake smells, or shiny sparkles (except in the eyeshadow). It&#x27;s like the salt of the earth. And it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I like this product as much as the Bare Minerals product.  I would say that the color is more true to my skin tone than Bare Minerals.  My disappointment is that it did not come with the brushes shown.</li>
            <li> This is a great little product for a fantastic price . Easy to apply and had great staying power even in the humidity. The concealer is a little tricky to use though, you need to have a light touch when applying. I love love love the eyeshadow !</li>
            <li> What a great makeup kit! This kit includes a concealer, bronzer, eye shadow, setting powder, 2 shades of mineral foundation, and a brush set.  This was a first for me trying any type of mineral makeup and I have to say I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any lines or look cracked.  It is light and feels great on.  It feels like I am not wearing any foundation, unlike a liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I love the brushes, and it even comes with a little pouch for carrying the brushes in.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great for what you get! I recommend IQ if your looking for a little less expensive alternative to some of the more popular brands of mineral makeup.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend well on skin. Brushes were hard amd hurt my face. They were cheaply made. I will never buy this makeup again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Almay&#x27;s smart shade light/medium foundation for years and decided to buy this in the fair/fair 2 because the medium shades always look horrible on me, like I put on a fake tan.  For the fair, the coverage was okay, I didn&#x27;t look unnatural but a little pale so the next shade should suit me more with more coverage.  Not impressed with the brushes, at least the two bigger brushes so definitely looking to replace these as they might be a reason why the coverage was not as great as it could have been. I also feel that this mineral makeup is good for my skin, I am acne prone and already I see and feel a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> I gave this makeup five stars for coverage and overall quality. It is well worth the price. I have not used the original products which I felt were way to expensive, but my sister does use that product and felt my look was comparable to hers. I would remove half a star because the way it is packaged more of the mineral comes out into the top of the container when I am traveling.  I then have to tap a little onto the included brush and pat it in the upside down cap to get the right amount on my brush. Still I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> My first time ever using this kind of make up, I really like it minus the bronzer part because I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;ll have to look up some makeup vids. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife and she loved it. It has twelve kits and it creates a great look after using it. The light fair shade is awesome. The concealer, bronzer, eye shadow, setting powder, two full size mineral foundation - all the kits are too good. For having a natural look, I must suggest to use this makeup set.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. I don&#x27;t feel it blends as well as BM but s&lt;br /&gt;Covers just as well. I do LOVE the eyeshadow in tan that came with this kit! Great shimmer and great blending!</li>
            <li> Excellent, true to the description it is an even, long lasting product. Will definitely be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a cheap replacement for my original product to try and save a few bucks. you get what you pay for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend spending the extra money buying bare minerals. this stuff is crap...</li>
            <li> At 30 years old, this is the first make-up I have ever tried. I fell in love with it! The finishing spray is a necessity, but since I didn&#x27;t order it, I use a small bottle of water mixed with a bit of my favorite face moisturizer and voila: finishing spray! It smooths it out and makes it look flawless. The brushes are great and the whole kit is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> excellent makeup - almost as good as bare minerals.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bareminerals replacement. This kit was OK and didn&#x27;t contain bismuth which I thought might be better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it&#x27;s very matte- almost cakey. There is no &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; like bareminerals original (probably because it contains no bismuth). I also wasn&#x27;t a fan of the texture and extra matte-ness from the mineral finishing powder. I have very oily skin and still had a problem with how it looked. It&#x27;s even more matte/cakey then bareminerals matte collection. However the color match is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more pigmented I think then bareminerals- which could be a good or bad thing for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes included were of very low quality. I gave them to my daughter to play with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up putting it aside and going back to my normal brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this make up. The eye shadow doesn&#x27;t have much pigment so it&#x27;s pretty useless. Love the bronzer and have used that for eyeshadow. The brushes were ok but I ended up using my own kabuki for the powder. The instructions call for primer and finishing spray which aren&#x27;t included. I use aloe and a little coconut oil for primer and shop the finishing spray. The make up stays on for the duration. For the cost this is a great makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this  product, it did not feel like I was wearing heavy makeup. I will be interested in ordering more of your line.</li>
            <li> It is a great deal for the money. It would be nice however if they added a bag for the actual mineral powders. The back shown is just for the brushes.</li>
            <li> Not very good coverage</li>
            <li> The make-up was nothing like bare mineral make-up.  The brushes had a plastic and glue smell. These products were unusable.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the price, because it is so much cheaper than bare minerals.  It is ok but does not go on as nice as bare minerals products.</li>
            <li> It is everything I expected and more. The brushes look to be as good as my original brushes...time will tell...all the products are normal size. A ziplock bag to keep everything in and this will stay in my purse so I will never be caught without makeup again!</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY known mineral makeup on the market, none remotely as good as this product. The foundation is fantastic for those, like me, who have experienced burning, itching, swelling, and hives from those other so-called \\&quot;au natural\\&quot;  mineral makeup, especially those that advertise that they are specifically and specially formulated for sensitive skin. The foundation colors actually blend and adjust to your own skin tone, the coverage is exceptional, it actually covered my freckles without having to put layer upon layer of the foundation, which often times leads to a \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; look. I admit I was hesitant to try this brand when it arrived; to my embarrassment, after applying the makeup, I did not experience the break outs or the unbearable burning sensations that other \\&quot;high end (overly priced)\\&quot; mineral makeup caused. IQ Natural is my new GO-TO mineral makeup and I am looking forward to purchasing IQ Natural makeup for my daughters and my mother!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this kit, looks like I have 0-to very little makeup on and I no longer breakout because of clogged pores because it&#x27;s so much lighter compare to my old choice of make up.</li>
            <li> Upon applying the powder foundation, it seems to have alot of mineral(talc)that seems to goes everywhere.  Maybe it&#x27;s a case of you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve had experience with bareminerals with better success.</li>
            <li> It works ok for a back up plan. Or if you have a good skin moisturizer. But, by it self it does not blend well at all. I  have to really work with it. It will stay caked up and if your face is dry at all it will look like it is cracked. I only really liked the eyeshadow. The brush shed like crazy. I will not by again. Gave a star for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product, especially for the price. The brushes were of surprisingly good quality; though not top of the line they held together well and don&#x27;t shed the way cheap brushes do. The product was fantastic, the kind of makeup that you can&#x27;t even feel on your skin after it&#x27;s applied. The foundations provide light coverage that lets your skin breathe, and if you want it slightly more opaque a face primer makes all the difference. Overall, would buy again</li>
            <li> I started using Bare Escentuals last September and fell in LOVE..it was one of those true \\&quot;TA DA\\&quot; moments..I went to a retailer and had a mini makeover and was very impressed, however, my purse...not so much but all in all I decided to succumb to buying their products nonetheless....I&#x27;m not a huge make-up user so it&#x27;s been okay, typically only using the foundation, blush or that face color stuff, veil and mascara....no fuss no muss.  I discovered IQ here when searching for BE replacements. I ordered a mini sample kit, it was very inexpensive and the reviews were pretty decent.  I am overall happy with the purchase, but I think BE is a bit better quality, the foundation goes on a little &#x27;nicer&#x27; and &#x27;smoother&#x27; than IQ (I just ordered the &#x27;original&#x27; BE foundation which is much more like IQ than BE&#x27;s new foundation), I do like the IQ&#x27;s all over face color better than BE, it&#x27;s a bit lighter, I found the BE \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; was a little much, but the IQ&#x27;s version is nice.  So I would continue to buy both brands, I&#x27;ll probably stick with BE&#x27;s foundation and the mineral veil, but use the IQ&#x27;s colors. I am a fair for BE and ordered the same in IQ, which is a bit lighter, but it&#x27;s not a huge issue unless you are more of a fair toward medium...may be too light for ya.&lt;br /&gt;I think the mini kit is a good investment for any of the women (and maybe some men) looking into mineral makeup without having to commit :)</li>
            <li> I love this makeup!!!! I am extremely fair skinned, I have yet to find someone more pale than me and makeups have always had an orange tint on me until i found iq naturals. I have used bare minerals before and it looked a little orange tinted on my face, i was on amazon one day when i came accross this makeup set and decided to try it, other reviews said to order one shade darker because it runs light but with how fair my skin is i stuck with the fair which makes my face look awesome!!!! I reccomend this to everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: i should of updated this earlier but due to my sensitive skin this makeup caused me to break out and it also caused my sister to break out if u have sensitive skin do not use. The only foundations tht dont cause me to breakout is physicians formula and bare minerals. I still give three stars though because it still covered well and it didnt make me hav an orange tint just i cant use it because of the breakouts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly, isn&#x27;t quite as easy to use as Bare Escensuals, especially the setting veil and blusher. However it provides good coverage and for the price I think is a good value and works well.</li>
            <li> The makeup was not shipped. Only the brushes. Had to send it back, and didn&#x27;t even try to order again.</li>
            <li> just fine; ok color for me; love the veil. brushes are great to have in my make-up drawer. nice product.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this makeup a chance after using a friend&#x27;s Bare Minerals makeup and I absolutely love it! It looks great, lasts all day and it feels so natural that it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I am wearing anything. There seems to be a lot of negative reviews about the brush set, but I have not noticed any problems with it. The bristles are soft and so far none of them have fallen out.  I would highly recommend this makeup to anyone and I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> This makeup works better than bare minerals in my opinion. The brushes are a little harsh however, but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> Really awesome mineral makeup!!! But when it came in the mail, the eye shadow was all over the place inside the bag. Made a huge glittery mess all over myself. Brushes aren&#x27;t that great, but they were a bonus.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this makeup. I just wish the brushes were better for blending the mineral powder into your skin. This is why I will most likely buy a bare minerals brush to use with this makeup. The makeup does work good for coverage. I actually ran out of the little concealer type powder, and just use the bigger powder for now, and it still covers pretty good. It&#x27;s a little yellow-ish orange-ish, tint though.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to this shipment.The colors were not as they were described and the brushes were too rough on my skin that I started breaking out. The only thing I still use is the eye shimmer because it is subtle and goes with everything.</li>
            <li> Ordered this make up as a back up for travelling and I like the makeup it&#x27;s self well enough. The brushes aren&#x27;t very high quality and I don&#x27;t even really want to use them. Hence, I&#x27;m planning on giving them to a niece or someone just starting to use make up. I&#x27;d say buy the makeup but skip the brush kit.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage when I use my professional grade brushes. Very impressed after first application, will follow up in a week or so.</li>
            <li> This is perfect.  I had bare minerals years ago(still have some of the warmth actually) and loved it.  I had paid half price at the time but now it&#x27;s more expensive and I found this.  It&#x27;s not exactly like bare minerals but it&#x27;s really good.  It covers well and feels like I am wearing nothing at all.  The brushes aren&#x27;t the best but I have others(most women have more than a few brushes lol).  I love that it&#x27;s affordable and all natural.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters received these in their &amp;#34;stocking&amp;#34;.  Its a great starter kit.  They can determine if they like it before making further purchases.  So far they love it.</li>
            <li> The products are smaller than if you purchased them individually, but this is great for anyone looking to test out mineral makeup. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters. They love it and say it&#x27;s the best foundation they&#x27;ve ever used. will buy again.</li>
            <li> 4.5 stars, organic based product that delivers quality  coverage. My third purchase of this brand and plan to remain loyal customer!Brushes in this particular package not top of line , but get the job done. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Great for sensitive skin. And a help full hint with the mineral veil- apply it to your brush and tap the end of your brush down, not hard but lightly, it kinda spreads it all over the brush and creates a more even look and helps with fallout, you can do this with the actual foundation too! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> There is good and bad to say.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes except for the eyeshadow brush are not good. You&#x27;ll need better brushes. The concealer is not good. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t spread nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The good things are the brush case is great. The foundations are awesome and the finishing powder is really really good. As well as the bronzer and eyeshadow is good as well.&lt;br /&gt;The paper said it came with a primer which it did not.</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose this brand (besides the price) is that it contains no bismuth! I had wanted to wear mineral foundation so badly that I tried BE many times, only to find out I had an allergy to the bismuth. This IQ Naturals foundation is my new Holy Grail. It covers my hyper-pigmentation and stays on all day. Covers well and doesn&#x27;t look cakey. I use Laura Geller&#x27;s Spackle as my primer. I didn&#x27;t care for the brushes in this kit as well as the eye shadow has too much sparkle, but the rest of the kit is wonderful and well worth the $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, though, is if you are anything but porcelain, go with the medium. I ordered fair, and you get 2 shades of fair. The darker of the two works for me if I add a little of the Warmth to it.  The other Fair is so light I hope it works for me this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have dry skin and I was shocked I could use this foundation without it drying my skin out even more.</li>
            <li> I have used the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; big name mineral make up and this is comparable.  It covers well, is a great  value and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I used bare minerals for a while but was not impressed with the coverage. I wanted a makeup that&#x27;s all natural and affordable. I love it. I use it all the time over my smashbox cc creams (also fab). I love the color of the blush and the eyeshadow. Will keep purchasing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little dry overall it&#x27;s very good</li>
            <li> While the bisque has ok coverage, the rest just sits on top of your skin and doesn&#x27;t really blend or hide anything.</li>
            <li> I did not recieve the case or brushes with this order so needed to return it.  I was very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the brushes as that was the main reason I ordered the product for.</li>
            <li> Great item! Wonderful transaction! WOrks wonders on my skin!</li>
            <li> I love the make up, but the brushes seemed pretty cheap, as expected. I have to say though, this has the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!) I have horrible bags under my eyes and it covers it right up! The rest of the make up was very soft, just make sure to use a primer before applying so it doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
