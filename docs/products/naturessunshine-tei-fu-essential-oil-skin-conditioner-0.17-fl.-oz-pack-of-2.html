            <li> Tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love to use this stuff at night under my nose without having a cold because it relaxes me.  </li>
            <li> A long time ago I went to a health food store and was doing some shopping and had a splitting headache</li>
            <li> I even put some on my palms and cup over my eyes (not directly on or in my eyes) until my eyes water for dry or itchy eyes.</li>
            <li> However, if you want instant relief that doesn&#x27;t require a corticosteroid, allergy shots, decongestants, or other drugs, this can be an effect and inexpensive option.</li>
            <li> Try putting it on the back of one of your hands, then compare it to the other.</li>
            <li> I sprinkle on my sheets when slipping into bed at night.  </li>
            <li> You can put a dab on each cheek to relieve pressure, but be careful not to get this stuff in your eyes; it burns like hell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a reaction or problem with this oil; however, I never put it all over my face, but rather only on a few small, specific pressure</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and when I have a painful sinus headache I dab it on my temples and on my sinuses and in front of my ears and lay down</li>
            <li> I use it for clogged sinuses, bug bites and other skin irritations, sore or irritated throat, hang nails, and on-and-on.</li>
            <li> hmm bottles to small, this solution is based on parafin Liquid mixed witl etherical Oils.  </li>
            <li> When you get down to it</li>
            <li> whatever the reason it works extremely well!</li>
            <li> We decided to buy her one and like a miracle they appear way less often or with less strength she called us from Mexico to thank us</li>
            <li> but with less intensity so she doesn&#x27;t burst out crying with pain.</li>
            <li> I walked out of the store with this little bottle of oil .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just rub a little bit under your nose</li>
            <li> and you can breath a little easier.  </li>
            <li> This little bottle is kept with me at all times.</li>
            <li> I probably can&#x27;t convey to you how essential it is to us to have this little bottle near by for coughs, cuts, burns, toothaches, headaches, bad breath, difficulty breathing, indigestion, itching, and a zillion other things!  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it works.</li>
            <li> It helps with minor skin problems, like bug bites and blind pimples.  </li>
            <li> Hard to believe</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I could get it on-line and have had to look for distributors in the past (like Avon and MaryKay!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not blind from getting it in mine, but it&#x27;s a miserable experience.  </li>
            <li> ; (kitchen table/across the back fence tests, not in a scientific way) and found it works for about 6-8 hours on the worst neurological pain, and works when nothing else does, even narcotic pain meds.  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple of days but it will make a blind pimple leave sooner.  </li>
            <li> My wife suffers from fibro and has connective tissue problems.</li>
            <li> It can be a lifesaver whenever you get a cold.  </li>
            <li> If you have a bad cold, or your head is stuffed up...</li>
            <li> Some people hate those smells</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 15 years.  It&#x27;s a menthol type oil that&#x27;s very strong and helps to relieve sinus pressure when I have a headache and helps relieve muscle stress.  It has a strong menthol smell and a little goes a long, long way.  I didn&#x27;t know I could get it on-line and have had to look for distributors in the past (like Avon and MaryKay!) Finally it&#x27;s easy to purchase.  Caution:  Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes, it burns!</li>
            <li> A super product for folks and their children that have stuffy noses.  Just a drop on a persons upper lip beneath the nose works like magic.</li>
            <li> My aunt LOVES this, we are very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5 years now. Helps with headaches, aches and pains, nasal congestion and others. I keep a bottle in my pocket everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> A long time ago I went to a health food store and was doing some shopping and had a splitting headache, the lady seen I was in distress and she motioned for me to come with her. She asked if she could apply this oil. She put it in the spot that was throbbing and within a few minutes the headache was mostly gone ( It will make it tolerable if it doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely) I was sold. I walked out of the store with this little bottle of oil .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This was years ago. I was getting really low and was wondering if I could get more, I searched Amazon and found this. Same oil. It is very concentrated, goes a long way. It is one of those things I always keep in my purse for emergencies. It is also good to clear your nasal passages. I never want to be out of this oil.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my aunt who has several sicknesses among them diabetes, glaucoma and a brain tumor because of these she would get major headaches that would burst out in tears last time i visited her she got one of those headaches which was really heart braking. We decided to buy her one and like a miracle they appear way less often or with less strength she called us from Mexico to thank us she still gets them but with less intensity so she doesn&#x27;t burst out crying with pain. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> GREAT PURCHASE FOR THE PRICE. BEST VALUE FOR THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY. WILL RECOMMEND THIS PURCHASE TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for quite some time. When I have a headeache, I rub it into my temples or wherever it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;Keep it away from eyes.  I&#x27;ve used it on my chin  for aches and for tooth problems</li>
            <li> Great for bug bites. Tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Agree with others, this is great!  We&#x27;ve actually &amp;#34;tested it&amp;#34; (kitchen table/across the back fence tests, not in a scientific way) and found it works for about 6-8 hours on the worst neurological pain, and works when nothing else does, even narcotic pain meds.  It appears to be less effective for arthritic type pain though.  It beats out lavender oil for the level of muscle pain relief and duration (lavender provides maybe 4 hours relief).  Since some folks use coconut oil, lavender oil and/or the Tei-Fu oil for various reasons, we&#x27;ve made our own mix of the three.  We used approx. 1/2 cup coconut oil, 2 T. lavender, and 20 drops of Tei-Fu oil.  It works wonders.  Love the Tei-Fu oil!!</li>
            <li> A friend at work told me about this oil and she let me try hers.  It really works for headaches and minor muscle aches.  It was delivered promptly and was the best deal I could find.</li>
            <li> Love tei fu oil. I use it for clogged sinuses, bug bites and other skin irritations, sore or irritated throat, hang nails, and on-and-on. I even put some on my palms and cup over my eyes (not directly on or in my eyes) until my eyes water for dry or itchy eyes. I recommend it to others regularly and make sure I&#x27;m never without. As always, service was quick.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from fibro and has connective tissue problems. She has a lot of pain and typically only gets relief from hot water. We have tried a LOT of oils, balms, salves, etc., nothing has relieved her pain like the Tei Fu Essential Oil</li>
            <li> hmm bottles to small, this solution is based on parafin Liquid mixed witl etherical Oils.  etherical Oils mixed With spiritous 96% is better. But I cat find in internet.  My accupuncture doctor back from 3 moths holiday next monday, I can buy from her  She import from Singapore. Before 8 years ago I go apotek, and they mix for me  0.5 liters 90$ hahah. But this apotek no longer exist hmf ok.My oil was forbidden cos fascistic  Health care system in norway</li>
            <li> Sprinkle this around you anytime you want to calm yourself and pretend you are at the spa.  I sprinkle on my sheets when slipping into bed at night.  Ahhhhhhh.</li>
            <li> My family love this oil.  If you have a bad cold, or your head is stuffed up...one drop under your nose will instantly clear up your nose.&lt;br /&gt;We have even put a drop on the baby bottle when they were stuffed up.  Not on their nose.  It works wonders.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it! Good for headaches, sore muscles etc. I will always have this in my house. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;When headache meds aren&#x27;t keeping up with pain, this is an amazing pain reliever</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and when I have a painful sinus headache I dab it on my temples and on my sinuses and in front of my ears and lay down and my headache goes away!  Hard to believe but it works!  Just keep it away from your eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many bottles of this wonderful oil I&#x27;ve purchased, but it certainly is a magnificent product.  I&#x27;ve introduced many others to it as well...all loved it too. I use it from sores on my mouth/lips to ingrown toenails to using it on my temples and around my nose for sinus issues.  It&#x27;s wonderful! I&#x27;d rate it 10 stars if you had them.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I probably can&#x27;t convey to you how essential it is to us to have this little bottle near by for coughs, cuts, burns, toothaches, headaches, bad breath, difficulty breathing, indigestion, itching, and a zillion other things!  When you get down to it I guess it increases blood flow and it&#x27;s the blood that heals, but whatever the reason it works extremely well!</li>
            <li> This is a great natural way to clear your sinuses &amp; get rid of a headache! A friend told me to use this on my frequent headaches &amp; it works great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for lots of things.  It can be a lifesaver whenever you get a cold.  Just rub a little bit under your nose and you can breath a little easier.  It is great for headaches as well; just rub a little on your forehead and both temples and it helps.  It helps with minor skin problems, like bug bites and blind pimples.  It takes a couple of days but it will make a blind pimple leave sooner.  Sometimes it will actually bring a pimple to a head faster too.  It is great for sinus pressure in your cheek bones.  You can put a dab on each cheek to relieve pressure, but be careful not to get this stuff in your eyes; it burns like hell.  Oh, it will make your eyes water just having it on your cheeks too, so you don&#x27;t want to use it while driving.  This stuff is powerful; one time I put some in a foam cup and put hot water into it so I could breath the vapors, but poof, the bottom of the cup was gone.  Don&#x27;t let that scare you, it won&#x27;t hurt your skin, just keep away from the eyes.  I&#x27;m not blind from getting it in mine, but it&#x27;s a miserable experience.  I love to use this stuff at night under my nose without having a cold because it relaxes me.  If you like the smell of muscle rub or vick&#x27;s vapor rub then you should like this tie fu.  Some people hate those smells and if you do then you won&#x27;t want any tie fu.  I personally love this stuff.  I do wish it was cheaper, but it just takes a dab, so it lasts forever anyhow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product locally at a spa for over a decade, ever since I had a sinus massage with it. It&#x27;s used on pressure points on the face. (You can do an internet search for images of sinus pressure points.) At home, I put a drop on my middle fingers, apply pressure and massage in a tiny circle. Sometimes, I just open the bottle and inhale or dab a drop beneath each nostril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, somewhat sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction or problem with this oil; however, I never put it all over my face, but rather only on a few small, specific pressure points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, if you have severe chronic sinusitis, this will not take the place of sinus or septum surgery; if you have acute sinusitis, this will not take the place of corticosteroids. However, if you want instant relief that doesn&#x27;t require a corticosteroid, allergy shots, decongestants, or other drugs, this can be an effect and inexpensive option.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so neat, I&#x27;m so glad I can finally buy it online. It&#x27;s an oil that doesn&#x27;t leave you oily. It makes your skin look rejuvenated short term, and wonderfully soft long term. Try putting it on the back of one of your hands, then compare it to the other. Remember Bruce Willis&#x27; hands in Death Becomes Her? Yeah, it&#x27;s that awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. Not sure how it works. All I know it that it works..</li>
            <li> This little bottle is kept with me at all times. It is a wonderful mixture that I use on myself for at least 100 things!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use when I am congested, when my allergies are bothering me or if I have a migraine and it always helps.</li>
    </ol>
