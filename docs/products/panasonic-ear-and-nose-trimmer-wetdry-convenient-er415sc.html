            <li>Good Product.  </li>
            <li>It is vastly superior.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>if you want a good nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is Good.</li>

            <li>Good item.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, for $10, you&#x27;ll get a good 2 or three years of use out of it before the plastic breaks.  </li>
            <li>Good for the money, you have to wiggle the battery cap to get it to work</li>
            <li>In all a good product.</li>
            <li>this trimmer works well and is priced fairly, also has a good design to it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some good reviews  and</li>
            <li>It does a good job</li>
            <li>This trimmer doesn&#x27;t do a good, or even passable, job of removing nose hair.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but I dropped it once, and since it has been showing issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Good for home use and travel.</li>
            <li>to use and rinse clean and another great product from Panasonic!</li>
            <li>as always when I&#x27;ve dealt with Amazon, they are true to their word for customer service and a product that I am very happy with...</li>
            <li>Good looking, very effective and what more is there to say.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, it&#x27;s a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Works great and the design is top notch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be great if Panasonic would send us another one for free!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product...  </li>
            <li>You can tell it is a well made product, I am very satisfied</li>

            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, and works great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very effective with nose hairs.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed by the functionality of this little product and for the money it has to be one of the best grooming deals on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a scissors for many years and this is vastly superior.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived promptly, as described and performs well with ALOT of nose hair - no pain, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent trimmer and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It uses batteries and isn&#x27;t rechargable which is kind of dissapointing</li>
            <li>It made a nice gift.</li>
            <li>The Er415SC is nice and you can do your ears and nose</li>
            <li>Good and cheap!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had good luck with nose/ear trimmers -- tried many brands including Norelco and Remington.</li>
            <li>Husband always used scissors, but after using this efficient and effective tool....</li>
            <li>so far,,pretty handy too.</li>
            <li>Great price, Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>excellent product, everything was very well received.</li>
            <li>Always liked this product.</li>
            <li>This is an effective grooming tool.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>Keep one handy always.  </li>
            <li>If I wanted that kind of pain I would pull them out myself.  </li>
            <li>and I now have my own,</li>
            <li>I have probably bought more than 3 of these and found them to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Great power and great hand held design highly recommend for the price value.</li>
            <li>My nostrils are clean and happy.</li>
            <li>Very good, very practical!</li>
            <li>works as good as any, better than most</li>
            <li>Changing batteries and cleaning is very easy.</li>
            <li>This is much more convenient and safe!</li>
            <li>this is by far the best thing i have brought</li>
            <li>This is the best one I have seen so far.  </li>
            <li>does a good job and is comfortable</li>
            <li>I have tried others this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price great product.</li>
            <li>as now after my changes, it is as good as the original.</li>
            <li>Very good product high quality.</li>
            <li>I have had many types of Nose/Ear trmmers over the years and this is by far the best I have ever used</li>
            <li>It works great and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good size, and cuts clean with no pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li>A great purchase for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a nose trimmer so nothing to compare it to, but it seems to be fine!</li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very important the mark Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>This is my second ear, nose trimmer and the better of the two, it comes with a cap to put on top when not in use, compact size, It works great for me, if you never owned one before its a lot easier and quicker than using scissors and tweezers, Great price too.</li>
            <li>This product is very, very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I just finished using it and the process was quick and the results look good.</li>
            <li>It does a fair job, but still needs a better head/cutter unit and could use one or two more batteries to keep it at full speed and for repeated uses.  </li>
            <li>one truly delivers....  Very good product for us old guys with nose and ear hair instead of head hair.</li>
            <li>I guess all this is to say I was very pleasantly surprised to find out that this Panasonic does a very good job.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve learned you can take the top off and then turn it on.</li>
            <li>, what more could you want from a trimmer?</li>
            <li>Does a good job and is worth the penny.</li>
            <li>Nice close comfortable cut.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic trimmer just does a better job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li>More power and options.</li>
            <li>You can twist the top off to wash it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for better results.</li>
            <li>An ok gadget that works as described.</li>
            <li>It will cost more to ship it than to buy a better one.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ER415SC Nose and Ear Trimmer, Silver[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Most trimmers do not work well.</li>
            <li>safe to us</li>
            <li>Interestingly Amazon has a no return policy for this product so I am struck with this piece of C&amp;^%.</li>
            <li>This is a much better product that the one I used to have.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Hank Williams cd that now I&#x27;m glad I bought it satisfied with both items.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Am well pleased</li>
            <li>people might be better off paying more for the one from sharper image...</li>
            <li>Researched many many models before I bought and got this model.</li>
            <li>No nicks or cuts, but I now even breath better after using it.</li>
            <li>All of us adults have nose hairs, and the more senior among us have it growing out of our ears as well.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Perfectly safe</li>
            <li>The 415SC trimmer worked OK for about a month but stopped working while I was travelling.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he is satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is wet/dry.</li>
            <li>It is better to expend more money for a better quality product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This item will do all it says and more.  </li>
            <li>Even though it didnt have the best overall reviews (just like all the rest i read about regardless of brand or model...</li>
            <li>But i take most all reviews with a grain of salt</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Even after that, it worked better than this model.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer and makes smooth cuts with no pulling of hairs.</li>
            <li>This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite grooming tool.  </li>
            <li>Love it i can breath much better now</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this, cheap!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely wonderful for cleaning out all those nasal hairs that threaten to turn into a second mustache.</li>
            <li>This model is in no way even close to the ER421, which costs about 6 dollars more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Definitely a safe way to remove nasal hair without the fear of injury.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap trimmer!</li>
            <li>This trimmer performs okay.  </li>
            <li>and I like the cap connected on the end as it makes for better handling.</li>
            <li>This is a great product really works well.</li>
            <li>I hope this one is better.  </li>
            <li>and you get groomed with it for sure.</li>
            <li>It fell off the bathroom counter onto the floor and now it doesn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li>they worked OK, but I thought I&#x27;d give this Panasonic a try.  </li>
            <li>It works better than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Panasonic is a reliable name and I am pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>I use it more on ear hair.</li>
            <li>just like most</li>
            <li>Finally found this on Amazon and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li>This does the trick painlessly for thos interesting nose hairs.</li>
            <li>But, after messing with it, wiping out the inside where the battery \\&quot;touches\\&quot; and turning the top back-and-forth it started to work.  </li>
            <li>As one ages, males start growing unwanted hair in and around the ears, on top of the nose, from eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This one is quieter and better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many nose trimmers, and I ended up with this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it</li>
            <li>If I were to buy one, I would consider ordering from a retailer with a better replacement policy.  </li>
            <li>eeeh not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Panasonic has always been my favorite brand</li>
            <li>I just cannot imagine what more anyone could want, regardless of price.</li>
            <li>the more you stick your fingers up your nose.</li>
            <li>This device is simpler, safer and more effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is much better.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>can you say about a Nose and Ear Trimmer, it just works better than others.</li>
            <li>Boy - that&#x27;s refreshing, eh?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often but it works great when I do use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d pay more for something better designed</li>
            <li>there aren&#x27;t many alternatives, so i&#x27;ve bought this one 3 times.  </li>
            <li>But it could be better.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Like most of Panasonic products.</li>
            <li>I purchased one many years ago.</li>
            <li>This is an ok nose, ear clipper for the price.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic makes better ones that are newer and more reliable.</li>
            <li>free!</li>
            <li>but mostly it&#x27;s just a paperweight.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if it could get a bit closer though.</li>
            <li>its ok it does the job</li>
            <li>but I was a bit expecting to be a bit more sturdy.</li>
            <li>i love this nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>as will do more than just nose and ear hairs as it states on box will also do Eyebrows, lashes, mustache or any unwanted facial hair safely, has a great 2-year warranty from Panasonic, And so far been working like it should and doing a great job!</li>
            <li>the Panasonic ER-GN30-K gets pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Shipped on time---excellent product--works well, actually better than two similar products I bought recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged and at a very good price</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s the job done and is safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li>i owned a Panasonic personal trimmer for years, loved it, tried others and they were never as good.</li>
            <li>The ER415 simply does not do the job and is not a replacement for the much superior ER411.Panasonic destroyed a good product.</li>
            <li>Perfect product - fast shipping - thanks</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but then I wouldn&#x27;t be able to clean it out, so this is not the most hygienic option.</li>
            <li>and I thought the extra power would be a very good thing.  </li>
            <li>This is very good for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li>very easy and effective and does the job efficiently without much effort.  </li>
            <li>No yanking of hairs (to me, the most important quality in a nose and ear hair trimmer).</li>
            <li>work!Maybe if there&#x27;s more products they&#x27;ll sell for cheap</li>
            <li>can confirm that i was not electrocuted when putting device under water, and more importantly that water did not get into the battery compartment</li>
            <li>Better off just buying a cheap one at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>In fat, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t give a \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; makes me more comfortable sticking it up in my nose where I can&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s doing.</li>
            <li>Most important.  </li>
            <li>very well good price will no be without it</li>
            <li>its good for nose hair everything else not so much.</li>
            <li>good price fast delivery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to get one these for a long time, I think it&#x27;s the best way to describe this item: Easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with it, nonetheless my expectation was that it would trim the nostril hair more quickly.</li>
            <li>Cost a bit more than others, BUT WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>For better cleaning easily dismantle tip and carefully clean blade.</li>
            <li>Easy on-off switch.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and keeps the grass trimmed.  </li>
            <li>&gt;♦ Easy to replace battery&lt;</li>
            <li>♦ Easy to take apart for cleaning</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had one before, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I find it easy to use and works well</li>
            <li>The top comes off and you can rinse and clean the blades.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the blades are easy to access</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use it</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product that&#x27;s not only convient but works fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have since returned to the older trimmer which has a damaged head and sounds like its coming apart, but still gives a good close cut for the nose and ears.</li>
            <li>The battery I put into it is still going strong, but I do not use it every day.</li>
            <li>Strong motor that does the job.</li>
            <li>He has used it for 8 months now and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, pain free and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Goods direct mail China, fast, after receiving the goods, can&#x27;t wait to use it, is very good:)</li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>The previous one was excellent.  </li>
            <li>I owned one from Panasonic before and it did the job just fine.</li>
            <li>The units work fine</li>
            <li>To the guys who say these things do not cut or twist hair mine works just fine.</li>
            <li>Typical Panasonic product, great quality!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, and actually my second one since I wore out the first one.  </li>
            <li>but for now it is fine.</li>
            <li>For $11 that suits me fine.</li>
            <li>This nose hair trimmer worked fine..</li>
            <li>THE SHIPPER WAS FINE;</li>
            <li>This is a nice tool, convenient, easy to use, and  reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Not only does it cut incredibly close, leaving a smooth result, but it&#x27;s quick too.  </li>
            <li>Battery makes it user friendly and easy to take along on your travels.</li>
            <li>Does the job and does not pull which is a huge bonus...</li>
            <li>but there is one huge design flaw.</li>
            <li>The finger grip is comfortable, and it is not too noisy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean with running water on tip.</li>
            <li>works like a champ keeping the nose forest in check, smooth and painless...</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and thorough.</li>
            <li>was hoping that with detailed pictures panasonic would just send me a replacement handle portion but</li>
            <li>This does the job and is easy to clean by running it under the water in the sink.  </li>
            <li>the light and the vacuum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ER411 was no longer available</li>
            <li>But to get free shipping you have to buy something else to get it up</li>
            <li>Look for something as sturdy but more powerful.</li>
            <li>And you probably don&#x27;t need the one with the light attached.</li>
            <li>I should have been more leary when, fresh from package, I installed a battery and the cutter would not spin.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER415SC Nose, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry hair trimmer works great for trimming nose hair and ear hair .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a fantastic job, and keeps him trimmed.</li>
            <li>The motor struggles at times even with the light hair I have (nose and ears).  </li>
            <li>Technology has advanced....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not 100% easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean easily and clogs up.</li>
            <li>Efficient and comfortable.</li>
            <li>So smooth.</li>
            <li>Another great buy from the big A.</li>
            <li>That said, I got another brand of trimmer a couple of years ago, as it came free with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have never seen the one that cuts hairs so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, well designed product that does a great job.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was worried when I got this that it would do the same but it works great, no pain - it just trims.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S CHEAP</li>
            <li>Fabulous product for nose hair (I&#x27;m a woman and have yet to find any ear hair at age seventy-one).</li>
            <li>no nicks or pulls, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave smooth, but it does its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is made of cheap plastic</li>
            <li>This trimmer works great, only had it for a month or so, but trims ears and nose hairs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Light</li>
            <li>easier and safer, and it so cheap, why wouldn&#x27;t you buy it ?</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to hold and clean, doesn&#x27;t pull/grab</li>
            <li>NiCe really helpful.</li>
            <li>It glides over the hair so smoothly if it wasn&#x27;t for the sound of the motor</li>
            <li>to the blades on all of these being almost foil-thin, I wouldn&#x27;t expect much more than a year or two of use, but it is worth that IMO.</li>
            <li>so enjoy it.</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I could never quite get the old one to do a good job</li>
            <li>it is very useful thank you.</li>
            <li>Very useful anywhere.</li>
            <li>Pain free, quick, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I originally thought that the Conair would be a very good battery powered trimmer because unlike what appears to be all other battery powered trimmers, the Conair requires two batteries</li>
            <li>This one was much superior, in that the unit did not uncomfortably heat up, or vibrate too much, while  using it.</li>
            <li>It does the job quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It cuts very easily and cuts the hairs very close.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Originally purchased this after two others that I did not like at all.  </li>
            <li>Just does not cut or trim as did the original one.  </li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted for many years</li>
            <li>(The original one had worn out)</li>
            <li>I have had the trimmer for over a year and it works great, has not needed a battery replacement, is easily cleaned, and is very helpful generally.</li>
            <li>Its was cheap and works good enough said.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You should take it apart to clean out the hair</li>
            <li>, I can rinse it under the water faucet to clean it out....</li>
            <li>I had to take apart and clean it which was a pain.  </li>
            <li>MY &#x27;OLD&#x27; ONE WORKS BETTER!  </li>
            <li>Brand new out the the package it worked good for the first 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, but you dont pay much for it.  </li>
            <li>It did not work right out of the box!</li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s next to &amp;#34;Cyclops pimple&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hanging booger&amp;#34; on the list of &amp;#34;Most Distracting Things About A Person&#x27;s Face.&amp;#34; Solve this quick and easy with a nice cheap trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident, my posture, my love life, and my social life have all dramatically improved!!</li>
            <li>I bought this nose hair trimmer because of its low price and good reviews.</li>
            <li>You can spend a whole lot more money</li>
            <li>Seems to have good power and definitely trims hair.</li>
            <li>The ER415SC is a different design and doesn&#x27;t do as good a job.  </li>
            <li>And just give it a quick rinse to keep it clean, not bad.</li>
            <li>I was concerned buying this item given a number of reviews suggesting this particular model is not as good as older models and that it can catch/pull hairs.</li>
            <li>but it gets hot very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a great addition to all our other beauty aids.  </li>
            <li>I am an extremely vain person and this works great</li>
            <li>it was very reasonable, so may not last a real long time, but it sure is perfect now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I saved my blade from the older unit to install in the new trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This new one is great, quiet, cuts close and is so smooth running</li>
            <li>I had a couple of the older ones that seemed to work a bit better.</li>
            <li>I have an older Panasonic unit that still works, and it&#x27;s 100 X&#x27;s better than this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sort of a hairy person and using to cut the nose hair is super.</li>
            <li>Decent upgraded nose/ear hair trimmer, better than the entry level products.  </li>
            <li>This quickly gets rid of it without feeling a thing.</li>
            <li>The older model (10 years ago, had sharper blades and did a better job.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adequate, it works--</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it just interesting what hair does as you get older?  </li>
            <li>It requires a bit more maneuvering to get hair out of some places, like inside an ear, than the older model.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried several similar products but this one is the best quality of any of them.  </li>
            <li>ilke the style and after buying them i like the no pulling of hair and keep you from puttin them to far up your nose&lt;br /&gt;anyone who wants a good nose hair trimmer i would recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;bill</li>
            <li>I discovered that this Panasonic model is very easy to use compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li>Great value, comfortably cuts hair in tight places!</li>
            <li>I was very glad to find this again on Amazon.com at a very moderate price.</li>
            <li>this was the problem but even with a new battery, it still refused to run for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>if you need one, this one is as good , if not better, than most.</li>
            <li>But this is by far the best trimmer hands down</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Handy for quick personal care .</li>
            <li>It is a great trimmer but the batteries go dead quick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little tool.</li>
            <li>For such a cheap little trimmer, this item works great!!</li>
            <li>it works very well but looks cheap</li>
            <li>I have only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>The old style 410 and 420 blades were better.</li>
            <li>Quiet operation, effective and well built.</li>
            <li>The motor lags even with fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li>for the ladies it makes a nice travel buddy (only one speed though) that doesn&#x27;t look like a travel buddy thus eliminating any embarrassing TSA searches.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>Since everything is now manufactured in the Far East and China, I&#x27;m sure it will die a day after the warranty expires, like everything else I&#x27;ve bought over the years.</li>
            <li>Kind of underpowered, but that&#x27;s probably by design to be quiet and not hurt you.</li>
            <li>I think, sounded like it was about to die even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34; It wins my vote by a hair...</li>
            <li>I need it to in one or rarely two swipes and doesn&#x27;t pull at all, which was another concern that I had.</li>
            <li>I had just about given up finding one of these that worked worth a darn.  </li>
            <li>this works ok, but I expected more.</li>
            <li>Does a nice clean job on noses and can even be used on stray hairs under brows if you are careful.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is good value and with a bit of concentration will make one look sharp.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of trimming the hair, so I have to take a long time to get the job done by going back over and over my nose and</li>
            <li>It will, however, pull the hair right out of your nose, if that pleases you.</li>
            <li>Price is just right.</li>
            <li>Great little tool!</li>
            <li>A clean nostril of long, curled hurts feels so much better.</li>
            <li>so far, so good and beats and safer than clipping those kind of hairs with small scissors anyway!</li>
            <li>The new one is very quiet and does a pretty fair job.  </li>
            <li>This newer model seems to be made a little bit better, the motor seems better, and it does what it is supposed</li>
            <li>Great to have the proper equipment back.</li>
            <li>This things is far too easy.  </li>
            <li>He liked it so much and wanted a 2nd one, in case it was ever discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to use it often, and used it mildly for about 3 months, very infrequently.</li>
            <li>er411 is better as i have used it in past and it is awesome just little pricey.</li>
            <li>these things are pretty standard, this one does what it says, need to keep clean and degunked, but no complaints, will serve for a couple of years easy.</li>
            <li>It does work but gets rust very fast.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, quiet, just pop in a battery</li>
            <li>This is very reasonably priced and will serve you well for the cost.</li>
            <li>The old one was still working fine before the loss of the blade assembly.</li>
            <li>Nice clipper wet or dry  nice trim.</li>
            <li>This product is better than competing models that only ended up in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I HAVE OWNED THIS EXACT PANASONIC ER415SC NOSE AND EAR TRIMMER FOR OVER 10YRS...</li>
            <li>If they were to offer replacement blades for this product, I would consider giving it a higher rating.</li>
            <li>I would think anything more than this would be over kill, but there is definitely a benefit to purchase Panasonic brand over Conair.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly as its supposed to.</li>
            <li>This seems EXACTLY like the one I bought about a decade ago.</li>
            <li>I have owned this trimmer for many years but dropped it recently and needed to replace it.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed that the cap from the old model fit as did the blade mechanism...</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Are lights and vacuums really needed on a nose hair trimmer!  </li>
            <li>Really!  </li>
            <li>Or is the light intended to be used when you go camping and the Coleman lantern doesn&#x27;t reach that far.  </li>
            <li>When I got this trimmer two years ago it worked well on the first battery.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I cringed when I turned it on.  </li>
            <li>First trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, works well.</li>
            <li>It stopped working after I dropped it, but worked agsin once I made sure all the components were back in place and lined up with the notches on the head of the unit.</li>
            <li>first is that I bought 2 because I had 2 before.  </li>
            <li>First time user.</li>
            <li>I know that sounds funny</li>
            <li>This is my first Hair Trimmer</li>
            <li>He used it for the first time on Tuesday.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for  </li>
            <li>I got mine directly from&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic $10.99 free shipping plus tax.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what we needed for my husband.  </li>
            <li>All the people who complain that it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough must expect more of a nose-hair trimmer than I do.</li>
            <li>Very convenient!</li>
            <li>;-) I have always used cuticle scissors to trim my nose hair (ewwww) and this works just as well and gets just as close.</li>
            <li>Used only twice and doesn&#x27;t work any more.</li>
            <li>I finally just smashed mine with a hammer, which process gave me greater satisfaction than the product ever did.  </li>
            <li>When I consider that many, perhaps dozens, of people were involved with designing, building, and marketing this product, I am embarrassed to be a member of the human race.</li>
            <li>My second purchase, the first panasonic lasted many years.</li>
            <li>This unit is still running on the first AA I put in it.  </li>
            <li>There are many more that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>The new groomer is even better than the old one</li>
            <li>it is slightly different design than my older one, but it works as good so far.</li>
            <li>I have used the older Panasonic ER411 nose trimmer for a long time and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Small and light with very easy operation.</li>
            <li>this little beast of a grooming tool still going, works as described.not much else to say good deal</li>
            <li>fast, smooth action.</li>
            <li>not too great or powerful but works as well as my previous trimmer (different brand), same size and same color, but a good value at $7.99 on amazon.</li>
            <li>They were more expensive and did not do a good job</li>
            <li>Overall good with solid performance.</li>
            <li>It gets right up in there and does a nice job with little hair pulling.  </li>
            <li>I also got a reasonable price, very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>First one finally gave way after 10 years   Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Decided to purchase this trimmer based on positive feedback by others.  </li>
            <li>He is aware that if he really likes something, it is often discontinued and he can never buy it again</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job better than the one I replaced by a long shot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really unclear to me why such a simple, widely distributed consumer grooming product cannot be made to function so that I&#x27;d rate it excellent.</li>
            <li>I have used several other brands for different places where I stay and this one is the best of them all.</li>
            <li>Cheap, first one broke after 8 months, second one, 3 months.</li>
            <li>I have bought many trimmers in the past , this one is comfortably quite , fits well in hand &amp; cuts without pulling hairs .</li>
            <li>It is simple, easy to use, and durable.</li>
            <li>Easy, simple, does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>Had a older version of the same trimmer and took a chance with the newer version, I am not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>The newer one is a little more noisy than the previous (5 year old) model, but it works great.</li>
            <li>it is very high quality.</li>
            <li>This does work fine, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; at the facial hair too much, but the variability of the motor does not inspire confidence.</li>
            <li>If there is a gripe, it&#x27;s only because I wish it came with a light.</li>
            <li>This unit came with a tiny, cheap blade that didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than I expected</li>
            <li>Cuts fast and close.</li>
            <li>It is also very durable.</li>
            <li>if you think the price is cheap enough for it to be disposable</li>
            <li>very compact/light/easy to use.  </li>
            <li>well made thanks panasonic</li>
            <li>last pretty long but changing to a rechargable type will become more economical.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I tried two types of another brand, much to my dissatisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Trims really close without nicking the skin.  </li>
            <li>Ridiculessly cheap sale price at around ten bucks.</li>
            <li>I guess there are people who don&#x27;t have a light above their bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li>Very well built and sturdy</li>
            <li>Serves its function very well.</li>
            <li>Compact and operates very well on the AA battery.  </li>
            <li>I would only recommend this item to someone who would enjoy a wake call.</li>
            <li>It is working very well</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>But then ... Who wants to talk about trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li>We like it, it does the job and works very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>It may sound gross but it does a neat job of removing nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily feel cheap but it foes not feel well made either.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts much longer and the motor spins faster.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>* this thing whirrs like a champ - so much so that it really tickles my nose</li>
            <li>What I like  is that this groomer cuts much closer than a fancy chrome plated model I tried.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know these things cut your nose...</li>
            <li>Cheaper at amazon.com than at a retail mall speciality store, and cheaper to replace whole unit than just the trimmer head parts.</li>
            <li>Very finiky...</li>
            <li>The battery compartment is sealed from water so you can rinse the whole thing off.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he claims it works very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth it .. works very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just selective about what hair it wants to remove.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Washable feature is very convenient too.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfy.</li>
            <li>Very disppointing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for having it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done safely, the are no exposed blades to cut or irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;Solid quality as expected from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Occasionally it appears to pull a hair... which isn&#x27;t comfortable in the nose</li>
            <li>Says it works very well.</li>
            <li>Going on a whole year since hes had it.</li>
            <li>and the blade rotates quite fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the rescue.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this groomer for his ears and it has worked very well for him.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic</li>
            <li>Finally! Been using cuticle scissors for years, felt brave enough to try this, after a couple of buddies said they had similar products.</li>
            <li>Fast service and product is as described.  </li>
            <li>THIS WAS MUCH NEEDED FOR MY BOYFRIEND</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use it much, but it gets the nose and ear hair very well.</li>
            <li>You probably need to spend at least $35.00 for a good model.</li>
            <li>Not much to it, but good reliable product for personal grooming.  </li>
            <li>Bought as a replacement for a several year old cheaper Wahl model, and definitely satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li>He said he liked it (a man of few words).</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time going over the same areas that I did on my old one....and....to top it off</li>
            <li>they won&#x27;t run fast or consistently even with new batteries.    </li>
            <li>Easy to use, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>After using this one, I&#x27;m glad i&#x27;m rid of the other one.</li>
            <li>It seems like it should be straightforward enough</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s better than I expected!  </li>
            <li>Better than other trimmers I have used.  </li>
            <li>I just got my nose trimmer in the mail the other day I love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more to give to other family members who always want to use mine.</li>
            <li>This is a very cheap product and that is why it is not worth it.</li>
            <li>The older model provided a much closer cut.</li>
            <li>but no biggy as there just as simple to clean without it anyway</li>
            <li>It works, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to spin as fast as my older one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I recently replaced my Panasonic ER411 with the new ER415 since the ER411 is no longer available.</li>
            <li>(is that normal for nose hair to grow this fast?), and it works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li>it is very easy to use however, i do find it difficult to clean!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without mine!</li>
            <li>They last longer, give it more oomph, and ensure that you&#x27;re going to be cutting rather than pulling hair even when you&#x27;re moving along at a pretty good pace.</li>
            <li>While this thing works its doesn&#x27;t have much power even with a new battery.  </li>
            <li>This new trimmer is quieter and so much sharper.  </li>
            <li>Works very well when new.</li>
            <li>A quality product, so much better than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li>This works decent.</li>
            <li>older unit didn&#x27;t have the rubberized grip, the cap used to fall off, and I thought the motor was weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I bought this particular model, my reasoning was: well...</li>
            <li>It does not trim hair quickly and you need to try several times.</li>
            <li>This particular one, the Panasonic ER415SC, was purchased in 2013 and was inferior from the start.</li>
            <li>Works to a decent efficiency with batteries and doesn&#x27;t cut too close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Not particularly efficient.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to replace an older one, also Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully not user error, but its not like I have particularly grandpa-ish bushman nostrils, so</li>
            <li>As I get older I am getting hair in places that hair shouldn&#x27;t be in my opinion..</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Panasonic, at a decent price, I might add.  </li>
            <li>If you lose a part, you may as well throw the whole thing in the trash, as each part is nearly the cost of the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>It is at least as good as my old one, it was inexpensive, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It seems to jam up without too much use, has a cheap fragile plastic holder for the tiny razor blades inside the housing (which broke on my last one when they fell out trying to clean it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for nose hair trimming.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a great bang for the buck device that uses real cutters... instead of the old clapper-thrasher crap so many of their competitors are pushing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Panasonic Hair Groomer...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Made in China, high performance price ratio.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using the other one and so far it seems better, but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to have replacement blades for sale.</li>
            <li>Pretty good and less expensive than most.  </li>
            <li>For what little power it generates, is sure seems to go through the batteries.  </li>
            <li>For a little more than 10 bucks, this trimmer does its job nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>Is and standard product, but with quality, and you can clean with water directly.</li>
            <li>Also great for trimming those little tiny hairs on my upper lip and chin that appeared after menopause.</li>
            <li>Another cheap product, not really at about four dollars per nose hair trim, in the trash.</li>
            <li>I purchsed this trimmer to replace a 10 year old Panasonic trimmer that had served me very well until I fractured it on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>Send us a postage paid envelope and we&#x27;d be happy to send this nearly useless product back.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li>another normal quality product form overseas.</li>
            <li>Works for us ladies as well as my husbands more heavy duty one.</li>
            <li>The motor doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as the last one I had.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the low price.  </li>
            <li>Of course most things with the Panasonic name on them are high quality items, and usually last a very long time.</li>
            <li>If you remove the blade mechanism, the little spinning nub spins just fine, but once it engages with the blades, the whole thing grinds to a halt.  </li>
            <li>then it may be a decent buy... if you are interested in having one break shortly after you purchase it</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>So when it gave up, I bought a new one.</li>
            <li>Had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>so I bought this new one.</li>
            <li>Found it was cheaper to buy a new one than just the replacement parts.  </li>
            <li>for a brand new trimmer.</li>
            <li>After using the Panasonic ER411 nose trimmer for a couple of years I decided to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>So I decided to get a new one, and bought this</li>
            <li>brand new factory sealed..</li>
            <li>may as well buy a new one...</li>
            <li>I am waiting to see how this new one does.  </li>
            <li>I no longer live in fear of errant nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even work when I got it, tried new batteries and everything.</li>
            <li>why, it just wont turn on, even with new batteries.</li>
            <li>Tried new batteries, nothing.</li>
            <li>I used brand new batteries.  </li>
            <li>New battery didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of years and it still works like brand new.  </li>
            <li>Tried with brand new battery, no luck.</li>
            <li>A brand new Duracell battery ran out after 15 minutes of use and 3 weeks being stored.</li>
            <li>* works wet, so you can clean it under the faucet.</li>
            <li>I thought I could risk getting a cheap nose trimmer and have it work semi-decent (as I only need it occasionally).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, you have to replace batteries faster than expected but will still do the job working on a low battery for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Never bought a nose hair trimmer before, I am now 38 and do not want to look like my old shop teacher from high school.</li>
            <li>I ordered a Panasonic Nose and Ear Trimmer and it arrived very early.</li>
            <li>but means it should last a long time since you can easily add a new batter.  </li>
            <li>the device itself is easy to figure out if you bother to spend a few minutes with it, but the marking on the device and as detailed in the manual are pretty small</li>
            <li>I did this with my second Mangroomer, and it worked longer than the first Mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that it takes one AA battery instead of charging, meaning that you can use it at the drop of a hat without having to worry about plugging it in to charge it first.</li>
            <li>Wish old guys used them, ha ha!</li>
            <li>I dropped my first one after having it for about ten years and it broke.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked fine for about two and a half of those</li>
            <li>We originally bought this as a White Elephant gift, and one for personal use ...</li>
            <li>I have tried other products of this type over the years (many) with various degrees of success.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This one seems to be the same but doesn&#x27;t cut as close or as consistently.</li>
            <li>this little gizmo does the trick, its afordable, easy to use, painless.</li>
            <li>This particular model doesn&#x27;t catch the hair very well if at all, even after several passes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting old and a bit noisy, so I opted to get the new model.  </li>
            <li>My nostrils do feel funny right after shaving them up (a little prickly) but that isn&#x27;t the trimmers fault.</li>
            <li>and if you find you need a brush just use a old soft bristle toothbrush...not rocket Science to do!</li>
            <li>This new one does not work near as well as the old one did.</li>
            <li>I gave it new batteries, tried to open it up, slammed it on the counter, the whole spiel, but to no avail.</li>
            <li>There are better models that cost around the same or less.</li>
            <li>this product is designed more efficient than my previous nose and facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>However, this last one was better than the previous two.  </li>
            <li>This groomer has nothing extraordinary about it compared to more expensive groomers except the price.</li>
            <li>It is a little on the cheap side.  </li>
            <li>The ER411 was great, with a close cutting blade.  </li>
            <li>As far as cutting hair and comfort goes, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>I bought one about two months ago, and so far, I&#x27;ve gotten it to start every day.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been over a year now</li>
            <li>Cuts well and hasn&#x27;t caused any pain so far</li>
            <li>Thank heaven I kept my old one.  </li>
            <li>I used the blade from the old one and it works as it should now.</li>
            <li>Also, the price was considerably cheaper.</li>
            <li>wow I am so unhairy now :</li>
            <li>The old motto is still valid: You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I have used many trimmers that last only a few months, yet this trimmer works fast, cuts 100%</li>
            <li>This is my third purchase as being wet/dry is a real plus.</li>
            <li>Works very well, and it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li>My old lady was always bitchin about my nose hair poking out of my nostrils, so she bought me this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>big thanks</li>
            <li>The blade had disappeared out of my old one, so I ordered another (then the blade conveniently appeared).</li>
            <li>I had it on my wishlist for awhile because I remember how the old models yanked like I was pulling hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li>So far it is working well for me.</li>
            <li>but it does what I want it to do so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40+ years old.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for my old Panasonic that was dropped &amp; broke.  </li>
            <li>So I have to use sissors to complete the job.  </li>
            <li>Tested the old battery with another product and it still had power.</li>
            <li>It costs more ($20 vs $12.50) but at least they will take care of you if it stops working.</li>
            <li>sometimes the old nose hair needs a trim.  </li>
            <li>it came grow pretty long.</li>
            <li>the old one.</li>
            <li>Complete garbage at any price.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd trimmer that I have bought in my lifetime and the 1st the really works.</li>
            <li>No pulling of hair in thos sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>does an okay job... not great, not poor.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect, no problem tool for removing annoyingly visible nose hair.  </li>
            <li>It does a excellent work trimming those annoying ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li>nice nose and ear trimmer without all the unnecessary bells and whistles...</li>
            <li>IT WAS EASY AND GOT THE JOB DONE HANDS DOWN!!</li>
            <li>What I mean by better is it got closer.</li>
            <li>They changed the design of the rotary blade in the new one and it barely cuts.  </li>
            <li>The best fine hair trimmer I have used; much less painful yanking that other brands.  </li>
            <li>, I like the rubberized grip, the cap stays on tight, and the motor is strong enough that it cuts the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull it out.</li>
            <li>I went back to the older ER411.  </li>
            <li>Let Panasonic know that they should go back to the older design which worked.</li>
            <li>Decent enough accessory.</li>
            <li>Men are not the only ones who have excessive nose hair, and it is even more embarrassing for a woman, I imagine.  </li>
            <li>Overall, so-so performance, but at this price, a decent value.</li>
            <li>I have normal hair nose as in it doesn&#x27;t grow wild bushes but left untended</li>
            <li>The plastic is thinnest where the clips are (were); not a very good design, as they can break off easily.</li>
            <li>For now, if you need a personal trimmer, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and is high quality for a low price.</li>
            <li>So this one works just fine for me, and the batteries last a lot longer than they do in the ER421 with its useless, battery-draining light.</li>
            <li>Super not cool.</li>
            <li>After reading countless user reviews of these devices I finally decided that this contraption had the price and positive review combination</li>
            <li>I had another trimmer that finally failed after several years; this has been a great replacement, I use it on a regular basis with no issues.</li>
            <li>This item works exactly as advertised and as expected.  </li>
            <li>Good little trimmer for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>If you are a first time purchaser of this particular model, don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one.</li>
            <li>but maybe I should have spent a little more money.</li>
            <li>I threw aways the original receipt and can only provide the return center and the Philippines third party a copy of the credit card receipt for the sale.  </li>
            <li>If you say it is &#x27;only&#x27; a $12 product, then why not just send me a new one.</li>
            <li>After that though, it never got back up to usable speed with new batteries.</li>
            <li>If anyone from Panasonic is reading this, they should really just replace those pieces in the current or next shipping models...</li>
            <li>He had a very old one which finally wore out.  </li>
            <li>First the price is comparable to every other unit you are going to find.  </li>
            <li>My husband is now disabled and he can finally take care of these areas with ease and success!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other manufacturers products, but this model is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This one also has a useful cap that actually stays on if you keep it as I do in a drawer with a bunch of other stuff.</li>
            <li>I have a larger version and this particular one works just as well, and, is much smaller</li>
            <li>Had a particular panasonic that worked great a few years ago and have tried three different ones since and they all are lame.</li>
            <li>Although the snapping sound as it cuts the hair is kinda scary at first.</li>
            <li>It comes with a cap and says it is washable, so far mine hasn&#x27;t minded being run under the tap briefly.  </li>
            <li>My old Panasonic trimmer finally died after 10 years plus.  </li>
            <li>Replacement for old one that died when I dropped it after several years of use.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic Nose, Ear and Facial Hair Trimmer has worked circles around my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I realize this small gap is what makes it work so nicely, so I ordered another and grasp it firmly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not designed to be repaired/replaced, but I have had mine for a few months, so I got my monies worth already.</li>
            <li>but when I empty the cap, not much in there... but not bad product for the money.</li>
            <li>Mainly, it is underpowered by the single AA battery.  </li>
            <li>only use a trimmer about every month or so when I feel the nose hair brush my cheeks in a strong wind and the ear hair makes it hard for me to hear the TV.</li>
            <li>mean a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, while it lasts, it is the closest trimmer available.</li>
            <li>Second, the circular cutting structure is far superior to a flat blade.  </li>
            <li>At first I noticed that unlike my cheap-o, generic trimmer, this one did not make a whole lot of noise which I thought would mean it wouldn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>The new one is the same model but with a different type of internal trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Small enough for travel and takes care of the job quickly.</li>
            <li>Pretty weak motor, couldn&#x27;t really get any weaker...</li>
            <li>keep near your computer monitor, nobody who sits at a computer has an excuse for having nose/ear hair sticking out.</li>
            <li>There is no excuse for any guy to not have one of these.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it for long, but so far it doesn&#x27;t yank the hairs out.</li>
            <li>I really would prefer something like this last him a few years, not a few months.</li>
            <li>The first one got to the point that it pulled more hair than it cut which was painful</li>
            <li>Compared to a previous version which cut my hairs very well.  </li>
            <li>This product is much inferior to the previous trimmer.</li>
            <li>However I thing Panasonic only made minor improvements on the old one.  </li>
            <li>Good thing this was not a super expensive product.  </li>
            <li>I mean really really quick</li>
            <li>meaning you have to buy a whole new unit once the blades dull, which with such a tiny blade surface area is probably...</li>

            <li> Good quality and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation like so can.</li>
            <li> This item is a good value and well made</li>
            <li> This did do a good job.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs and does a good job trimming them.</li>
            <li> good product-good quality and performance</li>
            <li> Good item.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, for $10, you&#x27;ll get a good 2 or three years of use out of it before the plastic breaks.  </li>
            <li> Good for the money, you have to wiggle the battery cap to get it to work</li>

            <li> this trimmer works well and is priced fairly, also has a good design to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some good reviews  and</li>
            <li> It does a good job</li>
            <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t do a good, or even passable, job of removing nose hair.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but I dropped it once, and since it has been showing issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> Good for home use and travel.</li>

            <li> as always when I&#x27;ve dealt with Amazon, they are true to their word for customer service and a product that I am very happy with...</li>
            <li> Good looking, very effective and what more is there to say.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, it&#x27;s a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Works great and the design is top notch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would be great if Panasonic would send us another one for free!  </li>

            <li> Good product, nice delivery.</li>
            <li> Bought the product for my husband who thinks it&#x27;s the best for doing the job right.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It gets all the hair the first time and you are looking great!  </li>
            <li> then maybe Id buy more from them!Thanks!</li>
            <li> (I made sure they were returnable before I purchased them!).  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Works better than advertised!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, and works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective with nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed by the functionality of this little product and for the money it has to be one of the best grooming deals on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a scissors for many years and this is vastly superior.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly, as described and performs well with ALOT of nose hair - no pain, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It uses batteries and isn&#x27;t rechargable which is kind of dissapointing</li>
            <li> It made a nice gift.</li>
            <li> The Er415SC is nice and you can do your ears and nose</li>
            <li> Good and cheap!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had good luck with nose/ear trimmers -- tried many brands including Norelco and Remington.</li>
            <li> Husband always used scissors, but after using this efficient and effective tool....</li>
            <li> so far,,pretty handy too.</li>
            <li> Great price, Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> excellent product, everything was very well received.</li>
            <li> Always liked this product.</li>
            <li> This is an effective grooming tool.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> Keep one handy always.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted that kind of pain I would pull them out myself.  </li>
            <li> and I now have my own,</li>
            <li> I have probably bought more than 3 of these and found them to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Great power and great hand held design highly recommend for the price value.</li>
            <li> My nostrils are clean and happy.</li>
            <li> Very good, very practical!</li>
            <li> works as good as any, better than most</li>
            <li> Changing batteries and cleaning is very easy.</li>
            <li> This is much more convenient and safe!</li>
            <li> this is by far the best thing i have brought</li>
            <li> This is the best one I have seen so far.  </li>
            <li> does a good job and is comfortable</li>
            <li> I have tried others this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price great product.</li>
            <li> as now after my changes, it is as good as the original.</li>
            <li> Very good product high quality.</li>
            <li> I have had many types of Nose/Ear trmmers over the years and this is by far the best I have ever used</li>
            <li> It works great and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size, and cuts clean with no pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li> A great purchase for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a nose trimmer so nothing to compare it to, but it seems to be fine!</li>
            <li> It is very light</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very important the mark Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> This is my second ear, nose trimmer and the better of the two, it comes with a cap to put on top when not in use, compact size, It works great for me, if you never owned one before its a lot easier and quicker than using scissors and tweezers, Great price too.</li>
            <li> This product is very, very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I just finished using it and the process was quick and the results look good.</li>
            <li> It does a fair job, but still needs a better head/cutter unit and could use one or two more batteries to keep it at full speed and for repeated uses.  </li>
            <li> one truly delivers....  Very good product for us old guys with nose and ear hair instead of head hair.</li>
            <li> I guess all this is to say I was very pleasantly surprised to find out that this Panasonic does a very good job.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve learned you can take the top off and then turn it on.</li>
            <li> , what more could you want from a trimmer?</li>
            <li> Does a good job and is worth the penny.</li>
            <li> Nice close comfortable cut.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic trimmer just does a better job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li> More power and options.</li>
            <li> You can twist the top off to wash it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for better results.</li>
            <li> An ok gadget that works as described.</li>
            <li> It will cost more to ship it than to buy a better one.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ER415SC Nose and Ear Trimmer, Silver[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Most trimmers do not work well.</li>
            <li> safe to us</li>
            <li> Interestingly Amazon has a no return policy for this product so I am struck with this piece of C&amp;^%.</li>
            <li> This is a much better product that the one I used to have.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Hank Williams cd that now I&#x27;m glad I bought it satisfied with both items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Am well pleased</li>
            <li> people might be better off paying more for the one from sharper image...</li>
            <li> Researched many many models before I bought and got this model.</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts, but I now even breath better after using it.</li>
            <li> All of us adults have nose hairs, and the more senior among us have it growing out of our ears as well.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Perfectly safe</li>
            <li> The 415SC trimmer worked OK for about a month but stopped working while I was travelling.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he is satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is wet/dry.</li>
            <li> It is better to expend more money for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This item will do all it says and more.  </li>
            <li> Even though it didnt have the best overall reviews (just like all the rest i read about regardless of brand or model...</li>
            <li> But i take most all reviews with a grain of salt</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Even after that, it worked better than this model.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer and makes smooth cuts with no pulling of hairs.</li>
            <li> This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite grooming tool.  </li>
            <li> Love it i can breath much better now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, cheap!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely wonderful for cleaning out all those nasal hairs that threaten to turn into a second mustache.</li>
            <li> This model is in no way even close to the ER421, which costs about 6 dollars more.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Definitely a safe way to remove nasal hair without the fear of injury.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap trimmer!</li>
            <li> This trimmer performs okay.  </li>
            <li> and I like the cap connected on the end as it makes for better handling.</li>
            <li> This is a great product really works well.</li>
            <li> I hope this one is better.  </li>
            <li> and you get groomed with it for sure.</li>
            <li> It fell off the bathroom counter onto the floor and now it doesn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li> they worked OK, but I thought I&#x27;d give this Panasonic a try.  </li>
            <li> It works better than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Panasonic is a reliable name and I am pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I use it more on ear hair.</li>
            <li> just like most</li>
            <li> Finally found this on Amazon and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li> This does the trick painlessly for thos interesting nose hairs.</li>
            <li> But, after messing with it, wiping out the inside where the battery \\&quot;touches\\&quot; and turning the top back-and-forth it started to work.  </li>
            <li> As one ages, males start growing unwanted hair in and around the ears, on top of the nose, from eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This one is quieter and better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many nose trimmers, and I ended up with this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it</li>
            <li> If I were to buy one, I would consider ordering from a retailer with a better replacement policy.  </li>
            <li> eeeh not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has always been my favorite brand</li>
            <li> I just cannot imagine what more anyone could want, regardless of price.</li>
            <li> the more you stick your fingers up your nose.</li>
            <li> This device is simpler, safer and more effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is much better.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> can you say about a Nose and Ear Trimmer, it just works better than others.</li>
            <li> Boy - that&#x27;s refreshing, eh?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often but it works great when I do use it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d pay more for something better designed</li>
            <li> there aren&#x27;t many alternatives, so i&#x27;ve bought this one 3 times.  </li>
            <li> But it could be better.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Like most of Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> I purchased one many years ago.</li>
            <li> This is an ok nose, ear clipper for the price.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic makes better ones that are newer and more reliable.</li>
            <li> free!</li>
            <li> but mostly it&#x27;s just a paperweight.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if it could get a bit closer though.</li>
            <li> its ok it does the job</li>
            <li> but I was a bit expecting to be a bit more sturdy.</li>
            <li> i love this nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> as will do more than just nose and ear hairs as it states on box will also do Eyebrows, lashes, mustache or any unwanted facial hair safely, has a great 2-year warranty from Panasonic, And so far been working like it should and doing a great job!</li>
            <li> the Panasonic ER-GN30-K gets pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Shipped on time---excellent product--works well, actually better than two similar products I bought recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged and at a very good price</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the job done and is safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li> i owned a Panasonic personal trimmer for years, loved it, tried others and they were never as good.</li>
            <li> The ER415 simply does not do the job and is not a replacement for the much superior ER411.Panasonic destroyed a good product.</li>
            <li> Perfect product - fast shipping - thanks</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but then I wouldn&#x27;t be able to clean it out, so this is not the most hygienic option.</li>
            <li> and I thought the extra power would be a very good thing.  </li>
            <li> This is very good for removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> very easy and effective and does the job efficiently without much effort.  </li>
            <li> No yanking of hairs (to me, the most important quality in a nose and ear hair trimmer).</li>
            <li> work!Maybe if there&#x27;s more products they&#x27;ll sell for cheap</li>
            <li> can confirm that i was not electrocuted when putting device under water, and more importantly that water did not get into the battery compartment</li>
            <li> Better off just buying a cheap one at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> In fat, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t give a \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; makes me more comfortable sticking it up in my nose where I can&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s doing.</li>
            <li> Most important.  </li>
            <li> very well good price will no be without it</li>
            <li> its good for nose hair everything else not so much.</li>
            <li> good price fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get one these for a long time, I think it&#x27;s the best way to describe this item: Easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with it, nonetheless my expectation was that it would trim the nostril hair more quickly.</li>
            <li> Cost a bit more than others, BUT WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> For better cleaning easily dismantle tip and carefully clean blade.</li>
            <li> Easy on-off switch.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and keeps the grass trimmed.  </li>
            <li> &gt;♦ Easy to replace battery&lt;</li>
            <li> ♦ Easy to take apart for cleaning</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one before, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I find it easy to use and works well</li>
            <li> The top comes off and you can rinse and clean the blades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the blades are easy to access</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use it</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product that&#x27;s not only convient but works fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have since returned to the older trimmer which has a damaged head and sounds like its coming apart, but still gives a good close cut for the nose and ears.</li>
            <li> The battery I put into it is still going strong, but I do not use it every day.</li>
            <li> Strong motor that does the job.</li>
            <li> He has used it for 8 months now and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, pain free and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Goods direct mail China, fast, after receiving the goods, can&#x27;t wait to use it, is very good:)</li>
            <li> it works fine.</li>
            <li> The previous one was excellent.  </li>
            <li> I owned one from Panasonic before and it did the job just fine.</li>
            <li> The units work fine</li>
            <li> To the guys who say these things do not cut or twist hair mine works just fine.</li>
            <li> Typical Panasonic product, great quality!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and actually my second one since I wore out the first one.  </li>
            <li> but for now it is fine.</li>
            <li> For $11 that suits me fine.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer worked fine..</li>
            <li> THE SHIPPER WAS FINE;</li>
            <li> This is a nice tool, convenient, easy to use, and  reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Not only does it cut incredibly close, leaving a smooth result, but it&#x27;s quick too.  </li>
            <li> Battery makes it user friendly and easy to take along on your travels.</li>
            <li> Does the job and does not pull which is a huge bonus...</li>
            <li> but there is one huge design flaw.</li>
            <li> The finger grip is comfortable, and it is not too noisy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean with running water on tip.</li>
            <li> works like a champ keeping the nose forest in check, smooth and painless...</li>
            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and thorough.</li>
            <li> was hoping that with detailed pictures panasonic would just send me a replacement handle portion but</li>
            <li> This does the job and is easy to clean by running it under the water in the sink.  </li>
            <li> the light and the vacuum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ER411 was no longer available</li>
            <li> But to get free shipping you have to buy something else to get it up</li>
            <li> Look for something as sturdy but more powerful.</li>
            <li> And you probably don&#x27;t need the one with the light attached.</li>
            <li> I should have been more leary when, fresh from package, I installed a battery and the cutter would not spin.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER415SC Nose, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry hair trimmer works great for trimming nose hair and ear hair .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a fantastic job, and keeps him trimmed.</li>
            <li> The motor struggles at times even with the light hair I have (nose and ears).  </li>
            <li> Technology has advanced....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not 100% easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean easily and clogs up.</li>
            <li> Efficient and comfortable.</li>
            <li> So smooth.</li>
            <li> Another great buy from the big A.</li>
            <li> That said, I got another brand of trimmer a couple of years ago, as it came free with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen the one that cuts hairs so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, well designed product that does a great job.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was worried when I got this that it would do the same but it works great, no pain - it just trims.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S CHEAP</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for nose hair (I&#x27;m a woman and have yet to find any ear hair at age seventy-one).</li>
            <li> no nicks or pulls, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave smooth, but it does its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is made of cheap plastic</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great, only had it for a month or so, but trims ears and nose hairs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Light</li>
            <li> easier and safer, and it so cheap, why wouldn&#x27;t you buy it ?</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to hold and clean, doesn&#x27;t pull/grab</li>
            <li> NiCe really helpful.</li>
            <li> It glides over the hair so smoothly if it wasn&#x27;t for the sound of the motor</li>
            <li> to the blades on all of these being almost foil-thin, I wouldn&#x27;t expect much more than a year or two of use, but it is worth that IMO.</li>
            <li> so enjoy it.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I could never quite get the old one to do a good job</li>
            <li> it is very useful thank you.</li>
            <li> Very useful anywhere.</li>
            <li> Pain free, quick, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I originally thought that the Conair would be a very good battery powered trimmer because unlike what appears to be all other battery powered trimmers, the Conair requires two batteries</li>
            <li> This one was much superior, in that the unit did not uncomfortably heat up, or vibrate too much, while  using it.</li>
            <li> It does the job quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> It cuts very easily and cuts the hairs very close.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Originally purchased this after two others that I did not like at all.  </li>
            <li> Just does not cut or trim as did the original one.  </li>
            <li> Not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted for many years</li>
            <li> (The original one had worn out)</li>
            <li> I have had the trimmer for over a year and it works great, has not needed a battery replacement, is easily cleaned, and is very helpful generally.</li>
            <li> Its was cheap and works good enough said.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should take it apart to clean out the hair</li>
            <li> , I can rinse it under the water faucet to clean it out....</li>
            <li> I had to take apart and clean it which was a pain.  </li>
            <li> MY &#x27;OLD&#x27; ONE WORKS BETTER!  </li>
            <li> Brand new out the the package it worked good for the first 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, but you dont pay much for it.  </li>
            <li> It did not work right out of the box!</li>
            <li> The price is right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s next to &amp;#34;Cyclops pimple&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hanging booger&amp;#34; on the list of &amp;#34;Most Distracting Things About A Person&#x27;s Face.&amp;#34; Solve this quick and easy with a nice cheap trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident, my posture, my love life, and my social life have all dramatically improved!!</li>
            <li> I bought this nose hair trimmer because of its low price and good reviews.</li>
            <li> You can spend a whole lot more money</li>
            <li> Seems to have good power and definitely trims hair.</li>
            <li> The ER415SC is a different design and doesn&#x27;t do as good a job.  </li>
            <li> And just give it a quick rinse to keep it clean, not bad.</li>
            <li> I was concerned buying this item given a number of reviews suggesting this particular model is not as good as older models and that it can catch/pull hairs.</li>
            <li> but it gets hot very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to all our other beauty aids.  </li>
            <li> I am an extremely vain person and this works great</li>
            <li> it was very reasonable, so may not last a real long time, but it sure is perfect now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I saved my blade from the older unit to install in the new trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This new one is great, quiet, cuts close and is so smooth running</li>
            <li> I had a couple of the older ones that seemed to work a bit better.</li>
            <li> I have an older Panasonic unit that still works, and it&#x27;s 100 X&#x27;s better than this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of a hairy person and using to cut the nose hair is super.</li>
            <li> Decent upgraded nose/ear hair trimmer, better than the entry level products.  </li>
            <li> This quickly gets rid of it without feeling a thing.</li>
            <li> The older model (10 years ago, had sharper blades and did a better job.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adequate, it works--</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it just interesting what hair does as you get older?  </li>
            <li> It requires a bit more maneuvering to get hair out of some places, like inside an ear, than the older model.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried several similar products but this one is the best quality of any of them.  </li>
            <li> ilke the style and after buying them i like the no pulling of hair and keep you from puttin them to far up your nose&lt;br /&gt;anyone who wants a good nose hair trimmer i would recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;bill</li>
            <li> I discovered that this Panasonic model is very easy to use compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li> Great value, comfortably cuts hair in tight places!</li>
            <li> I was very glad to find this again on Amazon.com at a very moderate price.</li>
            <li> this was the problem but even with a new battery, it still refused to run for more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> if you need one, this one is as good , if not better, than most.</li>
            <li> But this is by far the best trimmer hands down</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Handy for quick personal care .</li>
            <li> It is a great trimmer but the batteries go dead quick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little tool.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap little trimmer, this item works great!!</li>
            <li> it works very well but looks cheap</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> The old style 410 and 420 blades were better.</li>
            <li> Quiet operation, effective and well built.</li>
            <li> The motor lags even with fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li> for the ladies it makes a nice travel buddy (only one speed though) that doesn&#x27;t look like a travel buddy thus eliminating any embarrassing TSA searches.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Since everything is now manufactured in the Far East and China, I&#x27;m sure it will die a day after the warranty expires, like everything else I&#x27;ve bought over the years.</li>
            <li> Kind of underpowered, but that&#x27;s probably by design to be quiet and not hurt you.</li>
            <li> I think, sounded like it was about to die even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; It wins my vote by a hair...</li>
            <li> I need it to in one or rarely two swipes and doesn&#x27;t pull at all, which was another concern that I had.</li>
            <li> I had just about given up finding one of these that worked worth a darn.  </li>
            <li> this works ok, but I expected more.</li>
            <li> Does a nice clean job on noses and can even be used on stray hairs under brows if you are careful.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is good value and with a bit of concentration will make one look sharp.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of trimming the hair, so I have to take a long time to get the job done by going back over and over my nose and</li>
            <li> It will, however, pull the hair right out of your nose, if that pleases you.</li>
            <li> Price is just right.</li>
            <li> Great little tool!</li>
            <li> A clean nostril of long, curled hurts feels so much better.</li>
            <li> so far, so good and beats and safer than clipping those kind of hairs with small scissors anyway!</li>
            <li> The new one is very quiet and does a pretty fair job.  </li>
            <li> This newer model seems to be made a little bit better, the motor seems better, and it does what it is supposed</li>
            <li> Great to have the proper equipment back.</li>
            <li> This things is far too easy.  </li>
            <li> He liked it so much and wanted a 2nd one, in case it was ever discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use it often, and used it mildly for about 3 months, very infrequently.</li>
            <li> er411 is better as i have used it in past and it is awesome just little pricey.</li>
            <li> these things are pretty standard, this one does what it says, need to keep clean and degunked, but no complaints, will serve for a couple of years easy.</li>
            <li> It does work but gets rust very fast.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, quiet, just pop in a battery</li>
            <li> This is very reasonably priced and will serve you well for the cost.</li>
            <li> The old one was still working fine before the loss of the blade assembly.</li>
            <li> Nice clipper wet or dry  nice trim.</li>
            <li> This product is better than competing models that only ended up in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I HAVE OWNED THIS EXACT PANASONIC ER415SC NOSE AND EAR TRIMMER FOR OVER 10YRS...</li>
            <li> If they were to offer replacement blades for this product, I would consider giving it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> I would think anything more than this would be over kill, but there is definitely a benefit to purchase Panasonic brand over Conair.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly as its supposed to.</li>
            <li> This seems EXACTLY like the one I bought about a decade ago.</li>
            <li> I have owned this trimmer for many years but dropped it recently and needed to replace it.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed that the cap from the old model fit as did the blade mechanism...</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Are lights and vacuums really needed on a nose hair trimmer!  </li>
            <li> Really!  </li>
            <li> Or is the light intended to be used when you go camping and the Coleman lantern doesn&#x27;t reach that far.  </li>
            <li> When I got this trimmer two years ago it worked well on the first battery.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I cringed when I turned it on.  </li>
            <li> First trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, works well.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after I dropped it, but worked agsin once I made sure all the components were back in place and lined up with the notches on the head of the unit.</li>
            <li> first is that I bought 2 because I had 2 before.  </li>
            <li> First time user.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds funny</li>
            <li> This is my first Hair Trimmer</li>
            <li> He used it for the first time on Tuesday.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for  </li>
            <li> I got mine directly from&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic $10.99 free shipping plus tax.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed for my husband.  </li>
            <li> All the people who complain that it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough must expect more of a nose-hair trimmer than I do.</li>
            <li> Very convenient!</li>
            <li> ;-) I have always used cuticle scissors to trim my nose hair (ewwww) and this works just as well and gets just as close.</li>
            <li> Used only twice and doesn&#x27;t work any more.</li>
            <li> I finally just smashed mine with a hammer, which process gave me greater satisfaction than the product ever did.  </li>
            <li> When I consider that many, perhaps dozens, of people were involved with designing, building, and marketing this product, I am embarrassed to be a member of the human race.</li>
            <li> My second purchase, the first panasonic lasted many years.</li>
            <li> This unit is still running on the first AA I put in it.  </li>
            <li> There are many more that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> The new groomer is even better than the old one</li>
            <li> it is slightly different design than my older one, but it works as good so far.</li>
            <li> I have used the older Panasonic ER411 nose trimmer for a long time and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Small and light with very easy operation.</li>
            <li> this little beast of a grooming tool still going, works as described.not much else to say good deal</li>
            <li> fast, smooth action.</li>
            <li> not too great or powerful but works as well as my previous trimmer (different brand), same size and same color, but a good value at $7.99 on amazon.</li>
            <li> They were more expensive and did not do a good job</li>
            <li> Overall good with solid performance.</li>
            <li> It gets right up in there and does a nice job with little hair pulling.  </li>
            <li> I also got a reasonable price, very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> First one finally gave way after 10 years   Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase this trimmer based on positive feedback by others.  </li>
            <li> He is aware that if he really likes something, it is often discontinued and he can never buy it again</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job better than the one I replaced by a long shot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really unclear to me why such a simple, widely distributed consumer grooming product cannot be made to function so that I&#x27;d rate it excellent.</li>
            <li> I have used several other brands for different places where I stay and this one is the best of them all.</li>
            <li> Cheap, first one broke after 8 months, second one, 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have bought many trimmers in the past , this one is comfortably quite , fits well in hand &amp; cuts without pulling hairs .</li>
            <li> It is simple, easy to use, and durable.</li>
            <li> Easy, simple, does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Had a older version of the same trimmer and took a chance with the newer version, I am not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> The newer one is a little more noisy than the previous (5 year old) model, but it works great.</li>
            <li> it is very high quality.</li>
            <li> This does work fine, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; at the facial hair too much, but the variability of the motor does not inspire confidence.</li>
            <li> If there is a gripe, it&#x27;s only because I wish it came with a light.</li>
            <li> This unit came with a tiny, cheap blade that didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected</li>
            <li> Cuts fast and close.</li>
            <li> It is also very durable.</li>
            <li> if you think the price is cheap enough for it to be disposable</li>
            <li> very compact/light/easy to use.  </li>
            <li> well made thanks panasonic</li>
            <li> last pretty long but changing to a rechargable type will become more economical.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I tried two types of another brand, much to my dissatisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Trims really close without nicking the skin.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculessly cheap sale price at around ten bucks.</li>
            <li> I guess there are people who don&#x27;t have a light above their bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li> Very well built and sturdy</li>
            <li> Serves its function very well.</li>
            <li> Compact and operates very well on the AA battery.  </li>
            <li> I would only recommend this item to someone who would enjoy a wake call.</li>
            <li> It is working very well</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> But then ... Who wants to talk about trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> We like it, it does the job and works very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> It may sound gross but it does a neat job of removing nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily feel cheap but it foes not feel well made either.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts much longer and the motor spins faster.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * this thing whirrs like a champ - so much so that it really tickles my nose</li>
            <li> What I like  is that this groomer cuts much closer than a fancy chrome plated model I tried.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know these things cut your nose...</li>
            <li> Cheaper at amazon.com than at a retail mall speciality store, and cheaper to replace whole unit than just the trimmer head parts.</li>
            <li> Very finiky...</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is sealed from water so you can rinse the whole thing off.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he claims it works very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth it .. works very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just selective about what hair it wants to remove.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Washable feature is very convenient too.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfy.</li>
            <li> Very disppointing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for having it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done safely, the are no exposed blades to cut or irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;Solid quality as expected from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Occasionally it appears to pull a hair... which isn&#x27;t comfortable in the nose</li>
            <li> Says it works very well.</li>
            <li> Going on a whole year since hes had it.</li>
            <li> and the blade rotates quite fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the rescue.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this groomer for his ears and it has worked very well for him.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic</li>
            <li> Finally! Been using cuticle scissors for years, felt brave enough to try this, after a couple of buddies said they had similar products.</li>
            <li> Fast service and product is as described.  </li>
            <li> THIS WAS MUCH NEEDED FOR MY BOYFRIEND</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use it much, but it gets the nose and ear hair very well.</li>
            <li> You probably need to spend at least $35.00 for a good model.</li>
            <li> Not much to it, but good reliable product for personal grooming.  </li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for a several year old cheaper Wahl model, and definitely satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li> He said he liked it (a man of few words).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time going over the same areas that I did on my old one....and....to top it off</li>
            <li> they won&#x27;t run fast or consistently even with new batteries.    </li>
            <li> Easy to use, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After using this one, I&#x27;m glad i&#x27;m rid of the other one.</li>
            <li> It seems like it should be straightforward enough</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s better than I expected!  </li>
            <li> Better than other trimmers I have used.  </li>
            <li> I just got my nose trimmer in the mail the other day I love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more to give to other family members who always want to use mine.</li>
            <li> This is a very cheap product and that is why it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> The older model provided a much closer cut.</li>
            <li> but no biggy as there just as simple to clean without it anyway</li>
            <li> It works, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to spin as fast as my older one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my Panasonic ER411 with the new ER415 since the ER411 is no longer available.</li>
            <li> (is that normal for nose hair to grow this fast?), and it works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li> it is very easy to use however, i do find it difficult to clean!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without mine!</li>
            <li> They last longer, give it more oomph, and ensure that you&#x27;re going to be cutting rather than pulling hair even when you&#x27;re moving along at a pretty good pace.</li>
            <li> While this thing works its doesn&#x27;t have much power even with a new battery.  </li>
            <li> This new trimmer is quieter and so much sharper.  </li>
            <li> Works very well when new.</li>
            <li> A quality product, so much better than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> This works decent.</li>
            <li> older unit didn&#x27;t have the rubberized grip, the cap used to fall off, and I thought the motor was weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I bought this particular model, my reasoning was: well...</li>
            <li> It does not trim hair quickly and you need to try several times.</li>
            <li> This particular one, the Panasonic ER415SC, was purchased in 2013 and was inferior from the start.</li>
            <li> Works to a decent efficiency with batteries and doesn&#x27;t cut too close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Not particularly efficient.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an older one, also Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully not user error, but its not like I have particularly grandpa-ish bushman nostrils, so</li>
            <li> As I get older I am getting hair in places that hair shouldn&#x27;t be in my opinion..</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Panasonic, at a decent price, I might add.  </li>
            <li> If you lose a part, you may as well throw the whole thing in the trash, as each part is nearly the cost of the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> It is at least as good as my old one, it was inexpensive, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It seems to jam up without too much use, has a cheap fragile plastic holder for the tiny razor blades inside the housing (which broke on my last one when they fell out trying to clean it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for nose hair trimming.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great bang for the buck device that uses real cutters... instead of the old clapper-thrasher crap so many of their competitors are pushing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Panasonic Hair Groomer...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Made in China, high performance price ratio.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using the other one and so far it seems better, but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to have replacement blades for sale.</li>
            <li> Pretty good and less expensive than most.  </li>
            <li> For what little power it generates, is sure seems to go through the batteries.  </li>
            <li> For a little more than 10 bucks, this trimmer does its job nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> Is and standard product, but with quality, and you can clean with water directly.</li>
            <li> Also great for trimming those little tiny hairs on my upper lip and chin that appeared after menopause.</li>
            <li> Another cheap product, not really at about four dollars per nose hair trim, in the trash.</li>
            <li> I purchsed this trimmer to replace a 10 year old Panasonic trimmer that had served me very well until I fractured it on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> Send us a postage paid envelope and we&#x27;d be happy to send this nearly useless product back.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li> another normal quality product form overseas.</li>
            <li> Works for us ladies as well as my husbands more heavy duty one.</li>
            <li> The motor doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as the last one I had.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the low price.  </li>
            <li> Of course most things with the Panasonic name on them are high quality items, and usually last a very long time.</li>
            <li> If you remove the blade mechanism, the little spinning nub spins just fine, but once it engages with the blades, the whole thing grinds to a halt.  </li>
            <li> then it may be a decent buy... if you are interested in having one break shortly after you purchase it</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> So when it gave up, I bought a new one.</li>
            <li> Had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> so I bought this new one.</li>
            <li> Found it was cheaper to buy a new one than just the replacement parts.  </li>
            <li> for a brand new trimmer.</li>
            <li> After using the Panasonic ER411 nose trimmer for a couple of years I decided to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> So I decided to get a new one, and bought this</li>
            <li> brand new factory sealed..</li>
            <li> may as well buy a new one...</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see how this new one does.  </li>
            <li> I no longer live in fear of errant nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even work when I got it, tried new batteries and everything.</li>
            <li> why, it just wont turn on, even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> Tried new batteries, nothing.</li>
            <li> I used brand new batteries.  </li>
            <li> New battery didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of years and it still works like brand new.  </li>
            <li> Tried with brand new battery, no luck.</li>
            <li> A brand new Duracell battery ran out after 15 minutes of use and 3 weeks being stored.</li>
            <li> * works wet, so you can clean it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> I thought I could risk getting a cheap nose trimmer and have it work semi-decent (as I only need it occasionally).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, you have to replace batteries faster than expected but will still do the job working on a low battery for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Never bought a nose hair trimmer before, I am now 38 and do not want to look like my old shop teacher from high school.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Panasonic Nose and Ear Trimmer and it arrived very early.</li>
            <li> but means it should last a long time since you can easily add a new batter.  </li>
            <li> the device itself is easy to figure out if you bother to spend a few minutes with it, but the marking on the device and as detailed in the manual are pretty small</li>
            <li> I did this with my second Mangroomer, and it worked longer than the first Mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it takes one AA battery instead of charging, meaning that you can use it at the drop of a hat without having to worry about plugging it in to charge it first.</li>
            <li> Wish old guys used them, ha ha!</li>
            <li> I dropped my first one after having it for about ten years and it broke.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked fine for about two and a half of those</li>
            <li> We originally bought this as a White Elephant gift, and one for personal use ...</li>
            <li> I have tried other products of this type over the years (many) with various degrees of success.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This one seems to be the same but doesn&#x27;t cut as close or as consistently.</li>
            <li> this little gizmo does the trick, its afordable, easy to use, painless.</li>
            <li> This particular model doesn&#x27;t catch the hair very well if at all, even after several passes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting old and a bit noisy, so I opted to get the new model.  </li>
            <li> My nostrils do feel funny right after shaving them up (a little prickly) but that isn&#x27;t the trimmers fault.</li>
            <li> and if you find you need a brush just use a old soft bristle toothbrush...not rocket Science to do!</li>
            <li> This new one does not work near as well as the old one did.</li>
            <li> I gave it new batteries, tried to open it up, slammed it on the counter, the whole spiel, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> There are better models that cost around the same or less.</li>
            <li> this product is designed more efficient than my previous nose and facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> However, this last one was better than the previous two.  </li>
            <li> This groomer has nothing extraordinary about it compared to more expensive groomers except the price.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the cheap side.  </li>
            <li> The ER411 was great, with a close cutting blade.  </li>
            <li> As far as cutting hair and comfort goes, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> I bought one about two months ago, and so far, I&#x27;ve gotten it to start every day.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been over a year now</li>
            <li> Cuts well and hasn&#x27;t caused any pain so far</li>
            <li> Thank heaven I kept my old one.  </li>
            <li> I used the blade from the old one and it works as it should now.</li>
            <li> Also, the price was considerably cheaper.</li>
            <li> wow I am so unhairy now :</li>
            <li> The old motto is still valid: You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have used many trimmers that last only a few months, yet this trimmer works fast, cuts 100%</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase as being wet/dry is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li> My old lady was always bitchin about my nose hair poking out of my nostrils, so she bought me this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> big thanks</li>
            <li> The blade had disappeared out of my old one, so I ordered another (then the blade conveniently appeared).</li>
            <li> I had it on my wishlist for awhile because I remember how the old models yanked like I was pulling hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li> So far it is working well for me.</li>
            <li> but it does what I want it to do so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40+ years old.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my old Panasonic that was dropped &amp; broke.  </li>
            <li> So I have to use sissors to complete the job.  </li>
            <li> Tested the old battery with another product and it still had power.</li>
            <li> It costs more ($20 vs $12.50) but at least they will take care of you if it stops working.</li>
            <li> sometimes the old nose hair needs a trim.  </li>
            <li> it came grow pretty long.</li>
            <li> the old one.</li>
            <li> Complete garbage at any price.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd trimmer that I have bought in my lifetime and the 1st the really works.</li>
            <li> No pulling of hair in thos sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> does an okay job... not great, not poor.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect, no problem tool for removing annoyingly visible nose hair.  </li>
            <li> It does a excellent work trimming those annoying ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li> nice nose and ear trimmer without all the unnecessary bells and whistles...</li>
            <li> IT WAS EASY AND GOT THE JOB DONE HANDS DOWN!!</li>
            <li> What I mean by better is it got closer.</li>
            <li> They changed the design of the rotary blade in the new one and it barely cuts.  </li>
            <li> The best fine hair trimmer I have used; much less painful yanking that other brands.  </li>
            <li> , I like the rubberized grip, the cap stays on tight, and the motor is strong enough that it cuts the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull it out.</li>
            <li> I went back to the older ER411.  </li>
            <li> Let Panasonic know that they should go back to the older design which worked.</li>
            <li> Decent enough accessory.</li>
            <li> Men are not the only ones who have excessive nose hair, and it is even more embarrassing for a woman, I imagine.  </li>
            <li> Overall, so-so performance, but at this price, a decent value.</li>
            <li> I have normal hair nose as in it doesn&#x27;t grow wild bushes but left untended</li>
            <li> The plastic is thinnest where the clips are (were); not a very good design, as they can break off easily.</li>
            <li> For now, if you need a personal trimmer, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and is high quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> So this one works just fine for me, and the batteries last a lot longer than they do in the ER421 with its useless, battery-draining light.</li>
            <li> Super not cool.</li>
            <li> After reading countless user reviews of these devices I finally decided that this contraption had the price and positive review combination</li>
            <li> I had another trimmer that finally failed after several years; this has been a great replacement, I use it on a regular basis with no issues.</li>
            <li> This item works exactly as advertised and as expected.  </li>
            <li> Good little trimmer for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time purchaser of this particular model, don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one.</li>
            <li> but maybe I should have spent a little more money.</li>
            <li> I threw aways the original receipt and can only provide the return center and the Philippines third party a copy of the credit card receipt for the sale.  </li>
            <li> If you say it is &#x27;only&#x27; a $12 product, then why not just send me a new one.</li>
            <li> After that though, it never got back up to usable speed with new batteries.</li>
            <li> If anyone from Panasonic is reading this, they should really just replace those pieces in the current or next shipping models...</li>
            <li> He had a very old one which finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> First the price is comparable to every other unit you are going to find.  </li>
            <li> My husband is now disabled and he can finally take care of these areas with ease and success!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other manufacturers products, but this model is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This one also has a useful cap that actually stays on if you keep it as I do in a drawer with a bunch of other stuff.</li>
            <li> I have a larger version and this particular one works just as well, and, is much smaller</li>
            <li> Had a particular panasonic that worked great a few years ago and have tried three different ones since and they all are lame.</li>
            <li> Although the snapping sound as it cuts the hair is kinda scary at first.</li>
            <li> It comes with a cap and says it is washable, so far mine hasn&#x27;t minded being run under the tap briefly.  </li>
            <li> My old Panasonic trimmer finally died after 10 years plus.  </li>
            <li> Replacement for old one that died when I dropped it after several years of use.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Nose, Ear and Facial Hair Trimmer has worked circles around my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I realize this small gap is what makes it work so nicely, so I ordered another and grasp it firmly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not designed to be repaired/replaced, but I have had mine for a few months, so I got my monies worth already.</li>
            <li> but when I empty the cap, not much in there... but not bad product for the money.</li>
            <li> Mainly, it is underpowered by the single AA battery.  </li>
            <li> only use a trimmer about every month or so when I feel the nose hair brush my cheeks in a strong wind and the ear hair makes it hard for me to hear the TV.</li>
            <li> mean a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, while it lasts, it is the closest trimmer available.</li>
            <li> Second, the circular cutting structure is far superior to a flat blade.  </li>
            <li> At first I noticed that unlike my cheap-o, generic trimmer, this one did not make a whole lot of noise which I thought would mean it wouldn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> The new one is the same model but with a different type of internal trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Small enough for travel and takes care of the job quickly.</li>
            <li> Pretty weak motor, couldn&#x27;t really get any weaker...</li>
            <li> keep near your computer monitor, nobody who sits at a computer has an excuse for having nose/ear hair sticking out.</li>
            <li> There is no excuse for any guy to not have one of these.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it for long, but so far it doesn&#x27;t yank the hairs out.</li>
            <li> I really would prefer something like this last him a few years, not a few months.</li>
            <li> The first one got to the point that it pulled more hair than it cut which was painful</li>
            <li> Compared to a previous version which cut my hairs very well.  </li>
            <li> This product is much inferior to the previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> However I thing Panasonic only made minor improvements on the old one.  </li>
            <li> Good thing this was not a super expensive product.  </li>
            <li> I mean really really quick</li>
            <li> meaning you have to buy a whole new unit once the blades dull, which with such a tiny blade surface area is probably...</li>
            <li> Loved the old one, hate the replacement.</li>
            <li> As for the vacuum, vacuum what?  </li>
            <li> You will not regret it for the price, if you&#x27;re flush with money, get the one with the vacuum.</li>
            <li> I found it to be much less powerful than the previous version.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that a battery does NOT last long.</li>
            <li> dropped the previous one on the floor right on it&#x27;s head and broke the little razor part.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works on some one that has too much hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i dont know how long it last</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 6 months and batteries don&#x27;t last as long as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> and they do not last long.  </li>
            <li> Third party refuses to identify its corporate identity, only provides first name of current rep.  Poor manufacturing quality.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it would work shaving other body parts but for the nostrils it is right on the nose.</li>
            <li> only negative is it really does seem to  eat batteries.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts nose hair very well and without occasionally tugging at the hairs, which is one complaint</li>
            <li> This replaced a generic nose hair trimmer (unknown brand, chrome) that had finally given up the ghost.</li>
            <li> This one does not trim nearly as well, and after only a few uses stopped working.  </li>
            <li> i dont think the one AA battery is enough power for it to run very long without changing it!...</li>
            <li> I called Panasonic and complained and they told me I should purchase a new cutting head, at my own expense....</li>
            <li> Ok job on ear hair, but overall I am sorry I purchased!</li>
            <li> The light on the 421 was useless.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a cheap brand from china and it barely worked - tugged the hair out instead of cutting it and was painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how long THIS Panasonic clipper lasts.  </li>
            <li> After calling customer service they said I could pay to have it shipped back or take it to a service center (closest one 500 miles).</li>
            <li> The sign of an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; man:  long fingernails, ear hair, nose hair, rogue eyebrow hair.  </li>
            <li> so I figured that if the spify one breaks as I have read these units never hold up too long, I would have a backup.</li>
            <li> Guard protects skin from any possible cuts/damage, and does a thorough job of trimming with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> but I have no problem recommending this as long as it stays together.</li>
            <li> ♦ Battery lasts a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> , why did no one tell me how prolific hair would become in these strange places?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will make me a life long customer.</li>
            <li> (it is very simple) but do it carefully.  </li>
            <li> First, it worked poorly, snagging nose hairs and getting stuck multiple times every time I used it.</li>
            <li> But it seemed to cut reasonably well, for about a month until it began running so slowly that it pulled rather than cut the hairs.</li>
            <li> These trimmers do not have much power, the blades move slow and I did not know that it wasn&#x27;t rechargable.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty weak sauce.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the other Panasonic models because some of the extra features seemed \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; -like</li>
            <li> He had tried several other brands and found them lacking.</li>
            <li> There are other men trimmers that do just as well and work for multiple things.</li>
            <li> we will see if it lasts long!</li>
            <li> For $12 or whatever I paid for this I wish I had gotten this a long time ago!  </li>
            <li> would buy this again or other products similar to it</li>
            <li> I have used other&#x27;s where I had to constantly replace the batteries.  </li>
            <li> ...follow instructions to remove blade cap with no tools needed (which in fact for any maintenance on it!), rinse and dry</li>
            <li> The LED guide light is a joke, mine was installed incorrectly and angled 3 inches away from the area you really need to be illuminated making it worthless.</li>
            <li> Being waterproof allows me to spray a organic disinfectant onto the blades, allowing to air dry without worrying about rusting the blades or corroding the motor .</li>
            <li> You can actually hear it removing the hair till it&#x27;s smooth, all without cutting your skin.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t understand are the other models by Panasonic that include either a \\&quot;light\\&quot; or a \\&quot;vacuum</li>
            <li> My experience is that these trimmers only last a few months no matter how you store them or how often you use them, so don&#x27;t count on leaving your trimmer in your will to anybody.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t the light or vacuum take power from the one battery instead of devouting all of the juice to the cutting mechanism which is the point to having a nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> it takes a single AA battery.</li>
            <li> Runs on a single AA cell.  </li>
            <li> When you open it up the unit to emtpy the clippings the nylon blade assembly falls out and in my case it goes down the drain.</li>
            <li> It seems to be basically a design flaw but where the cutter portion (the dark grey cap that houses the metal blade unit) twists onto the handle, the retaining piece is an extremely flimsy piece TINY of plastic (see the customer uploaded picture for details).  </li>
            <li> Lost my previous one and have been using tiny scissors.  </li>
            <li> previously owned two of the MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmers[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Only works about half the time and when it does, \\&quot;pulls\\&quot; the hairs out rather than cuts them.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a new ER421; my old ER421 needed a new blade and they are hard to find and expensive...</li>
            <li> you have to turn the head a bit to unfasten it, but it all seems delicate in that too much torque will snap a small but critical piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> The trimmer stopped working for a bit after a while but started back on immediately when I gave it a little shake.  </li>
            <li> Your unit must be old- dull or you have a jungle in there.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a five-year old ER415 with dull trimmer head and is virtually identical, expect for the color of a couple of plastic parts.</li>
            <li> This was chosen to replace an earlier model of the same groomer that I had used for at least five years.</li>
            <li> Gets stuck unless its totally empty.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this after reading through a few hundred reviews on similar products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had different versions of this for everyday use and found others not as reliable</li>
            <li> I returned the product to Panasonic&#x27;s McAllen&#x27;s center in Tx and have been in caught in customer service</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> advice:  If you don&#x27;t use a trimmer for wet hair, I advise keeping the machine in a plastic zip lock bag</li>
            <li> this is a PRO to me because then I don&#x27;t have to waste another outlet plug for a device that I&#x27;ll use only occasionally.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I paid what I expected.</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY - DON&#x27;T BUY.</li>
            <li> Later I found the missing piece intact, but by then I had tossed the trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it works as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> This was a product that I have been curious about buying for some time now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the style he likes, but he said it is a bit underpowered, and stopped working after only a few months.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have dropped it, gotten it wet, and abused it already.  </li>
            <li> For a product that only needs to be used every few weeks this is a bargain.</li>
            <li> That was kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> The guard keeps you from destroying the nose forest, and you can use it on other parts of your face, if that idea doesnt gross you</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Panasonic ER411 which, while not perfect, did an adequate job.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for tough as wire nose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not a nose hair trimmer connoisseur but have owned several in the past with no issues.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower and use it every other week for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> short... seems to work well for a short while but inevitably will fail way before the warranty is up...</li>
            <li> So one is in use, the other in the cupboard.</li>
            <li> All we expected !</li>
            <li> I found other brands/models in stores and even bought a couple of them.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare this to other</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t rip the hair out like other&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li> and I tried other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed one of these since my other one gave out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how it works for other things.</li>
            <li> It has lasted longer than any other model that I have bought.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer used to cause the occasional yelp from a painful hair yanking, but this Panasonic trimmer has been completely painless (1 month of use so far).  </li>
            <li> But the unit is cheap enough to replace every year or so if needed, just it is a bit wasteful to design a product this way, since the motor base never wears out.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, makes a mildly violent sound when it makes contact with those pesky ear and nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately its a horrible problem as you must undo this cap to clean the blade which \\&quot;gunks up\\&quot; very easily with trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only negative is that I must sometimes tap it against the counter to get it going, after I have flipped the switch to turn it on.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time for a product this price.  </li>
            <li> JUST ANOTHER AVERAGE PRODUCT MADE IN CHINA</li>
            <li> The battery is now in my TV remote and the trimmer is in the trash, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The clipper needs to be made so that it cuts closer and the plastic housing that holds the clipper onto the base needs to be made more durable.  </li>
            <li> But after that they all start to break down after about 1 year....</li>
            <li> You know, it sounds like the motor is about to quit working at any moment or is slowing down.  </li>
            <li> And it cuts every hair down to the skin.</li>
            <li> As the motor slows down, the trimmer begins to pull the air rather than cut it.</li>
            <li> If you are just out for nose hair and use a beard trimmer like me for all other grooming get a few of the ER112BC</li>
            <li> But after a few times using it, I have a hard time starting the thing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the blades dull quickly after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give anything less than five stars for now considering</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d feel a slight tickling and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> It could probably use a slightly closer shave</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer and less</li>
            <li> The previous brand I owned, Krups</li>
            <li> I purchased about 10 of these and gave for presents to friend and relatives who sufferd from similar not good products.  </li>
            <li> Not good enough for them.  </li>
            <li> I got hair growing in weird places, and in the normal places hair is growing like weeds.</li>
            <li> This did a decent job of trimming nose hair, but the retention clips that hold the blade cover to the body of the unit broke off after a few month&#x27;s use, making the trimmer useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the blade assembly dropped out when it was being cleaned, without being noticed and was lost, and I had to purchase a new groomer.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped mine and the tolerances between the blade and the guard are miniscule; one slightly bent piece of metal killed the hole device.  </li>
            <li> especially when the batteries get weak.  </li>
            <li> I like this little trimmer.</li>
            <li> This little gadget will help you take care of both.</li>
            <li> If you are getting a lot of flack about nose hair, this little bugger can buy you some peace.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this little gadget.  </li>
            <li> and I dropped once and got damaged a little.</li>
            <li> A durable little trimmer for those of us sporting the nosebeard.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders AND traps the little hairs</li>
            <li> this little ditty goes through it without one tug...</li>
            <li> (It tickles a little, but you will get used to it.)</li>
            <li> nobody wants to see all that crazy hair growing in places</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> It served me well until it died a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and will purchase another to keep in my travel case.</li>
            <li> It is a bit larger than needed and the plastic is of poor quality but the product does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I have used this quite a few times.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a waste money in my book.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Stopped after a few months.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Broke after a few months</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> I use to everyday on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic piece on the battery compartment broke within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Cuts poorly, left lots of hair behind.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t replace blades, and it usually stops working in less than 2 years...  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that these micro trimmers tend to die after a few years, I will update this review if this unit loses it&#x27;s effectiveness or if it encounters any other issues.  </li>
            <li> I hate to admit that I&#x27;m getting older, but this is one of those necessary items for a man my age.  </li>
            <li> No Good doesn&#x27;t work as expected waste of money</li>
            <li> so I took this device and replaced the cutting mechanism and cap with that from the older model and now it works like a charm.    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not easy to see what you&#x27;re supposed to be doing.</li>
            <li> they are not easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Weak - struggles to work</li>
            <li> the past I would disconnect razor blade from holder, it worked, but cut myself a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> DECIDED TO BUY A NEW ONE TO IMPROVE CUTTING ABILITY.  </li>
            <li> hate messing with nose hairs and this makes quick work of them.</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 brands and 7 models of these devices over the years and this is the first to really work to thoroughly get those nasty ear and nose hairs, which is the difference between looking like an poorly groomed geezer and a business professional.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a little Panasonic trimmer for at least a dozen years.  </li>
            <li> This item replaced a Panasonic one that worked for many years, but the switch failed although the motor and blades were still operational.&lt;br /&gt;Automatically sought a same name one, but very disappointed in it.  </li>
            <li> no more scissors for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two others in the past eight months that just DIED on the spot.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times with my ear and nose hair and it performs wonderfully, no problems!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> There is no better trimmer for the money.  </li>
            <li> No more twezzers or scissors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned it for about 1 month, but I was really skeptical.  </li>
            <li> was not satisfied with the prod ER415sc.</li>
            <li> I usually have nose hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It will get what you&#x27;re too lazy to go at with tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to get now.</li>
            <li> As usual Panasonic quality does the job.</li>
            <li> I read few negative reviews on breakage, etc.</li>
            <li> Have given these as gifts in the past.  </li>
            <li> I had bought one of another brand and was not pleased.</li>
            <li> fails to cut closely on smaller hairs.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m just not sure what that is.  </li>
            <li> It finally began to fail.</li>
            <li> sorry for my english!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on experience with an older Panasonic model and despite bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know that the light is to be used not simultaneously with the cutting mechanism but instead to look into your nose before or after cutting.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was some way that it&#x27;d tickle less, but at least it&#x27;s painless!  </li>
            <li> Stopped working after a while the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; got dull.</li>
            <li> I can hardly tell it is on.  </li>
            <li> Also the blades kinda run dull after a while, so you will feel some pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have to work to hard to get the area of hair that I want to trim.  </li>
            <li> No pulling out of nose hairs (a painful characteristic of my other unit)</li>
            <li> Product never worked and by the time we tried to use it, it was too late to return.</li>
            <li> least with this I can keep it from turning into a veritable forest.</li>
            <li> Does the job it is designed to do at least</li>
            <li> It snags hairs, instead of cutting them which nips at your nostrils, feeling like its actually nicking your skin.  </li>
            <li> Not trying to cut anything thick but it trims well</li>
            <li> If the price was not so low I would be so mad I would not repurchase this item,</li>
            <li> After sending them pictures with the point of failure circled they stated I could mail it off for service.</li>
            <li> Works like any trimmer not better or worse.</li>
            <li> I bought a model ER430 which stopped working after less than three months, the blade just stopped coming into contact with the hair and failed to trim anything.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it became difficult to find a replacement blade, so I purchased the ER415 thinking they had to be similar.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t imagine the item being designed any less expensively.  </li>
            <li> Save your $$ and avoid this weak trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Word of advice: do not let the battery get too weak.</li>
            <li> Rechargeable 1.2V are too weak.</li>
            <li> Cuts well very hard to clean&lt;br</li>
            <li> My previous one felt like a weed wacker, but this is like cutting your lawn with scissors.</li>
            <li> however, although I have very thick, course hair</li>
            <li> I bought this because I found those little scissors for nose hair awkward and inadequate.  </li>
            <li> Sorry about the headline, but it&#x27;s hard to get all prosey about a hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> their email tech support insisted it was a consumable part (the blade block) which had broken.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic does not stand behind its products.  </li>
            <li> It has never spun at the velocity of it&#x27;s predecessor, nor does it cut any thing like the broken unit.</li>
            <li> about the poor review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Poor job on nose hair, seems under powered.</li>
            <li> Also, the claim the manufacture makes about it being rinse-able is false.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is near impossible to obtain replacement blade assemblies.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got one with bad blades or this they redesigned them.</li>
            <li> This is a worthless product not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Very weak motor, even after changing the battery.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never gone wrong with a Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> I was horrified to find out that they changed the design for the worse, since it no longer gives a close shave!  </li>
            <li> In fact, the reviews of issues with the cutting ability were correct and it was a poor performer.</li>
            <li> This is a difficult review to write because you need something to compare it with.   </li>
            <li> suppliers who sell products let you return them if they fail..</li>
            <li> Just weird.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong for $10.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is awful, to the point that I am buying a different model.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> /&gt;Guess you get what you paid for, very poor quality</li>
            <li> Some reviewers are saying that Panasonic re-designed the blades and that the re-design prevented them from cutting closer.  </li>
            <li> I hear it cutting</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a built in safety feature that prevents the cutting head from going too close to the skin.</li>
            <li> Pulls nose hairs instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> My god it&#x27;s started coming out of the smallest holes on me, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m turning into a yeti.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing when manufacturers take consumers&#x27; reliable purchase</li>
            <li> How cynical is it to make a product that craps out after 21 months?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hated the fact that it didn&#x27;t come with a darn battery which was annoying because then I had to order those but other</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this thing!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll begin to feel the difference before this gets too bad, then you&#x27;ll know to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with the results after using the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It feels almost like the trimmer is cutting into your nasal membrane!</li>
            <li> and then he would be SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was sort of disappointed with it however.  </li>
            <li> He won&#x27;t use it, and I don&#x27;t blame him! :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed in one of their products.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the lack of quality.</li>
            <li> Now I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with a Jheri Redding which was absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> Warranty is worthless.</li>
            <li> It is worthless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> and I hate having to stick my finger up my nose to scratch the itch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a piece of crap, and I can&#x27;t even contact Amazon to remedy the situation..</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I gave it away!  </li>
            <li> It is very bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is horrible.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe amazon is selling a product that is so terrible!</li>
            <li> Awful quality.</li>
            <li> BUT IT&#x27;S CRAP!!!</li>

            <li> This is the the third Panasonic I&#x27;ve purchased.  As far as cutting hair and comfort goes, it&#x27;s great.  But after a few times using it, I have a hard time starting the thing.  I bought one about two months ago, and so far, I&#x27;ve gotten it to start every day. However, sometimes I have to try over and over and over again before it will turn on.  I&#x27;ve learned there&#x27;s a trick to the thing.  The motor often stops working...especially when the batteries get weak.  But I&#x27;ve learned you can take the top off and then turn it on. It seems to work after you do that.  So far, it&#x27;s been over a year now and it still works.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> The best nose and ear hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. If there is a gripe, it&#x27;s only because I wish it came with a light. But this is by far the best trimmer hands down</li>
            <li> My father use it all the time. He was please with the way it worked.</li>
            <li> It is the best of the worst on the market. it works fine. I am not sure if it works on some one that has too much hair. It does what I needed it to do. Don&#x27;t buy the Chinese model that resembles it. It is very bad.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace a rechargeable trimmer set whose battery would no longer hold a charge.  It uses one AA battery and has enough power to do the job. it is also very quiet.  I highly recommend it for nose hair trimming.</li>
            <li> have to jack around with it to use</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product.  It is inexpensive, functional, and sleek.  The finger grip is comfortable, and it is not too noisy.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT IN EVERY RESPECT!  SELLER A+++</li>
            <li> works really great. very nice to use and does a great job. no more scissors for me.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do. My nose and ear hair are neatly trimmed, and now all the ladies are after me.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.  My husband has been using it and he is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Compared to a previous version which cut my hairs very well.  This version blades are not doing the same job of hair removal. Not sure if I got one with bad blades or this they redesigned them. But they take forever to cut and miss a lot. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer used to cause the occasional yelp from a painful hair yanking, but this Panasonic trimmer has been completely painless (1 month of use so far).  Cuts well and hasn&#x27;t caused any pain so far, what more could you want from a trimmer?</li>
            <li> Works great, great value for the money</li>
            <li> these things are pretty standard, this one does what it says, need to keep clean and degunked, but no complaints, will serve for a couple of years easy. keep near your computer monitor, nobody who sits at a computer has an excuse for having nose/ear hair sticking out.</li>
            <li> Thank heaven I kept my old one.  They changed the design of the rotary blade in the new one and it barely cuts.  I used the blade from the old one and it works as it should now.</li>
            <li> This unit came with a tiny, cheap blade that didn&#x27;t work at all. No trimming ... just made noise.  It&#x27;s a good thing I saved my blade from the older unit to install in the new trimmer.  I should have checked my options in a store. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> This replaced a Panasonic trimmer I purchased several years ago. This one was much superior, in that the unit did not uncomfortably heat up, or vibrate too much, while  using it. Also, the price was considerably cheaper. A five-star product.</li>
            <li> i owned a Panasonic personal trimmer for years, loved it, tried others and they were never as good. the ER415SC fits the bill well. it is slightly different design than my older one, but it works as good so far.</li>
            <li> While this thing works its doesn&#x27;t have much power even with a new battery.  Gets stuck unless its totally empty.</li>
            <li> I purchased this time on August 8, 2011.  I have used it 3 times and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is better than competing models that only ended up in the garbage. I suggest if you buy this brand. My prior one lasted well over ten years.  The box the trimmer came in had warnings about the battery.  It did not contain a battery though.  Plan on buying a battery.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  The trimmer stopped working for a bit after a while but started back on immediately when I gave it a little shake.  Does a good job and is worth the penny.</li>
            <li> I HAVE OWNED THIS EXACT PANASONIC ER415SC NOSE AND EAR TRIMMER FOR OVER 10YRS...DECIDED TO BUY A NEW ONE TO IMPROVE CUTTING ABILITY.  THE ER415SC I JUST PURCHASED DOES NOT CUT WELL AT ALL!  MY &#x27;OLD&#x27; ONE WORKS BETTER!  THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> This is a great nose and ear hair trimmer. No yanking of hairs (to me, the most important quality in a nose and ear hair trimmer).</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great. Nice close comfortable cut. It&#x27;s better than I expected and I&#x27;ve never gone wrong with a Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these for gifts and myself.  It works great.  It removes all of the hairs and does not hurt at all.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Excellent value trimmer for nose and ear. Cuts fast and close. Easy to use and clean with running water on tip. For better cleaning easily dismantle tip and carefully clean blade.</li>
            <li> This works decent. I had a couple of the older ones that seemed to work a bit better. What I mean by better is it got closer. Does the job and does not pull which is a huge bonus...</li>
            <li> I came back to this simple Panasonic trimmer after trying ones from Norelco and from Conair. The Panasonic trimmer just does a better job.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this after reading through a few hundred reviews on similar products.  I chose this model thinking quality over quantity. Unfortunately, the blades dull quickly after a few uses. I&#x27;m of the opinion that the manufacturer should include replacement blades with this product, in order for it to be of \\&quot;reasonable\\&quot; quality. If they were to offer replacement blades for this product, I would consider giving it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> I bought a Panasonic ER415SC Nose and Ear Trimmer about three years ago, and it worked well. So when it gave up, I bought a new one. This new one does not work near as well as the old one did. I have to go over and over and over the same areas in order to get it to work.</li>
            <li> Well built unit.  This trimmer cuts well and does a thorough job with no pulling of hair.  I&#x27;ve used a scissors for many years and this is vastly superior.  Panasonic says the blades will last three years with once a week use.  It is also very easy to clean.  After my satisfaction I also gave one to my dad and he likes it too.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Did not last - only used 3 or 4 times and then it quite working . Had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The best nose hair trimmer out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic ER415 for several years. It has served me well. Unfortunately I left a battery in it and it deteriorated in the unit. I replaced it with a Jheri Redding which was absolutely worthless. I was very glad to find this again on Amazon.com at a very moderate price. It seems to me to be an excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li> Works as intended and advertised</li>
            <li> It was very good and on time!! Highly recommended I really like this product. very good, I like it. great!!</li>
            <li> works like a champ keeping the nose forest in check, smooth and painless...only negative is it really does seem to  eat batteries. easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this nose hair trimmer because of its low price and good reviews. The trimmer I had before came from a one of those $10 grooming gift sets that you can get at Kohl&#x27;s or something. I was happy with it but I lost it so I bought this new one. At first I noticed that unlike my cheap-o, generic trimmer, this one did not make a whole lot of noise which I thought would mean it wouldn&#x27;t work as well. I was wrong. This trimmer cuts nose hair very well and without occasionally tugging at the hairs, which is one complaint I had with my last trimmer. I have only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> i Bought this for my husband.  He raves about it.</li>
            <li> Second Panasonic trimmer I owned. Reliable and does the job. No frills but you don&#x27;t need them. Cleans well with aclcohol poured through while running.</li>
            <li> wow I am so unhairy now :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy with it</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how long THIS Panasonic clipper lasts.  I&#x27;ve ordered two others in the past eight months that just DIED on the spot.</li>
            <li> Great,  easy-to-use. It just stopped working after two years.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and thorough. It can work in a variety of ways. It is also very durable. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This will probably get the job done if you use it in the obvious places.  I would think anything more than this would be over kill, but there is definitely a benefit to purchase Panasonic brand over Conair.  I returned a $15 Conair one to TJ Maxx because the on off switch didn&#x27;t work; you would have to take the batteries out to get it to stop.  I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower and use it every other week for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Finally I have a solution to my nose and ear hair problem lol</li>
            <li> This replaced a generic nose hair trimmer (unknown brand, chrome) that had finally given up the ghost. I&#x27;m more than pleased with it. It works well, seems to be of sufficient build quality - it&#x27;s chopping nose hairs, not trees. And just give it a quick rinse to keep it clean, not bad.</li>
            <li> Purchased this from amazon and it broke within 3 months. It worked great until then. It seems to be basically a design flaw but where the cutter portion (the dark grey cap that houses the metal blade unit) twists onto the handle, the retaining piece is an extremely flimsy piece TINY of plastic (see the customer uploaded picture for details).  Unfortunately its a horrible problem as you must undo this cap to clean the blade which \\&quot;gunks up\\&quot; very easily with trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that with detailed pictures panasonic would just send me a replacement handle portion but their email tech support insisted it was a consumable part (the blade block) which had broken.  After sending them pictures with the point of failure circled they stated I could mail it off for service. I replied that that would be unacceptable as the cost of returning it would be almost the price paid for it. They directed me to a customer service phone number that again told me to mail it in. (After 30 minutes of being transfered around from department to department)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short... seems to work well for a short while but inevitably will fail way before the warranty is up... if you think the price is cheap enough for it to be disposable then it may be a decent buy... if you are interested in having one break shortly after you purchase it I&#x27;d find another brand...</li>
            <li> dropped the previous one on the floor right on it&#x27;s head and broke the little razor part. Found it was cheaper to buy a new one than just the replacement parts.  The newer one is a little more noisy than the previous (5 year old) model, but it works great. No yanking, no tugging or making my eyes water in pain.  It&#x27;s a great little tool.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, excellent price.</li>
            <li> Great product my stepdad loved it</li>
            <li> My husband loves his trimmer.  Made a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer arrived on time and as described. I have used it several times with my ear and nose hair and it performs wonderfully, no problems!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty weak sauce.  For what little power it generates, is sure seems to go through the batteries.  I was quite disappointed with the results after using the trimmer.  I recently upgraded to the Norelco 6 in 1 G480.  It is vastly superior.  Save your $$ and avoid this weak trimmer.  Spend an extra $15 for the G480.  More power and options.</li>
            <li> It is very light so I feel like if I dropped it on the floor it would break. It tickled my nose when I trimmed it but it works great. It did its duty. You can twist the top off to wash it. It doesn&#x27;t come with batteries.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift. It did not work right out of the box! Do they not have any quality control? Do they not test a product before it is packaged and shipped? After calling customer service they said I could pay to have it shipped back or take it to a service center (closest one 500 miles). Pay to ship it back! It never worked. Do not gamble with this company. They do not care about the customer. If you say it is &#x27;only&#x27; a $12 product, then why not just send me a new one.</li>
            <li> I used another brand for several years before it stopped working. After using this one, I&#x27;m glad i&#x27;m rid of the other one.</li>
            <li> This gadget does the trick at a price that can&#x27;t be beat.  This is the third one I&#x27;ve bought over the years.</li>
            <li> This does exactly as its supposed to. Good little trimmer for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Great little tool! Small enough for travel and takes care of the job quickly. I use for my nose and it does the trick every time. Changing batteries and cleaning is very easy. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this trimmer. It jerks and pulls hair from your nose! It feels almost like the trimmer is cutting into your nasal membrane! I called Panasonic and complained and they told me I should purchase a new cutting head, at my own expense....for a brand new trimmer. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this piece of junk! Your welcome.</li>
            <li> An ok gadget that works as described. One battery powers it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I found those little scissors for nose hair awkward and inadequate.  This does the job and is easy to clean by running it under the water in the sink.  For the price it it is a winner.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works as advertised...very compact/light/easy to use.  I have a larger version and this particular one works just as well, and, is much smaller so it is easier to pack when you travel.</li>
            <li> I bought a Panasonic personal trimmer that looked just like this back in 2003. It served me well until it died a few weeks ago. This newer model seems to be made a little bit better, the motor seems better, and it does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older unit didn&#x27;t have the rubberized grip, the cap used to fall off, and I thought the motor was weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this newer ER415SC, I like the rubberized grip, the cap stays on tight, and the motor is strong enough that it cuts the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull it out. I just finished using it and the process was quick and the results look good. Some reviewers are saying that Panasonic re-designed the blades and that the re-design prevented them from cutting closer.  I just used this and I think it cuts close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid eight bucks for this and I think that&#x27;s a great deal.  I can&#x27;t give anything less than five stars for now considering this product has met my expectations and I don&#x27;t know what else I would change. I didn&#x27;t buy the other Panasonic models because some of the extra features seemed \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; -like the light and the vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that these micro trimmers tend to die after a few years, I will update this review if this unit loses it&#x27;s effectiveness or if it encounters any other issues.  For now, if you need a personal trimmer, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Use the kitchen scissors or a pocket knife. The \\&quot;ER\\&quot; in the name should stand for the Emergency Room. Take it there at once. I have an older Panasonic unit that still works, and it&#x27;s 100 X&#x27;s better than this one.</li>
            <li> After using the Panasonic ER411 nose trimmer for a couple of years I decided to purchase a new one. The ER411 was no longer available so I purchased the ER4155SC. Big mistake in one week the plastic on the blade broke. It will cost more to ship it than to buy a better one.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ER415SC Nose and Ear Trimmer, Silver[[ASIN:B000O5VKK0 Panasonic ER415SC Nose and Ear Trimmer, Silver]]</li>
            <li> This did a decent job of trimming nose hair, but the retention clips that hold the blade cover to the body of the unit broke off after a few month&#x27;s use, making the trimmer useless. The plastic is thinnest where the clips are (were); not a very good design, as they can break off easily. I could super-glue the blade cover back on and have use of the trimmer again, but then I wouldn&#x27;t be able to clean it out, so this is not the most hygienic option.</li>
            <li> I was concerned buying this item given a number of reviews suggesting this particular model is not as good as older models and that it can catch/pull hairs. I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case.  This seems EXACTLY like the one I bought about a decade ago. In all the years I&#x27;ve used these trimmers, I&#x27;ve never had it pull or catch.  I think its a very good product.</li>
            <li> I HAVE AN ER411 WORKS GREAT. UP GRADE TO ER415SC WHAT A MISTAKE IT CANT FIND THE HAIR EVEN IF IT HAD RADAR. DON&#x27;T BUY. SCOTTSDALE AZ</li>
            <li> When I bought this particular model, my reasoning was: well...Panasonic is Panasonic. Not the case...you get what you pay for. I still like and will buy Panasonic. The old motto is still valid: You get what you pay for. This particular model doesn&#x27;t catch the hair very well if at all, even after several passes. You probably need to spend at least $35.00 for a good model.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly, as described and performs well with ALOT of nose hair - no pain, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Most trimmers do not work well. This one does.[[ASIN:B000O5VKK0 Panasonic ER415SC Nose and Ear Trimmer, Silver]]</li>
            <li> Cheap, first one broke after 8 months, second one, 3 months. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works well, delivered on time. My nostrils are clean and happy.</li>
            <li> I have owned this trimmer for many years but dropped it recently and needed to replace it. The previous one was excellent.  The new one is the same model but with a different type of internal trimmer.  It is absolutely useless. I am keeping it for the motorized end and because I saved the internal trimmer from the one I dropped.  If you are a first time purchaser of this particular model, don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best thing i have brought&lt;br /&gt;it does the job very well good price will no be without it&lt;br /&gt;i dont know how long it last but i will allways have one&lt;br /&gt;very safe to us well made thanks panasonic</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer and reasonably priced. Great service as always, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer batteries last pretty long but changing to a rechargable type will become more economical.  Highly recommend this product for tough as wire nose hair(s) removal.</li>
            <li> I have used many trimmers that last only a few months, yet this trimmer works fast, cuts 100% and I use it in the shower all the time!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used the older Panasonic ER411 nose trimmer for a long time and really liked it.  It gives a very close shave.  So I decided to get a new one, and bought this ER415SC.  I was horrified to find out that they changed the design for the worse, since it no longer gives a close shave!  They must have changed the clearance of the blades.  What a waste of money.  I went back to the older ER411.  Let Panasonic know that they should go back to the older design which worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on experience with an older Panasonic model and despite bad reviews. In fact, the reviews of issues with the cutting ability were correct and it was a poor performer. However, I noticed that the cap from the old model fit as did the blade mechanism... so I took this device and replaced the cutting mechanism and cap with that from the older model and now it works like a charm.    If anyone from Panasonic is reading this, they should really just replace those pieces in the current or next shipping models... as now after my changes, it is as good as the original.</li>
            <li> I got this from Ava Productions . It didn&#x27;t work out of the box. I called the reseller Ava Production , he told me that only Amazon customer seem to have an issue with this product. Interestingly Amazon has a no return policy for this product so I am struck with this piece of C&amp;^%. Amazon however offered a credit for this product but not the reseller . The reseller even told me that I don&#x27;t know how to put the battery in. Given a choice I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I find this works on nose and ear hair as well as eye brows. Not trying to cut anything thick but it trims well</li>
            <li> Totally gets rid of nose hairs.  This is a much better product that the one I used to have.  Pain free, quick, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product never worked and by the time we tried to use it, it was too late to return.</li>
            <li> Its was cheap and works good enough said. But to get free shipping you have to buy something else to get it up over 25 bucks lol. I bought the Hank Williams cd that now I&#x27;m glad I bought it satisfied with both items.</li>
            <li> There is no better trimmer for the money.  You can spend a whole lot more money but it won&#x27;t beat this choice.  Don&#x27;t look any further or bother looking for another trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer that I have found.. I tried two types of another brand, much to my dissatisfaction.  This works!</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 6 months and batteries don&#x27;t last as long as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> item received in exit requirements</li>
            <li> Great product. Worked perfectly as advertised. Highly recommended. I owned one from Panasonic before and it did the job just fine.</li>
            <li> I like this little trimmer. My nostrils do feel funny right after shaving them up (a little prickly) but that isn&#x27;t the trimmers fault. It gets right up in there and does a nice job with little hair pulling.  It uses batteries and isn&#x27;t rechargable which is kind of dissapointing but means it should last a long time since you can easily add a new batter.  It comes with a cap and says it is washable, so far mine hasn&#x27;t minded being run under the tap briefly.  Not sure how it would work shaving other body parts but for the nostrils it is right on the nose.</li>
            <li> During the preferential purchase, use convenient, cleaning is very clean, very happy shopping</li>
            <li> Stopped working after one month.  Now I have a hairy nose.</li>
            <li> does an okay job... not great, not poor.  I hear it cutting but when I empty the cap, not much in there... but not bad product for the money.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I needed and I use it often!  I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.  Definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic trimmer finally died after 10 years plus.  This new trimmer is quieter and so much sharper.  Trims really close without nicking the skin.  Very satisfied.  Ridiculessly cheap sale price at around ten bucks.</li>
            <li> fast, smooth action. Am well pleased</li>
            <li> I hate to admit that I&#x27;m getting older, but this is one of those necessary items for a man my age.  It does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a difficult review to write because you need something to compare it with.   The only battery powered trimmer that I am familar with is the Conair NE152CS Ultimate Turbo Nose/Ear Trimmer and on that basis alone, I give this Panasonic ER415SC five stars.  I originally thought that the Conair would be a very good battery powered trimmer because unlike what appears to be all other battery powered trimmers, the Conair requires two batteries and I thought the extra power would be a very good thing.  Don&#x27;t make that mistake.  Also check out the reviews for the Conair; so, so. And the price has been substantially reduced.  This ER4515SC with one battery is excellent.  It cuts very easily and cuts the hairs very close.  What I don&#x27;t understand are the other models by Panasonic that include either a \\&quot;light\\&quot; or a \\&quot;vacuum system.\\&quot;  Are lights and vacuums really needed on a nose hair trimmer!  Doesn&#x27;t the light or vacuum take power from the one battery instead of devouting all of the juice to the cutting mechanism which is the point to having a nose hair trimmer.  Yes, I know that the light is to be used not simultaneously with the cutting mechanism but instead to look into your nose before or after cutting.  Really!  I guess there are people who don&#x27;t have a light above their bathroom mirror.  Or is the light intended to be used when you go camping and the Coleman lantern doesn&#x27;t reach that far.  As for the vacuum, vacuum what?  If you believe that there are lose hairs remaining in your nose, try something novel: blow your nose!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of these.  They work great for about 1 year of use perhaps once every 3 weeks for about 5 minutes.  But after that they all start to break down after about 1 year....they won&#x27;t run fast or consistently even with new batteries.    Panasonic should work on making these last longer.....people might be better off paying more for the one from sharper image...</li>
            <li> After reading countless user reviews of these devices I finally decided that this contraption had the price and positive review combination I was looking for. I have had the trimmer for over a year and it works great, has not needed a battery replacement, is easily cleaned, and is very helpful generally. A great purchase for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Handy for quick personal care . It made a nice gift.</li>
            <li> I have had three of these units at this point. The units work fine but there is one huge design flaw. When you open it up the unit to emtpy the clippings the nylon blade assembly falls out and in my case it goes down the drain. If the price was not so low I would be so mad I would not repurchase this item,</li>
            <li> The sign of an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; man:  long fingernails, ear hair, nose hair, rogue eyebrow hair.  This device assists in eliminating two of the signs of someone who has let themselves go.  Great device.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after I used it 4 times. Super not cool.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace a generic device that had given up the ghost.  Very well built and sturdy--I was quite impressed with the Panasonic trimmer.  Serves its function very well.</li>
            <li> Never bought a nose hair trimmer before, I am now 38 and do not want to look like my old shop teacher from high school. Researched many many models before I bought and got this model. Also purchsase the Panasonic ER112BC at the same time. The ER112BC was like [..]so I figured that if the spify one breaks as I have read these units never hold up too long, I would have a backup. The Er415SC is nice and you can do your ears and nose but it seems to lack juice. If you want to do detail work it is great but takes awhile to get the job done. I tried the cheapie one and it did the job with gusto. No nicks or cuts, but I now even breath better after using it. It has helped my snoring. No more twezzers or scissors. If you are just out for nose hair and use a beard trimmer like me for all other grooming get a few of the ER112BC and you wont be dissapointed. To the guys who say these things do not cut or twist hair mine works just fine. Your unit must be old- dull or you have a jungle in there.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to replace a similar one that broke after several years of use (also Panasonic).    I found it to be much less powerful than the previous version. It does not trim hair quickly and you need to try several times. Even then it does not trim well.    Look for something as sturdy but more powerful.</li>
            <li> Good product, nice delivery. Is and standard product, but with quality, and you can clean with water directly. it&#x27;s very important the mark Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Good and cheap!  I used it once and it&#x27;s efficient.  I wish there was some way that it&#x27;d tickle less, but at least it&#x27;s painless!  That&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> Works very well when new. Too bad it is near impossible to obtain replacement blade assemblies. But the unit is cheap enough to replace every year or so if needed, just it is a bit wasteful to design a product this way, since the motor base never wears out.</li>
            <li> All of us adults have nose hairs, and the more senior among us have it growing out of our ears as well. This little gadget will help you take care of both. My only negative is that I must sometimes tap it against the counter to get it going, after I have flipped the switch to turn it on.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product.  This is the best one I have seen so far.  It is cheap and works perfectly.  It does not give you pain while using it.  I purchased about 10 of these and gave for presents to friend and relatives who sufferd from similar not good products.  I love it</li>
            <li> This trimmer/groomer works perfectly. It does the job without any hassle. I&#x27;m sort of a hairy person and using to cut the nose hair is super. You&#x27;d feel a slight tickling and that&#x27;s about it. Perfectly safe and you can use it to trim the eyebrows and the inside/outside of the ear as well. I gave it only 4 stars cuz I believe there&#x27;s always a room for improvement.</li>
            <li> Trimmers work great.  Compact and operates very well on the AA battery.  For the money, its the best out there.  And you probably don&#x27;t need the one with the light attached.</li>
            <li> The 415SC trimmer worked OK for about a month but stopped working while I was travelling.  Finally remembered I&#x27;d left it in the travel case and replaced the battery.  Still didn&#x27;t function.  Another cheap product, not really at about four dollars per nose hair trim, in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had different versions of this for everyday use and found others not as reliable (even ones purchased in Japan which were Japan only models). This is my third purchase as being wet/dry is a real plus. Wish it was smaller but not a big drawback.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming nose and ears.  That is what I got it for.  Requires one AA Battery to make it run.</li>
            <li> When I got this trimmer two years ago it worked well on the first battery. After that though, it never got back up to usable speed with new batteries. I could never figure out why that is. Also, the claim the manufacture makes about it being rinse-able is false. The blade will rust on you faster than a 1 minute microwave meal if you rinse it. There are better models that cost around the same or less.</li>
            <li> This item replaces a Panasonic trimmer I purchased over ten years ago from Brookstone. This trimmer has a built in safety feature that prevents the cutting head from going too close to the skin. The older model provided a much closer cut. I have since returned to the older trimmer which has a damaged head and sounds like its coming apart, but still gives a good close cut for the nose and ears. I wish I bought this in a bricks and mortar store so I could take it back.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he is satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> Panasonic outsources its customer service to a third party in the Philippines and needs to review the performance of that company.  It is horrible. I bought a model ER430 which stopped working after less than three months, the blade just stopped coming into contact with the hair and failed to trim anything.  I returned the product to Panasonic&#x27;s McAllen&#x27;s center in Tx and have been in caught in customer service hell ever since.  I threw aways the original receipt and can only provide the return center and the Philippines third party a copy of the credit card receipt for the sale.  Not good enough for them.  Anonymous emails, and letters from both assuring me they value my business but continuing to ask for a piece of paper I do not have.  No personal contact with Panasonic allowed.  Third party refuses to identify its corporate identity, only provides first name of current rep.  Poor manufacturing quality.  Panasonic does not stand behind its products.  Warranty is worthless.</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift for my son.  He likes it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect, no problem tool for removing annoyingly visible nose hair.  Lost my previous one and have been using tiny scissors.  Great to have the proper equipment back.</li>
            <li> it is very useful thank you.</li>
            <li> I have had many types of Nose/Ear trmmers over the years and this is by far the best I have ever used and I highly recommend it to all. I love the fact that it is wet/dry. I use it everyday and will purchase another to keep in my travel case. Typical Panasonic product, great quality!</li>
            <li> This is great!  I&#x27;ve only owned it for about 1 month, but I was really skeptical.  The first time I used it I cringed when I turned it on.  I was waiting for pain----NO PAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it was time to review the results.  This things is far too easy.  It gets all the hair the first time and you are looking great!  There is no excuse for any guy to not have one of these.  Great product boys, order one today!</li>
            <li> This is a very cheap product and that is why it is not worth it. It does work but gets rust very fast. It is better to expend more money for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> This was chosen to replace an earlier model of the same groomer that I had used for at least five years. Unfortunately, the blade assembly dropped out when it was being cleaned, without being noticed and was lost, and I had to purchase a new groomer. The old one was still working fine before the loss of the blade assembly. The new groomer is even better than the old one and I love it. Don&#x27;t bother to look any further! This groomer is great!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is a bit larger than needed and the plastic is of poor quality but the product does what it says it will. Decent enough accessory.</li>
            <li> Thank you, 5 stars from me</li>
            <li> As my title suggests... DO NOT BUY THIS! I thought I could risk getting a cheap nose trimmer and have it work semi-decent (as I only need it occasionally). It proved that buying this was a mistake. First, it worked poorly, snagging nose hairs and getting stuck multiple times every time I used it. The third time I used it, literally the third time!, it crapped out on me! I gave it new batteries, tried to open it up, slammed it on the counter, the whole spiel, but to no avail. This is a worthless product not worth your money. I recommend Norellco G370 if you want a good nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> works great...I have had more expensive models that have not works this well.  Easy on-off switch.</li>
            <li> This item will do all it says and more.  Great power and great hand held design highly recommend for the price value.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER415SC is a great clipper.  Had one for several years before it quit working.  Bought another brand to replace it but threw it out and went back to this clipper.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> First trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, works well. Does the job</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product is great !</li>
            <li> Panasonic changed the blades in the 415 and it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as it should. It is worthless. The old style 410 and 420 blades were better.</li>
            <li> This tool surpassed my expectations on performance.  Guys, you don&#x27;t have to wait until you visit your hairstylist  /barber to get your ear hairs cut!  This is much more convenient and safe!</li>
            <li> was not satisfied with the prod ER415sc. er411 is better as i have used it in past and it is awesome just little pricey.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on several brands and different models, i chose this one!, Even though it didnt have the best overall reviews (just like all the rest i read about regardless of brand or model...as it seems you cant make anyone happy with anything anymore!)!, But i take most all reviews with a grain of salt and like i said chose this one as did like the features...as will do more than just nose and ear hairs as it states on box will also do Eyebrows, lashes, mustache or any unwanted facial hair safely, has a great 2-year warranty from Panasonic, And so far been working like it should and doing a great job!, However the box states it comes with a cleaning brush...it didnt...but no biggy as there just as simple to clean without it anyway...follow instructions to remove blade cap with no tools needed (which in fact for any maintenance on it!), rinse and dry and if you find you need a brush just use a old soft bristle toothbrush...not rocket Science to do!, The only thing i noticed which was in the reviews is i dont think the one AA battery is enough power for it to run very long without changing it!...but again, the price is right...and again...so far, so good and beats and safer than clipping those kind of hairs with small scissors anyway! LOL!</li>
            <li> perfect size, good for travel and to carry on the go, smooth and not noisy at all, can´t beat the price...</li>
            <li> Panasonic puts out a great product again.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift. It is Good.</li>
            <li> Works great, going on 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Works great.  Does what it says.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Bought the product for my husband who thinks it&#x27;s the best for doing the job right.  He had tried several other brands and found them lacking.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had good luck with nose/ear trimmers -- tried many brands including Norelco and Remington. I found Panasonic model, ER416, Wet/Dry, to be the best though. Seems to have good power and definitely trims hair. It stopped working after I dropped it, but worked agsin once I made sure all the components were back in place and lined up with the notches on the head of the unit.</li>
            <li> He liked it so much and wanted a 2nd one, in case it was ever discontinued.  He is aware that if he really likes something, it is often discontinued and he can never buy it again and then he would be SO disappointed. So one is in use, the other in the cupboard.</li>
            <li> Decent upgraded nose/ear hair trimmer, better than the entry level products.  Guard protects skin from any possible cuts/damage, and does a thorough job of trimming with minimal effort.  Not much to it, but good reliable product for personal grooming.  Bought as a replacement for a several year old cheaper Wahl model, and definitely satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li> I purchsed this trimmer to replace a 10 year old Panasonic trimmer that had served me very well until I fractured it on the bathroom floor. Even after that, it worked better than this model. I should have been more leary when, fresh from package, I installed a battery and the cutter would not spin. I opened the trimming section, fiddled with the blade and cone and successfully got the thing started. It has never spun at the velocity of it&#x27;s predecessor, nor does it cut any thing like the broken unit. It will, however, pull the hair right out of your nose, if that pleases you. I would only recommend this item to someone who would enjoy a wake call. This POS will leave a mark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a month now and it works perfectly.  The battery I put into it is still going strong, but I do not use it every day.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER415SC Nose, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry hair trimmer works great for trimming nose hair and ear hair .&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought two, the quality is very good A man send a oneself use.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer and makes smooth cuts with no pulling of hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not a nose hair trimmer connoisseur but have owned several in the past with no issues. This particular one, the Panasonic ER415SC, was purchased in 2013 and was inferior from the start. The LED guide light is a joke, mine was installed incorrectly and angled 3 inches away from the area you really need to be illuminated making it worthless. But it seemed to cut reasonably well, for about a month until it began running so slowly that it pulled rather than cut the hairs. I replaced the battery over and over thinking this was the problem but even with a new battery, it still refused to run for more than 10 seconds. The battery is now in my TV remote and the trimmer is in the trash, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Husband always used scissors, but after using this efficient and effective tool.... he has switched completely.&lt;br /&gt;Does a fantastic job, and keeps him trimmed.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be a big improvement over the junk one I bought 10 Years ago.  However I thing Panasonic only made minor improvements on the old one.  Mainly, it is underpowered by the single AA battery.  The motor struggles at times even with the light hair I have (nose and ears).  It does a fair job, but still needs a better head/cutter unit and could use one or two more batteries to keep it at full speed and for repeated uses.  That said... it still is the best one I have found to date.</li>
            <li> works like a rotary lawn mower, gets everything!!</li>
            <li> Works very well, and it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li> My old lady was always bitchin about my nose hair poking out of my nostrils, so she bought me this trimmer.  It is easy to use and keeps the grass trimmed.  Not much else to say.  If you are getting a lot of flack about nose hair, this little bugger can buy you some peace.</li>
            <li> It is working very well so far,,pretty handy too.Keep up the good work!Maybe if there&#x27;s more products they&#x27;ll sell for cheap then maybe Id buy more from them!Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite grooming tool.  He had a very old one which finally wore out.  This works very well.</li>
            <li> it does the job..brand new factory sealed.. no problems ..quick delivery..i will probably give these as gifts for xmas..big thanks</li>
            <li> Love it i can breath much better now</li>
            <li> I usually have nose hair.  This quickly gets rid of it without feeling a thing. I don&#x27;t know about the ear hair part.</li>
            <li> Stopped working in 3 months. Don&#x27;t buy this, cheap!</li>
            <li> The blade had disappeared out of my old one, so I ordered another (then the blade conveniently appeared). This is absolutely wonderful for cleaning out all those nasal hairs that threaten to turn into a second mustache.</li>
            <li> This model is in no way even close to the ER421, which costs about 6 dollars more.  This one (ER415) never worked well from day one...I just ordered a new ER421; my old ER421 needed a new blade and they are hard to find and expensive...may as well buy a new one...its that good.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Good value</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised. But then ... Who wants to talk about trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> Exceeds expectations in every way. Quiet operation, effective and well built.</li>
            <li> Of course on amazon.com, after 30 days you can not return the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most suppliers who sell products let you return them if they fail..even after 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is clearly very low quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a sharper image nose trimmer for 10 years and never had a problem with it.  I will NEVER purchase another electronic gadget from you again,  Macy&#x27;s Wal Mart and Walgreens sell similar products and I will move over to purchasing from them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my husband. I don&#x27;t see why you need a separate tool just for nose / ear hair. There are other men trimmers that do just as well and work for multiple things.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion. Well packaged. I have bought many trimmers in the past , this one is comfortably quite , fits well in hand &amp; cuts without pulling hairs . Being waterproof allows me to spray a organic disinfectant onto the blades, allowing to air dry without worrying about rusting the blades or corroding the motor . I have 2 now &amp; keep the second one in the RV for weekends away from home .</li>
            <li> I bought this facial hair remover to replace one of a different brand that had stopped working.  I was very happy to find it at a great price and even more happy to find out how well it works.  Men are not the only ones who have excessive nose hair, and it is even more embarrassing for a woman, I imagine.  It does not pinch or hurt to use it and does the job it is supposed to do.  I have not tried it in ears, since I don&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
            <li> I had another trimmer that finally failed after several years; this has been a great replacement, I use it on a regular basis with no issues.</li>
            <li> Minimal tug on the hairs unlike the old days. I had it on my wishlist for awhile because I remember how the old models yanked like I was pulling hair with my fingers. Finally got it and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> We have had this nose hair trimmer before but it got damaged so we bought it again. We like it, it does the job and works very well.</li>
            <li> works good.&lt;br /&gt;I hate messing with nose hairs and this makes quick work of them.</li>
            <li> This is not a quality product. It seems like it should be straightforward enough but maybe I should have spent a little more money. When the head does not fall off which is almost never, they are quite simply, ineffective. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and actually my second one since I wore out the first one.  I use it daily to eliminate hair in my ears.</li>
            <li> it works very well but looks cheap we will see if it lasts long! but for now it is fine.</li>
            <li> does a good job and is comfortable</li>
            <li> Purchased for my elderly mom - she loves it!!  Definitely a safe way to remove nasal hair without the fear of injury.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect.  Great price, Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Works like any trimmer not better or worse. It is a cheap trimmer! Does what it says and uses a AA battery.</li>
            <li> This trimmer performs okay.  I was sort of disappointed with it however.  The motor lags even with fresh batteries.  You know, it sounds like the motor is about to quit working at any moment or is slowing down.  Just weird.  It still cuts hair though.  I can&#x27;t recommend it based on my experience.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s better than I expected!  Works very well and I like the cap connected on the end as it makes for better handling.</li>
            <li> Very good product I recommend it 100%, Excellent quality, good for presents for your dad, uncle, brother. recommend for personal use</li>
            <li> My husband loves this little gadget.  It may sound gross but it does a neat job of removing nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great bang for the buck device that uses real cutters... instead of the old clapper-thrasher crap so many of their competitors are pushing. I would recommend using Ultimate Lithium batteries in it. They last longer, give it more oomph, and ensure that you&#x27;re going to be cutting rather than pulling hair even when you&#x27;re moving along at a pretty good pace.</li>
            <li> I have two apartments, bought one of these for each location. Bought another name brand before, but dropped it and it stopped working. But not the Panasonic. Works great, and is reliable.</li>
            <li> It works well. I just hope it lasts! It doesn&#x27;t necessarily feel cheap but it foes not feel well made either. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  it was very reasonable, so may not last a real long time, but it sure is perfect now.</li>
            <li> Trims the hairs, just like it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve never used a nose trimmer so nothing to compare it to, but it seems to be fine! Doesn&#x27;t come with a battery. That was kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> It does a excellent work trimming those annoying ear and nose hair. The only con is that this device is a made in plastic and I dropped once and got damaged a little. I wish they made it stronger.</li>
            <li> ★★★★★★★★★★thank you ★★★★★★★★★★</li>
            <li> I have tried others this by far is the best. I highly recommend it, it&#x27;s a great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> this is a third one that I bought for family members. This is a nice tool, convenient, easy to use, and  reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I guess it works well but I noticed that the batteries seem to drain in a couple months, even without being used.  I can&#x27;t explain it but my last one did too.  It was a different model but also by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The best fine hair trimmer I have used; much less painful yanking that other brands.  I accidentally dropped mine and the tolerances between the blade and the guard are miniscule; one slightly bent piece of metal killed the hole device.  I realize this small gap is what makes it work so nicely, so I ordered another and grasp it firmly.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me.  Technology has advanced....this product is designed more efficient than my previous nose and facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Pulls nose hairs instead of cutting them. He won&#x27;t use it, and I don&#x27;t blame him! :(</li>
            <li> Pretty good and less expensive than most.  The older model (10 years ago, had sharper blades and did a better job.)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it for long, but so far it doesn&#x27;t yank the hairs out.</li>
            <li> A durable little trimmer for those of us sporting the nosebeard.  It will get what you&#x27;re too lazy to go at with tweezers.</li>
            <li> This is a great product really works well.</li>
            <li> Used it once...and even that time I had to fiddle with the switch and battery to get it to come on.  Went to use a second time and wont work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess you get what you paid for, very poor quality</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a while the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; got dull.</li>
            <li> It is a great trimmer but the batteries go dead quick.  I mean really really quick and they do not last long.  I give it 3 stars for 2 reasons.&lt;br /&gt;The first is that I bought 2 because I had 2 before.  The 2 i bought did not work after 6 months.  I consider them disposable.  The cost is in batteries.  They could make it bigger just to take another battery or something but the battery life is UTLTRA short.&lt;br /&gt;I mean a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, while it lasts, it is the closest trimmer available.</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see how this new one does.  I had ordered one some time ago and it just quit, changing batteries did not help.  I hope this one is better.  I like the product though.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 7-8 uses. then died!</li>
            <li> Broke 3 weeks into use.  Surprising for Panasonic.</li>
            <li> All we expected ! Also speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> This does the job would buy it again.  Battery makes it user friendly and easy to take along on your travels.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to all our other beauty aids.  Makes it easier for me to keep my husband all trimmed in his ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get one these for a long time, I think it&#x27;s the best way to describe this item: Easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for several months after my Panasonic ER421KC was damaged.  100% improvement.  The battery lasts much longer and the motor spins faster.  The light on the 421 was useless.  For my buck, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> this little beast of a grooming tool still going, works as described.not much else to say good deal and you get groomed with it for sure.</li>
            <li> I have had the Panasonic ER415SC for about 13 months now.  It fell off the bathroom counter onto the floor and now it doesn&#x27;t work any more.  I had purchased it to replace my ER411, which stopped working.  The ER411 was great, with a close cutting blade.  The ER415SC is a different design and doesn&#x27;t do as good a job.  I was disappointed.  I&#x27;m not sure what to get now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thing to clip my nose hair and ear hair (that I can&#x27;t see).  It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of trimming the hair, so I have to take a long time to get the job done by going back over and over my nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously owned two of the MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmers[[ASIN:B0019ZZFJ6 MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer]], and they worked OK, but I thought I&#x27;d give this Panasonic a try.  I&#x27;m going to buy the Mangroomer again.  It works better than the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that a lot of these trimmers are manufactured by the same maker, but even if the Mangroomer has the same maker as the Panasonic, the Mangroomer worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advice:  If you don&#x27;t use a trimmer for wet hair, I advise keeping the machine in a plastic zip lock bag [[ASIN:B003UEMOWA Ziploc Storage Bag, Gallon Value Pack, 40-Count(Pack of 3)]]when it&#x27;s not in use.  I did this with my second Mangroomer, and it worked longer than the first Mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use a trimmer about every month or so when I feel the nose hair brush my cheeks in a strong wind and the ear hair makes it hard for me to hear the TV. My experience is that these trimmers only last a few months no matter how you store them or how often you use them, so don&#x27;t count on leaving your trimmer in your will to anybody.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> This item works exactly as advertised and as expected.  Panasonic is a reliable name and I am pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> First time user. So far it is working well for me.I would recommend it to anyone that asked about it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the closest shave but it does what I want it to do so far. Works to a decent efficiency with batteries and doesn&#x27;t cut too close. It could probably use a slightly closer shave but I have no problem recommending this as long as it stays together. Seems well built to me, another normal quality product form overseas.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do. I use it more on ear hair. I know that sounds funny but my ear lobes occasionally grow a fuzz and even my ear canal. This works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt. Although the snapping sound as it cuts the hair is kinda scary at first. Nice product!</li>
            <li> No complaints on this thing. I was getting &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; and this worked in inner ear, outer ear, nose... even eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This works great for the hubby! Easy to use, pain free and easy to clean! I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> No Good doesn&#x27;t work as expected waste of money</li>
            <li> I have used this quite a few times.  It&#x27;s adequate, it works--that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:&lt;br /&gt;♦ Easy to replace battery&lt;br /&gt;♦ Battery lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;♦ Easy to take apart for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;♦ It&#x27;s very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Not particularly efficient. Takes numerous passes to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;√ Overall, so-so performance, but at this price, a decent value.</li>
            <li> Perfect and great price!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40+ years old. I got hair growing in weird places, and in the normal places hair is growing like weeds. Take my nose for instance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this thing for about a month, and use it once a week (is that normal for nose hair to grow this fast?), and it works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;* arrived in the sealed OEM packaging/box&lt;br /&gt;* instructions were so-so. the device itself is easy to figure out if you bother to spend a few minutes with it, but the marking on the device and as detailed in the manual are pretty small and it&#x27;s not easy to see what you&#x27;re supposed to be doing. But you figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;* works wet, so you can clean it under the faucet. just like most **I&#x27;m going to hide this one here... for the ladies it makes a nice travel buddy (only one speed though) that doesn&#x27;t look like a travel buddy thus eliminating any embarrassing TSA searches. SO I&#x27;VE HEARD** shavers/clippers these days. can confirm that i was not electrocuted when putting device under water, and more importantly that water did not get into the battery compartment&lt;br /&gt;* it takes a single AA battery. this is a PRO to me because then I don&#x27;t have to waste another outlet plug for a device that I&#x27;ll use only occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;* this thing whirrs like a champ - so much so that it really tickles my nose and I end up sneezing a bit from all of that flying debris. but when i blow my nose, there&#x27;s hair bits everywhere, so yeah, it works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;* it&#x27;s not 100% easy to clean. you have to turn the head a bit to unfasten it, but it all seems delicate in that too much torque will snap a small but critical piece of plastic. would have preferred a a push-button release to get to this area.&lt;br /&gt;* the manual is definitely lacking, but again this isn&#x27;t a dual overhead cam engine (I have no idea what that is, I just remember it from 80&#x27;s TV commercials... and it sounds cool)&lt;br /&gt;* it&#x27;s a slider on/off mechanism. i don&#x27;t like sliders, i prefer push button on/off switches which i thought it was based on the picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong for $10. I&#x27;ve had this Tweezerman nose hair clipper for years (the twisty one, not the squeezy one), and I now keep the Tweezerman in my travel kit and this one in the master bath.</li>
            <li> it was a gift  he uses it all thetime</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my old Panasonic that was dropped &amp; broke.  I found other brands/models in stores and even bought a couple of them.  They were more expensive and did not do a good job (I made sure they were returnable before I purchased them!).  Finally found this on Amazon and have been very happy with it.  It is at least as good as my old one, it was inexpensive, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow! For such a cheap little trimmer, this item works great!! It does the job quickly and easily. I definitely recommend this product. A+++</li>
            <li> not too great or powerful but works as well as my previous trimmer (different brand), same size and same color, but a good value at $7.99 on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for the money. Don&#x27;t buy con air, buy this panasonic one. You will not regret it for the price, if you&#x27;re flush with money, get the one with the vacuum.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my Panasonic ER411 with the new ER415 since the ER411 is no longer available. The ER415 does not perform even close to the ER411. I noticed the head openings are fewer and smaller which accounts for the performance. The ER415 does not cut nose hairs and pulls nose hairs. The ER415 simply does not do the job and is not a replacement for the much superior ER411.Panasonic destroyed a good product.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3 months. Very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> What I like  is that this groomer cuts much closer than a fancy chrome plated model I tried.  The first one got to the point that it pulled more hair than it cut which was painful but as noted the closeness of the cut is great.</li>
            <li> I just got it so I don&#x27;t know how it will stand up over time. It works great and does what it says it should do. I especially like the fact that it takes one AA battery instead of charging, meaning that you can use it at the drop of a hat without having to worry about plugging it in to charge it first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been impressed with this product. It doesn&#x27;t clean easily and clogs up. Feels underpowered. I&#x27;m looking for something else. I wish I could return this.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it, it was a gift for him.</li>
            <li> exacty what I Wanted works great!</li>
            <li> This is my first Hair Trimmer so I can&#x27;t compare this to other product.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this is a great product and does its job.</li>
            <li> WORKS PERFECTLY AND CUTS MY HAIR WITHOUT ANY PAIN. GREAT PRODUCT. WORKS ONLY ONBATTERY</li>
            <li> excellent product, everything was very well received.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Efficient and comfortable. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know these things cut your nose... lol. But it works, it gets the job done. I hated the fact that it didn&#x27;t come with a darn battery which was annoying because then I had to order those but other than that it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is my second ear, nose trimmer and the better of the two, it comes with a cap to put on top when not in use, compact size, It works great for me, if you never owned one before its a lot easier and quicker than using scissors and tweezers, Great price too.</li>
            <li> Great service!  We ordered the Panasonic nose and ear hair trimmer on Saturday.  It arrived on Monday.  He used it for the first time on Tuesday.  Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for  It is a great buy and I am happy that I found it here instead of searching all the stores</li>
            <li> Everything has changed since I purchased this nose hair trimmer. I&#x27;m confident, my posture, my love life, and my social life have all dramatically improved!! I no longer live in fear of errant nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it.  Great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I love that it&#x27;s waterproof. And it cuts every hair down to the skin. So smooth. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> i really loved this product. i use it for my nose; one thing i was extremely happy about is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! it is very easy to use however, i do find it difficult to clean! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one before, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but I find it easy to use and works well</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it just interesting what hair does as you get older?  This does the trick painlessly for thos interesting nose hairs.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t work on the second day of receivig it.</li>
            <li> Cheaper at amazon.com than at a retail mall speciality store, and cheaper to replace whole unit than just the trimmer head parts. This was a replacement for a five-year old ER415 with dull trimmer head and is virtually identical, expect for the color of a couple of plastic parts.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an older one, also Panasonic.  This new one is great, quiet, cuts close and is so smooth running I can hardly tell it is on.  Of course most things with the Panasonic name on them are high quality items, and usually last a very long time. I also got a reasonable price, very fast shipping.  Another great buy from the big A.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item after reading the reviews.  Initially, it wouldn&#x27;t work and I almost returned it.  But, after messing with it, wiping out the inside where the battery \\&quot;touches\\&quot; and turning the top back-and-forth it started to work.  Very finiky... wondering if I got a lemon?</li>
            <li> Works great and the design is top notch.  The blades inside the housing are spring loaded so it cuts without ever snagging.  When actually using the trimmer it cuts well and never tugs or pulls.  The top comes off and you can rinse and clean the blades.  The battery compartment is sealed from water so you can rinse the whole thing off.  Great trimmer for the price!</li>
            <li> Wondering why I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner, because it works great!! Also great for trimming those little tiny hairs on my upper lip and chin that appeared after menopause.</li>
            <li> Does the job!  A clean nostril of long, curled hurts feels so much better.</li>
            <li> For a little more than 10 bucks, this trimmer does its job nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine recently had some intermittent issue where it won&#x27;t start. Also the blades kinda run dull after a while, so you will feel some pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonna buy another one</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective with nose hairs.</li>
            <li> perfect nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> For $12 or whatever I paid for this I wish I had gotten this a long time ago!  Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> This item is sturdy and does what it promises to do. I highly recommend the Panasonic Hair Groomer... HM Guerra</li>
            <li> As one ages, males start growing unwanted hair in and around the ears, on top of the nose, from eyebrows. (If only the unwanted hair would grow in balding spots.) This groomer has nothing extraordinary about it compared to more expensive groomers except the price. Since everything is now manufactured in the Far East and China, I&#x27;m sure it will die a day after the warranty expires, like everything else I&#x27;ve bought over the years. But it is inexpensive, does the job, and we just have to adapt to throwaways and replacements.</li>
            <li> Good looking, very effective and what more is there to say.  I have used several other brands for different places where I stay and this one is the best of them all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he claims it works very well (no pulling/pinching of any sort) but it gets hot very quickly.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t rip the hair out like other&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li> As usual Panasonic quality does the job.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one I wore out.  Pervious one lasted about 8 years.  It is simple, easy to use, and durable.</li>
            <li> Lost this in moving and repurchased it now. Always liked this product. No pain! Does a nice clean job on noses and can even be used on stray hairs under brows if you are careful. Originally purchased this after two others that I did not like at all.  This is an effective grooming tool.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even work when I got it, tried new batteries and everything. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> had maney others this is the best.</li>
            <li> As others have posted, that this is a piece of junk.  After a few uses it stopped working.  I would definitely not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great value, comfortably cuts hair in tight places!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Does its job!</li>
            <li> Gentleman.. do u want to have relations with humans .. then get grooming.. nobody wants to see all that crazy hair growing in places it shouldnt ..  this little gizmo does the trick, its afordable, easy to use, painless. Well designed and does not cut your skin..  cleans up in seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it .. works very well</li>
            <li> Replacement for old one that died when I dropped it after several years of use. This one is quieter and better. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> stopped working within a week.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. Easy to use, lasts a long time. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It stopped working within about 3 months. No sense as to why, it just wont turn on, even with new batteries. Hopefully not user error, but its not like I have particularly grandpa-ish bushman nostrils, so I feel comfortable blaming it on poor quality.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap and very good quality product! I read few negative reviews on breakage, etc. This is not quite correct, if you handle it with care it works just perfectly. Occasional disassembling and rinsing with water of the head would make this baby work for a longer time. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret...</li>
            <li> Very good product high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a little Panasonic trimmer for at least a dozen years.  It&#x27;s getting old and a bit noisy, so I opted to get the new model.  The new one is very quiet and does a pretty fair job.  It requires a bit more maneuvering to get hair out of some places, like inside an ear, than the older model.  That said, I got another brand of trimmer a couple of years ago, as it came free with an electric shaver.  It was so bad that I gave it away!  The Panasonic is good value and with a bit of concentration will make one look sharp.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the job done and is safe and easy to use. I don&#x27;t know why I wasn&#x27;t using this product before. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Perfect for a value of money. I&#x27;m use it ones a week and will definately recoment it</li>
            <li> Good thing this was not a super expensive product.  This is the third trimmer we have purchased.  All three of them \\&quot;not getting the job done\\&quot;!  However, this last one was better than the previous two.  This trimmer does not get all the hair.  So I have to use sissors to complete the job.  It&#x27;s just selective about what hair it wants to remove.  And I&#x27;m not talking about a \\&quot;bush man\\&quot; here.&lt;br /&gt;We can not understand why a seemingly simple product can not perform as it should.  We will be purchasing another one in the hope that it will perform as it should.&lt;br /&gt;Would be great if Panasonic would send us another one for free!  Send us a postage paid envelope and we&#x27;d be happy to send this nearly useless product back.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry about the poor review.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we have purchased many Panasonic products and are very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;Jon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Panasonic before.  I liked it. It had good energy.  It broke years ago and I tried other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have it again and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great too.</li>
            <li> Sorry about the headline, but it&#x27;s hard to get all prosey about a hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it&#x27;s job better than the one I replaced by a long shot.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use it often, and used it mildly for about 3 months, very infrequently. I went to turn it on one morning and nothing happened. Tried new batteries, nothing. Tested the old battery with another product and it still had power. Definitely a waste money in my book.</li>
            <li> My prior one lasted 3.5 years before the motor went. For $11 that suits me fine. It does the job well. Word of advice: do not let the battery get too weak. As the motor slows down, the trimmer begins to pull the air rather than cut it. You&#x27;ll begin to feel the difference before this gets too bad, then you&#x27;ll know to replace the battery. Battery life is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is junk!! Got it for my husband for Xmas and it already is losing power!! I cannot believe amazon is selling a product that is so terrible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many nose trimmers, and I ended up with this one.  I have never seen the one that cuts hairs so smoothly.  Washable feature is very convenient too.</li>
            <li> Terrific!  Have given these as gifts in the past.  Keep one handy always.  Wish old guys used them, ha ha!</li>
            <li> The product arrived and works as advertised.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it and I use it often. I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Kind of underpowered, but that&#x27;s probably by design to be quiet and not hurt you.</li>
            <li> This item replaced a Panasonic one that worked for many years, but the switch failed although the motor and blades were still operational.&lt;br /&gt;Automatically sought a same name one, but very disappointed in it.  Just does not cut or trim as did the original one.  Would look for a more expensive Panasonic or another brand.</li>
            <li> It stop working after three weeks.</li>
            <li> good product.I paid what I expected.Good delivery...I am very satisfy.</li>
            <li> This product is much inferior to the previous trimmer.Don&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer. Loved the old one, hate the replacement.</li>
            <li> Workd as advertised for a month, after that its in the garbage can. It didnt work ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap motor perhaps.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Panasonic ER411 which, while not perfect, did an adequate job.  Unfortunately it became difficult to find a replacement blade, so I purchased the ER415 thinking they had to be similar.  Wrong!  This one does not trim nearly as well, and after only a few uses stopped working.  I tinkered with the battery connection, which worked briefly, but now it has stopped working again.  Very disppointing.  Will think twice about buying a Panasonic again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thought - the Panasonic ER-GN30-K gets pretty good reviews.  If I were to buy one, I would consider ordering from a retailer with a better replacement policy.  Amazon will not replace the item, but Hammacher Schlemmer will.  It costs more ($20 vs $12.50) but at least they will take care of you if it stops working.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!! My husband is now disabled and he can finally take care of these areas with ease and success!</li>
            <li> Have a BF or husband that has hair coming out of every crevice? This is the bathroom tool for you! It works wonders AND traps the little hairs so they don&#x27;t get all over the bathroom counter and sink! Eyebrows, nose, and ears...this takes care of all of it. And for a good price too.</li>
            <li> Works great.does everything it is meant for  .No complaints at all .</li>
            <li> Nice clipper wet or dry  nice trim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got two of these units, one at home and another that I keep in my travel bag.  I&#x27;ve got English/Scottish blood, so I&#x27;m doing my best to ensure that my nose hairs don&#x27;t take over my face, same thing with my ears.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other manufacturers products, but this model is my favorite.  It&#x27;s a simple, well designed product that does a great job.</li>
            <li> trims all ear and nose hairs without pulling at all...As I get older I am getting hair in places that hair shouldn&#x27;t be in my opinion..however, although I have very thick, course hair and it presents a challenge for the best of products and this little ditty goes through it without one tug...I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried several similar products but this one is the best quality of any of them.  It cuts well, and close to the root and it is easy to clean and maintain.  Cost a bit more than others, BUT WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Being over 50 sometimes the old nose hair needs a trim.  This works great.  I used to have a cheap brand from china and it barely worked - tugged the hair out instead of cutting it and was painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried when I got this that it would do the same but it works great, no pain - it just trims.</li>
            <li> My god it&#x27;s started coming out of the smallest holes on me, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m turning into a yeti.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the things I was warned about aging, why did no one tell me how prolific hair would become in these strange places?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least with this I can keep it from turning into a veritable forest.</li>
            <li> These are defective.  I bought one and it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  I used brand new batteries.  I returned it and they sent me another one.  It worked for a couple days, and now it won&#x27;t turn on again.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tickle when I breathe anymore.</li>
            <li> He is very happy with this product. It works like a charm. We will recommand this item to friends. Thanks for having it.</li>
            <li> Very useful anywhere.</li>
            <li> eeeh not my favorite. i have to work to hard to get the area of hair that I want to trim.  i&#x27;ll use it because i paid for it!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well. I had bought one of another brand and was not pleased. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done safely, the are no exposed blades to cut or irritate skin.&lt;br /&gt;Solid quality as expected from Panasonic. Cleans under water. I got mine directly from&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic $10.99 free shipping plus tax.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got nose or ear hair and want to get rid of it, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Had a older version of the same trimmer and took a chance with the newer version, I am not disappointed!  Works better than advertised!  Need a trimmer?  Buy this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Perfect product - fast shipping - thanks</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. It&#x27;s a piece of crap.  Stopped working after 2 uses. It was after the 1 month Amazon return period, which meant having to call Panasonic and deal with their phone maze.....and then pay to ship the product to Texas. Not worth the time for a product this price.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY - DON&#x27;T BUY.</li>
            <li> Good price, and quality</li>
            <li> This is a great hair removal tool. Good quality and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation like so can.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer and less than a month later wasn&#x27;t working. I changed the batteries and still it wasn&#x27;t working. Awful quality. DON&#x27;T BUY IT. IT&#x27;S CHEAP BUT IT&#x27;S CRAP!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic Nose and Ear Trimmer.  I dropped my first one after having it for about ten years and it broke.  During that time I only had to replace the battery once. Later I found the missing piece intact, but by then I had tossed the trimmer. My bad.  Fabulous product for nose hair (I&#x27;m a woman and have yet to find any ear hair at age seventy-one). Very smooth, quiet, just pop in a battery and you&#x27;re set to go.  Can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without mine! Panasonic has always been my favorite brand and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed in one of their products.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer worked fine.. I am very pleased with the product...  I would recommend it to anyone ...</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, but you dont pay much for it.  Dont expect it to last though.  Does the job it is designed to do at least</li>
            <li> Good price &amp; it works great too.</li>
            <li> Occasionally it appears to pull a hair... which isn&#x27;t comfortable in the nose&lt;br /&gt;Overall it works as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> A must to your hygeine regimen!&lt;br /&gt;I use it about once a week or whenever I see those nose or ear hairs sprouting!!!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and rinse clean and another great product from Panasonic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really unclear to me why such a simple, widely distributed consumer grooming product cannot be made to function so that I&#x27;d rate it excellent. This does work fine, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; at the facial hair too much, but the variability of the motor does not inspire confidence. The previous brand I owned, Krups I think, sounded like it was about to die even with a fresh battery. It&#x27;s disappointing when manufacturers take consumers&#x27; reliable purchase/need for such products for granted and do not improve the engineering. Heck, how about a $40 version with coded language in the advertising that means, &amp;#34;This one actually works,&amp;#34; that I could buy?</li>
            <li> I seldom, if ever, have problems with any product displaying the Pansonic brand but this is definitely an exception. Only works about half the time and when it does, \\&quot;pulls\\&quot; the hairs out rather than cuts them. If I wanted that kind of pain I would pull them out myself.  I am debating whether to try another Panasonic trimmer or move on to something else.  I am hoping that a different model will provide different results but for now....this one is going to the junk heap or the Salvation Army, whichever is closer.</li>
            <li> Made in China, high performance price ratio.</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase this trimmer based on positive feedback by others.  Not disappointed at all.  Have used numerous trimmers and they can&#x27;t compare to the Panasonic.  Will make me a life long customer.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father who asked for a nosehair trimmer. He said he liked it (a man of few words).</li>
            <li> Had a particular panasonic that worked great a few years ago and have tried three different ones since and they all are lame.</li>
            <li> My second one . First one finally gave way after 10 years   Easy to use. no nicks or pulls, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this model for about three years. It&#x27;s worked fine for about two and a half of those years.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;simple design&lt;br /&gt;easy to change battery&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Although the blades are easy to access they are not easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Weak - struggles to work&lt;br /&gt;Been nicked a number of times (no idea how but it hurts like hell).</li>
            <li> Does the job without any issues.  Better than other trimmers I have used.  I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a facial trimmer.</li>
            <li> These trimmers do not have much power, the blades move slow and I did not know that it wasn&#x27;t rechargable.</li>
            <li> Overall good with solid performance. Small and light with very easy operation. This item is a good value and well made</li>
            <li> A steal for the price.  Works amazingly well.  I just cannot imagine what more anyone could want, regardless of price.</li>
            <li> This thing is like a weedeater for your nose!  Strong motor that does the job.</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave smooth, but it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should take it apart to clean out the hair (it is very simple) but do it carefully.  I ruined one of these (I don&#x27;t know how) such that the blade rotated, but it didn&#x27;t actually cut the hair.  So, when you reassemble it, treat the blades carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a manually operated one.  But, it was nothing compared to this Panasonic ER415SC</li>
            <li> This did do a good job.  For a while.  Stopped after a few months.  I was disappointed in the lack of quality.</li>
            <li> I have normal hair nose as in it doesn&#x27;t grow wild bushes but left untended it came grow pretty long. Sometimes it gets itchy and I hate having to stick my finger up my nose to scratch the itch. It also makes your nostrils larger the more you stick your fingers up your nose. Anyway, this nose trimmer does the job. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs and does a good job trimming them. If you have tougher nose hair, this product probably isn&#x27;t for you. You probably need a V8 twin turbo nose hair trimmer to do the job.</li>
            <li> It stopped working one day after the return date....  It&#x27;s a piece of crap, and I can&#x27;t even contact Amazon to remedy the situation..</li>
            <li> Before this I used scissors or tweezers. This device is simpler, safer and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed for my husband.  It was inexpensive and is high quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good. work perfect.</li>
            <li> We originally bought this as a White Elephant gift, and one for personal use ... we are quite happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product! Gave my husband this item for Christmas.  He loves it.  Says it works very well.</li>
            <li> Husband loves his. Going on a whole year since hes had it.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this product.</li>
            <li> Works great, does the job, so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Poor job on nose hair, seems under powered. Ok job on ear hair, but overall I am sorry I purchased!</li>
            <li> its good for nose hair everything else not so much.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  Stopped working after a week.  Better off just buying a cheap one at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> THE SHIPPER WAS FINE; JUST ANOTHER AVERAGE PRODUCT MADE IN CHINA.. I MISS THE UNIT MADE BY SHARPER IMAGE- it lasted for years.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide whether to buy this trimmer or the similar ER421, so I bought both of them. This one is much better. All the people who complain that it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough must expect more of a nose-hair trimmer than I do. I just want it to keep the hairs from tickling my nose; I don&#x27;t care if there&#x27;s some stubble left. In fat, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t give a \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; makes me more comfortable sticking it up in my nose where I can&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s doing. So this one works just fine for me, and the batteries last a lot longer than they do in the ER421 with its useless, battery-draining light. This one also has a useful cap that actually stays on if you keep it as I do in a drawer with a bunch of other stuff.</li>
            <li> as always when I&#x27;ve dealt with Amazon, they are true to their word for customer service and a product that I am very happy with...it works great...just like it said on the web site..</li>
            <li> Very convenient! So cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#x27;t you buy this commodity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it can also be washed, convenient and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.</li>
            <li> The title says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can you say about a Nose and Ear Trimmer, it just works better than others.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Boy - that&#x27;s refreshing, eh? &amp;#34; It wins my vote by a hair...&amp;#34; jokes aside, great product</li>
            <li> I have tried other products of this type over the years (many) with various degrees of success.&lt;br /&gt;This one truly delivers....  Very good product for us old guys with nose and ear hair instead of head hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price great product. I don&#x27;t use it very often but it works great when I do use it, I have never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> I use this exclusively for nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is awful, to the point that I am buying a different model.&lt;br /&gt;It fails to cut closely on smaller hairs.  It snags hairs, instead of cutting them which nips at your nostrils, feeling like its actually nicking your skin.  These are fine hairs, it should not be hard to develop a device with blades sharp enough to cut them instead of pulling them.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 6 times over 2 months.  New battery didn&#x27;t help.  Marginal performance before that.  I bought it because it was Panasonic.  Now I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does the job it&#x27;s designed to do but I can&#x27;t imagine the item being designed any less expensively.  It seems to jam up without too much use, has a cheap fragile plastic holder for the tiny razor blades inside the housing (which broke on my last one when they fell out trying to clean it so I had to buy a second one) and I don&#x27;t even know if the razor blade is meant to be replaced at all... meaning you have to buy a whole new unit once the blades dull, which with such a tiny blade surface area is probably... now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d pay more for something better designed i&#x27;m just not sure what that is.  It also doesn&#x27;t trim as close as i&#x27;d like but maybe were just running up against the limits of physics here...</li>
            <li> Very good, very practical!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t replace blades, and it usually stops working in less than 2 years...  there aren&#x27;t many alternatives, so i&#x27;ve bought this one 3 times.  last time i bought a replacement, i also bought another version of this.  i&#x27;ve been using the other one and so far it seems better, but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to have replacement blades for sale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some of these before, and this one is meh. It works, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to spin as fast as my older one. My previous one felt like a weed wacker, but this is like cutting your lawn with scissors. It functions. It does the job. But it could be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of years and it still works like brand new.  Excellent quality and performance.</li>
            <li> How cynical is it to make a product that craps out after 21 months?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It simply will not turn on.  I have tried four different batteries.</li>
            <li> Broke after a few months</li>
            <li> I am an extremely vain person and this works great ;-) I have always used cuticle scissors to trim my nose hair (ewwww) and this works just as well and gets just as close.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed by the functionality of this little product and for the money it has to be one of the best grooming deals on Amazon.  Not only does it cut incredibly close, leaving a smooth result, but it&#x27;s quick too.  There is practically nothing to it.  You insert it and move it around until you hear that the hairs have all been trimmed.  You can actually hear it removing the hair till it&#x27;s smooth, all without cutting your skin.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> nice nose and ear trimmer without all the unnecessary bells and whistles...good price fast delivery</li>
            <li> good product-good quality and performance</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace a no-name one I had bought at a discount store.  After almost a year of trying to use this unit, I ordered the Panasonic unit.  Arrived as promised and from day one has worked perfectly.  No pulling out of nose hairs (a painful characteristic of my other unit) and the blade rotates quite fast.  Has  protective cover cap.  Runs on a single AA cell.  Thanks for the rescue.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this groomer for his ears and it has worked very well for him. He&#x27;s been pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but it also pulls the hair sometimes. Maybe a newer battery would help. I&#x27;ll give that a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a similar model that worked well for years. This one seems to be the same but doesn&#x27;t cut as close or as consistently.</li>
            <li> Received it and its working great!</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Nose, Ear and Facial Hair Trimmer has worked circles around my old trimmer.  I could never quite get the old one to do a good job and I thought that was just the way these things worked.....until.....I decided to try the Panasonic, at a decent price, I might add.  I discovered that this Panasonic model is very easy to use compared to my old one.  It trims very nicely and I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time going over the same areas that I did on my old one....and....to top it off, I can rinse it under the water faucet to clean it out....the old one. I had to take apart and clean it which was a pain.  I guess all this is to say I was very pleasantly surprised to find out that this Panasonic does a very good job.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and it meets my expectations. This is the second one I owned. The first lasted for many years but occasionally you had to jostle it or reinsert batteries to get it going. For the money I recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works to my satisfaction. Like most of Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> very easy and effective and does the job efficiently without much effort.  would buy this again or other products similar to it</li>
            <li> It works when it works. It stopped working after a month. Tried with brand new battery, no luck. Tried cleaning inside and out, no luck. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> This item broke after one use.  It is made of cheap plastic and I think the on off switch broke.</li>
            <li> Great price, does the job. Thanks Panasonic</li>
            <li> Good item. This is a replacement for the one I had for 20 years.</li>
            <li> Pretty weak motor, couldn&#x27;t really get any weaker... Feels like a Bic lighter with the child-proofing added on.</li>
            <li> A quality product, so much better than my previous trimmer. You can tell it is a well made product, I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this thing! The price is right! No freight cost and it works! My wife has one and I now have my own, so everyone&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> Works well, needs 1.5V battery. Rechargeable 1.2V are too weak. Good value.</li>
            <li> Great product! I purchased one many years ago. It finally began to fail. I decided to try a different brand. I was very disappointed. I came back to this Panasonic product, so happy that I did. I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great, only had it for a month or so, but trims ears and nose hairs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Light weight and not too loud.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I would disconnect razor blade from holder, it worked, but cut myself a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Must easier and safer, and it so cheap, why wouldn&#x27;t you buy it ?</li>
            <li> It works well and does the job it was designed to do!  My only problem is that a battery does NOT last long.</li>
            <li> This is an ok nose, ear clipper for the price.  The clipper needs to be made so that it cuts closer and the plastic housing that holds the clipper onto the base needs to be made more durable.  Otherwise, for $10, you&#x27;ll get a good 2 or three years of use out of it before the plastic breaks.  If there is an updated model that has been improved that would be the one to buy.</li>
            <li> Good for the money, you have to wiggle the battery cap to get it to work</li>
            <li> Easy, simple, does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Have this device since April 2014 . I am satisfied with it, nonetheless my expectation was that it would trim the nostril hair more quickly. In all a good product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! Uses it all the time. He has used it for 8 months now and still going strong. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to hold and clean, doesn&#x27;t pull/grab</li>
            <li> works great.  It is a little on the cheap side.  But you get what you pay for.  I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> this trimmer works well and is priced fairly, also has a good design to it i like that it works without a cord.</li>
            <li> Very good product...trims well.  I have probably bought more than 3 of these and found them to do a good job.</li>
            <li> I just got my nose trimmer in the mail the other day I love it does everything I needed it to do painless very cheap great all around!!!</li>
            <li> if you need one, this one is as good , if not better, than most. cuts, battery lasts,  lite weight, quiet. It&#x27;s an ear hair and nose hair trimmer, what the H can I say about that...?</li>
            <li> Everyone I know could use one of these things. My wife and I each have one plus one spare. They are great. Follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I needed one of these since my other one gave out. Same make but I had it for 15 years before it gave out.</li>
            <li> Used only twice and doesn&#x27;t work any more. Only a 30 day warranty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last one I purchased lasted 12 years!</li>
            <li> It is and does what it says. Not flimsy. Price is just right. I&#x27;m using it for nose only. Don&#x27;t know how it works for other things.</li>
            <li> works well no problems</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> NiCe really helpful. Easy to use it</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my Hubby as a last min Christmas gift, it was here on time.. My hubs loves it</li>
            <li> Not the best trimmer, but does the job.  If you lose a part, you may as well throw the whole thing in the trash, as each part is nearly the cost of the whole thing.  Panasonic makes better ones that are newer and more reliable.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Panasonic Nose and Ear Trimmer and it arrived very early. This was a product that I have been curious about buying for some time now.  but I&#x27;m happy that  I ordered it. I&#x27;ve read some good reviews  and while I realize it&#x27;s not the product for everyone, it definitely was for me. It cuts the hairs I need it to in one or rarely two swipes and doesn&#x27;t pull at all, which was another concern that I had. For those who have an electric razor, this doesn&#x27;t feel any different than one of those. It glides over the hair so smoothly if it wasn&#x27;t for the sound of the motor you wouldn&#x27;t notice it was there.  I think this is a great product that&#x27;s not only convient but works fantastic!  The Panasonic 415 left the nose and ears hair (and cut) free! I know not everybody will agree on products, but I wanted to provide some feedback on my experience with this product. It does a good job and it is a great price!  I will be making  another review after. i keep using it some more.&lt;br /&gt; I love this product!  This works great.</li>
            <li> I had just about given up finding one of these that worked worth a darn.  The Panasonic does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave my nose feeling like going to vibrate off.  A great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Finally! Been using cuticle scissors for years, felt brave enough to try this, after a couple of buddies said they had similar products. Research showed this as having the best reviews, extremely happy, works great, good price!</li>
            <li> Goods direct mail China, fast, after receiving the goods, can&#x27;t wait to use it, is very good:)</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 brands and 7 models of these devices over the years and this is the first to really work to thoroughly get those nasty ear and nose hairs, which is the difference between looking like an poorly groomed geezer and a business professional.&lt;br /&gt;Due to the blades on all of these being almost foil-thin, I wouldn&#x27;t expect much more than a year or two of use, but it is worth that IMO.</li>
            <li> Works for us ladies as well as my husbands more heavy duty one. Don&#x27;t know about someone with very coarse hairs.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Keep nose hairs trimmed.</li>
            <li> This never worked well from day one.  You click it on, and sometimes the blades come to life, sometimes they don&#x27;t.  If you remove the blade mechanism, the little spinning nub spins just fine, but once it engages with the blades, the whole thing grinds to a halt.  You can shake it and whack it and sometimes this helps, but mostly it&#x27;s just a paperweight.  I finally just smashed mine with a hammer, which process gave me greater satisfaction than the product ever did.  When I consider that many, perhaps dozens, of people were involved with designing, building, and marketing this product, I am embarrassed to be a member of the human race.</li>
            <li> ilke the style and after buying them i like the no pulling of hair and keep you from puttin them to far up your nose&lt;br /&gt;anyone who wants a good nose hair trimmer i would recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;bill martin</li>
            <li> It is a simple trimmer and works well. I would recommend it to all who need one. so enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, makes a mildly violent sound when it makes contact with those pesky ear and nose hairs.  Fully enclosed blade head means no risk of nipping your ears and no blood.  All I want now is to see Billy Crystal explain the virtues of this product in a commercial.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I had purchased a different one that didn&#x27;t work, so I went back to this one. (The original one had worn out)</li>
            <li> works as good as any, better than most</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, you have to replace batteries faster than expected but will still do the job working on a low battery for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I owned a very similar Panasonic trimmer for well over 10 years. I&#x27;m very pleased with this replacement and enter each day knowing the world will look me in the eye instead of the nose.</li>
            <li> The motor doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as the last one I had.</li>
            <li> Great product that works well!!</li>
            <li> Fast service and product is as described.  It works great and is easy to clean.  I recommend it to anyone needing a trimmer.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MUCH NEEDED FOR MY BOYFRIEND AND ONCE I RECIEVED IT....I COULDN&#x27;T HAVE ASKED FOR SOMETHING BETTER!! IT WAS EASY AND GOT THE JOB DONE HANDS DOWN!!</li>
            <li> It does what is stated.  It keeps the nose hairs, as well as, the  facial hair on the female face in check.  When removing the facial hair, no stubble is let.</li>
            <li> This is very good for removing facial hair. I use to everyday on my eyebrows. It would be better if it could get a bit closer though.</li>
            <li> Just do it. Dont overthink it, just buy it. Why? Because stray nosehair is gross. It&#x27;s next to &amp;#34;Cyclops pimple&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hanging booger&amp;#34; on the list of &amp;#34;Most Distracting Things About A Person&#x27;s Face.&amp;#34; Solve this quick and easy with a nice cheap trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size, and cuts clean with no pain or discomfort. (It tickles a little, but you will get used to it.) The guard keeps you from destroying the nose forest, and you can use it on other parts of your face, if that idea doesnt gross you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not designed to be repaired/replaced, but I have had mine for a few months, so I got my monies worth already.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband.  It&#x27;s the style he likes, but he said it is a bit underpowered, and stopped working after only a few months.  I really would prefer something like this last him a few years, not a few months.</li>
            <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t do a good, or even passable, job of removing nose hair. Also, the plastic piece on the battery compartment broke within a few weeks. Get another model or brand.</li>
            <li> Cuts well very hard to clean&lt;br /&gt;Battery has short life</li>
            <li> its ok it does the job just only problem is the the package said it comes with a cleaning brush it wasnt in the box</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money.  Works great. My second purchase, the first panasonic lasted many years.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but I dropped it once, and since it has been showing issues.&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah - my fault, but I was a bit expecting to be a bit more sturdy.</li>
            <li> This product is very, very cheaply made. Not sturdy at all. The sliding Power switch won&#x27;t stay in On position, I have to put tape on the switch to make it stay on. Brand new out the the package it worked good for the first 2-3 uses. A brand new Duracell battery ran out after 15 minutes of use and 3 weeks being stored. If I don&#x27;t remove the battery while not using it, it will drain out. Cuts poorly, left lots of hair behind. Complete garbage at any price.</li>
            <li> Good. I thought it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd trimmer that I have bought in my lifetime and the 1st the really works. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> First the price is comparable to every other unit you are going to find.  That said.  I have used other&#x27;s where I had to constantly replace the batteries.  This unit is still running on the first AA I put in it.  That is 5+ months of constant use.  Second, the circular cutting structure is far superior to a flat blade.  Most important.  It is quiet as heck.  I had one, I thought I would go deaf if I put in my ear.  This one, you don&#x27;t even notice it working.  Also, I have dropped it, gotten it wet, and abused it already.  It is totally worth the low price.  It is a work horse.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time---excellent product--works well, actually better than two similar products I bought recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged and at a very good price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, and works great. A very good value. Good for home use and travel. I&#x27;m going to buy more to give to other family members who always want to use mine.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  No pulling of hair in thos sensitive areas.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> sorry for my english!!! i like  this product. it is very high quality. very good panasonic er415sc. i love this nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is very reasonably priced and will serve you well for the cost. There are many more that are much more expensive. For a product that only needs to be used every few weeks this is a bargain.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. It clips hair quickly, quietly and efficiently. Panasonic makes the very best trimmers. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this works ok, but I expected more.</li>
            <li> Junk.  I should of realized it for the price. Very weak motor, even after changing the battery. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This model does a great job of removing around the nose, eyebrows, and ears. It has lasted longer than any other model that I have bought.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use it much, but it gets the nose and ear hair very well.</li>
            <li> This is my second or third iteration of this brand nose trimmer. They keep improving all the time. A truly necessary bit of gear for anyone who hates nose hair &amp;#34;bugging&amp;#34; them.</li>
