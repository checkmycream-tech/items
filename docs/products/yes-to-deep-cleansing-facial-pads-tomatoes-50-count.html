    <ol>
            <li>Plus, they smell great!</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful -</li>
            <li>I smells very good.</li>
            <li>These Yes to Tomatoes pads are brilliant.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and works great.</li>
            <li>Both are great though.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do anything for me, pleasant smell though.</li>
            <li>The good:</li>
            <li>It seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>it works and it smells good to boot.  </li>
            <li>LOVE these things!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>One star is too many!</li>
            <li>I use this after cleansing my face -- kind of like you would a toner.</li>
            <li>I have heard so many good things about Lycopene.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal and a great product!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not feel like I have to wash my face after using these pads, which would effectively defeat the purpose since I&#x27;d be washing away the effective ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve come to seek out products in the \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; line more and more.</li>
            <li>Love, love Yes To.</li>
            <li>This works much better than the proactive which cost much more.</li>
            <li>We bought this and the spot stick, he seems to like using the pads more.</li>
            <li>And the Yes to Tomatoes moisturizer is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell though.</li>
            <li>, the texture is good for scrubbing away grime, they don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, my favorite thing about these is how good they smell.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent, strong medicine and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>These got here quickly and in-tact</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I AM ACNE FREE.</li>
            <li>Its just soft smooth balanced skin.</li>
            <li>YesTo never fails to impress me.</li>
            <li>I tried using it over the summer, when my skin is generally better (it&#x27;s dry and breaks out more in the winter), and every time I used it, I started getting cystic acne a day or two later.</li>
            <li>This product is not only effective, but it works fast, with in two days, your skin is clear.</li>
            <li>We added a few drops of water to the container to make the pads a little wetter, but other than that they were perfect on their own.</li>
            <li>The products work well, aren&#x27;t exorbitantly priced, and relatively easy to find at local drugstores, Target, or here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My husband has really oily skin</li>
            <li>Really comparable to things I&#x27;ve tried at 4 and 5x the price.</li>
            <li>But I think that&#x27;s just because I don&#x27;t notice much else</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just rough enough that they clear away dead skin and keep pores clean, perfect for blemish control, and even seem to minimize wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my family&#x27;s household and bath products and in a lot of cases the products are more expensive and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the pads and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This product is more expensive than oxy pads, but my husband seems to think it is making his face just as clean as the oxy pads and he certainly hasn&#x27;t had any new break-outs, so I think this is a winner.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m constantly trying to balance between something good for blemish control that doesn&#x27;t dry me out so much that it makes fine lines worse.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to screw lid on tight!</li>
            <li>because they work exactly the same as 2% salicylic acide Acne pads I&#x27;ve been using for years (Oxy pads, Neutrogena brand, etc).</li>
            <li>Repairing Acne Lotion cleared it up completely within a matter of days.  </li>
            <li>I am a 48 year old woman who has suffered with acne my entire life...</li>
            <li>first, the expected teen acne, then later adult acne.</li>
            <li>all the pimples on the right side of my face have disappeared and the left side has less but is still putting up a fight.</li>
            <li>dirt comes off, however i&#x27;m not sure if the dirt is simply sticking to my mildly sticky face.</li>

            <li> dirt comes off, however i&#x27;m not sure if the dirt is simply sticking to my mildly sticky face.</li>
            <li> As an adult that still has breakouts even though the dreaded teenage years were a couple of decades ago, I look for skincare products that aren&#x27;t as harsh on skin as those marketed for teens.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However: I really don&#x27;t like using these because I feel like they leave a weird almost sticky residue, and I have a hard time using them without washing my face afterwards, which is exactly what I buy a product like this to avoid.</li>
            <li> Unlike other cleansers (even the sensitive ones,) right after I use them my skin isn&#x27;t painfully taut and dry until i moisturize.</li>
            <li> I hope this product works for other people the way it has for me, because I feel I&#x27;ve stumbled upon a miracle.</li>
            <li> so my moms always buying me skin products since i have always suffered from acne due to my PCOS.</li>
            <li> but i like how it doesnt smell nasty.based on the reviews from other people</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can no longer find this in locals stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super fond of the Yes to Tomatoes cleanser...</li>
            <li> It may have been just this shipment that wasn&#x27;t sealed, was dried out, and not full, but how will I know that it won&#x27;t happen again?</li>
            <li> and we always kept a few containers of oxy pads around the house to \\&quot;degrease\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was paying $7.99 each when I purchased from the store and a couple of times they were dried out.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t sting or feel as harsh as the pharmacy junk.</li>
            <li> This cleansing pad is one of the few I&#x27;ve tried that cleans and treats without any irritation or burning.</li>
            <li> I also like that the smell is not medicinal or overpowering and that no residue is left behind.  </li>
            <li> ive been using both everyday for the past 2 weeks now and have seen a lot of improvement.</li>
            <li> To Tomatoes cleansing facial pads for my teenage daughter who was suffering from bad acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> What a bunch of hype, deceptive marketing strategies, waste of time and hard earned money.</li>
            <li> but the pad is too small.</li>
            <li> To products fanatic and have used something from almost every one of their product lines.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, somehow I always thought that by the time I started getting wrinkles</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work out that way, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to cancel my subscription, but I have no way of knowing what I&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li> This made me break out like CRAZY.</li>
            <li> It includes bad components like titanium dioxide, phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate.</li>
            <li> too perfumey smelling, but its not that bad.</li>
            <li> I waa soooo disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this after cleansing my face -- kind of like you would a toner. I smells very good. It doesnt burn or irritate the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I def will reccommend this and will re-purchase. 100% satified!</li>
            <li> I am a 48 year old woman who has suffered with acne my entire life... first, the expected teen acne, then later adult acne. For the first time in my life, I AM ACNE FREE. I owe it to this product. I use these pads up to three times a day, and I have not had one pimple in months. I hope this product works for other people the way it has for me, because I feel I&#x27;ve stumbled upon a miracle. My only complaint is that I can no longer find this in locals stores and I have to buy it online. Anyway, I buy it by the case!</li>
            <li> My husband has really oily skin and we always kept a few containers of oxy pads around the house to \\&quot;degrease\\&quot;. I have been trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my family&#x27;s household and bath products and in a lot of cases the products are more expensive and don&#x27;t work as well. This product is more expensive than oxy pads, but my husband seems to think it is making his face just as clean as the oxy pads and he certainly hasn&#x27;t had any new break-outs, so I think this is a winner. We added a few drops of water to the container to make the pads a little wetter, but other than that they were perfect on their own.</li>
            <li> This product is the same as the one sold in stores. It arrived on time and works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> It is mask doing nothing.  I am worrying about buying this. I don&#x27;t recommend to buy it. It includes bad components like titanium dioxide, phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate. I never see its cleaning and spa effect.</li>
            <li> The good: I like the smell, the texture is good for scrubbing away grime, they don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However: I really don&#x27;t like using these because I feel like they leave a weird almost sticky residue, and I have a hard time using them without washing my face afterwards, which is exactly what I buy a product like this to avoid.</li>
            <li> LOVE these things! Seriously, somehow I always thought that by the time I started getting wrinkles I&#x27;d be over getting blemishes. Didn&#x27;t work out that way, unfortunately. So I&#x27;m constantly trying to balance between something good for blemish control that doesn&#x27;t dry me out so much that it makes fine lines worse. I&#x27;ve tried it all. There&#x27;s only two products that I&#x27;ve ever felt I couldn&#x27;t do without. These Yes to Tomatoes pads are brilliant. They&#x27;re just rough enough that they clear away dead skin and keep pores clean, perfect for blemish control, and even seem to minimize wrinkles. Unlike other cleansers (even the sensitive ones,) right after I use them my skin isn&#x27;t painfully taut and dry until i moisturize. Its just soft smooth balanced skin. Love these! I&#x27;m not super fond of the Yes to Tomatoes cleanser... too perfumey smelling, but its not that bad. And the Yes to Tomatoes moisturizer is fabulous. Really comparable to things I&#x27;ve tried at 4 and 5x the price. Highly recommend the pads and moisturizer. And they&#x27;re portable!</li>
            <li> I waa soooo disappointed! I have heard so many good things about Lycopene. It may have been just this shipment that wasn&#x27;t sealed, was dried out, and not full, but how will I know that it won&#x27;t happen again? I&#x27;m sad to cancel my subscription, but I have no way of knowing what I&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li> I was paying $7.99 each when I purchased from the store and a couple of times they were dried out. Such a great deal and a great product!!</li>
            <li> YesTo never fails to impress me. I had been using their cucumber towelettes for a while but my skin started breaking out. These cleansing pads not only cleared up my skin but they don&#x27;t sting or feel as harsh as the pharmacy junk. Plus, they smell great! These got here quickly and in-tact and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now. not enough time to decide if it works as it should. However it leaves a sticky residue. everytime I use these pads dirt comes off, however i&#x27;m not sure if the dirt is simply sticking to my mildly sticky face. I really enjoy the smell though. I don&#x27;t think i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent, strong medicine and not tested on animals. What more can you ask for? I just wish it&#x27;d come in quantities bigger than 50 pads!</li>
            <li> As an adult that still has breakouts even though the dreaded teenage years were a couple of decades ago, I look for skincare products that aren&#x27;t as harsh on skin as those marketed for teens.  This cleansing pad is one of the few I&#x27;ve tried that cleans and treats without any irritation or burning.

The products work well, aren&#x27;t exorbitantly priced, and relatively easy to find at local drugstores, Target, or here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so my moms always buying me skin products since i have always suffered from acne due to my PCOS. so she recently bought me this tomato product as well as the zeno heat treatment. ive been using both everyday for the past 2 weeks now and have seen a lot of improvement. all the pimples on the right side of my face have disappeared and the left side has less but is still putting up a fight. this product does make my face feel sticky but i like how it doesnt smell nasty.based on the reviews from other people i feel that it may be this product that is doing all the work.</li>
            <li> I am a Yes To products fanatic and have used something from almost every one of their product lines.  I bought the Yes To Tomatoes cleansing facial pads for my teenage daughter who was suffering from bad acne breakouts.  This combined with the Yes To Tomatoes Repairing Acne Lotion cleared it up completely within a matter of days.  This product is wonderful - it works and it smells good to boot.  Love, love Yes To.</li>
            <li> I like the formulation of product on the pad but the pad is too small. Also, make sure to screw lid on tight!</li>
            <li> What a bunch of hype, deceptive marketing strategies, waste of time and hard earned money. One star is too many!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for me, pleasant smell though.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, my favorite thing about these is how good they smell. But I think that&#x27;s just because I don&#x27;t notice much else about them-- because they work exactly the same as 2% salicylic acide Acne pads I&#x27;ve been using for years (Oxy pads, Neutrogena brand, etc).

            <li> This product is not only effective, but it works fast, with in two days, your skin is clear. This works much better than the proactive which cost much more. We bought this and the spot stick, he seems to like using the pads more. Both are great though.</li>
