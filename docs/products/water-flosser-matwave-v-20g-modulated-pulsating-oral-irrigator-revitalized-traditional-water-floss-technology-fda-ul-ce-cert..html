            <li>This is a great unit in design and function.  </li>

            <li>Order arrived on time, well packed and seems to be of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>points: magnetic handle, variable pulsation rate, good pressure, 2-year warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best part is the two year FULL REPLACEMENT (not just repair) warranty.</li>
            <li>this water flosser has everything you need to live a happy healthy oral life!!!</li>
            <li>But it is nice to know there is a 2 year warranty backing up this unit</li>
            <li>It does an effective job of cleaning all that hardware.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums also looked great and my mouth felt really clean.</li>
            <li>Best oral irrigator I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;There is a great soft tip that enables you to really clean in pockets and under bridges.</li>
            <li>Water flossing removes 99.9 of placque and is up to 50% more effective than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The water jet wasn&#x27;t as strong as either of the two waterpik units we own.  </li>
            <li>I would think that I would get more than 1 year.  </li>
            <li>It arrived fast, it was great while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Purchased a Waterpic Ultra and hope I have better luck.   </li>
            <li>why are my gums in love you might ask, or even think I am a bit over kill?</li>
            <li>and this Matwave model has become one of my favorite things to use.</li>
            <li>:  )</li>
            <li>many Amazon reviewers</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many things I like better about the Cleanpro V-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the magnetic wand holder and varying water pressure.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product because I could feel my teeth and gums getting healthier day by day.</li>
            <li>Much better than my Water Pik.</li>
            <li>The reservoir also holds much more water.</li>
            <li>I was prepared to pay a lot more for a well made machine than this one cost</li>
            <li>A teacher at a dental college I recently visited also was impressed.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;operation are unique to its kind.</li>
            <li>My order arrived on time with secure packaging, and the customer service was great, which I appreciate very much from Amazon and the vendor.</li>
            <li>This year I have had full dental implants and my oral surgeon suggested that I purchase a good quality water flosser to keep the areas around my implants clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, if you are looking for an alternative water flosser that it more technologically advanced and a better built unit than a Waterpik that comes with a 2 year warranty,  I&#x27;d recommend you give the Cleanpro a try.</li>
            <li>and most certainly your gums will thank you!!!</li>
            <li>Jason Hi, was the person I was communicating with - and I was more than pleased how quickly he responded and replaced my unit free of charge.</li>
            <li>It cleans and flosses my teeth and gums very quickly and thoroughly, so my mouth feels refreshed after each time I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s speed cleaned and flossed my teeth in record time and it was so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for any one wanting an optimum job but don&#x27;t have the time to floss.</li>
            <li>Would seem that would be an easy thing to swap out in a device that&#x27;s as straightforward as this.</li>
            <li>Just fabulous.</li>
            <li>yet here is the kicker my dad (40yr smoker) on the rare times he goes to the dentist they always say he has the most healthiest gums and teeth (fillings and all)</li>
            <li>Not so sure its worth the hassale.</li>
            <li>The advantage here is at lower pressures you also get a lower pulse rate making it easier to find a pulse/pressure combination that is comfortable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adjustable water pressure allowing you to begin with light pressure and increasing for your comfort.</li>
            <li>have played with the device enough and am happy with its performance.</li>
            <li>Great idea to give your customers and extra.</li>
            <li>The cover fits securely to keep dirt out of the water</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The lack of detailed instructions for useto free Volt.</li>
            <li>Far superior in quality &amp; performance to Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery and GREAT SERVICE: when it arrived, a tiny rubber O-ring was defective, and getting a replacement was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>This product is quite durable, and deserves every one of the 5 stars and was definitely worth the money!.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I needed a reliable Water flosser, to easily clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>Unit is delivered as described with a good sized reservoir and multiple tips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Magnetic handle mount – this is just cool</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a high quality product with excellent craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>cause you do not have someone strange playing in your mouth or hearing the wonderful drill sound in the room next to you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li>but since I got the 2 year Warranty - I quickly emailed Matwave customer service, to see what options of repair/exchange I would have.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, nice size unit, very powerful motor and the water container was bigger as well, compared to the Water pic brand.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m back to being a very satisfied customer, (with healthier gums, to boot).</li>
            <li>It is still a good machine, but you would have to consider it disposable rather than a long term product.  </li>
            <li>I love the digital controls, they are easy to operate and there are no nobs to get moldy from any water that gets on them.</li>
            <li>Had a little hiccup with installation of the rubber gasket and plug, but once my issue was made known to Matwave Technologies, Inc., I received great customer service</li>
            <li>Far more dependable than a Water Pic.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use warm water to fill up the tank, and sometimes with mouth wash, and as time progressed, I got into the habit of using the device daily.</li>
            <li>Looked for a water flosser on the market and liked this digital design.</li>
            <li>The device is well made, large reservoir kept operation with no interruption, magnetic handle is quite handy and the digital display is unique.</li>
            <li>It is a bit long, easily getting tangled around everything else on the counter top.</li>
            <li>I had other flossers but this is definitely the best!</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick, thanks Amazon for that!</li>
            <li>This stopped working three weeks ago, right at a year.  </li>
            <li>The unit is more than sufficiently powerful; the nasal tip just has to be slightly adjusted to get more oomph, but for most users, this won&#x27;t be necessary at all.</li>
            <li>The motor is a bit louder than I would like in a perfect world, but it&#x27;s only on for a few minutes at a time</li>
            <li>If they can lower down  motor&#x27;s noizy that could be more better(probably because that strong power cost it).</li>
            <li>This hopefully will last longer and it hold a lot more water.</li>
            <li>It started making a loud sound and stopped working.</li>
            <li>It was quieter than our first waterpik</li>
            <li>This is the first water flosser that I have owned.</li>
            <li>I am not, how many of us out there have had so quote deep cleaning?</li>
            <li>you know where these tools have been 2 its an outstanding pro power water sonic matwave, water pressure  is same as dentist cleanings.</li>
            <li>This works very well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I ordered the product, I figured the V-20G model would give me a&lt;br /&gt;bigger bang for the buck than the V-20B. Since I share with the family, the&lt;br /&gt;G package had more tips (9 in total) to go around family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;pressure stays consistent with usage</li>
            <li>should you pride yourselves as smart cookies do not listen to them</li>
            <li>I mistakenly ordered 2 of these and was getting ready to send one back, but my husband saw how easy it was to use</li>
            <li>Very modern, sleek design made of what feels like high quality materials.  </li>
            <li>, I didn’t have much luck with the Waterpik  WP-100W</li>
            <li>It would have been appreciated if a shorter cord or some wire clips were provided.</li>
            <li>He then warned me that my teeth would&lt;br /&gt;look longer, and this vampire-like idea really scared me away.</li>
            <li>The head fits securely into the hand device with an audible click unlike the Conair model that I recently returned where the head fell out every time I used it!!</li>
            <li>so really who cares?</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d rather use this and get the job done fast.</li>
            <li>The customer service was very responsive in replying my  inquiries.</li>
            <li>Very unimpressive, on the whole.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Matwave and they were very responsive.</li>
            <li>I am highly satisfied with this product and the service, just need to be careful about undissolvable solids in the salt</li>
            <li>Unit is well built and works as expected, good experience overall, will buy from the source again.</li>
            <li>Much better than any other flosser I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>I can only highly recommend this company, their prompt and friendly customer service, but most of all - their Water Flosser is hands down -</li>
            <li>even if you have only one or two or a full set as I have.</li>
            <li>it seems to be a new torture device at the dentist chair!</li>
            <li>The unit itself is much quieter and far better cleaning than any other model I ever tried before.</li>
            <li>Seems fine, although the many extra parts do seem a bit excessive.  </li>
            <li>The ergonomic handle  has a magnetic attachment that makes for easy clean up and no wire tangling, the water tank holds enough water for me to rinse my entire mouth, and it&#x27;s very convenient to use and share with the family because of the extra tips that come with the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Reviews sounded so tempting - me being a Prime Member with free shipping - I had nothing to loose, but give it a try.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 11yr.old son and he said the lowest setting is to high</li>
            <li>High hopes for this unit.</li>
            <li>So far Amazon and the seller seem to be very cooperative with my refund.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so fresh following cleaning</li>
            <li>Works great a little messy but you are spraying water around.</li>
            <li>Did not bother with asking for another replacement although have no doubt that the seller would continue to send new units till the two year warranty was up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Tuesday May 26 and a new Water Flosser Matwave</li>
            <li>If my new appliance&#x27;s pump dies in fourteen month&#x27;s</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try a new water flosser, searched</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase again.from this vendor - but would first see if they could send along a new pump.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The variable speed keypad suit a variety of uses- gum massaging, regular water flossing, and allowed me to work up from a lower pressure to a higher pressure over time.</li>
            <li>Not to do the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when unpacking this water flosser was the extra water valve that was packed inside.</li>
            <li>It holds enough water to complete flossing your entire mouth unlike others I have tried that need to be filled two or three times.</li>
            <li>use this to clean my teeth after eating fruits, since brushing can cause damage on tooth enamel due to the citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product offers &amp;#34;lifetime service&amp;#34; so perhaps if I&#x27;d asked they might have sent along a new pump.  </li>
            <li>With a long history of oral complications, I have always been willing to try out new products to improve my oral health-</li>
            <li>My gums used to bleed whenever I used a toothpick or floss, but with this water flosser my gums aren&#x27;t as sensitive and don&#x27;t bleed anymore.</li>
            <li>The extra tips make it very convenient and user-friendly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The device is very well made, the low profile design, shape, and digital&lt;</li>
            <li>Waterpik offers a travel unit but even that is 110V?  </li>
            <li>I have had it for several months now and have found it to be powerful enough and reliable.  </li>
            <li>The pressure is not as good as the Waterpick and after about 6 months the pause button failed.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the full &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; to water pick unless I push down on the water container with one hand while holding the pick with the other.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>used this to clean the narrow space and corners around the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but the new waterpik is comparably quiet.</li>
            <li>and I continue to be amazed at how much food debris it removes even though I have already brushed prior to water</li>
            <li>I have purchased several Waterpic flossers over the years and have found them less and less reliable with not nearly enough power to effectively floss.  </li>
            <li>Controls are simple and completely waterproof.</li>
            <li>I recently compared Waterpik to Matwave and it was like comparing an old Ford to a Tesla.</li>
            <li>Instead of getting a unit purposed specifically for nasal irrigation, though, with potentially less power and a lower capacity, I wanted this unit because of its increased capacity (900ml) and advertised higher pulsatile power.</li>
            <li>Those 3 Water pics did not live up to my expectations, all 3 units simply broke and it was a great disappointment for me in terms of performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Back in September 2014, I was desperately looking for a different Water Flosser, other than the good old Water pic.</li>
            <li>At about $65 with a two year warranty the cost of less than $3/month to add water flossing to my daily routine is reasonable.</li>

            <li> /&gt;In summary, if you are looking for an alternative water flosser that it more technologically advanced and a better built unit than a Waterpik that comes with a 2 year warranty,  I&#x27;d recommend you give the Cleanpro a try.</li>
            <li> and most certainly your gums will thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Jason Hi, was the person I was communicating with - and I was more than pleased how quickly he responded and replaced my unit free of charge.</li>
            <li> It cleans and flosses my teeth and gums very quickly and thoroughly, so my mouth feels refreshed after each time I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s speed cleaned and flossed my teeth in record time and it was so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for any one wanting an optimum job but don&#x27;t have the time to floss.</li>
            <li> Would seem that would be an easy thing to swap out in a device that&#x27;s as straightforward as this.</li>
            <li> Just fabulous.</li>
            <li> yet here is the kicker my dad (40yr smoker) on the rare times he goes to the dentist they always say he has the most healthiest gums and teeth (fillings and all)</li>
            <li> Not so sure its worth the hassale.</li>
            <li> The advantage here is at lower pressures you also get a lower pulse rate making it easier to find a pulse/pressure combination that is comfortable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adjustable water pressure allowing you to begin with light pressure and increasing for your comfort.</li>
            <li> have played with the device enough and am happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> Great idea to give your customers and extra.</li>
            <li> The cover fits securely to keep dirt out of the water</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The lack of detailed instructions for useto free Volt.</li>
            <li> Far superior in quality &amp; performance to Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and GREAT SERVICE: when it arrived, a tiny rubber O-ring was defective, and getting a replacement was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This product is quite durable, and deserves every one of the 5 stars and was definitely worth the money!.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I needed a reliable Water flosser, to easily clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> Unit is delivered as described with a good sized reservoir and multiple tips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Magnetic handle mount – this is just cool</li>
            <li> Good product overall.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a high quality product with excellent craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> cause you do not have someone strange playing in your mouth or hearing the wonderful drill sound in the room next to you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li> but since I got the 2 year Warranty - I quickly emailed Matwave customer service, to see what options of repair/exchange I would have.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, nice size unit, very powerful motor and the water container was bigger as well, compared to the Water pic brand.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m back to being a very satisfied customer, (with healthier gums, to boot).</li>
            <li> It is still a good machine, but you would have to consider it disposable rather than a long term product.  </li>
            <li> I love the digital controls, they are easy to operate and there are no nobs to get moldy from any water that gets on them.</li>
            <li> Had a little hiccup with installation of the rubber gasket and plug, but once my issue was made known to Matwave Technologies, Inc., I received great customer service</li>
            <li> Far more dependable than a Water Pic.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use warm water to fill up the tank, and sometimes with mouth wash, and as time progressed, I got into the habit of using the device daily.</li>
            <li> Looked for a water flosser on the market and liked this digital design.</li>
            <li> The device is well made, large reservoir kept operation with no interruption, magnetic handle is quite handy and the digital display is unique.</li>
            <li> It is a bit long, easily getting tangled around everything else on the counter top.</li>
            <li> I had other flossers but this is definitely the best!</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick, thanks Amazon for that!</li>
            <li> This stopped working three weeks ago, right at a year.  </li>
            <li> The unit is more than sufficiently powerful; the nasal tip just has to be slightly adjusted to get more oomph, but for most users, this won&#x27;t be necessary at all.</li>
            <li> The motor is a bit louder than I would like in a perfect world, but it&#x27;s only on for a few minutes at a time</li>
            <li> If they can lower down  motor&#x27;s noizy that could be more better(probably because that strong power cost it).</li>
            <li> This hopefully will last longer and it hold a lot more water.</li>
            <li> It started making a loud sound and stopped working.</li>
            <li> It was quieter than our first waterpik</li>
            <li> This is the first water flosser that I have owned.</li>
            <li> I am not, how many of us out there have had so quote deep cleaning?</li>
            <li> you know where these tools have been 2 its an outstanding pro power water sonic matwave, water pressure  is same as dentist cleanings.</li>
            <li> This works very well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I ordered the product, I figured the V-20G model would give me a&lt;br /&gt;bigger bang for the buck than the V-20B. Since I share with the family, the&lt;br /&gt;G package had more tips (9 in total) to go around family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;pressure stays consistent with usage</li>
            <li> should you pride yourselves as smart cookies do not listen to them</li>
            <li> I mistakenly ordered 2 of these and was getting ready to send one back, but my husband saw how easy it was to use</li>
            <li> Very modern, sleek design made of what feels like high quality materials.  </li>
            <li> , I didn’t have much luck with the Waterpik  WP-100W</li>
            <li> It would have been appreciated if a shorter cord or some wire clips were provided.</li>
            <li> He then warned me that my teeth would&lt;br /&gt;look longer, and this vampire-like idea really scared me away.</li>
            <li> The head fits securely into the hand device with an audible click unlike the Conair model that I recently returned where the head fell out every time I used it!!</li>
            <li> so really who cares?</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d rather use this and get the job done fast.</li>
            <li> The customer service was very responsive in replying my  inquiries.</li>
            <li> Very unimpressive, on the whole.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Matwave and they were very responsive.</li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied with this product and the service, just need to be careful about undissolvable solids in the salt</li>
            <li> Unit is well built and works as expected, good experience overall, will buy from the source again.</li>
            <li> Much better than any other flosser I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> I can only highly recommend this company, their prompt and friendly customer service, but most of all - their Water Flosser is hands down -</li>
            <li> even if you have only one or two or a full set as I have.</li>
            <li> it seems to be a new torture device at the dentist chair!</li>
            <li> The unit itself is much quieter and far better cleaning than any other model I ever tried before.</li>
            <li> Seems fine, although the many extra parts do seem a bit excessive.  </li>
            <li> The ergonomic handle  has a magnetic attachment that makes for easy clean up and no wire tangling, the water tank holds enough water for me to rinse my entire mouth, and it&#x27;s very convenient to use and share with the family because of the extra tips that come with the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Reviews sounded so tempting - me being a Prime Member with free shipping - I had nothing to loose, but give it a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11yr.old son and he said the lowest setting is to high</li>
            <li> High hopes for this unit.</li>
            <li> So far Amazon and the seller seem to be very cooperative with my refund.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so fresh following cleaning</li>
            <li> Works great a little messy but you are spraying water around.</li>
            <li> Did not bother with asking for another replacement although have no doubt that the seller would continue to send new units till the two year warranty was up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Tuesday May 26 and a new Water Flosser Matwave</li>
            <li> If my new appliance&#x27;s pump dies in fourteen month&#x27;s</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try a new water flosser, searched</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase again.from this vendor - but would first see if they could send along a new pump.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The variable speed keypad suit a variety of uses- gum massaging, regular water flossing, and allowed me to work up from a lower pressure to a higher pressure over time.</li>
            <li> Not to do the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when unpacking this water flosser was the extra water valve that was packed inside.</li>
            <li> It holds enough water to complete flossing your entire mouth unlike others I have tried that need to be filled two or three times.</li>
            <li> use this to clean my teeth after eating fruits, since brushing can cause damage on tooth enamel due to the citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product offers &amp;#34;lifetime service&amp;#34; so perhaps if I&#x27;d asked they might have sent along a new pump.  </li>
            <li> With a long history of oral complications, I have always been willing to try out new products to improve my oral health-</li>
            <li> My gums used to bleed whenever I used a toothpick or floss, but with this water flosser my gums aren&#x27;t as sensitive and don&#x27;t bleed anymore.</li>
            <li> The extra tips make it very convenient and user-friendly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The device is very well made, the low profile design, shape, and digital&lt;</li>
            <li> Waterpik offers a travel unit but even that is 110V?  </li>
            <li> I have had it for several months now and have found it to be powerful enough and reliable.  </li>
            <li> The pressure is not as good as the Waterpick and after about 6 months the pause button failed.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the full &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; to water pick unless I push down on the water container with one hand while holding the pick with the other.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> used this to clean the narrow space and corners around the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but the new waterpik is comparably quiet.</li>
            <li> and I continue to be amazed at how much food debris it removes even though I have already brushed prior to water</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Waterpic flossers over the years and have found them less and less reliable with not nearly enough power to effectively floss.  </li>
            <li> Controls are simple and completely waterproof.</li>
            <li> I recently compared Waterpik to Matwave and it was like comparing an old Ford to a Tesla.</li>
            <li> Instead of getting a unit purposed specifically for nasal irrigation, though, with potentially less power and a lower capacity, I wanted this unit because of its increased capacity (900ml) and advertised higher pulsatile power.</li>
            <li> Those 3 Water pics did not live up to my expectations, all 3 units simply broke and it was a great disappointment for me in terms of performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Back in September 2014, I was desperately looking for a different Water Flosser, other than the good old Water pic.</li>
            <li> At about $65 with a two year warranty the cost of less than $3/month to add water flossing to my daily routine is reasonable.</li>
            <li> and I expect to improve the previous symptoms that I was experiencing (plaque buildup, sensitive gums, and occasional pain).</li>
            <li> Pump failure after 14 months of almost daily use is probably not the greatest endorsement of the products longevity - the pump failure renders the entire appliance a throw away unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Reasonably long power cord and hose connecting the pump</li>
            <li> The device package uses thick gauge cardboard,&lt;br /&gt;not corrugated board, which made the box very rigid and the device was well&lt;</li>
            <li> When I voiced my concerns to Jason via email, he took it upon himself to offer me the unit with two nasal tips along with 4 other oral tips for the same price.</li>
            <li> From the first use, the tank was very hard to remove and reseat.  </li>
            <li> I simply send him back my broken Matwave unit and got a brand new one in exchange.</li>
            <li> Had several water pic units which lasted less then 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> Updating this review - as noted below Seller responded to pump failure by shipping a new unit.</li>
            <li> pressure is a little low, but yippeupnida design is</li>
            <li> I was willing to deal with these issues, until the unit failed to turn after less than one week of twice daily use.  </li>
            <li> The two year warranty is being honored with no questions asked other than verifying my Amazon purchase information.  </li>
            <li> and I kept the other one for his bathroom.</li>
            <li> This means you get one touch operation because the Cleanpro remembers your setting from the previous use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally sealed control panel – no knobs, nooks or crevices to fill with water</li>
            <li> tank is a bit tight at beginning then break-in gradually.</li>
            <li> One thing need to mention though, the reservoir started rather tight to be taken off, I sometime did not even both to take if off to refill, wish the vendor would improve this.</li>
            <li> The pump in the new unit failed at the end of July 2015.</li>
            <li> It comes with at least 2 tips for other family members, plus other attachments which you may or may not use.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new (working) base and did not ask for the old one to be returned.</li>
            <li> If there is anything about this product that I did not enjoy, it would be the power cord.</li>
            <li> tank has a 30 oz capacity, and after a few days, I decided to fill it to</li>
            <li> The water tank fits securely on the base and although they tell you not to leave water in it, I do and it never leaks.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, I had an issue with the pause button remaining depressed</li>
            <li> I do not drink coffee, pop, or black tea, I brush 2 times I floss!</li>
            <li> Ten days ago the pump failed.</li>
            <li> Small footprint.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day after each meal, also added Listerine, to my surprise, it flashes out food debris even after I did brush, the gum symptom improved a lot after a few days, hope this will eventually save me from making a doctor’s office trip!</li>
            <li> The water tank cover and base have a&lt;br /&gt;perfect mirror finish, the magnetic handle is something that attracts my&lt;br /&gt;eye, and the handle size is just right.</li>
            <li> This product is awful - leaked dramatically from the very beginning - and when I tried to get a replacement under the warranty, Amazon only had the number in China!  </li>
            <li> This is an update - after less than one year of service this product has broken and no longer operates.</li>
            <li> To my disappointment, the handle broke about 5 month later -</li>
            <li> company logo on control panel is confusing; it looks like one of the buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would hope so since it was so new.  :-(</li>
            <li> I sent an email to the seller&#x27;s customer service contact link informing them of the failure.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Waterpick that failed after about a year.  </li>
            <li> This was  a poor design from the start.  </li>
            <li> Even comes with an extra replacement gasket between tank &amp; base unit.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell there are no great water flossers out there.</li>
            <li> Poorly made</li>
            <li> So (with a sample size of two units) i have a mean time to fail of two months for the pump - or about two hours of usage.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, my dentist saw my bad gums and suggested that I cut the top&lt;br /&gt;off</li>
            <li> Reservoir is a bit difficult to remove from the device</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Coiled molded tubing does not tangle, and stores into recess in base.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the Water Flosser Matwave</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Had several water pic units which lasted less then 2 yrs. This hopefully will last longer and it hold a lot more water.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Waterpick that failed after about a year.  This was  a poor design from the start.  The pressure is not as good as the Waterpick and after about 6 months the pause button failed.  I have to resort to sticking the nozzle in my mouth before turning it on.  The unit has digital controls but the on/off button is flush mounted with the surface so  you can&#x27;t tell whether your finger is on it or not.  Good thing it has a 2 year warranty.  I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> This Water Flosser working very good for me. It&#x27;s powerful and easy to use. If they can lower down  motor&#x27;s noizy that could be more better(probably because that strong power cost it).</li>
            <li> Washers not reliable.</li>
            <li> Works great a little messy but you are spraying water around.</li>
            <li> This stopped working three weeks ago, right at a year.  It started making a loud sound and stopped working. I would think that I would get more than 1 year.  It arrived fast, it was great while it lasted.</li>
            <li> The unit we purchased off Amazon lasted 2 months before it stopped working.  The water jet wasn&#x27;t as strong as either of the two waterpik units we own.  It was quieter than our first waterpik but the new waterpik is comparably quiet.</li>
            <li> Far more dependable than a Water Pic.</li>
            <li> I had other flossers but this is definitely the best!</li>
            <li> Updating this review - as noted below Seller responded to pump failure by shipping a new unit. The pump in the new unit failed at the end of July 2015. So (with a sample size of two units) i have a mean time to fail of two months for the pump - or about two hours of usage.  Did not bother with asking for another replacement although have no doubt that the seller would continue to send new units till the two year warranty was up. Purchased a Waterpic Ultra and hope I have better luck.   It&#x27;s Tuesday May 26 and a new Water Flosser Matwave V-20G is sitting on my desk. I purchased this item in March of 2014. Ten days ago the pump failed. On Monday morning PT May 18 I sent an email to the seller&#x27;s customer service contact link informing them of the failure. By Monday afternoon I had an email with a FedEx Ground tracking number informing me that my replacement water flossier was on the way. The two year warranty is being honored with no questions asked other than verifying my Amazon purchase information.  This is the first water flosser that I have owned. I purchased it based on the recommendation of e dental hygienist specializing in periodontal work and on Amazon product reviews. Good machine. Does what it says it will do. Pump failure after 14 months of almost daily use is probably not the greatest endorsement of the products longevity - the pump failure renders the entire appliance a throw away unfortunately. The product offers &amp;#34;lifetime service&amp;#34; so perhaps if I&#x27;d asked they might have sent along a new pump.  At about $65 with a two year warranty the cost of less than $3/month to add water flossing to my daily routine is reasonable. Unit is delivered as described with a good sized reservoir and multiple tips. I&#x27;m the only user so never needed to change tips but the changeover is very simple. Reasonably long power cord and hose connecting the pump o the tip. Reservoir is a bit difficult to remove from the device but removal is seldom needed.  If my new appliance&#x27;s pump dies in fourteen month&#x27;s I would definitely purchase again.from this vendor - but would first see if they could send along a new pump. Would seem that would be an easy thing to swap out in a device that&#x27;s as straightforward as this.</li>
            <li> Back in September 2014, I was desperately looking for a different Water Flosser, other than the good old Water pic. brand. I&#x27;ve had 3 Water pics over a 2 year period of time, as I had a lot of dental work done (Implants) - and I needed a reliable Water flosser, to easily clean my teeth. Those 3 Water pics did not live up to my expectations, all 3 units simply broke and it was a great disappointment for me in terms of performance.&lt;br /&gt;So I looked for a completely different unit - and I found the Matwave. The Reviews sounded so tempting - me being a Prime Member with free shipping - I had nothing to loose, but give it a try. I was fascinated from the start. Quick delivery, nice size unit, very powerful motor and the water container was bigger as well, compared to the Water pic brand. The unit itself is much quieter and far better cleaning than any other model I ever tried before. To my disappointment, the handle broke about 5 month later - but since I got the 2 year Warranty - I quickly emailed Matwave customer service, to see what options of repair/exchange I would have. Their customer service is excellent. Jason Hi, was the person I was communicating with - and I was more than pleased how quickly he responded and replaced my unit free of charge. I simply send him back my broken Matwave unit and got a brand new one in exchange. Just fabulous. I can only highly recommend this company, their prompt and friendly customer service, but most of all - their Water Flosser is hands down - THE BEST - Thank you Matvave, you got yourself a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Far superior in quality &amp; performance to Waterpik. Best part is the two year FULL REPLACEMENT (not just repair) warranty. Controls are simple and completely waterproof. Even comes with an extra replacement gasket between tank &amp; base unit. Magnetic handle holds flosser unit in place when not in use. Small footprint. Coiled molded tubing does not tangle, and stores into recess in base. Fully adjustable pressure. Compatible with mouthwash.</li>
            <li> why are my gums in love you might ask, or even think I am a bit over kill? I am not, how many of us out there have had so quote deep cleaning? it seems to be a new torture device at the dentist chair! I am a health nut, a vegan, a non food junky! I do not smoke(i.e. dries your gums out) I do not drink coffee, pop, or black tea, I brush 2 times I floss! but yet I am to believe my egotistical dentist on a power trip no doubt tells me my teeth are going to fall out and that my jaw bone is getting ate away by plaque, and there is nothing we can do about it. yet here is the kicker my dad (40yr smoker) on the rare times he goes to the dentist they always say he has the most healthiest gums and teeth (fillings and all) they have ever seen, what a load of horse apples!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so should you pride yourselves as smart cookies do not listen to them be in charge of your mouth!!! this water flosser has everything you need to live a happy healthy oral life!!! 1 you know where these tools have been 2 its an outstanding pro power water sonic matwave, water pressure  is same as dentist cleanings. it is by no means a cheep girly machine its  pro all the way will clean out those gum pockets!!! 3 it well save you money and stress and leave you smiling cause you do not have someone strange playing in your mouth or hearing the wonderful drill sound in the room next to you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy this machine and your teeth and most certainly your gums will thank you!!! and just maybe your gums too will say I am in love!!! cheers</li>
            <li> Had good reviews , can not remove the water baisin if you do manage to pry it off it leaks when replaced. Tryed to call manufactuer, no answer just a recording no matter the time of call. From what I can tell there are no great water flossers out there. Not so sure its worth the hassale.</li>
            <li> With a long history of oral complications, I have always been willing to try out new products to improve my oral health- and this Matwave model has become one of my favorite things to use. The ergonomic handle  has a magnetic attachment that makes for easy clean up and no wire tangling, the water tank holds enough water for me to rinse my entire mouth, and it&#x27;s very convenient to use and share with the family because of the extra tips that come with the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variable speed keypad suit a variety of uses- gum massaging, regular water flossing, and allowed me to work up from a lower pressure to a higher pressure over time. Sometimes I use warm water to fill up the tank, and sometimes with mouth wash, and as time progressed, I got into the habit of using the device daily. Soon, it will be time for my regular check up at the dentist, after couple weeks of usage, I already felt the cleanness in my mouth and I expect to improve the previous symptoms that I was experiencing (plaque buildup, sensitive gums, and occasional pain). This product is quite durable, and deserves every one of the 5 stars and was definitely worth the money!.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My teeth are happy, happy, happy.  :  )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everybody who still has their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Just Saying</li>
            <li> Order arrived on time, well packed and seems to be of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;High points: magnetic handle, variable pulsation rate, good pressure, 2-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Low point: tank is a bit tight at beginning then break-in gradually.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11yr.old son and he said the lowest setting is to high and he cant use it. The button should be to make it go as you want it to.. Not to do the exact opposite. Poorly made</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the Cleanpro V-20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is a dental hygienist and she likes it too. We use a water flosser because we know the importance of cleaning between teeth and below the gum line. Water flossing removes 99.9 of placque and is up to 50% more effective than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many Amazon reviewers, I didn’t have much luck with the Waterpik  WP-100W so I thought I’d try something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many things I like better about the Cleanpro V-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Year Warranty – The unit is solidly built so I am not anticipating any issues. But it is nice to know there is a 2 year warranty backing up this unit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quieter operation – The Cleanpro is quieter than the Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modulated pulsation rate of 800-1600 pulse/min - The advantage here is at lower pressures you also get a lower pulse rate making it easier to find a pulse/pressure combination that is comfortable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larger 900ml water tank – This means it lasts longer than the Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digital controls - This means you get one touch operation because the Cleanpro remembers your setting from the previous use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally sealed control panel – no knobs, nooks or crevices to fill with water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnetic handle mount – this is just cool…the handle magnetically ‘clicks’ in place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you are looking for an alternative water flosser that it more technologically advanced and a better built unit than a Waterpik that comes with a 2 year warranty,  I&#x27;d recommend you give the Cleanpro a try.</li>
            <li> This works very well! Adjustable water pressure allowing you to begin with light pressure and increasing for your comfort. Hubby and I have used WaterPic handheld battery units for years but they seem to only last for 6-8 months. Hoping this will last longer. Does have a two warranty. High hopes for this unit.</li>
            <li> I rated this one star because, when i received it i noticed some of the packaging was opened.&lt;br /&gt;Then after looking at all of it, I noticed it was used!! Someone must of returned it. I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great unit in design and function.  Love the magnetic wand holder and varying water pressure.  Very modern, sleek design made of what feels like high quality materials.  Had a little hiccup with installation of the rubber gasket and plug, but once my issue was made known to Matwave Technologies, Inc., I received great customer service and I&#x27;m back to being a very satisfied customer, (with healthier gums, to boot).</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to switch nozzles so family members can share one device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tank lasts for two or three uses, depending on who in the family is using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnetic hanger is handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this to clean the narrow space and corners around the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this to clean my teeth after eating fruits, since brushing can cause damage on tooth enamel due to the citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company logo on control panel is confusing; it looks like one of the buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the pause button on the handle locked, so I didn’t have to constantly hold it to pause.</li>
            <li> product is as described</li>
            <li> Easier to use than the WaterPic it replaced.</li>
            <li> This machine is wonderful and it  exceded all my expectations. This year I have had full dental implants and my oral surgeon suggested that I purchase a good quality water flosser to keep the areas around my implants clean. My mouth feels so fresh following cleaning and I continue to be amazed at how much food debris it removes even though I have already brushed prior to water flossing.&lt;br /&gt;A must for anyone with impants even if you have only one or two or a full set as I have.</li>
            <li> the flosser only worked for 6 weeks. The motor no longer runs.</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time with secure packaging, and the customer service was great, which I appreciate very much from Amazon and the vendor. I really enjoyed using this product because I could feel my teeth and gums getting healthier day by day. My gums used to bleed whenever I used a toothpick or floss, but with this water flosser my gums aren&#x27;t as sensitive and don&#x27;t bleed anymore. It cleans and flosses my teeth and gums very quickly and thoroughly, so my mouth feels refreshed after each time I use it. The water flosser did everything it was advertised to do - I especially enjoyed the variable pulsation rates and how it remembers the last pressure setting. The extra tips make it very convenient and user-friendly. If there is anything about this product that I did not enjoy, it would be the power cord. It is a bit long, easily getting tangled around everything else on the counter top. It would have been appreciated if a shorter cord or some wire clips were provided. Other than that, this is a high quality product with excellent craftsmanship. A great investment that I truly recommend for good dental health and hygiene.</li>
            <li> Bought this unit but did not put it to immediate use, until two weeks later, for some reason, my gum became flammable swollen,  I did not want to see dentist and hoped this device would be my “gum savior”, it actually is. I used it twice a day after each meal, also added Listerine, to my surprise, it flashes out food debris even after I did brush, the gum symptom improved a lot after a few days, hope this will eventually save me from making a doctor’s office trip! The device is well made, large reservoir kept operation with no interruption, magnetic handle is quite handy and the digital display is unique. One thing need to mention though, the reservoir started rather tight to be taken off, I sometime did not even both to take if off to refill, wish the vendor would improve this. Good product overall.</li>
            <li> Best oral irrigator I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;There is a great soft tip that enables you to really clean in pockets and under bridges.</li>
            <li> Much better than my Water Pik. The reservoir also holds much more water. The Water Pik I used to use would run out of water often before I was finished irrigating my teeth. Also, even though I haven&#x27;t owned this product a year yet (and it has a two-year replacement guarantee), in owing a Water Pik for about four years or so, I had to replace the hand held piece three or four times.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, my dentist saw my bad gums and suggested that I cut the top&lt;br /&gt;off by about a sixteenth of an inch. He then warned me that my teeth would&lt;br /&gt;look longer, and this vampire-like idea really scared me away. Instead, I&lt;br /&gt;turned to using a water flosser 4-5 times a week. This became a habit and my&lt;br /&gt;gum health has since improved by a lot.  After a couple of years, my old&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik lost its steam so I wanted to try a new water flosser, searched&lt;br /&gt;thoroughly on Amazon, and this Matwave V model looked appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I ordered the product, I figured the V-20G model would give me a&lt;br /&gt;bigger bang for the buck than the V-20B. Since I share with the family, the&lt;br /&gt;G package had more tips (9 in total) to go around family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package was well wrapped. The device package uses thick gauge cardboard,&lt;br /&gt;not corrugated board, which made the box very rigid and the device was well&lt;br /&gt;protected.&lt;br /&gt;The device is very well made, the low profile design, shape, and digital&lt;br /&gt;operation are unique to its kind. The water tank cover and base have a&lt;br /&gt;perfect mirror finish, the magnetic handle is something that attracts my&lt;br /&gt;eye, and the handle size is just right. The magnetic design made it&lt;br /&gt;effortless to take the handle on and off its base---a feature you would not&lt;br /&gt;expect to see on a water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tank has a 30 oz capacity, and after a few days, I decided to fill it to&lt;br /&gt;half tank for each use, which lasts about 1-2 minutes for my flossing with a&lt;br /&gt;mid-range pressure setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have played with the device enough and am happy with its performance.The&lt;br /&gt;pressure stays consistent with usage and I do not have to increase the&lt;br /&gt;pressure to get the same pressure as before. I will keep using it and keep&lt;br /&gt;the scalpel away from my mouth!</li>
            <li> This product is awful - leaked dramatically from the very beginning - and when I tried to get a replacement under the warranty, Amazon only had the number in China!  Thankfully, Amazon itself was great and refunded my money rather than making me go thru the manufacturer.  So Amazon gets 5 stars for customer service but Matwave gets a big zero for product quality.</li>
            <li> Seems fine, although the many extra parts do seem a bit excessive.  If it lasts two years I&#x27;ll be happy. Its noisy as are all these devices.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed with this.  Seal broke withn 30 days.  It doesn&#x27;t have the full &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; to water pick unless I push down on the water container with one hand while holding the pick with the other.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had my Water Pic instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that after contacting the company, they did reply immediately &amp; sent me replacement seals at no charge.  I would hope so since it was so new.  :-(</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, easy to use and gets the job done. Prompt delivery and GREAT SERVICE: when it arrived, a tiny rubber O-ring was defective, and getting a replacement was quick and easy. I&#x27;d give it six stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Waterpic flossers over the years and have found them less and less reliable with not nearly enough power to effectively floss.  I finally gave up, did some research I found the Matwave V-20G.  I have had it for several months now and have found it to be powerful enough and reliable.  Will never go back to a Waterpic flosser again!</li>
            <li> This is an update - after less than one year of service this product has broken and no longer operates. It is still a good machine, but you would have to consider it disposable rather than a long term product.  The first thing I noticed when unpacking this water flosser was the extra water valve that was packed inside. Sooner or later these fall out and get lost and then the tank leaks. Great idea to give your customers and extra. The water tank fits securely on the base and although they tell you not to leave water in it, I do and it never leaks. It holds enough water to complete flossing your entire mouth unlike others I have tried that need to be filled two or three times.The cover fits securely to keep dirt out of the water and I just pour the amount of water and additive I want to use from a glass into the tank - that way there is never a leaky connection. I love the digital controls, they are easy to operate and there are no nobs to get moldy from any water that gets on them. The magnetic holder is brilliant - nothing to break! The head fits securely into the hand device with an audible click unlike the Conair model that I recently returned where the head fell out every time I used it!! The motor is a bit louder than I would like in a perfect world, but it&#x27;s only on for a few minutes at a time so really who cares? I mistakenly ordered 2 of these and was getting ready to send one back, but my husband saw how easy it was to use and I kept the other one for his bathroom. It comes with at least 2 tips for other family members, plus other attachments which you may or may not use. I was prepared to pay a lot more for a well made machine than this one cost and I am very happy with the design and construction of this machine.</li>
            <li> I recently compared Waterpik to Matwave and it was like comparing an old Ford to a Tesla. Matwave is GREAT!!!! It&#x27;s speed cleaned and flossed my teeth in record time and it was so easy to use. The pulse rate is faster than the Waterpik so I&#x27;d rather use this and get the job done fast. My teeth and gums also looked great and my mouth felt really clean. Highly recommend this for any one wanting an optimum job but don&#x27;t have the time to floss. A teacher at a dental college I recently visited also was impressed. She swore by Waterpik but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Go Matwave!!!!</li>
            <li> Not as solid build at WaterPik but its cheaper and the reason I bought it is because it is 110-240V compliant.  Waterpik offers a travel unit but even that is 110V?  Waterpik / braun / Oral-B is out of their mind, they think people only travel in US!!!  I travel a lot, so needed something that works in all countries.</li>
            <li> Looked for a water flosser on the market and liked this digital design. The customer service was very responsive in replying my  inquiries. Delivery was quick, thanks Amazon for that! Unit is well built and works as expected, good experience overall, will buy from the source again.</li>
            <li> of the toiletnice product ...&lt;br /&gt;water pressure is a little low, but yippeupnida design is&lt;br /&gt;The lack of detailed instructions for useto free Volt.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the Water Flosser Matwave V-20G.  From the first use, the tank was very hard to remove and reseat.  I was willing to deal with these issues, until the unit failed to turn after less than one week of twice daily use.  So far Amazon and the seller seem to be very cooperative with my refund.</li>
            <li> This is a mixed review.  Like the pressure, and the big water container.  BUT... the container does not lift out for washing, and the motor is a noisy affair.  Very unimpressive, on the whole.  But it does the job and I shall use it until it dies.  THEN I will look for another brand to purchase. Please read my Comment about how it stopped working after nine months.</li>
            <li> This unit was purchased for my teens who have braces. It does an effective job of cleaning all that hardware. After a few months of use, I had an issue with the pause button remaining depressed so no water would come out. I contacted Matwave and they were very responsive. I appreciate them honoring their warranty. They sent me a new (working) base and did not ask for the old one to be returned. I received it quickly. The customer service was very good.</li>
            <li> Love.Much better than any other flosser I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> I bought this unit as a custom order to use for nasal irrigation. I&#x27;m currently suffering from a chronic sinus infection that&#x27;s been around for almost 4 or 5 months, and likely will not remit without surgery, which I hope to have done next month. Anhyhow, I&#x27;m a bigger guy, and it takes almost 8 iterations with a 240 ml. squeeze bottle to manually get all the gunk out of my sinuses. Instead of getting a unit purposed specifically for nasal irrigation, though, with potentially less power and a lower capacity, I wanted this unit because of its increased capacity (900ml) and advertised higher pulsatile power. When I voiced my concerns to Jason via email, he took it upon himself to offer me the unit with two nasal tips along with 4 other oral tips for the same price. UPDATE: I received a replacement unit for just shipping costs after it clogged from constant use. The unit is more than sufficiently powerful; the nasal tip just has to be slightly adjusted to get more oomph, but for most users, this won&#x27;t be necessary at all. I am highly satisfied with this product and the service, just need to be careful about undissolvable solids in the salt I&#x27;m using to irrigate with.</li>
