            <li>He said it&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s not oily or smelly &amp; soothes his face after shaving or work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>and I welcome the sun block SPF 15 that any dermatologists will tell you is the number one thing you can do to minimize aging of the skin...</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena moisturizer cream has been successful in stopping my razor burn and my face feels great.  </li>
            <li>I did some research online and found out retinol is the best ingredient for healthy skin on the face.  </li>
            <li>The changes in a three week period are remarkable; crows feet almost gone, skin looks and feels smoother and fresher and</li>
            <li>Amazing product, feels great when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, though.</li>
            <li>Good ingredients, SPF 15, non greasy.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been looking for something too fancy but saw this recommended in a magazine and tried and loved it.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is a superior product line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because this used to be a good product.</li>
            <li>So please consider that if you want to buy it, it is a good moisturiser cream</li>
            <li>This is a good combo of both, and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li>my challenge is to find a good face lotion that does not make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Provides good moisturizing with the added benefits of sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li>Really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>, it seems like a good product.  </li>
            <li>This one strikes a good balance.</li>
            <li>The inspiration came to win the love of a woman</li>
            <li>I am sure you would be happy.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and makes my skin look very healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m 42 now and am happy that something easy like this makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Great product, light scent.</li>
            <li>Does a great job as a mostirizer,  which was the primary reason for purchasing.</li>
            <li>This product does really nicely in this department.  </li>
            <li>, the SPF 15 is a nice side benefit.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is also a nice touch with Cali summers which I forget to throw suntan lotion on quite a bit so with this</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m good to go : 3</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably smoother and has a nice color after applying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good my face doesn&#x27;t feel oily but the smell could be better</li>
            <li>Saw no improvement or difference of any kind in my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought my man this product for his dry/combination skin and he&#x27;s absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li>This Nutrogena cream is the best I have found - and at a reasonable price point.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be ok, goes on good, not greasy or anything, have to see how it does..</li>
            <li>The closest match to the ingredients of the original great product is this L&#x27;Oreal product:</li>
            <li>It works great as a mild sunblock&lt;</li>
            <li>Pretty good !</li>
            <li>Honestly after washing I look OK</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li>but this is the best I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>makes your skin feel nice an smooth, and seems to do a good job of keeping you safe in the sun, since it has an SPF.  </li>
            <li>Works great as a morning or evening moisturizer, absorbs quickly, leaves no shiny residue and keeps my face looking very fresh.</li>
            <li>I think both of those others are great and have certain benefits and negatives when compared to this.</li>
            <li>I love most about this lotion</li>
            <li>I ordered more to bring overseas with me.  </li>
            <li>Looking better just makes you feel</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s not a problem for you, then this is certainly better than some greasy formula.</li>
            <li>It accomplishes a nice balance between a moisturized and smooth feel, without any oily residue.</li>
            <li>I do not see any visible changes, but the skin feels better.</li>
            <li>Love that my face does not feel oily after use.</li>
            <li>Disappears into the face, feels great, seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure who is writing these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Tiny</li>
            <li>, i love that it says men on it so that he would use it.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt better, of course it takes time.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily on my face.</li>
            <li>I also get better sun protection than my Banana Boat SPF 30 sun screen; my face gets reddened by the heat/sun.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena has a lower SPF 15 but protects my face better from the sun.</li>
            <li>I used this product along with a couple drops of hyaluronic acid before going to bed, and was always pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>The Neutrogena moisturizer has reduced the dryness and has improved the look of my skin, it looks a lot more</li>
            <li>Refreshing.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li>it, i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for more than a year using it after i shave.</li>
            <li>but I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin healthy and moisturized (go figure) throughout the winter.</li>
            <li>You will most like skip on this product; or, any sunscreen product containing the mentioned toxin.</li>
            <li>: I love it.</li>
            <li>Would buy this product wholesale if available!</li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>stuff is very straightforward.  </li>
            <li>I found this to be a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>and once I started using this product I saw a huge difference in my skin, more even an healthier.</li>
            <li>Best fifteen bucks I ever spent.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product and am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s a good sunscreen or really does \\&quot;fight aging\\&quot; who knows but I like it.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper at Nordstrom ruck, otherwise good product.</li>
            <li>I would describe the nice feeling as &#x27;mesmerizing&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Avoid this product as it&#x27;s full of chemicals!  </li>
            <li>Can easily see a difference when using it, skin is softer and moisturized after a couple days of usage.</li>
            <li>, it just gets used up very quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not feel greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>Just as advertised, very quick turnaround</li>
            <li>This applies easily, absorbs well, and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>not greasy and goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, I noticed a huge difference within a week.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and it is nice to put on some moisturizer after shaving and not have to worry about the Sun burning your face if you end up outside.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen does not have a strong scent, nor does the face cream itself.</li>
            <li>Best aftershave out there hands down .</li>
            <li>Of all the mens face creams I&#x27;ve used - this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>but I personally think it does, which is great for guys like me who tend to get a shiny forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use this primarily in the morning because it has SPF in it and gives me moisture without greasiness.</li>
            <li>I want it to be odor/vapor free.  </li>
            <li>and i have smooth skin.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and still enjoy the effect)&lt;br /&gt;Evens</li>
            <li>Makes my face butter smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started using this moisturizer and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Its sp15 which is light.</li>
            <li>Works good, but I have sensitive skin and it burns and itches my face.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>not much impressions, but still good product as well.&lt;br /&gt;cheap and nice quality.</li>
            <li>My husband bought this (not that he needs it, he already looks young for his age) and felt bamboozled because he thought it was a bit more effective than just a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>There may be more high end brands that do a better job</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, and it smells nice, but you get very little for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind all the amazing reviews before this Summer have all been made in regards to the OLD product formula!!</li>
            <li>This looks pretty neat and fancy until you&#x27;re about halfway or more through the tube.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena in May 2015 significantly changed the ingredients of this product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve seen significant changes.</li>
            <li>give it a shot , its super cheap too.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on clean, doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel, or leave my face looking shiny.  </li>
            <li>No odor or fragrance, absorbs completely and quickly into the skin, perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>The old formula they used was amazing.</li>
            <li>over this which goes on much easier and produced better results.</li>
            <li>Plus, they are fairly priced and address basic skin needs.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in wrinkles yet, but my skin seems softer, and it is good to have an SPF factor on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t really seen improvement with that however, the moisturizer part seems to do ok.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s good enough for me to continue to buy it</li>
            <li>claims because I don&#x27;t really believe in that type of voodoo-hoodoo magic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easily absorbed and leaves y skin smooth and supple all day.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, it works.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, it makes your skin tone much more even, but you can probably get the same ingredients at a better price from a local store.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, thats all I can say for this product.</li>
            <li>but nothing particularly extraordinary</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a hint of a sunscreen smell, but that quickly dissipates once you rub it in.  </li>
            <li>Adequate sun protection, and heals skin after a razor shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, I&#x27;m pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Hey guys, well I rarely write reviews for products unless they are a worthy mention in my book.</li>
            <li>is it&#x27;s very non greasy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After about two weeks of consistent use I can honestly say that my skin looks much healthier with more even tone, better rosier color, less noticeable scarring, and even clearer skin under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Be aware!</li>
            <li>Age fighter might be a little strong on wording, enhanced sunscreen is probably more appropriate.  </li>
            <li>I feel my face does look younger with this product and also if a very good moisturizer, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li>Skin feels and looks great after a few eeks of using it.</li>
            <li>product is somewhat pricey for those not used to paying for specialty moisturizers but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but when I went back to get more later they had raise the price to match Amazon&#x27;s so this is probably as good as you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li>product is somewhat pricey for those not used to paying for specialty moisturizers but it is well worth the price.</li>

            <li>Far better than the nivea after shave balm.  </li>
            <li>this moisturizer is not greasy and is rapidly absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li>It is not a lot in terms of volume, but well worth the price</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely had &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; over the course of my life.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, keeps my skin moist but not shiny or oily, and does seem to have a smoothing effect on my facial appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my skin way better and smoother and soft everyone noticed.</li>
            <li>and it really is worth it.</li>
            <li>will give it a bit more time to see if it really makes that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>good product from a big name its always better to go with big names instead of off brands!</li>
            <li>It feels nice when applied to your skin, and the feeling remains for several seconds.</li>
            <li>is good enough since it spreads pretty easily with no mess or residue.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that made my skin feel and look smooth thanks to its Retinol and Multivitamins(explains the price tag)</li>
            <li>I am pretty pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li>Mainly useful during the winter, when indoor heating can dry out your skin, especially right after you&#x27;ve washed your face in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>honestly, i don&#x27;t know if it reduces facial lines all that much</li>
            <li>Smooths on easily and is not heavy.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product, and I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li>: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3641089/Pictures/IMG_20150328_093623.jpg They even add the words &amp;#34;non greasy&amp;#34; in obvious awareness of needing to counteract the fact that it is now more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>It has helped even my color out and make the overall appearance of my face look better.  </li>
            <li>First off, my face has never been so protected while being moistureized</li>
            <li>If this is your first go at this type of product, I would just buy this one first.</li>
            <li>so I only use in on my face where I need it most</li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended using an astringent/toner prior to applying this and that helped even more.  </li>
            <li>I do think this works much better as a facial cleaner than moisturizer.</li>
            <li>That was a first ever to happen</li>
            <li>Having said all that, this is the first moisturizer that made me breakout.</li>
            <li>I was mainly interested in the SPF benefits and</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and there are no weird scents or chemicals that irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Price is too high and the lotion runs out too quickly.  </li>
            <li>The one other brand I had tried regularly had given me pimples periodically -- far from ideal for someone in their 40s!!!  </li>
            <li>I really like, I decided to make the most of what I have and so bought numerous beauty products.for my face.  </li>
            <li>However after turning 30 I noticed my pores becoming larger and lots of blackheads developing.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine, ran out fairly quickly and there are other products that performs the same and smell better.</li>
            <li>This is just a small step, but boy is it a good step.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it most likely as I get older.</li>
            <li>makes your skin look healthy and moist as opposed to dry all the time .</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and am always looking for something better to help protect and moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Triple Protect version of this which is much more common, but I don&#x27;t think it works as well and smells too strong like aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second time i bought works good took away dry skin.</li>
            <li>At retail, it really is overpriced for the amount provided but deals are out there.</li>
            <li>I much prefer [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Leaves a very oily/greasy look&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an outdoorsy type (hunting, backpacking, etc.) and never been much concerned about my looks</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absolutely reduces the appearance of wrinkles</li>
            <li>When I wash it off it is slimy and very noticeable</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave your face shiny or oily looking, doesn&#x27;t require that you use alot, and its reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not prone to breakouts much anymore</li>
            <li>it really does work.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noted or felt any change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through 3 tubes and can&#x27;t tell if it makes me look younger, but I figured out that its not that important anyway.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the balm and this product (on my face).</li>
            <li>If your skin is very prone to acne, like mine is, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>This also is very unassuming.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any particular change in the lines on my face, but multiple other people have commented on how good I&#x27;ve been looking, so maybe that&#x27;s something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mainly use Earth Science men&#x27;s balm for my whole body.</li>
            <li>It also has sunscreen in it -- which is good for those of us that are regularly in the sun for periods of time that are significant but not long enough to warrant actually applying sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I would say it isn&#x27;t quite as good as the Jack Black serum and Double Duty moisturizer</li>
            <li>keeps me looking young and pretty ...</li>
            <li>Like most of the other Neutrogena products I&#x27;ve tried, miracle stuff that doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young and good looking though, so it doesn&#x27;t have to work too hard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that most face moisturizers leave my skin greasy or with a slightly tacky feeling after I apply them.</li>
            <li>It actually has the sensation that it has penetrated the skin for a deep moisture, rather than leaving it on top for me to have to wipe off.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to score mine for a bit cheaper at Nordstrom Rack</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to score mine for a bit cheaper at Nordstrom Rack</li>
            <li>I have been trying different facial lotions but most seem to have a greasy feel, even though its for my type of skin like the Neutrogena Combination Skin formula makes my skin look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I will most likely look for something else next time until the tube design is improved.</li>
            <li>sample mainly used for a sunscreen?</li>
            <li>Again decent product</li>
            <li>I use it mainly at night and within a week of use I could see the difference.</li>
            <li>He was very hesitant to use any &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34;, but after some convincing, he tried it &amp; now uses it everyday.</li>
            <li>I have moderately oily skin (specifically my forehead and eyes) and find that by the end of the day I am blotting myself (for full disclosure, I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t spend that much time out in direct sunlight, but it is a plus that the moisturizer is also SPF rated.</li>
            <li>and I can only imagine the fun I&#x27;ll have trying to get some out when it&#x27;s close to gone.</li>
            <li>I get this tingly sensation but the packaging says it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>OoO Regenerist does a slightly better job of firming loose skin than the Neutrogena but goes on a tiny bit oilier and has a somewhat feminine smell (which I admittedly don&#x27;t dislike).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I though I would try something new</li>
            <li>So far this has been a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Thick, but blends and absorbs very easily.</li>
            <li>is a comparison of the changes to this Neutrogena product (left, old / right, new)</li>
            <li>Its not sticky and makes the skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I rarely offer reviews unless the product is very good or very bad, but this is absolutely superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually one for a multitude of face creams, or man products, but this is one that I find myself consistently coming back to.</li>
            <li>Jack Black is paraben free, whereas this is not</li>
            <li>Some shine, but easily blotted with a towel after a few minutes and doesn&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li>All I have to do is put on a little bit in the morning and my face is fine for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and my face stays pretty clear, but when I use this daily my skin breaks out</li>
            <li>My skin always feels smooth and tight afterward.</li>
            <li>I originally had wrinkles on my forhead and now they less visible</li>
            <li>Intense Double Action Re-Tautening Moisturiser - 30ml/1oz]]</li>
            <li>I can see a clear difference too.  </li>
            <li>but when I apply this moisturizer my skin looks alive and radiant.  </li>
            <li>So far, I already bought two of these.</li>
            <li>The only real issue I have (which is why I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars) is the package of the product.</li>
            <li>Note that the photos advertise on the Amazon page reflect the old product.</li>
            <li>i had tried Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30, 1.7 Ounce which is very greasy /oily.</li>
            <li>i didnt expect much from this since same company.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and bought this for the areas around my eyes.</li>
            <li>and wow.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feels soft and it doesn&#x27;t make skin looks oily.</li>
            <li>, you smell like sunscreen.&amp;#34;  It also left my face a bit shiny and didn&#x27;t moisturize very well.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get a ton of wrinkles when I&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far, I feel my skin feels softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of these emollients that leave too much oil on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It was not greasy at all and in fact, felt nearly invisible except for making my skin feel moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The 2nd tube, the bottom blew open while I was mixing it, squirting the product all over my shirt and pants, and wasting $5 worth of product.</li>
            <li>However, most creams with SPF are (A) Too damn thick, (B)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a handful of face moisturizers in the past, most of them not specifically aimed at men, before I finally decided to fork out for some of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually actually a fan of Neutrogena but this particular product was not it.</li>
            <li>AND THIS IS THE REASON FOR THIS PRODUCT TO HAVE SUCH A HIGH RATE OF 5 STARS.</li>
            <li>I had such high expectations for this product, but everytime I used it, it made my face break out.</li>
            <li>My forehead lines seem to have relaxed and my eye wrinkles are completely smooth and only show late in the evening when I get home from work and am really tired.&lt;br /&gt;Summary</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks, and it lasts a long time if you use it the right way.</li>
            <li>also tried the much cheaper Trader Joe&#x27;s facial mosturizer cream, which was noticeably greasier and actually caused a bit of acne.  </li>
            <li>Just be happy with yourself, unless you are really in a bad way and need the help.</li>
            <li>Several hours after I put in on my 9 year old daughter hugged me and said, &amp;</li>
            <li>short I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised w/ the look and feel when applied.  </li>
            <li>I washed my face several times but it took over 48 hours for my eyes to get back to normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is essentially a completely different product, and the new formulation is not acceptable in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li>I have tried other face creams and they did not go on very well.</li>
            <li>Definitely got rid of my laugh lines in a few days.</li>
            <li>I would never have expected such a positive change from the daily application of a face cream.  </li>
            <li>When I first took it out of the bottle, I thought it might be a little greasy because of how it looked, but it&#x27;s not that way at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The forehead wrinkles I am targeting, after about two weeks of consistent use (two applications daily), are getting less noticeable, but persist just a bit.</li>
            <li>With all other moisturizers, I found that applying them at night was really the only option.... until I found Neutrogena Men Age Fighter Face Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Apparently they forgot to tell Neutrogena that the eyes are located in the face or human beings.</li>
            <li>The thickness of some SPF creams is really a problem for me as I am black and they will basically make my face look purplish.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate which makes my skin dry and flaky.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> He said it&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s not oily or smelly &amp; soothes his face after shaving or work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> and I welcome the sun block SPF 15 that any dermatologists will tell you is the number one thing you can do to minimize aging of the skin...</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena moisturizer cream has been successful in stopping my razor burn and my face feels great.  </li>
            <li> I did some research online and found out retinol is the best ingredient for healthy skin on the face.  </li>
            <li> The changes in a three week period are remarkable; crows feet almost gone, skin looks and feels smoother and fresher and</li>
            <li> Amazing product, feels great when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, though.</li>
            <li> Good ingredients, SPF 15, non greasy.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been looking for something too fancy but saw this recommended in a magazine and tried and loved it.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a superior product line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because this used to be a good product.</li>
            <li> So please consider that if you want to buy it, it is a good moisturiser cream</li>
            <li> This is a good combo of both, and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> my challenge is to find a good face lotion that does not make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Provides good moisturizing with the added benefits of sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li> Really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> , it seems like a good product.  </li>
            <li> This one strikes a good balance.</li>
            <li> The inspiration came to win the love of a woman</li>
            <li> I am sure you would be happy.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and makes my skin look very healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m 42 now and am happy that something easy like this makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Great product, light scent.</li>
            <li> Does a great job as a mostirizer,  which was the primary reason for purchasing.</li>
            <li> This product does really nicely in this department.  </li>
            <li> , the SPF 15 is a nice side benefit.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is also a nice touch with Cali summers which I forget to throw suntan lotion on quite a bit so with this</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m good to go : 3</li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably smoother and has a nice color after applying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good my face doesn&#x27;t feel oily but the smell could be better</li>
            <li> Saw no improvement or difference of any kind in my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought my man this product for his dry/combination skin and he&#x27;s absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li> This Nutrogena cream is the best I have found - and at a reasonable price point.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be ok, goes on good, not greasy or anything, have to see how it does..</li>
            <li> The closest match to the ingredients of the original great product is this L&#x27;Oreal product:</li>
            <li> It works great as a mild sunblock&lt;</li>
            <li> Pretty good !</li>
            <li> Honestly after washing I look OK</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li> but this is the best I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li> makes your skin feel nice an smooth, and seems to do a good job of keeping you safe in the sun, since it has an SPF.  </li>
            <li> Works great as a morning or evening moisturizer, absorbs quickly, leaves no shiny residue and keeps my face looking very fresh.</li>
            <li> I think both of those others are great and have certain benefits and negatives when compared to this.</li>
            <li> I love most about this lotion</li>
            <li> I ordered more to bring overseas with me.  </li>
            <li> Looking better just makes you feel</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s not a problem for you, then this is certainly better than some greasy formula.</li>
            <li> It accomplishes a nice balance between a moisturized and smooth feel, without any oily residue.</li>
            <li> I do not see any visible changes, but the skin feels better.</li>
            <li> Love that my face does not feel oily after use.</li>
            <li> Disappears into the face, feels great, seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure who is writing these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Tiny</li>
            <li> , i love that it says men on it so that he would use it.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt better, of course it takes time.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily on my face.</li>
            <li> I also get better sun protection than my Banana Boat SPF 30 sun screen; my face gets reddened by the heat/sun.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena has a lower SPF 15 but protects my face better from the sun.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with a couple drops of hyaluronic acid before going to bed, and was always pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> The Neutrogena moisturizer has reduced the dryness and has improved the look of my skin, it looks a lot more</li>
            <li> Refreshing.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> it, i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for more than a year using it after i shave.</li>
            <li> but I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my skin healthy and moisturized (go figure) throughout the winter.</li>
            <li> You will most like skip on this product; or, any sunscreen product containing the mentioned toxin.</li>
            <li> : I love it.</li>
            <li> Would buy this product wholesale if available!</li>
            <li> Okay.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> stuff is very straightforward.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> and once I started using this product I saw a huge difference in my skin, more even an healthier.</li>
            <li> Best fifteen bucks I ever spent.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s a good sunscreen or really does \\&quot;fight aging\\&quot; who knows but I like it.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper at Nordstrom ruck, otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> I would describe the nice feeling as &#x27;mesmerizing&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Avoid this product as it&#x27;s full of chemicals!  </li>
            <li> Can easily see a difference when using it, skin is softer and moisturized after a couple days of usage.</li>
            <li> , it just gets used up very quickly</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not feel greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, very quick turnaround</li>
            <li> This applies easily, absorbs well, and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> not greasy and goes on easy.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, I noticed a huge difference within a week.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and it is nice to put on some moisturizer after shaving and not have to worry about the Sun burning your face if you end up outside.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen does not have a strong scent, nor does the face cream itself.</li>
            <li> Best aftershave out there hands down .</li>
            <li> Of all the mens face creams I&#x27;ve used - this is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> but I personally think it does, which is great for guys like me who tend to get a shiny forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use this primarily in the morning because it has SPF in it and gives me moisture without greasiness.</li>
            <li> I want it to be odor/vapor free.  </li>
            <li> and i have smooth skin.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and still enjoy the effect)&lt;br /&gt;Evens</li>
            <li> Makes my face butter smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using this moisturizer and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Its sp15 which is light.</li>
            <li> Works good, but I have sensitive skin and it burns and itches my face.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> not much impressions, but still good product as well.&lt;br /&gt;cheap and nice quality.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this (not that he needs it, he already looks young for his age) and felt bamboozled because he thought it was a bit more effective than just a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> There may be more high end brands that do a better job</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, and it smells nice, but you get very little for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind all the amazing reviews before this Summer have all been made in regards to the OLD product formula!!</li>
            <li> This looks pretty neat and fancy until you&#x27;re about halfway or more through the tube.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena in May 2015 significantly changed the ingredients of this product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve seen significant changes.</li>
            <li> give it a shot , its super cheap too.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on clean, doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel, or leave my face looking shiny.  </li>
            <li> No odor or fragrance, absorbs completely and quickly into the skin, perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li> The old formula they used was amazing.</li>
            <li> over this which goes on much easier and produced better results.</li>
            <li> Plus, they are fairly priced and address basic skin needs.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in wrinkles yet, but my skin seems softer, and it is good to have an SPF factor on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t really seen improvement with that however, the moisturizer part seems to do ok.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s good enough for me to continue to buy it</li>
            <li> claims because I don&#x27;t really believe in that type of voodoo-hoodoo magic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easily absorbed and leaves y skin smooth and supple all day.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, it works.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it makes your skin tone much more even, but you can probably get the same ingredients at a better price from a local store.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, thats all I can say for this product.</li>
            <li> but nothing particularly extraordinary</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a hint of a sunscreen smell, but that quickly dissipates once you rub it in.  </li>
            <li> Adequate sun protection, and heals skin after a razor shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, I&#x27;m pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hey guys, well I rarely write reviews for products unless they are a worthy mention in my book.</li>
            <li> is it&#x27;s very non greasy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After about two weeks of consistent use I can honestly say that my skin looks much healthier with more even tone, better rosier color, less noticeable scarring, and even clearer skin under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Be aware!</li>
            <li> Age fighter might be a little strong on wording, enhanced sunscreen is probably more appropriate.  </li>
            <li> I feel my face does look younger with this product and also if a very good moisturizer, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Skin feels and looks great after a few eeks of using it.</li>
            <li> product is somewhat pricey for those not used to paying for specialty moisturizers but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but when I went back to get more later they had raise the price to match Amazon&#x27;s so this is probably as good as you&#x27;ll get.</li>

            <li> Far better than the nivea after shave balm.  </li>
            <li> this moisturizer is not greasy and is rapidly absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li> It is not a lot in terms of volume, but well worth the price</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely had &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; over the course of my life.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, keeps my skin moist but not shiny or oily, and does seem to have a smoothing effect on my facial appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my skin way better and smoother and soft everyone noticed.</li>
            <li> and it really is worth it.</li>
            <li> will give it a bit more time to see if it really makes that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> good product from a big name its always better to go with big names instead of off brands!</li>
            <li> It feels nice when applied to your skin, and the feeling remains for several seconds.</li>
            <li> is good enough since it spreads pretty easily with no mess or residue.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that made my skin feel and look smooth thanks to its Retinol and Multivitamins(explains the price tag)</li>
            <li> I am pretty pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li> Mainly useful during the winter, when indoor heating can dry out your skin, especially right after you&#x27;ve washed your face in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> honestly, i don&#x27;t know if it reduces facial lines all that much</li>
            <li> Smooths on easily and is not heavy.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product, and I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li> : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3641089/Pictures/IMG_20150328_093623.jpg They even add the words &amp;#34;non greasy&amp;#34; in obvious awareness of needing to counteract the fact that it is now more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> It has helped even my color out and make the overall appearance of my face look better.  </li>
            <li> First off, my face has never been so protected while being moistureized</li>
            <li> If this is your first go at this type of product, I would just buy this one first.</li>
            <li> so I only use in on my face where I need it most</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended using an astringent/toner prior to applying this and that helped even more.  </li>
            <li> I do think this works much better as a facial cleaner than moisturizer.</li>
            <li> That was a first ever to happen</li>
            <li> Having said all that, this is the first moisturizer that made me breakout.</li>
            <li> I was mainly interested in the SPF benefits and</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and there are no weird scents or chemicals that irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Price is too high and the lotion runs out too quickly.  </li>
            <li> The one other brand I had tried regularly had given me pimples periodically -- far from ideal for someone in their 40s!!!  </li>
            <li> I really like, I decided to make the most of what I have and so bought numerous beauty products.for my face.  </li>
            <li> However after turning 30 I noticed my pores becoming larger and lots of blackheads developing.  </li>
            <li> Works just fine, ran out fairly quickly and there are other products that performs the same and smell better.</li>
            <li> This is just a small step, but boy is it a good step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it most likely as I get older.</li>
            <li> makes your skin look healthy and moist as opposed to dry all the time .</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and am always looking for something better to help protect and moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Triple Protect version of this which is much more common, but I don&#x27;t think it works as well and smells too strong like aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second time i bought works good took away dry skin.</li>
            <li> At retail, it really is overpriced for the amount provided but deals are out there.</li>
            <li> I much prefer [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Leaves a very oily/greasy look&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an outdoorsy type (hunting, backpacking, etc.) and never been much concerned about my looks</li>
            <li> /&gt;It absolutely reduces the appearance of wrinkles</li>
            <li> When I wash it off it is slimy and very noticeable</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your face shiny or oily looking, doesn&#x27;t require that you use alot, and its reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not prone to breakouts much anymore</li>
            <li> it really does work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noted or felt any change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 tubes and can&#x27;t tell if it makes me look younger, but I figured out that its not that important anyway.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the balm and this product (on my face).</li>
            <li> If your skin is very prone to acne, like mine is, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> This also is very unassuming.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any particular change in the lines on my face, but multiple other people have commented on how good I&#x27;ve been looking, so maybe that&#x27;s something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mainly use Earth Science men&#x27;s balm for my whole body.</li>
            <li> It also has sunscreen in it -- which is good for those of us that are regularly in the sun for periods of time that are significant but not long enough to warrant actually applying sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I would say it isn&#x27;t quite as good as the Jack Black serum and Double Duty moisturizer</li>
            <li> keeps me looking young and pretty ...</li>
            <li> Like most of the other Neutrogena products I&#x27;ve tried, miracle stuff that doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young and good looking though, so it doesn&#x27;t have to work too hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that most face moisturizers leave my skin greasy or with a slightly tacky feeling after I apply them.</li>
            <li> It actually has the sensation that it has penetrated the skin for a deep moisture, rather than leaving it on top for me to have to wipe off.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to score mine for a bit cheaper at Nordstrom Rack</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to score mine for a bit cheaper at Nordstrom Rack</li>
            <li> I have been trying different facial lotions but most seem to have a greasy feel, even though its for my type of skin like the Neutrogena Combination Skin formula makes my skin look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I will most likely look for something else next time until the tube design is improved.</li>
            <li> sample mainly used for a sunscreen?</li>
            <li> Again decent product</li>
            <li> I use it mainly at night and within a week of use I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> He was very hesitant to use any &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34;, but after some convincing, he tried it &amp; now uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have moderately oily skin (specifically my forehead and eyes) and find that by the end of the day I am blotting myself (for full disclosure, I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t spend that much time out in direct sunlight, but it is a plus that the moisturizer is also SPF rated.</li>
            <li> and I can only imagine the fun I&#x27;ll have trying to get some out when it&#x27;s close to gone.</li>
            <li> I get this tingly sensation but the packaging says it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> OoO Regenerist does a slightly better job of firming loose skin than the Neutrogena but goes on a tiny bit oilier and has a somewhat feminine smell (which I admittedly don&#x27;t dislike).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I though I would try something new</li>
            <li> So far this has been a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Thick, but blends and absorbs very easily.</li>
            <li> is a comparison of the changes to this Neutrogena product (left, old / right, new)</li>
            <li> Its not sticky and makes the skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I rarely offer reviews unless the product is very good or very bad, but this is absolutely superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one for a multitude of face creams, or man products, but this is one that I find myself consistently coming back to.</li>
            <li> Jack Black is paraben free, whereas this is not</li>
            <li> Some shine, but easily blotted with a towel after a few minutes and doesn&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> All I have to do is put on a little bit in the morning and my face is fine for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and my face stays pretty clear, but when I use this daily my skin breaks out</li>
            <li> My skin always feels smooth and tight afterward.</li>
            <li> I originally had wrinkles on my forhead and now they less visible</li>
            <li> Intense Double Action Re-Tautening Moisturiser - 30ml/1oz]]</li>
            <li> I can see a clear difference too.  </li>
            <li> but when I apply this moisturizer my skin looks alive and radiant.  </li>
            <li> So far, I already bought two of these.</li>
            <li> The only real issue I have (which is why I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars) is the package of the product.</li>
            <li> Note that the photos advertise on the Amazon page reflect the old product.</li>
            <li> i had tried Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30, 1.7 Ounce which is very greasy /oily.</li>
            <li> i didnt expect much from this since same company.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and bought this for the areas around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and wow.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feels soft and it doesn&#x27;t make skin looks oily.</li>
            <li> , you smell like sunscreen.&amp;#34;  It also left my face a bit shiny and didn&#x27;t moisturize very well.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get a ton of wrinkles when I&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far, I feel my skin feels softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of these emollients that leave too much oil on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It was not greasy at all and in fact, felt nearly invisible except for making my skin feel moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The 2nd tube, the bottom blew open while I was mixing it, squirting the product all over my shirt and pants, and wasting $5 worth of product.</li>
            <li> However, most creams with SPF are (A) Too damn thick, (B)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of face moisturizers in the past, most of them not specifically aimed at men, before I finally decided to fork out for some of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually actually a fan of Neutrogena but this particular product was not it.</li>
            <li> AND THIS IS THE REASON FOR THIS PRODUCT TO HAVE SUCH A HIGH RATE OF 5 STARS.</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations for this product, but everytime I used it, it made my face break out.</li>
            <li> My forehead lines seem to have relaxed and my eye wrinkles are completely smooth and only show late in the evening when I get home from work and am really tired.&lt;br /&gt;Summary</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks, and it lasts a long time if you use it the right way.</li>
            <li> also tried the much cheaper Trader Joe&#x27;s facial mosturizer cream, which was noticeably greasier and actually caused a bit of acne.  </li>
            <li> Just be happy with yourself, unless you are really in a bad way and need the help.</li>
            <li> Several hours after I put in on my 9 year old daughter hugged me and said, &amp;</li>
            <li> short I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised w/ the look and feel when applied.  </li>
            <li> I washed my face several times but it took over 48 hours for my eyes to get back to normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is essentially a completely different product, and the new formulation is not acceptable in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> I have tried other face creams and they did not go on very well.</li>
            <li> Definitely got rid of my laugh lines in a few days.</li>
            <li> I would never have expected such a positive change from the daily application of a face cream.  </li>
            <li> When I first took it out of the bottle, I thought it might be a little greasy because of how it looked, but it&#x27;s not that way at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The forehead wrinkles I am targeting, after about two weeks of consistent use (two applications daily), are getting less noticeable, but persist just a bit.</li>
            <li> With all other moisturizers, I found that applying them at night was really the only option.... until I found Neutrogena Men Age Fighter Face Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Apparently they forgot to tell Neutrogena that the eyes are located in the face or human beings.</li>
            <li> The thickness of some SPF creams is really a problem for me as I am black and they will basically make my face look purplish.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate which makes my skin dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way and believe me...</li>
            <li> only complaint is I&#x27;d like to see this product with a higher SPF rating, say 50.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a 52 ear old male with oily skin with some moderate acne scarring and uneven tone in some places.  </li>
            <li> The real highlight though is the lack of vapors from this product, the other products I&#x27;ve tried make my eyes burn slightly from their vapors.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and never really used products such as this other than suncream which my wife inflicted upon me when we were on vacation.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, especially in the winter, so if I don&#x27;t have a moisturizing lotion on it, my cheeks and forehead get flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;ve had several ladies comment on how dry my skin is</li>
            <li> but I have used for quite a while now on a daily basis and the tube has barely gone down any.</li>
            <li> The only thing that comes close is Jack Black Double Duty and Oil of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream (both of which are almost double the price per oz).</li>
            <li> requires a small amount each application, one tube lasts me 6+ weeks with near daily</li>
            <li> but it goes a long way</li>
            <li> Absolutely everyone, each and every one I&#x27;ve met since starting using it, has commented that I look at least 25 years younger than the previous months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure what exactly I am supposed to see versus the plain facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try some other lesser priced lotions.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the other skin rejuvenation claims but it does seem to make my face feel younger</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who has dry skin and want to improve their appearance.</li>
            <li> The telling active ingredients on the back have changed from &amp;#34;Ensulizole 1%, Octinoxate 6%&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Avobenzone (1.5%),</li>
            <li> Also, a little seems to go a long way, though not long enough as the tube I ordered is only 1.4 ounces and at just under $14 is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or oily in the slightest which my face does not react well too usually.</li>
            <li> just apply a pretty thin layer</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a larger container, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There is a slight odor, similar to an \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; sunscreen lotion.  </li>
            <li> The pores are a lot smaller and the amount of blackheads is less.  </li>
            <li> My face seems!to be clearer and no new zits!  </li>
            <li> *hopefully* a little extra moisturizer won&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> is that it goes on and absorbs immediately with absolutely no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> and I hope I will have the result I expected.</li>
            <li> This is much harder to find than any of the other stuff.  </li>
            <li> I typically have dry skin and at times my face can become flaky.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I see any actual reduction in wrinkles (happily, I never really believed there would be)</li>
            <li> Not too greasy and a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> I never washed my face let alone use moisturizers or other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t from other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Fairly low scent and definitely not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> My Husband likes this product because it is not greasy like all the other brands he has tried.</li>
            <li> only a small amount is needed.  </li>
            <li> I try to use it daily, and it does seem to reduce some small wrinkles.</li>
            <li> do not intend to use any other moisturizer again.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I bought it for the moisturizing benefits and if the active ingredients fight aging, then I&#x27;m all for it.  </li>
            <li> an old school Irish lad so slapping on face creams is a bit weird</li>
            <li> Look at the active ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I sort of wish it would hold up to being active (swimming/sweating) but it works for me as is.</li>
            <li> I work in the very cold environment area (39 degree most of the time).</li>
            <li> The first one I used, it is impossible to get the last .2 ounces out, and the black coating on the tube flakes off.  </li>
            <li> When it runs low, its hard to get the remaining out.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the aluminum tube it comes in.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the container.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By an average non-gullible beauty product customer</li>
            <li> But the new formula smells terrible and feels like your putting on cheap sunscreen.</li>
            <li> After trying several common skin lotions and sun blocks that felt greasy and sometimes made my face shiny, I did a little search on Amazon for face moisturizers for men and</li>
            <li> A small dab will usually do and it should last you a month or so of use.</li>
            <li> A small dab will usually do and it should last you a month or so of use.</li>
            <li> In the last two orders of this product, I have noticed that either I was shipped the wrong product or the product has quiet changed.  </li>
            <li> I had previously been using Gillette aftershave gel for my face, but decided to switch up after suffering from razor burn during the fall and winter.  </li>
            <li> The black plastic would peel off from the container.</li>
            <li> revitalzied and age lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Yes, using a sunscreen will protect you from sun damage and make you age less.</li>
            <li> slight scent.</li>
            <li> I hate to say I&#x27;m metro, but as I struggle to hang on to my youth, I find myself exploring products generally taboo to \\&quot;real men.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I have used other brands in the past and this seems to keep my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I have never used a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling a little greasy or make me break out.</li>
            <li> If you apply it like once everyday depending on your face size.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> wow was i wrong.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> Never had any adverse reactions or felt that the moisturizer was too heavy or scented.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday after I get out of the shower as a moisturizer, aftershave and to help keep the greasiness appearance that I can sometimes get.</li>
            <li> and i like it for a few reasons:  </li>
            <li> I started using this cream a few days ago with one application every morning.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Does the job moisturizing as with other Neutrogena products, the \\&quot;age fighter\\&quot; bit is questionable with no noticeable difference from using it regularly.</li>
            <li> The smell of the cream is not strong but its smell in combination with the gel has gotten me compliments from women.  </li>
            <li> You just have to use an extremely small amount and within a few minutes after putting it on you</li>
            <li> Do your research on Titanium Dioxide, and when you find out why it is so bad; that some European countries have placed it on their hazard lists of possible carcinogen.  </li>
            <li> This cream leaves your skin dry and with a matte unhealthy appearance.</li>
            <li> Also for the price you get very little.</li>
            <li> It takes very little to moisturize the face.  </li>
            <li> Only sorry I didn&#x27;t start using this product years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recommended, especially compare to other expensive products!</li>
            <li> My usual moisturizer ran out</li>
            <li> (altho it&#x27;s not cheap!)</li>
            <li> Hard to rate this product, after a week of using it still made my face tingle as the ratings said, but the thing that I&#x27;m not sure is, it made the lines around my nose crack.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks pricey, being $12-13 for a small tube, but it lasts at least a month.</li>
            <li> At this price it is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> At that point getting cream out becomes tricky to say the least</li>
            <li> I bought this item to try and slow the wrinkles a bit.</li>
            <li> : compared with other products for men with this potency I don&#x27;t find it expensive at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products for my face, even some very expensive items</li>
            <li> problem solved and i havent broken out.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion but the material that the tube is made out of was a poor choice.</li>
            <li> the big names have to keep the reputations up so they can&#x27;t have a bad product!</li>
            <li> (Sorry if that&#x27;s TMI, but I&#x27;m just telling it like it is.)  </li>
            <li> (Sorry about sounding so clinical, but I do like this stuff.)</li>
            <li> It is not good for me!!</li>
            <li> It is fairly expensive lotion</li>
            <li> and it seems expensive to replace when there are cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> it starts folding in a weird way.</li>
            <li> This is just expensive sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> (C) Smell weird, or (D) cause acne/pimples.</li>
            <li> but I always read reviews before I purchase products so perhaps I feel guilty and need to contribute.</li>
            <li> It will clog pores and make my face feel miserable if it&#x27;s on too long.</li>
            <li> ill be using this forever !</li>
            <li> The sweat from my forehead tainted with this cream reached my eyes and the reaction was so violent that for a while I feared that I was going blind.</li>
            <li> Horrible, my skin was always burning after application.</li>
            <li> &quot; it comes in is awful.  </li>
            <li> But you don&#x27;t have to pay this outrageous price for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> worst the time and money, The product is not an age</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works as advertised. This is the only face lotion I use.</li>
            <li> Great product, light scent. No irritation. I wish the bottle was larger for the money. I would continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of face moisturizers in the past, most of them not specifically aimed at men, before I finally decided to fork out for some of this stuff. I&#x27;ve found that most face moisturizers leave my skin greasy or with a slightly tacky feeling after I apply them. I have moderately oily skin (specifically my forehead and eyes) and find that by the end of the day I am blotting myself (for full disclosure, I live in Florida so humidity is part of the issue). With all other moisturizers, I found that applying them at night was really the only option.... until I found Neutrogena Men Age Fighter Face Moisturizer. It is bar-none the best face moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried. The only thing that comes close is Jack Black Double Duty and Oil of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream (both of which are almost double the price per oz). I think both of those others are great and have certain benefits and negatives when compared to this. Jack Black is paraben free, whereas this is not but it lacks retinol that Neutrogena has. OoO Regenerist does a slightly better job of firming loose skin than the Neutrogena but goes on a tiny bit oilier and has a somewhat feminine smell (which I admittedly don&#x27;t dislike).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about this lotion is that it goes on and absorbs immediately with absolutely no greasy feeling. My skin always feels smooth and tight afterward. It actually has the sensation that it has penetrated the skin for a deep moisture, rather than leaving it on top for me to have to wipe off. It doesn&#x27;t claim to provide a matte appearance afterward but I personally think it does, which is great for guys like me who tend to get a shiny forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this primarily in the morning because it has SPF in it and gives me moisture without greasiness. I feel that it does a great job of all-day moisture protection. I reserve my greasier face moisturizers for night time use when they can be left alone without me looking like a greasy pig and I don&#x27;t need the sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is somewhat pricey for those not used to paying for specialty moisturizers but it is well worth the price. A small dab will usually do and it should last you a month or so of use. I was lucky enough to score mine for a bit cheaper at Nordstrom Rack but when I went back to get more later they had raise the price to match Amazon&#x27;s so this is probably as good as you&#x27;ll get. I&#x27;ll probably continue to play around trying different moisturizers but from now on I&#x27;ll always have some of this on hand and it will now stand as my go-to face moisturizer.the sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is somewhat pricey for those not used to paying for specialty moisturizers but it is well worth the price.

            <li> I like this lotion and feel it works great. No smell, great for night time. Not greasy at all. The only complaint is the aluminum tube it comes in. When it runs low, its hard to get the remaining out.</li>
            <li> For the price it seems to do the trick.  I ordered more to bring overseas with me.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer for men, this product is great.  No greasiness, no scent.  At retail, it really is overpriced for the amount provided but deals are out there.</li>
            <li> I like this item, it leaves your face feeling refreshed and it helps reduce the visible wrinkles. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works good, but I have sensitive skin and it burns and itches my face.</li>
            <li> I rarely offer reviews unless the product is very good or very bad, but this is absolutely superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 52 ear old male with oily skin with some moderate acne scarring and uneven tone in some places.  I never washed my face let alone use moisturizers or other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll, after rejoining the dating world and having found soemone I really like, I decided to make the most of what I have and so bought numerous beauty products.for my face.  All that I can say is that these products can make an enormous difference in improving your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For facial wash I use J and J Purpose in the am and L&#x27;Oreal 360 apricot exfoliator at night.  After washing am and pm I apply the neutogena age fighter.  I also use Olay&#x27;s Regenrist microdermabrasionol once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about two weeks of consistent use I can honestly say that my skin looks much healthier with more even tone, better rosier color, less noticeable scarring, and even clearer skin under my eyes.  Honestly after washing I look OK but when I apply this moisturizer my skin looks alive and radiant.  Nothing short of a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t known why I was such a Neanderthal before but now I can honestly attest to the need for men to use these products to look their best.  The inspiration came to win the love of a woman but now its all for me.  Looking better just makes you feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is for everyone, but this product is nothing short of a miracle worker.  And no, I am not affiliated in any way with the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.  Far better than the nivea after shave balm.  Best fifteen bucks I ever spent.</li>
            <li> Horrible, my skin was always burning after application. It doesn&#x27;t from other moisturizers. I&#x27;m usually actually a fan of Neutrogena but this particular product was not it.</li>
            <li> I work in the very cold environment area (39 degree most of the time). It help me to reduce flaking and redness on my face. No side effect or allergen at all. So far, I already bought two of these.</li>
            <li> Hey guys, well I rarely write reviews for products unless they are a worthy mention in my book. Well this moisturizer is so excellent. I have been trying different facial lotions but most seem to have a greasy feel, even though its for my type of skin like the Neutrogena Combination Skin formula makes my skin look and feel greasy. This is the first product that made my skin feel and look smooth thanks to its Retinol and Multivitamins(explains the price tag) these ingredients help keep your skin youthful. I don&#x27;t need it even though I am 20. Really great product. Only product I use as a facial lotion/sunscreen substitute. I only apply this when my skin is hungry for moisture or after I wash my face to seal my pores. If you apply it like once everyday depending on your face size. It could last you for up to 3months+ just apply a pretty thin layer is good enough since it spreads pretty easily with no mess or residue.</li>
            <li> This is much harder to find than any of the other stuff.  I tried the Triple Protect version of this which is much more common, but I don&#x27;t think it works as well and smells too strong like aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is very straightforward.  Fairly low scent and definitely not overwhelming.  The biggest thing I like about it is it&#x27;s very non greasy and easy to apply.  It seems to reduce the oily parts of my skin and feels like it tightens it up.  Whether it&#x27;s a good sunscreen or really does \\&quot;fight aging\\&quot; who knows but I like it.</li>
            <li> Although this moisturizer is not greasy, I still noticed pores blocking up.  (Sorry if that&#x27;s TMI, but I&#x27;m just telling it like it is.)  I&#x27;d suggest that if you&#x27;re still prone to breakouts, this might not work out for you.  If that&#x27;s not a problem for you, then this is certainly better than some greasy formula.</li>
            <li> Definitely got rid of my laugh lines in a few days. The forehead wrinkles I am targeting, after about two weeks of consistent use (two applications daily), are getting less noticeable, but persist just a bit. Good stuff, though.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  Good ingredients, SPF 15, non greasy. The \\&quot;tube\\&quot; it comes in is awful.  The first one I used, it is impossible to get the last .2 ounces out, and the black coating on the tube flakes off.  The 2nd tube, the bottom blew open while I was mixing it, squirting the product all over my shirt and pants, and wasting $5 worth of product. I will most likely look for something else next time until the tube design is improved.</li>
            <li> GREAT!  Combine this with drinking a gallon of water a day and you will start looking younger!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I wanted this product to do, and here&#x27;s how the product performed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I wanted it to moisturize my face (obviously).  It does this well, and the effect lasts for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;2. I want it to be odor/vapor free.  There is a slight odor, similar to an \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; sunscreen lotion.  The odor is not noticable enough to be an issue for me.  The real highlight though is the lack of vapors from this product, the other products I&#x27;ve tried make my eyes burn slightly from their vapors.&lt;br /&gt;3. No residue/oily feel.  This product does really nicely in this department.  It accomplishes a nice balance between a moisturized and smooth feel, without any oily residue. It doesn&#x27;t make my face look shiny either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the SPF 15 is a nice side benefit.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product, and I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li> Nothing has changed on my face</li>
            <li> I found this to be a pretty good product. Not too greasy and a little can go a long way. The only real issue I have (which is why I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars) is the package of the product. It comes it a somewhat tin-like tube. This looks pretty neat and fancy until you&#x27;re about halfway or more through the tube. At that point getting cream out becomes tricky to say the least and I can only imagine the fun I&#x27;ll have trying to get some out when it&#x27;s close to gone. I like the product but probably won&#x27;t repurchase until/unless the package is changed up.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, thats all I can say for this product.</li>
            <li> Does the job moisturizing as with other Neutrogena products, the \\&quot;age fighter\\&quot; bit is questionable with no noticeable difference from using it regularly. I much prefer [[ASIN:B004P26C6K Men Expert Vita Lift Intense Double Action Re-Tautening Moisturiser - 30ml/1oz]] over this which goes on much easier and produced better results.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m 41 and once I started using this product I saw a huge difference in my skin, more even an healthier.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Waste of money. Be careful!</li>
            <li> If my face gets sweaty in the gym, beware of this in my eyes. OUCH!</li>
            <li> One of the best face lotions I have ever tried. You just have to use an extremely small amount and within a few minutes after putting it on you forgot you even have lotion on your face. It&#x27;s not heavy or oily in the slightest which my face does not react well too usually. The sunscreen is also a nice touch with Cali summers which I forget to throw suntan lotion on quite a bit so with this i&#x27;m good to go : 3</li>
            <li> So far this has been a decent moisturizer. I do not see any visible changes, but the skin feels better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a while.  In the last two orders of this product, I have noticed that either I was shipped the wrong product or the product has quiet changed.  What I have is definitely an INEFERIOR product.  The front label, in red, has changed from &amp;#34;SPF 15&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;board spectrum SPF 15&amp;#34;.  The telling active ingredients on the back have changed from &amp;#34;Ensulizole 1%, Octinoxate 6%&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Avobenzone (1.5%), Octisalate (5%), Octocrylene (3%), Oxybenzone (4%)&amp;#34;.  Note that the photos advertise on the Amazon page reflect the old product.</li>
            <li> Be aware! Neutrogena in May 2015 significantly changed the ingredients of this product. Instead of 2 sunscreens it now has 4 different ones and the box now says &amp;#34;broad spectrum&amp;#34;. The downside is the product now:&lt;br /&gt;- Stings the skin&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a very oily/greasy look&lt;br /&gt;This is essentially a completely different product, and the new formulation is not acceptable in my personal opinion. The closest match to the ingredients of the original great product is this L&#x27;Oreal product: http://amzn.to/1AOwyCH&lt;br /&gt;Here is a comparison of the changes to this Neutrogena product (left, old / right, new): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3641089/Pictures/IMG_20150328_093623.jpg They even add the words &amp;#34;non greasy&amp;#34; in obvious awareness of needing to counteract the fact that it is now more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame.</li>
            <li> No odor or fragrance, absorbs completely and quickly into the skin, perfect for daily use. Can easily see a difference when using it, skin is softer and moisturized after a couple days of usage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for 2 weeks now.  I am pretty pleased with it so far.  It has helped even my color out and make the overall appearance of my face look better.  It has every thing you need in a moisturizer sunscreen, vitamins, and retinol.  It moisturizes well and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  I&#x27;m happy with my investment.  If you think it is a bit pricy it probably is, but if you can&#x27;t spend your money on yourself then what can you spend it on.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has actually made some of the wrinkles around my eyes go away. I hadn&#x27;t been looking for something too fancy but saw this recommended in a magazine and tried and loved it. I&#x27;m an outdoorsy type (hunting, backpacking, etc.) and never been much concerned about my looks but I&#x27;m 42 now and am happy that something easy like this makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love that my face does not feel oily after use.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a non greasy moisturizer with spf. i had tried Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30, 1.7 Ounce which is very greasy /oily. i didnt expect much from this since same company. wow was i wrong. this moisturizer is not greasy and is rapidly absorbed by skin. makes your skin look healthy and moist as opposed to dry all the time . give it a shot , its super cheap too. ill be using this forever ! problem solved and i havent broken out.</li>
            <li> My Husband likes this product because it is not greasy like all the other brands he has tried. Very good product</li>
            <li> Disappears into the face, feels great, seems to work really well. Just wish a tube lasted longer!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a superior product line. I am committed to their products. Plus, they are fairly priced and address basic skin needs. (Sorry about sounding so clinical, but I do like this stuff.)</li>
            <li> Warning: The product has changed and it is now greasier, smells like regular sunscreen, and makes my face greasy. I had to stop purchasing it. It&#x27;s a shame because this used to be a good product. Keep in mind all the amazing reviews before this Summer have all been made in regards to the OLD product formula!!</li>
            <li> Ripoff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure who is writing these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Tiny sample mainly used for a sunscreen? Really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It is not good for me!! Skin oily</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it makes your skin tone much more even, but you can probably get the same ingredients at a better price from a local store.</li>
            <li> Thick, but blends and absorbs very easily. No residues or grease left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells a bit like sunscreen, but otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> Best aftershave out there hands down . Razor burn, bumps, rash. Are eliminated with this product.</li>
            <li> This cream has a misleading name, it says Age Fighter but it is a sunscreen cream. So please consider that if you want to buy it, it is a good moisturiser cream but nothing particularly extraordinary</li>
            <li> Second time i bought works good took away dry skin.</li>
            <li> my husband is using it which is great, i love that it says men on it so that he would use it.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt better, of course it takes time. This is just a small step, but boy is it a good step. First off, my face has never been so protected while being moistureized and it fights age ! :D Definitelly recommend to others 5/5!</li>
            <li> Works great and after using it for a while i&#x27;ve seen significant changes. I originally had wrinkles on my forhead and now they less visible and i have smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Ok. This is the third mens age fighter I have tried. I am 40 and thought I would try some sort of face moisturizer/age cream. This is a good combo of both, and you cant beat the price. I would say it isn&#x27;t quite as good as the Jack Black serum and Double Duty moisturizer but those were almost $95 for the pair. At this price it is hard to beat. If this is your first go at this type of product, I would just buy this one first. I am sure you would be happy.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy. I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in wrinkles yet, but my skin seems softer, and it is good to have an SPF factor on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It works great as a mild sunblock&lt;br /&gt;It absolutely reduces the appearance of wrinkles (I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and still enjoy the effect)&lt;br /&gt;Evens my complexion by soothing red marks from acne&lt;br /&gt;Provides great moisture that lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big con, I can&#x27;t forget to wash my face before bed, this stuff is like a goopy barrier that stays on all day. It will clog pores and make my face feel miserable if it&#x27;s on too long. When I wash it off it is slimy and very noticeable that it&#x27;s still there doing its thing.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!! I have used other brands in the past and this seems to keep my face feeling refreshed. It is not a lot in terms of volume, but well worth the price</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I have sensitive skin and bought this for the areas around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using Gillette aftershave gel for my face, but decided to switch up after suffering from razor burn during the fall and winter.  The Neutrogena moisturizer cream has been successful in stopping my razor burn and my face feels great.  My skin is noticeably smoother and has a nice color after applying.  There is no greasiness with this stuff and it does not make your skin look shiny.  I bought it for the moisturizing benefits and if the active ingredients fight aging, then I&#x27;m all for it.  It also has sunscreen in it -- which is good for those of us that are regularly in the sun for periods of time that are significant but not long enough to warrant actually applying sunscreen.  It is fairly expensive lotion so I only use in on my face where I need it most and I have continued to use the Gillette gel on my neck after shaving.  The smell of the cream is not strong but its smell in combination with the gel has gotten me compliments from women.  I&#x27;ve been applying it once or twice per day, only a small amount is needed.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to take care of their skin or combat razor burn.</li>
            <li> For years I had been using various &amp;#34;after shave balms&amp;#34; all over my face. However after turning 30 I noticed my pores becoming larger and lots of blackheads developing.  I did some research online and found out retinol is the best ingredient for healthy skin on the face.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months now, on my nose, below eyes, cheeks and forehead and wow. The pores are a lot smaller and the amount of blackheads is less.  A friend of mine recommended using an astringent/toner prior to applying this and that helped even more.  I still use the after shave balm (Neutrogena Triple Protect) on my neck to avoid razor burn.  Anyhow, I am really impressed with this stuff. It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks, and it lasts a long time if you use it the right way.</li>
            <li> This says moisturizer but on the actual bottle, it says sun protection. The bottle is really tiny. The photo makes it look big but it is smaller than a hotel shampoo bottle.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, especially in the winter, so if I don&#x27;t have a moisturizing lotion on it, my cheeks and forehead get flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my challenge is to find a good face lotion that does not make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect. I have been using it for years. The fact that it&#x27;s also anti-aging with Retinol is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks pricey, being $12-13 for a small tube, but it lasts at least a month. Probably two. You only need a pea-sized drop on your finger.</li>
            <li> I have used a Neutrogena product of the same size, and I think I got suckered in the by the marketing of this product to men. For the same price I bought three 1.6 ounce Neutrogena Face Moisturizers with SPF 15. They were white and did not have the words &amp;#34;age fighter&amp;#34;. It is a good product and it is nice to put on some moisturizer after shaving and not have to worry about the Sun burning your face if you end up outside. I&#x27;m just not sure what exactly I am supposed to see versus the plain facial moisturizer. Again decent product, it just gets used up very quickly and it seems expensive to replace when there are cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily on my face. It dries with a thorough application. I also get better sun protection than my Banana Boat SPF 30 sun screen; my face gets reddened by the heat/sun. The Neutrogena has a lower SPF 15 but protects my face better from the sun.</li>
            <li> Like most of the other Neutrogena products I&#x27;ve tried, miracle stuff that doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and never really used products such as this other than suncream which my wife inflicted upon me when we were on vacation.  I tried this at the suggestion of a friend.  All I can say is WOW!  The changes in a three week period are remarkable; crows feet almost gone, skin looks and feels smoother and fresher and years younger.  I would never have expected such a positive change from the daily application of a face cream.  Only sorry I didn&#x27;t start using this product years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an old school Irish lad so slapping on face creams is a bit weird but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Apparently they forgot to tell Neutrogena that the eyes are located in the face or human beings. I applied this spf 15 cream on my face and went to do activities outdoors. The sweat from my forehead tainted with this cream reached my eyes and the reaction was so violent that for a while I feared that I was going blind. My eyes got deeply blood shot and my eye lids swelled up. I washed my face several times but it took over 48 hours for my eyes to get back to normal. This cream leaves your skin dry and with a matte unhealthy appearance.BEWARE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: AMAZON IS MISTAKENLY INSERTING REVIEWS FOR ANOTHER PRODUCT, THE NEUTROGENA MEN INVIGORATING FACE WASH, IN THIS LIST OF REVIEWS AND THIS IS THE REASON FOR THIS PRODUCT TO HAVE SUCH A HIGH RATE OF 5 STARS. WHAT A SHAME!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product along with a couple drops of hyaluronic acid before going to bed, and was always pleased with the results.  Never had any adverse reactions or felt that the moisturizer was too heavy or scented. Works great, would recommend.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very good. It makes your skin feels soft and it doesn&#x27;t make skin looks oily. The only complaint is the container. The black plastic would peel off from the container. Of course, this does not affect the quality of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Of all the mens face creams I&#x27;ve used - this is hands down the best. Doesn&#x27;t leave your face shiny or oily looking, doesn&#x27;t require that you use alot, and its reasonably priced. It seems to even out your face tone, and it lasts all day. Apply this after you shower in the morning and your face looks revitalzied and age lines are less noticeable. I&#x27;m 54 y.o. and people often comment that they can&#x27;t believe it. My kids&#x27; friends say that I look like I&#x27;m 40ish. Is it the cream ? probably helps.</li>
            <li> Pretty good ! Makes my face butter smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using this moisturizer and have been happy with the results. I typically have dry skin and at times my face can become flaky. The Neutrogena moisturizer has reduced the dryness and has improved the look of my skin, it looks a lot more healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t spend that much time out in direct sunlight, but it is a plus that the moisturizer is also SPF rated. Helps to know that when I do go out in the sun my skin is protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not feel greasy/oily. Would recommend to anyone who has dry skin and want to improve their appearance.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, feels great when you put it on. Does not let your face oily or sticky. Skin feels and looks great after a few eeks of using it.</li>
            <li> Gentle. Not greasy. Refreshing.</li>
            <li> I try to use it daily, and it does seem to reduce some small wrinkles. I&#x27;m young and good looking though, so it doesn&#x27;t have to work too hard. I&#x27;ll keep using it most likely as I get older. It is a pretty small tube for the $ though</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s not work because I just bought one tube and I hope I will have the result I expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> I like the lotion but the material that the tube is made out of was a poor choice. Once it gets low and you have to squeeze the last bit out it starts folding in a weird way.</li>
            <li> ITS A SUNSCREEN NOT AN ACTUAL AGE FIGTHING CREAM</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good my face doesn&#x27;t feel oily but the smell could be better</li>
            <li> keeps me looking young and pretty ... great product. will reorder.</li>
            <li> Used this for a couple of months. Saw no improvement or difference of any kind in my skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought my man this product for his dry/combination skin and he&#x27;s absolutely loving it. Since he&#x27;s used the product he can definitely feel the difference it has made in his skin, leaving it hydrated but not greasy. Great product!</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, it works. However, I now use Aveeno lotion because it is unscented and does not give a burning sensation around my eyes like this did. Also for the price you get very little. I do think this works much better as a facial cleaner than moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have tried other face creams and they did not go on very well. They were to greasy and did not absorb into the skin at all. This Neutrogena product is just the opposite!</li>
            <li> This will make your face like Benjamin Button</li>
            <li> not much impressions, but still good product as well.&lt;br /&gt;cheap and nice quality. Recommended, especially compare to other expensive products!</li>
            <li> Hard to rate this product, after a week of using it still made my face tingle as the ratings said, but the thing that I&#x27;m not sure is, it made the lines around my nose crack. That was a first ever to happen so I had to stop using the product and waited to heal, but now I decided not to continue using this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely had &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; over the course of my life.  I&#x27;ve used moisterizer&#x27;s for years.  Having said all that, this is the first moisturizer that made me breakout.</li>
            <li> all this is, is  a sunscreen w/ moisturizer. Yes, using a sunscreen will protect you from sun damage and make you age less. But you don&#x27;t have to pay this outrageous price for a sunscreen. My husband bought this (not that he needs it, he already looks young for his age) and felt bamboozled because he thought it was a bit more effective than just a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is just expensive sunscreen.  Look at the active ingredients.  It is literally nothing but sunscreen, and it smells like sunscreen.  Several hours after I put in on my 9 year old daughter hugged me and said, &amp;#34;Ew, you smell like sunscreen.&amp;#34;  It also left my face a bit shiny and didn&#x27;t moisturize very well.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and am always looking for something better to help protect and moisturize my skin.  I don&#x27;t know how well it fights age, I haven&#x27;t really seen improvement with that however, the moisturizer part seems to do ok.  I will definitely continue to use this and see how it continues to go.  4 stars for now, maybe 5 if I start seeing any &amp;#34;age fighting.&amp;#34;  I would recommend this as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for awhile now.  It has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> My usual moisturizer ran out and I though I would try something new (I think since I&#x27;m rapidly approaching 40 the age fighting tagline pulled me in) I&#x27;m not prone to breakouts much anymore but this product caused my face to break out all over. Your mileage may vary, but if you have a history of breakouts from facial products you might want to avoid this.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face moisturized and protects from the sun. I sort of wish it would hold up to being active (swimming/sweating) but it works for me as is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one for a multitude of face creams, or man products, but this is one that I find myself consistently coming back to. Works great as a morning or evening moisturizer, absorbs quickly, leaves no shiny residue and keeps my face looking very fresh. Can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any particular change in the lines on my face, but multiple other people have commented on how good I&#x27;ve been looking, so maybe that&#x27;s something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only requires a small amount each application, one tube lasts me 6+ weeks with near daily application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a face moisturizer, then I&#x27;d definitely give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. It is not greasy and makes my skin look very healthy. I wish it came in a larger container, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday after I get out of the shower as a moisturizer, aftershave and to help keep the greasiness appearance that I can sometimes get.</li>
            <li> burns my face after putting it on.  Avoid this product as it&#x27;s full of chemicals!  I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> I used every day and may friends and works partner note the difference. It is not greasy, and isn&#x27;t smell. I would bye again.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, very quick turnaround</li>
            <li> The product lasts about 3 months for me when using it daily.  It takes very little to moisturize the face.  I feel my face does look younger with this product and also if a very good moisturizer, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I put it on every morning after shaving.  I get moisturizing, wrinkle reduction and sun protection. JDS</li>
            <li> Age fighter might be a little strong on wording, enhanced sunscreen is probably more appropriate.  It goes on nicely, keeps my skin moist but not shiny or oily, and does seem to have a smoothing effect on my facial appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Withholding the 5th star because this does cause my face to break out. I&#x27;m 30 years old and my face stays pretty clear, but when I use this daily my skin breaks out and I have to take a break from it.</li>
            <li> This applies easily, absorbs well, and is not greasy.  I use Neutrogena Triple Protect Lotion on the freshley shaven portion of my face and use this product on the rest.  Provides good moisturizing with the added benefits of sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this lotion for some time and i like it for a few reasons:  1) no scent, 2) not greasy, 3) doesn&#x27;t break out my skin and 4) leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day.......honestly, i don&#x27;t know if it reduces facial lines all that much but i do like it bc of the above reasons and that&#x27;s good enough for me to continue to buy it (altho it&#x27;s not cheap!)</li>
            <li> I bought this item to try and slow the wrinkles a bit. I am 57. I use it mainly at night and within a week of use I could see the difference. Even my friends have remarked. This stuff is a little pricey but I have used for quite a while now on a daily basis and the tube has barely gone down any. A little really does go a long way and believe me...it really does work.</li>
            <li> Really good moisturizer. It is not greasy and does not cause my pores to clog. I will buy more when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> The old formula they used was amazing. A six star product. But the new formula smells terrible and feels like your putting on cheap sunscreen. Beware.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used. I have never used a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling a little greasy or make me break out. This does neither. Best moisturizer out there. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Was using the Anthony product line and spending quite a bit on it... Started using this at 1/3 the price and it&#x27;s good. Easier to apply since it&#x27;s in a tube rather than a tub.</li>
            <li> Smooths on easily and is not heavy. Some shine, but easily blotted with a towel after a few minutes and doesn&#x27;t return. I use it over prescription collagen serum for the spf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month.  So far, I&#x27;m very impressed.  The lotion goes on clean, doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel, or leave my face looking shiny.  I live in a dry climate which makes my skin dry and flaky.  All I have to do is put on a little bit in the morning and my face is fine for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a hint of a sunscreen smell, but that quickly dissipates once you rub it in.  And I can&#x27;t vouch for the &amp;#34;age-fighting&amp;#34; claims because I don&#x27;t really believe in that type of voodoo-hoodoo magic.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I&#x27;m pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for everyday use. It&#x27;s so easily absorbed and leaves y skin smooth and supple all day. I never believed in facial products but when you hit thirty and realize your face needs some caring, this product has got to do the work.</li>
            <li> But That&#x27;s it&lt;br /&gt;Not worst the time and money, The product is not an age fighter.&lt;br /&gt;as stated on the ad</li>
            <li> Does it actually fight aging on your face?  I don&#x27;t know.  But my husband will actually use it and it doesn&#x27;t make his skin irritated or break out so I&#x27;m 100% happy with it.  I was mainly interested in the SPF benefits and *hopefully* a little extra moisturizer won&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper at Nordstrom ruck, otherwise good product. I have used this for more than a year using it after i shave. It makes your skin softer. 3 stars just for the price Otherwise 5.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  Made my skin way better and smoother and soft everyone noticed. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have tried various face creams over the years.  Looking for a daily face cream that gives me SPF protection, keeps my face from drying and helps soften the lines under my eyes in the AM.  The one other brand I had tried regularly had given me pimples periodically -- far from ideal for someone in their 40s!!!  This Nutrogena cream is the best I have found - and at a reasonable price point.  There may be more high end brands that do a better job but this is the best I have tried so far.  Only been using for a month but I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great for men anti -age product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be ok, goes on good, not greasy or anything, have to see how it does..</li>
            <li> it burned and my skin will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel nice an smooth, and seems to do a good job of keeping you safe in the sun, since it has an SPF.  not greasy and goes on easy.  slight scent.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have used to date. I was apprehensive about the price but it goes a long way and it really is worth it. It helps keep my skin healthy and moisturized (go figure) throughout the winter.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well. My face seems!to be clearer and no new zits!  I have bought my second tube if that says anything.</li>
            <li> Do your research on Titanium Dioxide, and when you find out why it is so bad; that some European countries have placed it on their hazard lists of possible carcinogen.  You will most like skip on this product; or, any sunscreen product containing the mentioned toxin.</li>
            <li> Goes on like a greaseless lotion.  Comparatively expensive with similar products from Nivea and Neutrogena but has more skin  moisturizing ingredients.  Just started using this product and am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> People aren&#x27;t lying when they rave about this moisturizer on Amazon. It makes your face look refreshed and it isn&#x27;t greasy. When I first took it out of the bottle, I thought it might be a little greasy because of how it looked, but it&#x27;s not that way at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SPF 15 was also a hook for me as I wanted a moisturizer that had that so I don&#x27;t get a ton of wrinkles when I&#x27;m old. However, most creams with SPF are (A) Too damn thick, (B) Too damn greasy/shiny, (C) Smell weird, or (D) cause acne/pimples. This cream has not caused any of those issues. The thickness of some SPF creams is really a problem for me as I am black and they will basically make my face look purplish. No such problems with the Neutrogena one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not intend to use any other moisturizer again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, and it smells nice, but you get very little for what you pay for. I won&#x27;t buy it again unless the price drops.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noted or felt any change.</li>
            <li> Price is too high and the lotion runs out too quickly.  Other than that, it seems like a good product.  I&#x27;ve gone through 3 tubes and can&#x27;t tell if it makes me look younger, but I figured out that its not that important anyway.  Just be happy with yourself, unless you are really in a bad way and need the help.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I REALLY like this moisturizer for everyday use.  It absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling protected and hydrated all day.  I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and there are no weird scents or chemicals that irritate my skin.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this moisturizer. He was very hesitant to use any &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34;, but after some convincing, he tried it &amp; now uses it everyday. He said it&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s not oily or smelly &amp; soothes his face after shaving or work (he&#x27;s a firefighter).</li>
            <li> I never comment on anything but I always read reviews before I purchase products so perhaps I feel guilty and need to contribute. I used this \\&quot;wrinkle-fighter\\&quot; before, when I was in my 20&#x27;s and it didn&#x27;t do anything. Now I understand why. I didn&#x27;t have any wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 35 now and have some forehead/eye lines that bother me. I figured I will give it another try.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it seems to irritate skin when you apply it. I get this tingly sensation but the packaging says it&#x27;s normal. The skin eventually adjusts and it&#x27;s not bothersome. Greasy - this is definitely not a day cream if you have oily or combination skin like me so I only use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: compared with other products for men with this potency I don&#x27;t find it expensive at all. It doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and even though it&#x27;s greasy it doesn&#x27;t block pores. Most importantly, I noticed a huge difference within a week. My forehead lines seem to have relaxed and my eye wrinkles are completely smooth and only show late in the evening when I get home from work and am really tired.&lt;br /&gt;Summary: I love it. It&#x27;s a daily skin renewal.</li>
            <li> Does a great job as a mostirizer,  which was the primary reason for purchasing.</li>
            <li> Works well with razor burn under chin, will order again</li>
            <li> It broke out my husband skin</li>
            <li> I started using this cream a few days ago with one application every morning.  So far, I feel my skin feels softer and smoother.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that my face feels a bit greasy for awhile after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give it a bit more time to see if it really makes that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> good product from a big name its always better to go with big names instead of off brands! the big names have to keep the reputations up so they can&#x27;t have a bad product!</li>
            <li> I am very happy about this product. It feels nice when applied to your skin, and the feeling remains for several seconds. In addition it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue afterwards. I would describe the nice feeling as &#x27;mesmerizing&#x27;. Would definitely recommended. Would buy this product wholesale if available! I&#x27;m definitely going to research for that, and see if I hopefully can find it.&lt;br /&gt;This works, already before buying it I could already see a difference in skin texture. Absolutely everyone, each and every one I&#x27;ve met since starting using it, has commented that I look at least 25 years younger than the previous months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By an average non-gullible beauty product customer</li>
            <li> Works Okay.  I mainly use Earth Science men&#x27;s balm for my whole body. I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the balm and this product (on my face). Leaves your face feeling hydrated, but for the price....I&#x27;ll try some other lesser priced lotions.</li>
            <li> Recommended in a ladies magazine for women to use. I like it so far. The sunscreen does not have a strong scent, nor does the face cream itself. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Use it as aftershave in sunny SC. Adequate sun protection, and heals skin after a razor shave</li>
            <li> Works just fine, ran out fairly quickly and there are other products that performs the same and smell better. (This review written by Bun&#x27;s Husband)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of these emollients that leave too much oil on the skin.  This one strikes a good balance. I wish it came in a larger tube, however.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer for after washing my face. I had such high expectations for this product, but everytime I used it, it made my face break out. If your skin is very prone to acne, like mine is, this is not the product for you. I&#x27;m also under 40, which probably means i shouldn&#x27;t have used an age fighter moisturizer either.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.I see difference. Will buy again soon. Its sp15 which is light. If you&#x27;re in the sun alot.youll something stronger</li>
            <li> Not sure if I see any actual reduction in wrinkles (happily, I never really believed there would be) but I have to say that it does moisturize the skin without any greasy buildup.  Mainly useful during the winter, when indoor heating can dry out your skin, especially right after you&#x27;ve washed your face in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the much cheaper Trader Joe&#x27;s facial mosturizer cream, which was noticeably greasier and actually caused a bit of acne.  Guess I&#x27;ll stay away from TJ&#x27;s non-foods products from now on!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  Non-greasy.  SPF protection.  I can see a clear difference too.  It works... not miracles... but works like it should</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products for my face, even some very expensive items but I&#x27;m getting the best results with this. Been using it for about a year now and will probably stick to this cream for life.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer absorbs into the skin without leaving an oily residue and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Its not sticky and makes the skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I hate to say I&#x27;m metro, but as I struggle to hang on to my youth, I find myself exploring products generally taboo to \\&quot;real men.\\&quot;  That said, I&#x27;ve had several ladies comment on how dry my skin is and if I tried some facial cream it would improve my skin and possibly me look younger.  After trying several common skin lotions and sun blocks that felt greasy and sometimes made my face shiny, I did a little search on Amazon for face moisturizers for men and the \\&quot;Neutrogena Men Age Fighter Face Moisturizer\\&quot; came up.&lt;br /&gt;In short I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised w/ the look and feel when applied.  It was not greasy at all and in fact, felt nearly invisible except for making my skin feel moisturized.  Also, a little seems to go a long way, though not long enough as the tube I ordered is only 1.4 ounces and at just under $14 is a little pricey. As they say, the price of vanity has no bounds... Just ask any plastic surgeon or dermatologist w/ a 3-month waiting lists. I can&#x27;t speak for the other skin rejuvenation claims but it does seem to make my face feel younger and I welcome the sun block SPF 15 that any dermatologists will tell you is the number one thing you can do to minimize aging of the skin... SUN BLOCK!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is I&#x27;d like to see this product with a higher SPF rating, say 50.  I recommend for all men, manly or not, and will reorder.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I work outside in the elements and my head is shaved for male pattern baldness reason.  I put it in my truck console and apply it before I get out every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protection and convenience.  This also is very unassuming.  I forget I have it on.</li>
