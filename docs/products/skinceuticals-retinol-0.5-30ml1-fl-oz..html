            <li>Very glad I purchased and have been seeing good results.  </li>
            <li>it is a must have for sure!</li>
            <li>First time I have used this product and very happy I bought it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>retinol at a great price, however, the 1% cream is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>By the end of day 5 when all of the peeling was done, my skin looked amazing.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>However to be fair, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I liked the gel cleanser.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, and increases collagen production.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product, even some fine lines on my forhead have completely vanished and I am mostly happy about the quick vanishing of breakouts and  the much more refined texture of my skin, I think I am happy with the 0.5 concentration.</li>
            <li>I could see that the Hydroquinone had worked much better</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s mostly intended as a preventative for</li>
            <li>This is a keeper:)</li>
            <li>The texture is identical, although Retin-A has a more yellowish tinge to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I totally love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this product vs spending $400 on renova.</li>
            <li>Cheaper is NOT always better.</li>
            <li>I purchased more for preventative reasons.  </li>
            <li>I started out with Retinol 1.0% and it was too strong...</li>
            <li>It seems to be working just fine for me.</li>
            <li>However, I feel like it is helping to keep the wrinkles at bay and smooth my skin.  </li>
            <li>so far so good....</li>
            <li>I have yet to see the full effects I guess.. been using this for 4 days now.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>My wife says it works great  also cheaper than other stuff she was getting at macys ext</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have prescription hahaha!!</li>
            <li>I am impressed by the opaque metal tube this stuff comes in (same packaging as prescription retinol) since retinol breaks down in light.  </li>
            <li>Everyone comments on how fresh my skin looks.</li>
            <li>For me, both give a \\&quot;warming\\&quot; sensation once applied, absorb well and make my skin more sensitive to sunlight.  </li>
            <li>If you want to try retinol, consult with a dermatologist and do it right.</li>
            <li>My skin was fine at night, it was fine the next day and the day after but the day after that is when the peeling started.</li>
            <li>prevents my blackheads from forming and heals any blemishes super fast.</li>
            <li>Oh also let me mention that on the first day, when I used the Retinol, I also used Hydroquinone 2% gel.</li>
            <li>Overall my skin just looked better.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I notice it has made my skin look younger and smooth!</li>
            <li>The morning after my first use of the product reveal a brighter and even smoother looking skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>First prescribed by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is better then what I found at local spas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first doses</li>
            <li>It is a bit drying but applying a good moisturizer about half an hour after using this product helps!</li>
            <li>I used a good facial scrub, wash cloth and baking soda on the last day of peeling.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much - did not cause any irritation or redness and instructions for use were very helpful.  </li>
            <li>red marks fade super quick too.</li>
            <li>and I was able to start using this product every other day right away.</li>
            <li>It works but I get red easily.</li>
            <li>It does what it says it will, but if you have sensitive skin use once a week, the peeling skin wasn&#x27;t pleasant to see, but I&#x27;ve gotten the routine down now!</li>
            <li>was hoping it would help with some wrinkles but didn&#x27;t get to give much of a chance</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a real difference yet as I have just started using it sparingly until my skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have too much flaking</li>
            <li>I do a gentle clarisonic buff followed by a moisturizer and my skin glows</li>
            <li>After about the fist 2 weeks of using, I applied to liberally and it made the skin under my eyes really puffy.</li>
            <li>Works very well have noticed less fine lines with this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>It has helped clear up some problem areas and makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>and I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Still only using this twice a week, but this has helped me tremendously with acne.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a rentinol product that wasn&#x27;t prescription strength and know that SkinCeuticals makes high quality products.  </li>
            <li>So, they couldn&#x27;t tell me how old it was, or if it was even really SkinCeuticals product.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>Retinol helps the skin to turn over and exfoliate faster than it normally would on</li>
            <li>I have found a couple others with a similar review to this, so know that I am not crazy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had stopped using Retin-A while pregnant and nursing, and in recent months had developed a dry-but-oily patch on my temple.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase again, probably the higher dosage next time.</li>
            <li>Still use it every other 2 nights as more frequent causes my facial skin peeled.</li>
            <li>First let me say, I realize this product is not as potent as Retin-A Micro...but having used the prescription retinol for 15 years, I got tired of the expense and decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My 55 year old skin is responding to this cream.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and clear in appearance.</li>
            <li>but I do use with La Mer soft cream at night.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft, smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>I was very careful when I started it, just using it sparingly, buytfrom the first application I noticed it dried away blemishes very quickly.</li>
            <li>cream isn&#x27;t as potent as its prescription cousin but a little still goes a long way</li>
            <li>So far, still only able to apply every five days or so to avoid excessive peeling and irritation.  </li>
            <li>This is a little stronger, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>its the only thing that keeps my skin clear and even toned.  </li>
            <li>I did not get the irritation that some people posted but would recommend gradually increasing the frequency of use especially if you had sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The peeling then progressed and got worse on day 2, leveled off on day 3, got better (almost done) on day 4 and was done on day 5.</li>
            <li>way less irritating than retin-a but is just as good.  </li>
            <li>and I find that it does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>, I ws just putting a very slight layer on top of my night moisturizer, which is maybe why I did not get the drying or burning sensation reported by a few.</li>

            <li> I use this product with other skinceutical products for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The only advice I would give is to start slowly,use very little, be gentle.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t make the final verdict before at least finishing the first tube.</li>
            <li> I started off slow with application as it stated, but I believe I must have applied too much (DON&#x27;T!).</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a little irritation so if you have sensitive skin you might want to start with this vs. the 1% strength.</li>
            <li> It is now 5 months after the fact, and my skin looks as if I have aged 5 years in only a 5 month period.</li>
            <li> I let it dry, then put moisturizer over it and go to bed.</li>
            <li> It did dry my face and neck, so it was hard to wear makeup for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> Used daily for three weeks, then slowed down to 3-4x/ week.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the texture immediately, but I expected to see a bigger difference in my dark spots by now.</li>
            <li> Be careful with how you use this product.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> With 0.5% retinol, I am using it every other night and have no problems and everyone is complimenting my skin</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive thin skin, please do not try this product.</li>
            <li> It also matified my slight oily skin.</li>
            <li> this made me break out in little whiteheads all over my face.</li>
            <li> Just a little dryness and itching.</li>
            <li> It eventually went away, but I was left with permanently thin skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> , my usual redness in my skin was gone, my skin tone was even.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles to begin with, so not sure if it is working.  </li>
            <li> It also made my dark circle WORSE because of the skin thinning.</li>
            <li> And it did bring out the little pimple bumps i had underneath my skin that i have been trying to get rid of for years!!!</li>
            <li> Start VERY slow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 26 and my skin has always been thin but this product made it even thinner.</li>
            <li> My skin looks very thin, shiny, and crepey now.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin.  I really liked it.  I use this product with other skinceutical products for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Works very well have noticed less fine lines with this product! It is a bit drying but applying a good moisturizer about half an hour after using this product helps!</li>
            <li> I started out with Retinol 1.0% and it was too strong...skin became too flakey using it 5 to 6 days apart.  With 0.5% retinol, I am using it every other night and have no problems and everyone is complimenting my skin (age 67)...under eye wrinkles, skin congestion all gone.  It&#x27;s like getting a $125 facial, and the results last because you can apply it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this retinol!! way less irritating than retin-a but is just as good.  its the only thing that keeps my skin clear and even toned.  it is a must have for sure! prevents my blackheads from forming and heals any blemishes super fast. red marks fade super quick too.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will, but if you have sensitive skin use once a week, the peeling skin wasn&#x27;t pleasant to see, but I&#x27;ve gotten the routine down now!</li>
            <li> this product was recommended to me by a friend that is a hair stylist. It has helped clear up some problem areas and makes my skin super soft. I use it every 3rd night and if my skin starts to get flaky I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> Does what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews saying that they think that it might have expired of whatever. I personally contacted SkinCeuticals like someone else said that they did, however I did not receive any reply from them. Maybe they are ticked off about me buying from Amazon lol, oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product twice and I have pretty sensitive skin. I did not feel any warming sensation when applying, it didn&#x27;t burn or anything like that. I put it on and then waited 30 minutes and then applied a good moisturizer just like the instructions say to do. I applied it in the morning and then washed it off at night and applied a Vit C serum and night moisturizer and went to bed. My skin was fine at night, it was fine the next day and the day after but the day after that is when the peeling started. The peeling then progressed and got worse on day 2, leveled off on day 3, got better (almost done) on day 4 and was done on day 5. I used a good facial scrub, wash cloth and baking soda on the last day of peeling. Oh also let me mention that on the first day, when I used the Retinol, I also used Hydroquinone 2% gel. By the end of day 5 when all of the peeling was done, my skin looked amazing. I could see that the Hydroquinone had worked much better, my usual redness in my skin was gone, my skin tone was even. Overall my skin just looked better. I also use Vitamin C with Hyaluronic Acid serum Daily. I only skip it when I&#x27;m using the Retinol.</li>
            <li> My wife says it works great  also cheaper than other stuff she was getting at macys ext......  time will tell in 15 years</li>
            <li> This product really works! It did dry my face and neck, so it was hard to wear makeup for the first few weeks. And it did bring out the little pimple bumps i had underneath my skin that i have been trying to get rid of for years!!! I notice it has made my skin look younger and smooth! My sundamaged skin is finally starting to look undamaged!</li>
            <li> My 55 year old skin is responding to this cream. No breakouts!!</li>
            <li> so far so good.... I have yet to see the full effects I guess.. been using this for 4 days now. I am used to the generic tretinoin but I coudn&#x27;t get it now coz I don&#x27;t have prescription hahaha!! will keep using it though</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and clear in appearance. I let it dry, then put moisturizer over it and go to bed.</li>
            <li> Waiting for this product to give me result.</li>
            <li> this made me break out in little whiteheads all over my face. was hoping it would help with some wrinkles but didn&#x27;t get to give much of a chance</li>
            <li> The morning after my first use of the product reveal a brighter and even smoother looking skin. Still use it every other 2 nights as more frequent causes my facial skin peeled. Definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> I used to use a 0.3 by LaRoche-Posay but they stopped making it. This is a little stronger, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> This product is great for me. It&#x27;s not too strong and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I have normal skin and I was able to start using this product every other day right away. I use it every night and I do see a difference in my skin. I think I will go up to the 1 next time, but I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Good price! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a few times a week at bedtime for a couple months now, and I don&#x27;t see much difference in my skin. However to be fair, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet so it&#x27;s mostly intended as a preventative for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a little irritation so if you have sensitive skin you might want to start with this vs. the 1% strength. Just a little dryness and itching. I do have rosacea, so I haven&#x27;t used it on my face at all - just my neck - so I can&#x27;t say how it would affect rosacea patients.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use up this tube, but may or may not purchase again.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I came to know about this through Paula&#x27;s choice Beautypidia (cosmetic products review). I was very careful when I started it, just using it sparingly, buytfrom the first application I noticed it dried away blemishes very quickly. that was already a big plus. Then I used it on my dilated pores and noticed a big difference in texture. It also matified my slight oily skin. I wasn&#x27;t using it alone, I ws just putting a very slight layer on top of my night moisturizer, which is maybe why I did not get the drying or burning sensation reported by a few. I only used it alone after one month and I did not have any side effects, as my skin got probably accustomed to it. The only advice I would give is to start slowly,use very little, be gentle. I am very happy with this product, even some fine lines on my forhead have completely vanished and I am mostly happy about the quick vanishing of breakouts and  the much more refined texture of my skin, I think I am happy with the 0.5 concentration. This is a keeper:)</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a real difference yet as I have just started using it sparingly until my skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li> First prescribed by my dermatologist. It can be drying so I only use about 2-3 times weekly. Everyone comments on how fresh my skin looks. You  will probably not see results for several weeks. I am over 60.</li>
            <li> First let me say, I realize this product is not as potent as Retin-A Micro...but having used the prescription retinol for 15 years, I got tired of the expense and decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I can&#x27;t know ahead of time if any retinol product will prevent me from getting wrinkles, but my skin&#x27;s reaction to this retinol is similar to how it responds to prescription Retin-A.  For me, both give a \\&quot;warming\\&quot; sensation once applied, absorb well and make my skin more sensitive to sunlight.  I am impressed by the opaque metal tube this stuff comes in (same packaging as prescription retinol) since retinol breaks down in light.  The texture is identical, although Retin-A has a more yellowish tinge to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had stopped using Retin-A while pregnant and nursing, and in recent months had developed a dry-but-oily patch on my temple.  Scrubbing wouldn&#x27;t make it go away, neither would moisturizer.  3 days of this cream and the patch is gone - so it must be doing some good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream isn&#x27;t as potent as its prescription cousin but a little still goes a long way and I&#x27;m not out tons of cash.  It seems to be working just fine for me.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much - did not cause any irritation or redness and instructions for use were very helpful.  First time I have used this product and very happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals has proven to provide quality products for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and have been using SkinCeuticals Retinol for two years.  I totally love this product.  It makes my skin soft, smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> seeing improvement in my skin already.  Purchased about 4 weeks ago.  So far, still only able to apply every five days or so to avoid excessive peeling and irritation.  Very happy with results.</li>
            <li> It works but I get red easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I liked the gel cleanser.  My complexion is brighter.  I did not get the irritation that some people posted but would recommend gradually increasing the frequency of use especially if you had sensitive skin.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Am loving product and that I&#x27;m helping to keep my skin at its best.</li>
            <li> retinol at a great price, however, the 1% cream is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and a must have.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the product did not seem to be having any affects. So I contacted SkinCeuticals to see what expiration was. SkinCeuticals can tell you expiration based off  a code on the product  in conjunction with where you got the product. When I told them Amazon, they told me no one is authorized to sell the products. So, they couldn&#x27;t tell me how old it was, or if it was even really SkinCeuticals product. I bought this b/c of the great price, but after contacting seller, I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a rentinol product that wasn&#x27;t prescription strength and know that SkinCeuticals makes high quality products.  Very glad I purchased and have been seeing good results.  I am thinking of trying the 1.0 strength next.  I didn&#x27;t have too much flaking but I do use with La Mer soft cream at night.  The price on Amazon is better then what I found at local spas.</li>
            <li> Great, makes a beautiful difference in the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this product vs spending $400 on renova. I used it every third night and my skin is flakey in the morning. I do a gentle clarisonic buff followed by a moisturizer and my skin glows</li>
            <li> Works great. Creamy &amp; softens wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This review is coming from someone who tried about 5 months ago-STILL have damage from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 26 and my skin has always been thin but this product made it even thinner. After about the fist 2 weeks of using, I applied to liberally and it made the skin under my eyes really puffy. It eventually went away, but I was left with permanently thin skin under my eyes. Be careful with how you use this product. Start VERY slow. My skin just was not cut out for this product. It is now 5 months after the fact, and my skin looks as if I have aged 5 years in only a 5 month period. I started off slow with application as it stated, but I believe I must have applied too much (DON&#x27;T!). Retinol helps the skin to turn over and exfoliate faster than it normally would on it&#x27;s own, and increases collagen production. If you have sensitive thin skin, please do not try this product. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying it at all. My skin looks very thin, shiny, and crepey now. It also made my dark circle WORSE because of the skin thinning. I have found a couple others with a similar review to this, so know that I am not crazy. If you want to try retinol, consult with a dermatologist and do it right. Do not buy this brand. Cheaper is NOT always better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! Still only using this twice a week, but this has helped me tremendously with acne. I have noticed finer lines have become softer. Looking forward to trying the 1.0!</li>
            <li> Made my wife not look like a lizard anymore</li>
            <li> Really good product !</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles to begin with, so not sure if it is working.  I purchased more for preventative reasons.  However, I feel like it is helping to keep the wrinkles at bay and smooth my skin.  I especially like the moisturizing effect and I find that it does not dry my skin.  I will purchase again, probably the higher dosage next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first doses so I can&#x27;t make the final verdict before at least finishing the first tube. it does cause some peeling and irritation to the skin after a week of usage but I guess that&#x27;s the nature of such retinol stuffs. let&#x27;s see!</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I started it a month ago. Used daily for three weeks, then slowed down to 3-4x/ week. I noticed a difference in the texture immediately, but I expected to see a bigger difference in my dark spots by now. Will continue use.</li>
