            <li>Also have had very good luck with items ordered from Edens garden.  </li>
            <li>This oil is great used as a scented oil on your skin and its my fault for thinking I could add it to bath soap.  </li>
            <li>Great item as decribed.</li>

            <li>Great scent.</li>
            <li>I thought with all those beautiful fragrant flowers in it I could use it as body fragrant, but it doesn&#x27;t smell that good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant at all.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It is a nice oil to get the room to smell nice, and it is a good quality product for those who are not well versed in aromatherapy to formulate their own aroma...  </li>
            <li>I would love this in a body shower gel!  </li>
            <li>smells awesome and mixes very well with my oils</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice, very unusual.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, but I&#x27;m not opposed to it either.  </li>
            <li>This oil smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Eh...just ok.</li>
            <li>I like the patchouli to dominate &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>But it is now my favorite favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Hubby and I love the scent of this oil.  </li>
            <li>I will order more soon</li>
            <li>Love the scent...</li>
            <li>I have to admit that at first, when I smelled this just out of the bottle, I wasn&#x27;t sure I loved it.  </li>
            <li>That essential is wonderful and the smell is perfect for any special romantic occasion, The oil is pure and for massage is work greatly for some sensual moments</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t that overpowering after awhile, just smells yummy and clean!  </li>
            <li>But the first time I used itin a bath, I was in love!  </li>
            <li>This item came very quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I know it says better to dilute it, but I have had no problem or irritation using full strength (on arms)</li>
            <li>And when i want a quick pick-me-up, a couple drops of this in my diffuser is just the prescription!  </li>
            <li>I thought it might smell really sweet because of the flowers in it, but it is really more of an earthy, woodsy, CLEAN smell.  </li>
            <li>The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous.</li>
            <li>am now thrilled to find there is a larger one because I LOVE this scent and</li>
            <li>what a wonderful smell one you can&#x27;t really put your finger on kinda like the outdoors or some foreign land</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of patchouli, or sweet orange (The two strongest scents in the oil in my opinion)</li>
            <li>I love to smell patchouli, but I don&#x27;t really want to smell like patchouli, if you get my drift.</li>
            <li>An exceptional blend of aromatic oils, complex but lovely, mixes well with colognes, I love it.</li>
            <li>The Sweet orange and jasmine lift my mood, while the lavender and others relax and calm.  </li>
            <li>I mixed it with 1 liter of sweet almond oil, and it was still very strong.  </li>
            <li>For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
            <li>then this is the right oil for you.  </li>
            <li>It was packed well, and was exactly as described.      </li>
            <li>I am going to add some jasmine to the gallon I already mixed and see if I like that better.    </li>
            <li>OMG I ended up buying large bottles of this scent.</li>
            <li>Always a premium product, always fast efficient service</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li>This really worked for me.</li>
            <li>having used much of it ,,,dont really know how to raye ir.</li>
            <li>The patchouli smell is present but is blended perfectly with the other oils to tone it down.</li>
            <li>and I just put on about a half hour or more before going out</li>
            <li>But with a stroke of this (and my head firmly implanted under the musky arm of my husband) I was able to perform and...ENJOY without a hitch.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The quality of these oils is unbelievable, just as good as any of the more expensive oils on the market.  </li>
            <li>and it settles right down.  </li>

            <li> Not saying that this is not a good base or doesn&#x27;t offer a solid oil to use straight from the bottle, just that several formulas can tweak this if you are an experienced aromatherapist.</li>
            <li> the small one will not last me long as I wear it daily.</li>
            <li> I use it in burner and a small ant last a long time.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll still give it 5 stars, because there is nothing wrong with it, and the item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> At the end of a stressful workday, hubby and I would just rub the oil on each other and there is something about it that just promotes relaxation and stimulates senses.  </li>

            <li> Not a fan. Doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I have to admit that at first, when I smelled this just out of the bottle, I wasn&#x27;t sure I loved it.  But the first time I used itin a bath, I was in love!  And when i want a quick pick-me-up, a couple drops of this in my diffuser is just the prescription!  The Sweet orange and jasmine lift my mood, while the lavender and others relax and calm.

            <li> This item came very quickly in the mail.  It was packed well, and was exactly as described.      The bottle says use a 3-5% dilution for topical applications.  I mixed it with 1 liter of sweet almond oil, and it was still very strong.  I combined it with an entire gallon of the oil, and now it is not too heavy.      It isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, but I&#x27;m not opposed to it either.  It seems that a lot of the reviews on here hint at an overpowering scent, and I can understand why.  If you like the smell of patchouli, or sweet orange (The two strongest scents in the oil in my opinion) then this is the right oil for you.  I am going to add some jasmine to the gallon I already mixed and see if I like that better.    I&#x27;ll still give it 5 stars, because there is nothing wrong with it, and the item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This oil smells fantastic! I love to smell patchouli, but I don&#x27;t really want to smell like patchouli, if you get my drift. This oil is the perfect mix. The patchouli smell is present but is blended perfectly with the other oils to tone it down. The other fragrances are evident too but no one scent over takes the other.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an oil to add to my unscented bath soap but I&#x27;ve got to keep looking.  This oil is great used as a scented oil on your skin and its my fault for thinking I could add it to bath soap.  The scent is very nice, very unusual.</li>
            <li> Eh...just ok. The orange is a little too over powering for my taste. I like the patchouli to dominate &#x3D;)</li>

            <li> Always a premium product, always fast efficient service</li>
            <li> I am usually a do terra oil girl. I purchased a gift set to try the oils. OMG I ended up buying large bottles of this scent. It did not seem to work as an aphrodisiac.  . . Thankfully because I defuse it at the office. But it is now my favorite favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> The smell of this blend is wonderful. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Disappointed somewhat. It has one faint scent I can&#x27;t place but it just doesn&#x27;t belong.</li>
            <li> Hubby and I love the scent of this oil.  I don&#x27;t diffuse it.  Instead, I dilute it in 100% almond oil and use it for massage.  At the end of a stressful workday, hubby and I would just rub the oil on each other and there is something about it that just promotes relaxation and stimulates senses.  Definitely a must have!!</li>
            <li> what a wonderful smell one you can&#x27;t really put your finger on kinda like the outdoors or some foreign land I don&#x27;t know ? I keep ordering it though because it smells so mysterious.</li>
            <li> Good product. I use it in burner and a small ant last a long time. I will order more soon</li>
            <li> Love the scent... I use this as my over all colone... ALWAYS, ALWAYS recieve compliments on how it smells....great item, I will be reordering it again, and again....</li>
            <li> This really worked for me. I am perimenopausal. My sex drive is gone, ladies. But with a stroke of this (and my head firmly implanted under the musky arm of my husband) I was able to perform and...ENJOY without a hitch. You may seriously consider subscribe and save for this one!</li>
