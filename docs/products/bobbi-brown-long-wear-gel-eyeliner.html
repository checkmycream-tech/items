            <li>Product stays on great even if I go swimming or go to the gym.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be great, but it doesn&#x27;t give the pigment everyone said it would.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I love this gel liner!!</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a great lining brush, too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through over a dozen pencils, sticks, crayons, creams and now this gel liner (in top brands) and this one is perfect for me.</li>

            <li>and I absolutely love the gel eyeliner and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li>This is beyond amazing</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Applies nicely and stays all day.</li>
            <li>I liked this product in the beginning</li>
            <li>If I make a mistake (yes, it happens), it&#x27;s very easy to correct it.</li>
            <li>I use a good quality makeup remover and it comes off just fine.  </li>
            <li>try  to ask them at the mall for free brushes ,good luck with that,</li>
            <li>You will need to get the brush to apply it with as it needs a very fine brush.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this one I was sure from the reviews</li>
            <li>I purchased 4 Bobbi Brown long-wear gel eyeliners in a reputable department store, so I know I bought authentic product.  </li>
            <li>I also have it in indigo and violet and love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE eyeliner on the waterline or on the lower lid, but this eyeliner did not come through for me.</li>
            <li>There are better gel eyeliners that you can buy at cvs.</li>
            <li>The long-wear eyeliner gel brush did not perform well, but the long-wear eyeliner gel is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping to love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love love love</li>
            <li>did I say love?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this liner.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love Bobbi Brown, but I am too broke to buy her make up anymore.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care because the price was ridiculously low and great for the gel liner itself!</li>
            <li>I decided to try it in another color many years later and am very happy I did.</li>
            <li>I love this because it lasts all day and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Love the product, it&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>all the time, she love it, some people say at the mall is cheaper she told me at the mall they never give me a free eyeliner brush with the bobbi brown gel</li>
            <li>I love that it goes on smoothly, stays on all day without fading or smudging AND washes off easily .</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the special applicator brush, and I love it.</li>
            <li>and it had so many good reviews here and on the website of a major beauty</li>
            <li>DO NOT by this eyeliner as soon as I used it it went on just fine</li>
            <li>I am a  huge fan of Bobbie Brown.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of eyeliner</li>
            <li>and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>the cheap crayon stuff.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed how easily it went on and stayed like new all day long.</li>
            <li>I had bought this a year ago and it lasted me the entire year (perhaps not the best hygiene) but it still applied like new.</li>
            <li>Once the eyeliner has been applied and sits for a little while, you are good to go for the day!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, really brings out my eyes, and stays in place all day!</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is not smudge-proof and it fades quickly contrary to the product claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Bobbi Brown products for over 20 years, and have loved every single product.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is worth the cost.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I was so surprised and excited when I found this product for sale for EIGHT DOLLARS!</li>
            <li>This gel eyeliner is great at first but within a few weeks dries up, cracks and leaves eyeliner crumbs on your face.</li>
            <li>I purchased this eyeliner because it received some kind of beauty award not too long ago</li>
            <li>the color is dark ,eyes look very cool and cute.</li>
            <li>really I&#x27;ve never had an eyeliner that I loved this much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value, but the only thing is that it&#x27;s only $22 in-stores at Bloomingdale&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Make sure you have some good eye makeup remover (especially if you mess up) because it really does stay on!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work out but from my personal experience, it smudges VERY easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands of gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I only use it on my top lids (to prevent smudging</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was of higher quality when it was first put on the market.</li>
            <li>This is the first gel liner I tried, but I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>ACTUALLY MAC IS BETTER</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite products from her line.  </li>
            <li>The e.l.f. cream eyeliner is only a bit better than this one.  </li>
            <li>Get it on right the first time tho cause once its on it is on until you are ready to take it off with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>With the right brush it goes on like a dream, though you do need a steady hand.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes, and this stuff hasn&#x27;t caused me any issues</li>
            <li>No, this eyeliner is not waterproof, but it is certainly water resistant.</li>
            <li>It really makes my eyes pop</li>
            <li>and I always feel ready to go.</li>
            <li>You do need to specifically take it off with eye makeup remover at the end of the day as it really doesn&#x27;t move at all.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping, reasonable price</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I will have to make a trip to the mall after all and get the real stuff.</li>
            <li>It runs and the real bobbi brown eyeliner DOES NOT RUN.</li>
            <li>Better than any other eye liner I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love every other bobbi brown product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried using different brushes because originally I thought that was the problem.</li>
            <li>The top makes a great line and its fun to see the gel glide on so effortlessly, and you can make it as thick or as thin as you want</li>
            <li>all types, all colors and this eyeliner provides the most intense, deepest black of them all.</li>
            <li>However, the product was not acceptable in terms of staying power (as it looked when first applied), and the flaking was completely unacceptable.  </li>
            <li>eyeliner does not stay put at all, the pigment doesn&#x27;t even compare to the true product.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to sephora and have to buy it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason I love it is because it gives a really black look.</li>
            <li>The black is very richly pigmented.</li>
            <li>Have purchased 3 other name brands and Bobbi Brown is by far, the most water resistent, stays on without smearing and was OUTSTADING for 8 hour wear.</li>
            <li>Like other brands, it dries very quickly in the jar.</li>
            <li>Unlike other brands, it&#x27;s still easy to use, even when it dries out.</li>
            <li>At the end of a normal 8-hr workday, I have \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it didn&#x27;t dry out so quickly.</li>
            <li>Others seem to dry out way too quickly.</li>
            <li>I think that the product was either very old, or a faux product ( knock-off from China).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy cosmetics online again.</li>
            <li>I wanted to replace my used - up eyeliner - the exact same product.</li>
            <li>try not to be overly negative, so I will say that it does look lovely when it is first applied, but shortly after it smudges and fades.  </li>
            <li>I put it in the microwave for 3 seconds in order to get it soft before i use it.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than other eyeliners I&#x27;ve been using for, well, my whole adult life.</li>
            <li>But it arrived pretty much all dried out and unusable.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants a liner that stays on all day long.</li>
            <li>I typically get the Espresso colored gel eye liner, but the black was the one on sale :)  </li>
            <li>It goes on slick and wet looking and dries matte and lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only around $21, lasts forever and gives a really professional look.</li>
            <li>Lasts most days for 8+ hours unless I&#x27;m very active and my lids get a little oily.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried that it would be some fake knock off, but I can honestly say that it was the real deal!</li>
            <li>Or at least mark it as not from original brand.&lt;br /&gt;Worst experience on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>$200 later after an emergency eye doctor appointment that afternoon, I am now being treated with 5 different eye drops, washes, steroids and antibiotics to calm it down.</li>
            <li>I only wear liner on my top lids and yet with other liners it would migrate down to my lower lids and give me raccoon eyes, which stinks when you&#x27;re going for a clean and not smokey look!</li>
            <li>I found pencils always looked a bit faded out whereas this gives a very crisp black sharp look and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>These particular gel liners are not worth 50 cents.  </li>
            <li>Too little pay off, too much aggravation.  </li>
            <li>I like how the ink feels very natural unlike some of the other brands i&#x27;ve used, which i felt the itchiness in my eyes after i&#x27;ve applied eye liners.</li>

            <li> It runs and the real bobbi brown eyeliner DOES NOT RUN.</li>
            <li> Better than any other eye liner I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love every other bobbi brown product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried using different brushes because originally I thought that was the problem.</li>
            <li> The top makes a great line and its fun to see the gel glide on so effortlessly, and you can make it as thick or as thin as you want</li>
            <li> all types, all colors and this eyeliner provides the most intense, deepest black of them all.</li>
            <li> However, the product was not acceptable in terms of staying power (as it looked when first applied), and the flaking was completely unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> eyeliner does not stay put at all, the pigment doesn&#x27;t even compare to the true product.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to sephora and have to buy it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason I love it is because it gives a really black look.</li>
            <li> The black is very richly pigmented.</li>
            <li> Have purchased 3 other name brands and Bobbi Brown is by far, the most water resistent, stays on without smearing and was OUTSTADING for 8 hour wear.</li>
            <li> Like other brands, it dries very quickly in the jar.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands, it&#x27;s still easy to use, even when it dries out.</li>
            <li> At the end of a normal 8-hr workday, I have \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it didn&#x27;t dry out so quickly.</li>
            <li> Others seem to dry out way too quickly.</li>
            <li> I think that the product was either very old, or a faux product ( knock-off from China).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy cosmetics online again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my used - up eyeliner - the exact same product.</li>
            <li> try not to be overly negative, so I will say that it does look lovely when it is first applied, but shortly after it smudges and fades.  </li>
            <li> I put it in the microwave for 3 seconds in order to get it soft before i use it.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than other eyeliners I&#x27;ve been using for, well, my whole adult life.</li>
            <li> But it arrived pretty much all dried out and unusable.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who wants a liner that stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> I typically get the Espresso colored gel eye liner, but the black was the one on sale :)  </li>
            <li> It goes on slick and wet looking and dries matte and lovely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only around $21, lasts forever and gives a really professional look.</li>
            <li> Lasts most days for 8+ hours unless I&#x27;m very active and my lids get a little oily.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it would be some fake knock off, but I can honestly say that it was the real deal!</li>
            <li> Or at least mark it as not from original brand.&lt;br /&gt;Worst experience on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> $200 later after an emergency eye doctor appointment that afternoon, I am now being treated with 5 different eye drops, washes, steroids and antibiotics to calm it down.</li>
            <li> I only wear liner on my top lids and yet with other liners it would migrate down to my lower lids and give me raccoon eyes, which stinks when you&#x27;re going for a clean and not smokey look!</li>
            <li> I found pencils always looked a bit faded out whereas this gives a very crisp black sharp look and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> These particular gel liners are not worth 50 cents.  </li>
            <li> Too little pay off, too much aggravation.  </li>
            <li> I like how the ink feels very natural unlike some of the other brands i&#x27;ve used, which i felt the itchiness in my eyes after i&#x27;ve applied eye liners.</li>
            <li> Only concern I have is, will it dry out before it&#x27;s all used.</li>
            <li> Stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> It does not smudge or smear, and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> It lasts long.</li>
            <li> but it soon got dry and gritty - even though I closed the lid after every use.  </li>
            <li> I tried other liners,but keep coming back to gel eyeliner..</li>
            <li> I have been using this long wear gel eyeliner in black for around 5 years now and never looked back.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s old or what.</li>
            <li> when I exercise, I&#x27;m talking like sitting at my desk and constantly having to rub the corners of my eyes to ensure it&#x27;s not running down my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, the eyeliner looks worn out and messy just like any other eyeliner product, but at a much more expensive price.</li>
            <li> BONUS - For moderate wearers, this pod, although appears small, will last you about a year!</li>
            <li> It is a huge disappointment considering it is on the pricey side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great advertising, awful product.</li>
            <li> What did remain on my upper lid was certainly firmly in place</li>
            <li> and I had to use waterproof eye makeup remover to get it off - which was expected.  </li>

            <li> Has happened to me with two of them, and I keep them closed tightly, use 5 x a week.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had issues about this running down my eyes throughout the day.</li>

            <li> black facepaint froma holloween shop.</li>
            <li> And one pot lasts me about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is NOT worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I&#x27;m out because of how much I paid for it, but it was rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> I got my mum onto it a few years ago</li>
            <li> and she also loves it and wears it everyday</li>
            <li> and she has also bought it in quite  a few colours now</li>
            <li> I had my make-up done for a wedding a few years ago and it was all bobbi brown products.  </li>
            <li> and although it is cheaper and does not dry out, it is difficult to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The intensity of the black makes my eyes appear brighter and less tired.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package and tried to use it, it was dried out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smudged and the line I applied in the morning is hardly visible.  </li>
            <li> (she is late 50s)</li>
            <li> No more wiping off any smudges during the day!  </li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like is that this liner is quite expensive and NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> It gave me a terrible allergic reaction (allergic conjunctivitis) that caused my eyes to produce so much mucus within 2 hours of putting in on I could hardly see.</li>
            <li> Really, really poor quality product.</li>
            <li> (I go for a thicker line) but alas, I dont put it on the lower lid because I know it will come off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the problem is that people have purchased &amp;#34;fakes&amp;#34;, it is a poorly made product that has been hyped.  </li>
            <li> The brush was poorly made (the metal part fell off)</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the product is in the trash.</li>
            <li> A FAKE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wanted really badly to like this eyeliner, but unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t hold up to its promises.</li>
            <li> The issue I had with all of them was that they flaked like crazy once applied, they smeared onto my lower water line, and therefore the color faded within a matter of hours.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I received eyeliner from a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I still use it, it&#x27;s just kinda annoying that it runs.</li>
            <li> its the one thing I hate going without</li>
            <li> Purchase this and be very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed expecially for the price I paid for it!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bobbi Brown is the bomb. I had bought this a year ago and it lasted me the entire year (perhaps not the best hygiene) but it still applied like new. this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of gel eyeliner. When I saw this one I was sure from the reviews it was flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had issues about this running down my eyes throughout the day. I&#x27;m not talking like when I exercise, I&#x27;m talking like sitting at my desk and constantly having to rub the corners of my eyes to ensure it&#x27;s not running down my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the &amp;#34;blackness&amp;#34; of this gel is awesome. It really makes my eyes pop and it goes on smooth. I still use it, it&#x27;s just kinda annoying that it runs.</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 Bobbi Brown long-wear gel eyeliners in a reputable department store, so I know I bought authentic product.  I wear eyeliners on the inside of my upper lid line around my eyelashes (tightlining).  The texture is somewhat creamy and I have excellent brushes to apply the gel liner.  The issue I had with all of them was that they flaked like crazy once applied, they smeared onto my lower water line, and therefore the color faded within a matter of hours.  What did remain on my upper lid was certainly firmly in place and I had to use waterproof eye makeup remover to get it off - which was expected.  However, the product was not acceptable in terms of staying power (as it looked when first applied), and the flaking was completely unacceptable.  I would pay a lot of money for a perfect gel liner.  These particular gel liners are not worth 50 cents.  Too little pay off, too much aggravation.  Really, really poor quality product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner! I&#x27;ve tried dozens of eyeliners....all types, all colors and this eyeliner provides the most intense, deepest black of them all. I only use it on my top lids (to prevent smudging or smearing)but I can wear it with color on my lids or none at all and I always feel ready to go. The intensity of the black makes my eyes appear brighter and less tired. In my opinion, it is worth the cost.[[ASIN:B002Q67HRK Bobbi Brown Long Wear Gel Eyeliner - # 01 Black Ink - 3g/0.1oz]]</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> I love this gel liner!! Very pigmented! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have been using this long wear gel eyeliner in black for around 5 years now and never looked back.  The pot lasts me probably around 2 years using it every day so is very good value!  The reason I love it is because it gives a really black look. I found pencils always looked a bit faded out whereas this gives a very crisp black sharp look and it lasts all day.  You do need to specifically take it off with eye makeup remover at the end of the day as it really doesn&#x27;t move at all.  You will need to get the brush to apply it with as it needs a very fine brush.  I also have it in indigo and violet and love it. I got my mum onto it a few years ago and she also loves it and wears it everyday (she is late 50s) and she has also bought it in quite  a few colours now and it looks great on her too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product.  It&#x27;s only around $21, lasts forever and gives a really professional look.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work out but from my personal experience, it smudges VERY easily. At the end of the day, the eyeliner looks worn out and messy just like any other eyeliner product, but at a much more expensive price.</li>
            <li> Just wish it didn&#x27;t dry out so quickly. Otherwise a great eye liner.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be the holy grail of eyeliners. I LOVE eyeliner on the waterline or on the lower lid, but this eyeliner did not come through for me. The top makes a great line and its fun to see the gel glide on so effortlessly, and you can make it as thick or as thin as you want (I go for a thicker line) but alas, I dont put it on the lower lid because I know it will come off. I have resorted to just using mascara on the lower lid. Hmmmmm. rats!</li>
            <li> my wife use that gel eyeliner  all the time, she love it, some people say at the mall is cheaper she told me at the mall they never give me a free eyeliner brush with the bobbi brown gel&lt;br /&gt; try  to ask them at the mall for free brushes ,good luck with that,</li>
            <li> I love this! Make sure you have some good eye makeup remover (especially if you mess up) because it really does stay on!</li>
            <li> It last all day is awesone. The best</li>
            <li> there is no way this is a bobbi brown eyeliner. not only was it NOT longwear, it went on as well and stayed put about as well as black facepaint froma holloween shop. the cheap crayon stuff. the has a greasy sheer appearance that too two coats to make opaque , i looked like a racoon within two hours..... do NOT buy!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is NOT worth the price! In fact i would NOT even pay 2 cents for it!!! There are better gel eyeliners that you can buy at cvs.</li>
            <li> BEWARE! This gel eyeliner is great at first but within a few weeks dries up, cracks and leaves eyeliner crumbs on your face. Has happened to me with two of them, and I keep them closed tightly, use 5 x a week. Purchase this and be very disappointed! Great advertising, awful product.I bought this both times at a Bobbi Brown makeup counter, so I don&#x27;t think the problem is that people have purchased &amp;#34;fakes&amp;#34;, it is a poorly made product that has been hyped.  Perhaps it was of higher quality when it was first put on the market.</li>
            <li> Stays on a long time. Better than any other eye liner I have tried. This is the first gel liner I tried, but I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is a must have.  The long-wear eyeliner gel brush did not perform well, but the long-wear eyeliner gel is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to love it. I love every other bobbi brown product I have ever purchased. This one produced an allergy nightmare that I am still living with 3 days later. It gave me a terrible allergic reaction (allergic conjunctivitis) that caused my eyes to produce so much mucus within 2 hours of putting in on I could hardly see. I also have itching, swelling etc. $200 later after an emergency eye doctor appointment that afternoon, I am now being treated with 5 different eye drops, washes, steroids and antibiotics to calm it down. Needless to say, the product is in the trash.</li>
            <li> Love this. Product stays on great even if I go swimming or go to the gym. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> The very best eyeliner ever. I love this because it lasts all day and washes off easily. It doesn&#x27;t fade throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It is good.I like it. the color is dark ,eyes look very cool and cute. that is all.that is all.</li>
            <li> I love love love did I say love? This eyeliner!!!!! This is beyond amazing really I&#x27;ve never had an eyeliner that I loved this much. I bought it with a gift card at Macy&#x27;s because I was unsure but I&#x27;m totally going to buy it again. Thank you Bobbi for rescuing my eyes!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s old or what. But it arrived pretty much all dried out and unusable. I put it in the microwave for 3 seconds in order to get it soft before i use it.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, reasonable price</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 years. I love it. Lasts most days for 8+ hours unless I&#x27;m very active and my lids get a little oily. I have super sensitive eyes, and this stuff hasn&#x27;t caused me any issues (that I know of!). Would highly recommend! Make sure you have a great lining brush, too!</li>
            <li> Some of the best eye liners I have ever used. I like how the ink feels very natural unlike some of the other brands i&#x27;ve used, which i felt the itchiness in my eyes after i&#x27;ve applied eye liners.</li>
            <li> Have purchased 3 other name brands and Bobbi Brown is by far, the most water resistent, stays on without smearing and was OUTSTADING for 8 hour wear.</li>
            <li> Love the product, it&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on all day. Only concern I have is, will it dry out before it&#x27;s all used.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#60;3 BOBBI BROWN. This is amazing.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! No more wiping off any smudges during the day!  I tend to tear from eye allergies and this is fantastic!! I DID NOT realize though that you need to buy a brush. SOMEHOW I FEEL it should come with one.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great, but it doesn&#x27;t give the pigment everyone said it would. I&#x27;ve even tried using different brushes because originally I thought that was the problem. I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I&#x27;m out because of how much I paid for it, but it was rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am a  huge fan of Bobbie Brown.  I typically get the Espresso colored gel eye liner, but the black was the one on sale :)  I love this liner.  It does not smudge or smear, and lasts all day long.  In fact, this could be seen as a negative (i don&#x27;t mind it), but it can actually be a bit of a pain in the butt to get off.  I use a good quality makeup remover and it comes off just fine.  If you go to sleep with this on, it will still be there in the morning.  BONUS - For moderate wearers, this pod, although appears small, will last you about a year!</li>
            <li> THIS IS 100% A FAKE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I regret dearly that I purchased it on Amazon. I hope the website take this product down. Or at least mark it as not from original brand.&lt;br /&gt;Worst experience on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner does not stay put at all, the pigment doesn&#x27;t even compare to the true product.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to sephora and have to buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> I have used Bobbi Brown products for over 20 years, and have loved every single product. I wanted to replace my used - up eyeliner - the exact same product. When I opened the package and tried to use it, it was dried out! I think that the product was either very old, or a faux product ( knock-off from China).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy cosmetics online again.</li>
            <li> ALL THIS HYPE OVER THIS AND ITS JUST THE SAME AS THE OTHERS ACTUALLY MAC IS BETTER</li>
            <li> Love this. Applies nicely and stays all day.</li>
            <li> I tried other liners,but keep coming back to gel eyeliner..You can cry and it stays on..Simply love love love it!!!! I</li>
            <li> DO NOT by this eyeliner as soon as I used it it went on just fine then it started to make a crease in my eyelids then it faded and smeared all over my lids by the end of the day.  One thing I don&#x27;t like is that this liner is quite expensive and NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye liner I have ever used! I recommend it to anyone who wants a liner that stays on all day long. Get it on right the first time tho cause once its on it is on until you are ready to take it off with makeup remover. That is the way I like it.</li>
            <li> This easy to use and liner glides perfectly. It lasts long. Both my daughter and I loved it . Great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time with this eyeliner. It works perfectly. Much easier to use than other eyeliners I&#x27;ve been using for, well, my whole adult life. If I make a mistake (yes, it happens), it&#x27;s very easy to correct it. There&#x27;s only one problem. Like other brands, it dries very quickly in the jar. Unlike other brands, it&#x27;s still easy to use, even when it dries out.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. I&#x27;ve been through over a dozen pencils, sticks, crayons, creams and now this gel liner (in top brands) and this one is perfect for me. The black is very richly pigmented. It goes on slick and wet looking and dries matte and lovely. With the right brush it goes on like a dream, though you do need a steady hand. This is the only liner that hasn&#x27;t smudged on me. I only wear liner on my top lids and yet with other liners it would migrate down to my lower lids and give me raccoon eyes, which stinks when you&#x27;re going for a clean and not smokey look! I&#x27;m going to have to try it in other colors now.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the special applicator brush, and I love it. It is easy to apply, really brings out my eyes, and stays in place all day!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day. It doesn&#x27;t smudge. And one pot lasts me about a year and a half. It&#x27;s a great value, but the only thing is that it&#x27;s only $22 in-stores at Bloomingdale&#x27;s! Wish it reflected the price on Amazon because I would subscribe to this purchase if it was.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised and excited when I found this product for sale for EIGHT DOLLARS! I love Bobbi Brown, but I am too broke to buy her make up anymore. I was so pumped when I bought this. I was a little worried that it would be some fake knock off, but I can honestly say that it was the real deal! It even came with a mini brush for the Bobbi Brown version of the brush used of the gel liner. The brush was poorly made (the metal part fell off) but I don&#x27;t care because the price was ridiculously low and great for the gel liner itself! I would 100% buy this gel liner again!!!!</li>
            <li> I had my make-up done for a wedding a few years ago and it was all bobbi brown products.  I wish I could afford all of their make-up!  I&#x27;m a huge fan of eyeliner its the one thing I hate going without and I absolutely love the gel eyeliner and it lasts forever! Anyways, this only my second time buying it! It lasted me for a couple of years and I wear eyeliner almost on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years! I love that it goes on smoothly, stays on all day without fading or smudging AND washes off easily . My one complaint is that after several months, the product dries and will flake during application. I tried a similar product from Maybeline  and although it is cheaper and does not dry out, it is difficult to remove at the end of the day. Despite the questionable longevity of the Bobbie brown product, it is STILL my first choice in eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I was trying to save a trip to the mall and order online instead. I have used this product for years and what I got in the mail is not the same thing I get from the mall. I will have to make a trip to the mall after all and get the real stuff. This is obviously a knock off. It runs and the real bobbi brown eyeliner DOES NOT RUN.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite products from her line.  Others seem to dry out way too quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried this product several years ago while visiting in Chicago. I was very impressed how easily it went on and stayed like new all day long. I decided to try it in another color many years later and am very happy I did. It runs rings around pencil eyeliner and lasts the entire day without the need to touch it up.</li>
            <li> not waterproof, all over eyes! I was very disappointed expecially for the price I paid for it!  Its a bummer!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find the perfect eye liner that is &amp;#34;long-wear&amp;#34; and this ain&#x27;t it.  I&#x27;ve tried several different brands.  The e.l.f. cream eyeliner is only a bit better than this one.  I rated that one as an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  This is my experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I liked this product in the beginning but it soon got dry and gritty - even though I closed the lid after every use.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> As a swim instructor, I was looking for a product in which I could come into the pool and come out with out looking like a racoon and scaring away the kids.No, this eyeliner is not waterproof, but it is certainly water resistant. Once the eyeliner has been applied and sits for a little while, you are good to go for the day!</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyeliner because it received some kind of beauty award not too long ago and it had so many good reviews here and on the website of a major beauty retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I received eyeliner from a bad batch? This eyeliner is not smudge-proof and it fades quickly contrary to the product claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try not to be overly negative, so I will say that it does look lovely when it is first applied, but shortly after it smudges and fades.  At the end of a normal 8-hr workday, I have \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s smudged and the line I applied in the morning is hardly visible.  It almost looks like I fell asleep at my desk!  It is a huge disappointment considering it is on the pricey side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest not wasting your money on this product.  I wanted really badly to like this eyeliner, but unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t hold up to its promises.</li>
