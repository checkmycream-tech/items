            <li>This is a great product, you get all you need for a great price, I don&#x27;t think you can get all these products for less than this price.</li>
            <li>I was about to give up on gel polish but decided to give Gelish a try since it seemed pretty universally loved.  </li>
            <li>kit is ideal for people starting out and it gives you all of the products you need except for your nail gel polish.</li>
            <li>kit is ideal for people starting out and it gives you all of the products you need except for your nail gel polish.</li>
            <li>Washable lint free cloth works better; just don&#x27;t use fabric softener when you wash</li>
            <li>/&gt;Removing them is easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use system.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I have to say its pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>it was just a faulty box full love gelish though</li>
            <li>Still a good value for a new home gel nails kit.</li>
            <li>everything is fine as if nothing happened to it</li>
            <li>While I have strong healthy nails I rarely got or did manicures because they&#x27;d be trashed in a matter of hours.</li>
            <li>This is a great beginner kit when you are just starting to use gel polishes.</li>
            <li>* Place hand into the USpicy UV light for 2 minutes for a light color and 3 minutes for darker colors</li>
            <li>* Place your hand into the USpicy UV light for 3 minutes.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>* Place your hand into the USpicy UV light for 3 minutes.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>these work great for when you are just starting and getting a feel for the product, have family nail nights now.</li>
            <li>Everything one needed to get a start using gel nail polish, except the light.</li>
            <li>Just by a gelish color and a UV light.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect starter kit...but it you love the gel manicure like I do, you will soon need the bigger bottles, especially of the remover!</li>
            <li>* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had to learn to paint really clean edges or</li>
            <li>I should have ordered more actual polish colors earlier, good quality, good delivery, worth the price.</li>
            <li>The NailUV led light works great through, and was still worth the $30 spent at Costco.  </li>
            <li>Now I order the full size products on Amazon (I wish I&#x27;d know that from the beginning) because I use the products exclusively.</li>
            <li>Not only was the system MUCH easier to work with, consistency wise, I have also had a much better result.  </li>
            <li>if &amp;#34;ph bond&amp;#34; is necessary for good results or not, but I have been using it.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have ordered the full size.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have ordered the full size bottles.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing best deal ever and it came very fast nothings wrong with the polishes</li>
            <li>Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes of polish as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but surprisingly enough we have not had to buy more pH Bond, Foundation or Top It Off in over a year of continuous use.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Would buy it again because it was worth it</li>
            <li>I kind of think I prefer the smaller bottles bc</li>
            <li>Have been using this to do my own nails since mid December.</li>
            <li>wife just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails</li>
            <li>so we had to do some research to find the right technique.</li>
            <li>, right??</li>
            <li>when I first learned to manicure, this was my first starter kit!</li>
            <li>The only thing missing here that would make this the greatest kit would be if it came with cleaning pads, but I guess you can&#x27;t have it all</li>
            <li>Its a good little starter kit</li>
            <li>was the first brand I bought</li>
            <li>but they look pretty solid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>posted a photo of the products lined up in the order in which you would use them and a photo of my wife&#x27;s first results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>posted a photo of the products lined up in the order in which you would use them and a photo of my wife&#x27;s first results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The photo shows my first at home gel manicure at day 14.</li>
            <li>You will definitely need an LED-compatible foundation and top coat--those are the two components of the kit that you can&#x27;t do without.</li>
            <li>But these were easily found on the net.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would last longer, but I don&#x27;t like to see too much new growth, so I have removed after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it lasted the whole vacation plus</li>
            <li>Eventhough these are the mini sizes it has really lasted me.</li>
            <li>this is really mini and the foundation brush is not attached</li>
            <li>the directions.&lt;br /&gt;Get a good curing lamp with at least 18 watts.&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
            <li>* Push back cuticle and clean fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>must be clean, dry, and absolutely oil free.&lt;br /&gt;THIN</li>
            <li>highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail</li>
            <li>I love that the gel nail polish lasts for such a long time.</li>
            <li>And if you only do your own nails this kit will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>Im new to the gel nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used gel polish before, but I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>process of doing gel nail polish was new to us</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>You can also mix them up with gel polishes from other brands and still work really good and last the same as if you were using only gelish products.</li>
            <li>My only piece of advice is to not lay the top coat bottle down (it ruined the brush).</li>
            <li>so they looked professional.</li>
            <li>I added natural nail primer after pH Bond to get longer wear.</li>
            <li>also purchased separately the lint free wipes--don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use much and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy, stays on for a couple weeks at least.</li>
            <li>great deal, just remember when using, only use very thin layers for everything!</li>
            <li>and now you can get the same professional results as going to the Nail Salon</li>
            <li>For a fraction of the cost you can get the same professional results, save money and tell your friends that you did it yourself.</li>

            <li>No chipping or peeling just bare space were my nails</li>
            <li>but when I check on it one of the item the ph bond is just a empty bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like returning the product but too much hassle for me.</li>
            <li>I love the gelish brand, remember to use thin coats and they will not peel.</li>
            <li>This first go was a hour and a half mani</li>
            <li>I hope the seller can read this and reconsider to send me a new one but not an empty bottle!</li>

            <li> these work great for when you are just starting and getting a feel for the product, have family nail nights now.</li>
            <li> Everything one needed to get a start using gel nail polish, except the light.</li>
            <li> Just by a gelish color and a UV light.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect starter kit...but it you love the gel manicure like I do, you will soon need the bigger bottles, especially of the remover!</li>
            <li> * Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had to learn to paint really clean edges or</li>
            <li> I should have ordered more actual polish colors earlier, good quality, good delivery, worth the price.</li>
            <li> The NailUV led light works great through, and was still worth the $30 spent at Costco.  </li>
            <li> Now I order the full size products on Amazon (I wish I&#x27;d know that from the beginning) because I use the products exclusively.</li>
            <li> Not only was the system MUCH easier to work with, consistency wise, I have also had a much better result.  </li>
            <li> if &amp;#34;ph bond&amp;#34; is necessary for good results or not, but I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have ordered the full size.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have ordered the full size bottles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing best deal ever and it came very fast nothings wrong with the polishes</li>
            <li> Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes of polish as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but surprisingly enough we have not had to buy more pH Bond, Foundation or Top It Off in over a year of continuous use.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Would buy it again because it was worth it</li>
            <li> I kind of think I prefer the smaller bottles bc</li>
            <li> Have been using this to do my own nails since mid December.</li>
            <li> wife just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails</li>
            <li> so we had to do some research to find the right technique.</li>
            <li> , right??</li>
            <li> when I first learned to manicure, this was my first starter kit!</li>
            <li> The only thing missing here that would make this the greatest kit would be if it came with cleaning pads, but I guess you can&#x27;t have it all</li>
            <li> Its a good little starter kit</li>
            <li> was the first brand I bought</li>
            <li> but they look pretty solid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> posted a photo of the products lined up in the order in which you would use them and a photo of my wife&#x27;s first results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> posted a photo of the products lined up in the order in which you would use them and a photo of my wife&#x27;s first results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The photo shows my first at home gel manicure at day 14.</li>
            <li> You will definitely need an LED-compatible foundation and top coat--those are the two components of the kit that you can&#x27;t do without.</li>
            <li> But these were easily found on the net.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would last longer, but I don&#x27;t like to see too much new growth, so I have removed after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it lasted the whole vacation plus</li>
            <li> Eventhough these are the mini sizes it has really lasted me.</li>
            <li> this is really mini and the foundation brush is not attached</li>
            <li> the directions.&lt;br /&gt;Get a good curing lamp with at least 18 watts.&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
            <li> * Push back cuticle and clean fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> must be clean, dry, and absolutely oil free.&lt;br /&gt;THIN</li>
            <li> highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently remove the natural nail</li>
            <li> I love that the gel nail polish lasts for such a long time.</li>
            <li> And if you only do your own nails this kit will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Im new to the gel nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used gel polish before, but I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> process of doing gel nail polish was new to us</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> You can also mix them up with gel polishes from other brands and still work really good and last the same as if you were using only gelish products.</li>
            <li> My only piece of advice is to not lay the top coat bottle down (it ruined the brush).</li>
            <li> so they looked professional.</li>
            <li> I added natural nail primer after pH Bond to get longer wear.</li>
            <li> also purchased separately the lint free wipes--don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use much and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy, stays on for a couple weeks at least.</li>
            <li> great deal, just remember when using, only use very thin layers for everything!</li>
            <li> and now you can get the same professional results as going to the Nail Salon</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the cost you can get the same professional results, save money and tell your friends that you did it yourself.</li>

            <li> No chipping or peeling just bare space were my nails</li>
            <li> but when I check on it one of the item the ph bond is just a empty bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like returning the product but too much hassle for me.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish brand, remember to use thin coats and they will not peel.</li>
            <li> This first go was a hour and a half mani</li>
            <li> I hope the seller can read this and reconsider to send me a new one but not an empty bottle!</li>
            <li> You can use vitamin E, or jojoba, or some other natural oil for the &amp;#34;nourish&amp;#34; cuticles part.</li>
            <li> The size will last a long time as personal use</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;ll last</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 other similar products from different suppliers and received 1 the next day and the other 1 is already here</li>
            <li> The size is mini, but it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried other gel products but always end up going back to gelish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very rough on my nails and a traditional manicure lasts about 2 days.  </li>
            <li> * Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts about a week on my hands (regular polish doesn&#x27;t even last a day on me)  and a few weeks on my toes.</li>
            <li> The first time it was a little difficult since the consistency of the gel nail polish is different than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> not only are they less expensive the smaller size makes it easier to not get too much product on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Because you are really putting three UV cured layers just remember to put them on thinly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Because you are really putting three UV cured layers just remember to put them on thinly and evenly.</li>
            <li> The only thing missing was the instructions.</li>
            <li> I dont think other people read what they are buying</li>
            <li> The other brands just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> they are minis, but this kit will last probably at least a year and a half.</li>
            <li> We found the Gelish products in the beauty supply houses and this same kit was $49.99 and on Amazon it was 47 % less expensive for the same kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this has saved me three times what I would have to spend at the salon (and I haven&#x27;t even get to use half of it yet) without compromising quality in the results.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was not sealed tightly and leaked.</li>
            <li> I bought the NailUV starter kit from Costco and was having lots of trouble with my polish lifting and peeling.  </li>
            <li> This kit was helpful, but, like all the LED stuff out there, a little pricey for the small sizes.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the kit when purchased in larger sizes, but the small bottles in the kit may be helpful to save for traveling</li>
            <li> Small size</li>
            <li> of the bottles in this kit are the small ones</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the shipping of this product.</li>
            <li> that isn&#x27;t too expensive to start doing gel nails at home.</li>
            <li> * Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 1 minute under UV light.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed for this!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was good as a starter for the Gelish Products.  I got the starter kit from Sally&#x27;s to try the Gelish products and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  Now I order the full size products on Amazon (I wish I&#x27;d know that from the beginning) because I use the products exclusively.</li>
            <li> I dont think other people read what they are buying it does say mini in the description. This was a good starter kit. Im new to the gel nails and I wanted to play around with brands and gelish was the first brand I bought and I have to say its pretty amazing.  Its a good little starter kit</li>
            <li> I have done 3 applications of this product on my nails and absolutely love the results.  I followed the online tutorial, and have had long-lasting manicures.  The polish stays on for 2 weeks, with no peeling. I&#x27;m sure it would last longer, but I don&#x27;t like to see too much new growth, so I have removed after 2 weeks. The best part is that it stays so shiny until I remove it!  I&#x27;m very rough on my nails and a traditional manicure lasts about 2 days.  So happy to have found this, and of course, Amazon always has the best prices.</li>
            <li> Great starter for diy gel nails. Small size but you get lots of uses for a fraction of what you&#x27;d spend at the salon. Goes on easy, stays on for a couple weeks at least.</li>
            <li> Great kit. Everything I needed best brand there is out there. Would buy it again because it was worth it</li>
            <li> This is a great beginner kit when you are just starting to use gel polishes. It has everything you need to get started.  This kit will last a while before you will need the kit with larger bottles.  This was a great price on Amazon as opposed to Sallys.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice now. The first time it was a little difficult since the consistency of the gel nail polish is different than regular nail polish. The polish started to peel about 10 days after since some of the polish landed on my cuticle which doesn&#x27;t give it a good seal. Second time, I knew what to expect. They came out beautiful. I just did them 3 days ago so I don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;ll last but they look pretty solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing them is easy. I broke the seal by using a 180 grit file soaked them for about 10 minutes. I needed to use an orange stick to peel it off but I can tell you it was a lot easier then the ones done in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this kit. Good place to start that isn&#x27;t too expensive to start doing gel nails at home.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the shipping of this product. I ordered it on Feb.17, and it didn&#x27;t leave the supplier until the 19th.I ordered 2 other similar products from different suppliers and received 1 the next day and the other 1 is already here and it was shipped by US mail from California to South Carolina.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the tracking information is sketchy. It does not even disclose where it is shipping from.&lt;br /&gt;When (if) it ever gets here, I surely hope it is all in 1 piece because I cringe to think about having to get it replaced or a refund.&lt;br /&gt;I even tried to go on their site and get information about the shipping and have had NO response from them.&lt;br /&gt;This is a gift for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and I ordered it in plenty of time (had they shipped it properly) to get it reshipped to her in another state.&lt;br /&gt;Now  it will never get to her in time.  Don&#x27;t think I will ever order from Beautychain again.&lt;br /&gt;will never get to her</li>
            <li> Everything you need in one package, great price.  I bought it for me daughter she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish nail starter kit. Im glad that I purchased it but the only thing I dont like is having to redo the nails every week</li>
            <li> when I first learned to manicure, this was my first starter kit! It lasted longer than I thought. It convinced me that I love the Gelish line of products. I have since graduated to the bigger bottles...</li>
            <li> I love the gelish brand, remember to use thin coats and they will not peel. The polish lasts for 10 or more days!</li>
            <li> I bought the NailUV starter kit from Costco and was having lots of trouble with my polish lifting and peeling.  I was about to give up on gel polish but decided to give Gelish a try since it seemed pretty universally loved.  Now I understand why.  Not only was the system MUCH easier to work with, consistency wise, I have also had a much better result.  The finished manicure looks loads better and 48 hours in, shows no sign of lifting, peeling, etc., which the NailUV stuff already had.  The NailUV led light works great through, and was still worth the $30 spent at Costco.  However, from now on, I&#x27;m a Gelish girl.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I do my nails every 2 1/2 weeks but you can go longer.  I just like the convenience of changing nail color when I want without worrying about putting a hole in my wallet.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive about trying it. I&#x27;d never used gel polish before, but I wanted to try something new. WOW! It&#x27;s amazing stuff! I love it! After a while, I tried some of the cheaper brands, but I came back to this soon after. The other brands just don&#x27;t compare. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo9VUI5A2KNL0R]]My wife just got a UV curing lamp and we needed to get the right products to do her nails so they looked professional. We found the Gelish products in the beauty supply houses and this same kit was $49.99 and on Amazon it was 47 % less expensive for the same kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also checked Amazon for Gelish UV nail polish and the prices were lower for the 0.5 ounce size for the same product that the beauty supply house was selling for $15 for the 0.3 ounce size. You can also find a broader selection of colors on Amazon. Make sure that you buy the 0.5 ounce sizes of polish as you are getting 66% more for about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the bottles in this kit are the small ones but surprisingly enough we have not had to buy more pH Bond, Foundation or Top It Off in over a year of continuous use.  You don&#x27;t use much and it lasts a long time.  We also use alcohol swabs and regular fingernail polish remover.  We spend a lot of money on fingernail polishes from Gelish and there are a lot of great colors available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process of doing gel nail polish was new to us so we had to do some research to find the right technique. We used a UV cure nail lamp and had great results. Here are the steps we followed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple instructions to use nail polish gels:&lt;br /&gt;* Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br /&gt;* Push back cuticle and clean fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;* Shape nails using a nail file.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with nail buffer.&lt;br /&gt;* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish pH Bond to nails.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 1 minute under UV light.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply your favorite color of Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish or your favorite brand of UV cured gel polish to the nail surface and to the nail edge.&lt;br /&gt;* Place hand into the USpicy UV light for 2 minutes for a light color and 3 minutes for darker colors&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Top It Off Sealer or Gel Topcoat to the nails and the nail tip edges.&lt;br /&gt;* Place your hand into the USpicy UV light for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Nourish to your cuticle and to the skin around your nail. (Condition your skin.)&lt;br /&gt;* Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a photo of the products lined up in the order in which you would use them and a photo of my wife&#x27;s first results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is ideal for people starting out and it gives you all of the products you need except for your nail gel polish. The quality of the products is very good and the results are spectacular. Because you are really putting three UV cured layers just remember to put them on thinly and evenly. If you enjoy doing your own nails and now you can get the same professional results as going to the Nail Salon you will love these products. For a fraction of the cost you can get the same professional results, save money and tell your friends that you did it yourself. My wife has already had several compliments on her nails in just a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves this kit and the Gelish products including the nail polish and she recommends them to you.es for darker colors&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Top It Off Sealer or Gel Topcoat to the nails and the nail tip edges.&lt;br /&gt;* Place your hand into the USpicy UV light for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;* Apply Gelish Nourish to your cuticle and to the skin around your nail.

            <li> I should have ordered more actual polish colors earlier, good quality, good delivery, worth the price. I would recommend to you to buy</li>
            <li> Just remember to buy the colored Gelish nail polish, separately.  Also, you should stick to using their nail polish remover for the best removal results.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect starter kit...but it you love the gel manicure like I do, you will soon need the bigger bottles, especially of the remover!</li>
            <li> The kit itself is okay, I was expecting larger bottles of product, not mini. One of the bottles was not sealed tightly and leaked.</li>
            <li> Easy to use system. I added natural nail primer after pH Bond to get longer wear. Great starter size to make sure you like the system before investing a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an employee with sallys and I save myself so much more money than buying it on Amazon then I would have bought it at work and it&#x27;s amazing best deal ever and it came very fast nothings wrong with the polishes everything is fine as if nothing happened to it everything&#x27;s fine a lot people said that they had a lot of issues with the polishes mine came perfect thank you God lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with Gelish. I work at big box home improvement store. I&#x27;m unpacking boxes, moving merchandise of all types, and using tools five days a week. While I have strong healthy nails I rarely got or did manicures because they&#x27;d be trashed in a matter of hours. Last month I went on a 2 week vacation and before I left I got a gel manicure at a salon and it lasted the whole vacation plus a week after I got back home. I don&#x27;t have the time or money to go to get salon manicures often so I deciced to try to do them at home. After some research I purchased the Gelish Mini kit and the Gelish 5 - 45 LED curing lamp. The photo shows my first at home gel manicure at day 14. No chipping or peeling just bare space were my nails are growing. I watched a lot of YouTube how to videos and took my time. This first go was a hour and a half mani but once I was done it was good to go. The nail color I used is Shake It Till You Samba.&lt;br /&gt;My tips are;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;Get a good curing lamp with at least 18 watts.&lt;br /&gt;Nail must be clean, dry, and absolutely oil free.&lt;br /&gt;THIN coats of foundation, color, and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;Really good lighting.&lt;br /&gt;No distractions.&lt;br /&gt;Take your time.</li>
            <li> I order this product couple days ago and I just recieved it yesterday but when I check on it one of the item the ph bond is just a empty bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like returning the product but too much hassle for me. I am really disappointed for this! I hope the seller can read this and reconsider to send me a new one but not an empty bottle!</li>
            <li> these work great for when you are just starting and getting a feel for the product, have family nail nights now.</li>
            <li> Love doing my gel manicures.  I kind of think I prefer the smaller bottles bc not only are they less expensive the smaller size makes it easier to not get too much product on the nails.  Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> this mini kit is perfect for the first timer- the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t have instructions, but just go on youtube and watch a tutorial. they are minis, but this kit will last probably at least a year and a half. great deal, just remember when using, only use very thin layers for everything! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I bought the mini sizes on the advice of another reviewer.  I wasn&#x27;t sure which products I would use more so I&#x27;m glad I started here.  I&#x27;ve done 12 manicures of myself and friends and have only refilled the acetone and alcohol.  The travel sizes are nice as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Recently began using LED polishes. This kit was helpful, but, like all the LED stuff out there, a little pricey for the small sizes. I now know what I need to purchase and won&#x27;t be using kits again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use alcohol for the &amp;#34;nail surface cleanse&amp;#34;, since that&#x27;s what it is and acetone remover for the &amp;#34;artificial nail remover&amp;#34;. You can use vitamin E, or jojoba, or some other natural oil for the &amp;#34;nourish&amp;#34; cuticles part. Much less expensive than the kit when purchased in larger sizes, but the small bottles in the kit may be helpful to save for traveling purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased separately the lint free wipes--don&#x27;t waste your money. Washable lint free cloth works better; just don&#x27;t use fabric softener when you wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if &amp;#34;ph bond&amp;#34; is necessary for good results or not, but I have been using it. You will definitely need an LED-compatible foundation and top coat--those are the two components of the kit that you can&#x27;t do without.</li>
            <li> This is a great item. Eventhough these are the mini sizes it has really lasted me. I have tried other gel products but always end up going back to gelish.</li>
            <li> this is really mini and the foundation brush is not attached so i had to go purchase the foundation seprately however im sure this is not the stors fault it was just a faulty box full love gelish though</li>
            <li> This is a great product, you get all you need for a great price, I don&#x27;t think you can get all these products for less than this price. I have tried them and they work excellent. And if you only do your own nails this kit will last you a long time. You can also mix them up with gel polishes from other brands and still work really good and last the same as if you were using only gelish products. The only thing missing here that would make this the greatest kit would be if it came with cleaning pads, but I guess you can&#x27;t have it all, right?? Just make sure you follow the instructions to the t. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Works great with gel nail polish. I followed directions I found online. I love that the gel nail polish lasts for such a long time. It lasts about a week on my hands (regular polish doesn&#x27;t even last a day on me)  and a few weeks on my toes.</li>
            <li> Love it.... Great price def save a lot of money by buying the starter kit.. The size will last a long time as personal use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great kit to start. I bought it just to try the gelish brand. I wish I would have ordered the full size. Still a good value for a new home gel nails kit.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this and uses it all the time. I don&#x27;t know much more about it - I&#x27;m a dude after all....</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I wish I would have ordered the full size bottles. My only piece of advice is to not lay the top coat bottle down (it ruined the brush). I went through the nail surface cleaner faster than the rest of the bottles -- so do yourself a favor and get two of those. Great kit. Great price, fast shipping! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Everything one needed to get a start using gel nail polish, except the light. The only thing missing was the instructions. But these were easily found on the net.</li>
            <li> Have been using this to do my own nails since mid December. I&#x27;m loving the results. This makes it simple to learn with.</li>
            <li> Great kit.  Had to learn to paint really clean edges or the gel peels off.  If you go to the Salon this kit will let you do them at home.  Just by a gelish color and a UV light.</li>
            <li> this has saved me three times what I would have to spend at the salon (and I haven&#x27;t even get to use half of it yet) without compromising quality in the results. Yes, it takes some practice but it didn&#x27;t take much for me (and I am really messy for this kinda stuff). I have used it with Gelish color nail polish and with sensatioNail color gel polish.. it works great either way..</li>
            <li> The kit has everything you need. The size is mini, but it lasts for a long time. It&#x27;s a great kit!!!</li>
