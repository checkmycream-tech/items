    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Again, I bought the talc powder, the spray and the perfume and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Tweed is a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>; so I took this chance and hope she will be happy.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I found it</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it in stores any more so getting it this way is perfect.  </li>
            <li>So she is delighted to be wearing it, and I must suffer in her presence each time she wears it.</li>
            <li>and I have always loved it.  </li>
            <li>I loved it then and still do now.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is from my mid-teens and I loved it then.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and she was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I would love to be able to continue using Tweed, and it has been my signature perfume, but I will not buy any more of the inferior product you sold me.  </li>
            <li>I love the Tweed Perfume  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t seen or smelled Tweed for so many years that I bought it just to reminisce.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years, and I love it</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume for over 50 years.  </li>
            <li>If available, the Parfume is much more preferable</li>
            <li>Service was fast and cost was fair.  </li>
            <li>Tweed had to be reformulated because many of the original ingredients in fragrances have been banned.</li>
            <li>I have the remaining amount of an ORIGINAL bottle of Tweed.</li>
            <li>I was so excited an ordered this, but it is NOT Tweed.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the original Tweed fragrance, but this didn&#x27;t even come close.  </li>
            <li>It is my understanding that in the UK you can still purchase the original formulation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, be aware when purchasing this fragrance that it isn&#x27;t the same wonderful scent we remember but something new, brought to you by the FDA.</li>
            <li>In the USA more than 100 ingredients used for traditional perfumery have been banned because they aren&#x27;t safe for children to ingest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the meantime, I &amp;#34;scent up&amp;#34; with it everyday and every once in awhile, bring my wrist to my nose, just to inhale its beautiful aroma.</li>
            <li>It still smells the way it did when I was a very young woman many years ago.</li>
            <li>Real Tweed stays light and lovey on me.  </li>
            <li>I had a bottle before and it was clear and smelled better.</li>
            <li>and I purchased it right away.  </li>
            <li>but my mom is my mother and so a little more expense is OK.</li>
            <li>Well, one and all, I am delighted to tell you that I am now old enough to wear Tweed.</li>
            <li>(This is the first time I have been dissatisfied with one of your products, so I was surprised.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was a teenager, I fell in love with English Tweed Perfume.</li>
            <li>much to my great disappointment, every bottle purchased is a cheap, Made In China knock off of the original Tweed.  </li>
            <li>This bottle under a new producer is still tried and true.  </li>
            <li>For as long as I can remember my mother had talked about this being her favorite perfume</li>
            <li>I first used this spray cologne when I was still in Jr. High School</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed in the scent of the product.</li>
            <li>My mother, however, being quite elderly now, no longer has much of a sense of smell.</li>
            <li>This is Tweed, by the original manufacturer - however, it is not the same classic scent.</li>
            <li>I first bought Tweed when I was 15 years old at a pharmacy nearby, and now I am 74 and wearing Tweed makes me feel that I am 15 again.  </li>
            <li>She had many other colgnes of the day on her dresser but this is the only one she wore.</li>
            <li>This fragrance, if you can call the modern version a fragrance, smells like bug spray, and has left a stain on my clothng.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised when I saw that I could still find it</li>
            <li>But my mother was horrified when she smelled it on me, saying that it was an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>Difficult to find it today, was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have other colognes that are much more expensive but Tweed was and still is a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a full-bodied aroma, yet strong enough to last all day.</li>
            <li>my friend loves it and it takes her back to high school days</li>
            <li>She was thrilled to finally have a bottle of her favorite perfume again, but in my opinion, this is one of the worst perfumes I have every smelled!</li>

            <li> I first bought Tweed when I was 15 years old at a pharmacy nearby, and now I am 74 and wearing Tweed makes me feel that I am 15 again.  I will keep ordering it when I run out.  Thank  you.</li>
            <li> I have worn Tweed perfume for over fifty years.  The product I received from you was NOT genuine Tweed.  It has a harsh undertone, and does not agree with my body chemistry.  It takes on an unpleasant odor as I wear it.  Real Tweed stays light and lovey on me.  I would love to be able to continue using Tweed, and it has been my signature perfume, but I will not buy any more of the inferior product you sold me.  Sorry to have to be so negative, but I think you should know the truth about the product you are offering.  (This is the first time I have been dissatisfied with one of your products, so I was surprised.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Bears</li>
            <li> I have the remaining amount of an ORIGINAL bottle of Tweed. I was so excited an ordered this, but it is NOT Tweed. It is not the same scent at all. Very disappointing, and wrong to sell something else as if it were the real deal.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember my mother had talked about this being her favorite perfume so I finally bought her a bottle through Amazon.com for her birthday.     She was thrilled to finally have a bottle of her favorite perfume again, but in my opinion, this is one of the worst perfumes I have every smelled! I was very dissappointed in the scent of the product. My mother, however, being quite elderly now, no longer has much of a sense of smell. So she is delighted to be wearing it, and I must suffer in her presence each time she wears it. It smells like typical OLD-LADY perfume.</li>
            <li> The title of the review says it all.  I&#x27;ve been searching for Tweed for some time, and much to my great disappointment, every bottle purchased is a cheap, Made In China knock off of the original Tweed.  This fragrance, if you can call the modern version a fragrance, smells like bug spray, and has left a stain on my clothng.  Buyer beware of Tweed, regardless of where it&#x27;s sold.</li>
            <li> This cologne is for my mom. I remember Tweed as a child. It&#x27;s not the exact bottle I&#x27;ve been searching for but after casually bringing up the subject, since this is a Christmas gift, she said &amp;#34;If it&#x27;s Tweed, they must all smell good&amp;#34; so I took this chance and hope she will be happy. I too like Tweed. Affording vintage scents is a luxury but my mom is my mother and so a little more expense is OK.</li>
            <li> I first used this spray cologne when I was still in Jr. High School and I have always loved it.  I was surprised when I saw that I could still find it and I purchased it right away.  It is not overly expensive and is as I remember it to be.  I have other colognes that are much more expensive but Tweed was and still is a favorite of mine.  I was so happy when I found it and I still feel the same about it.</li>
            <li> I did not like the fragrance.  I have been looking for the original Tweed fragrance, but this didn&#x27;t even come close.  I do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I love the Tweed Perfume  However, one can only get the Toilette Spray.  If available, the Parfume is much more preferable</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected, it stinks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to ad to my mothers perfume collection of yester-year, the scent takes me back in time because my mother didn&#x27;t wear anything but tweed. She had many other colgnes of the day on her dresser but this is the only one she wore. I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> My friend has been looking for this for years and thought it was no longer made.  I gave it to her for a surprise birthday present and she was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the real English tweed. I had a bottle before and it was clear and smelled better.</li>
            <li> This is Tweed, by the original manufacturer - however, it is not the same classic scent. Tweed had to be reformulated because many of the original ingredients in fragrances have been banned. You can blame this one on the FDA. It is my understanding that in the UK you can still purchase the original formulation. In the USA more than 100 ingredients used for traditional perfumery have been banned because they aren&#x27;t safe for children to ingest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, be aware when purchasing this fragrance that it isn&#x27;t the same wonderful scent we remember but something new, brought to you by the FDA.</li>
            <li> It still smells the way it did when I was a very young woman many years ago. I loved it then and still do now.</li>
            <li> Again, I bought the talc powder, the spray and the perfume and am very happy with it. I love it.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen or smelled Tweed for so many years that I bought it just to reminisce.  Service was fast and cost was fair.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This got to me in mint condition.  I&#x27;ve used it for years, and I love it but I don&#x27;t find it in stores any more so getting it this way is perfect.  I don&#x27;t even have to leave the house and go store to store to find it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is from my mid-teens and I loved it then.  This bottle under a new producer is still tried and true.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Tweed is a wonderful scent. Almost duplicate to the tweed of the 60&amp;#34;s. I would suggest this scent for anyone that likes a woodsy smell</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager, I fell in love with English Tweed Perfume. But my mother was horrified when she smelled it on me, saying that it was an old lady&#x27;s perfume. Well, one and all, I am delighted to tell you that I am now old enough to wear Tweed. Who says aging is all downhill?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a full-bodied aroma, yet strong enough to last all day. Its aroma reminds me of some other aroma but I can&#x27;t quite bring it to mind. If anyone out there knows what I&#x27;m talking about, I would appreciate hearing of what it reminds you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I &amp;#34;scent up&amp;#34; with it everyday and every once in awhile, bring my wrist to my nose, just to inhale its beautiful aroma.</li>
            <li> U sent me two of other tweed, what happened?  U did some thing to my friend.  I was quite disappointed</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume for over 50 years.  Difficult to find it today, was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> my friend loves it and it takes her back to high school days</li>
