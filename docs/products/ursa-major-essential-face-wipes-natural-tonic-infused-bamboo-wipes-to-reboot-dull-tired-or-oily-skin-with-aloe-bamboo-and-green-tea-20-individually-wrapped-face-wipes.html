            <li>Good to have when your travling</li>
            <li>Very refreshing on the face after a 7 hour flight, and the scent is not overbearing to a guy who does not like cologne.</li>

            <li>and I feel clean after using these.  </li>
            <li>Very nice to use after a long day of work or after the gym.  </li>
            <li>Not bad but not for me.  </li>
            <li>They have a very nice light scent, just enough moisture, and very soothing material.  </li>
            <li>and you can freshen up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Good single packs for having one stashed everywhere.</li>
            <li>I used it throughout my international journey and will be sure to keep packets for all my travels!</li>

            <li>Leaves skin fresh with no residue.</li>
            <li>The quality is worth it</li>

            <li>Am sure there are numerous products like this one</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great clean masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for getting the greasy scum from a long flight off your face.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have a large face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

            <li>The face wipes unfold rather large, so I can clean my entire face.  </li>
            <li>Knowing that at the end of a hard day&#x27;s hike I could sit down, break one of these out and feel immediately refreshed was a great feeling.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find them for a better price, but in the mean time I&#x27;ll continue to buy them off of amazon.</li>
            <li>Strong cloth with enough cleansing agent to wipe my face, neck and hands down well.  </li>
            <li>Works well for clearing the excessive oil from my skin, but it has an incredibly strong smell to it that lingers.</li>

            <li>I love these things — I carry a few in my everyday bag and always have them when I travel.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that, because I live outside the USA, with shipping and taxes and everything, they turn out to be even more expensive than what they already are, so</li>
            <li>I wipe during the flight... a wipe after the flight... left me very refreshed without any other side effects!</li>

            <li> I like these.  Very convenient.  I take these on trips where I&#x27;ll be out and about and sweating.  Just throw one of these in your pocket and a few in the car and you can freshen up quickly.  The smell is very pleasant and I feel clean after using these.  The face wipes unfold rather large, so I can clean my entire face.  I knocked off a star, because of the price.  I wish I could find them for a better price, but in the mean time I&#x27;ll continue to buy them off of amazon.</li>
            <li> These feel really great on my face after a long day. I like to cut them in half to save money.</li>
            <li> I like these because they are refreshing and convenient. But unlike another reviewer, I wish they were bigger, not smaller. It&#x27;s awkward trying to rub that little wipe all over my face. And I don&#x27;t have a large face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s been pointed out that the scent when others smell it on you is slightly that of old-people-smell...</li>
            <li> Very refreshing on the face after a 7 hour flight, and the scent is not overbearing to a guy who does not like cologne.</li>
            <li> feels good, gets ur face clean as a whistle and feeling groovy</li>
            <li> Excellent product for a quick facial cleanse. Leaves skin fresh with no residue.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a recommendation from GQ as a post-flight refresher for the face.  It works OK but the scent is a little odd.  Not bad but not for me.  I like the packaging but it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I love these things — I carry a few in my everyday bag and always have them when I travel. The scent is excellent, and not too strong. I love how large the towel is and how strong it is. And individually-wrapped is a MUST.</li>
            <li> When you are hot and sweaty this does the job for you</li>
            <li> Works well for clearing the excessive oil from my skin, but it has an incredibly strong smell to it that lingers. I think it is supposed to smell &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34;, but instead smells like bug spray. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Great product, ideal for traveling or everyday use! I used it throughout my international journey and will be sure to keep packets for all my travels! I wipe during the flight... a wipe after the flight... left me very refreshed without any other side effects! Am sure there are numerous products like this one but this is definitely my go to!</li>
            <li> They do feel fresh, I really liked the smell and my face does feel clean after using them. Only downside is that, because I live outside the USA, with shipping and taxes and everything, they turn out to be even more expensive than what they already are, so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be ordering another pack.</li>
            <li> Bought these and have been using them for a while now. I usually just throw one in my gym bag and use it after a quick workout. These are also great if you have oily skin and want to just refresh when away from your house for awhile. They have a nice scent to them and leave my face feeling so fresh and so clean... clean. The box says you can use these for not just your face, but I haven&#x27;t had the need or want to wipe my balls with them yet. But I&#x27;m sure you could, just make sure to wipe down your face first.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the after work refresh. I use these after a day at the office and it makes my skin feel so much better. They smell nice and it seems to wipe out all the build up from the day. Neat little box and single wrapped wipes.</li>
            <li> Very nice to use after a long day of work or after the gym.  The smell is good and you feel clean after using.  I wish the size was cut in half so there were more wipes.</li>
            <li> I bought these specifically for a two week backpacking trip in Patagonia.  They are out-expletive-standing.  I use other Ursa Major products for shaving and have been impressed but these were a different level.  Knowing that at the end of a hard day&#x27;s hike I could sit down, break one of these out and feel immediately refreshed was a great feeling.  They have a very nice light scent, just enough moisture, and very soothing material.  Will buy these again for ANY trip I go on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product, except that tissues are excessively large. Smell is great, quality is great, but i guess a smaller, pocket friendly tissue would be better.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Smells great, feels even better.</li>
            <li> Kinda pricey but really good Face/body wipes. The quality is worth it</li>
            <li> Great product, glad I bought it. Excellent for getting the greasy scum from a long flight off your face.</li>
            <li> Only con is now I&#x27;m addicted to using 2 per day (usually after lunch to freshen up for the afternoon and another before bed) but the cost is a bit high for my liking.  Also not available for prime costs me an extra couple dollars in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Great clean masculine scent.  Strong cloth with enough cleansing agent to wipe my face, neck and hands down well.  Good single packs for having one stashed everywhere.</li>
            <li> I travel with these, and enjoying using them to freshen up. The scent is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warmly recommended to all.</li>
            <li> So refreshing!  So expensive.  But after a flight or before a meeting, nothing else quite does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for beauty products but i&#x27;m glad i picked these up.  They smell great and leave your face feeling nice and clean.  Good to have when your travling</li>
            <li> I read a brief snippet in a magazine that recommended these, and I decided to give them a try.  I have never used anything like this before, and I must say I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations.  The first thing that you will notice is an extremely fresh, enjoyable smell - - not sure how to describe it ...it is simply a very fresh and clean scent.  They are so soothing and refreshing.  I got some for my wife, who is training for another triathlon.  She uses them to refresh her face at the halfway point of her very long bike rides - - she is now a convert as well.  This is a great thing to have if you are going to be out and about and just want a quick refreshing face cleanse ...maybe you are doing something outdoors in the heat and don&#x27;t have a chance to get home and change or shower before heading elsewhere ...these will come in handy.</li>
