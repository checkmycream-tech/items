            <li>hello kittys are great and bows to all of them where in good shape and none where chipped or missing parts love them</li>
            <li>Perfect for kids to play with, but for decorating shirts or some other craft.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>it made it easy for me</li>
            <li>the decals were too big to even fit on to the nail.. not too happy</li>
            <li>Fun and cute</li>
            <li>just so you know they are not rounded to fit your nails.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit 100% of the way</li>
            <li>We get crafty.</li>
            <li>She will be very glad to use them on the new cell phone she is getting for christmas.  </li>
            <li>very worth the price</li>
            <li>Received the product within 4 days, the bows and hello kitty are adorable and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>omg I love these nail arts so much.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It came quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li>As a new nail artist I really enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>These are cute, but the pink on hello kitty is very light</li>
            <li>shipping longer then expected but loved the hello kitty and bows.</li>
            <li>Thanks for these, and my customers love these, I&#x27;m a manicurist and my clients love these, I need to order more and will early next week.  </li>
            <li>So much fun with my daughter.</li>
            <li>MAY BE GOOD FOR OTHER PROJECTS</li>
            <li>the shop owner very helpful and responded quickly to each contact..</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>exactly as  advertised</li>
            <li>They are exactly what  the photo shows and</li>
            <li>Very pretty and love the pink color.  </li>
            <li>I also got them super early.</li>
            <li>There cute but not what I expected the color is very off from the pic</li>
            <li>On the picture the pink is a lot brighter, but it still looks cute.</li>
            <li>I love the kitties and the pink bows</li>
            <li>I was really going to get.</li>
            <li>Be careful because they are easily to come off if you glue them.</li>
            <li>The Hello Kitty faces are cute but it is missing a detail in the face.</li>
            <li>Flat back for easy application on nail</li>
            <li>pretty big size and bouldky</li>
            <li>The material and qualities are so poor and cheap looking!&lt;br /&gt;Better with more different size than one!</li>
            <li>Although they might be a little big to be used for nail art, but overall I am very satisfied and would order again.</li>
            <li>The items met my expectations completely</li>
            <li>I was really expecting them to be a lot smaller</li>
            <li>I have large nails and long</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, takes up to much room on the nails.</li>
            <li>It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case.</li>
            <li>These are far too big to place on nails and they have flat backs.  </li>

            <li> They fit my nails, but if you have small nail beds, it may not fit on your nails.</li>
            <li> THE PINK HELLO KITTY AND BOWS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS</li>
            <li> pic hello Kitty nose is yellow mine are black and ﻿the kitty is wearing pink in there pic mine</li>
            <li> but i feel a little big for the nails</li>
            <li> The Hello Kitty is not as pink as the pics.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter and her mom are tickled pink with the product.  </li>
            <li> is just a plain white cat.</li>
            <li> the details of these small pieces was above what I expected.</li>
            <li> usually hello kitty has a yellow nose.</li>
            <li> Oh these are the cutest little things and they actually look like little kitty</li>
            <li> I can use these on other projects too, not just for nails.</li>
            <li> I mean, it looks pretty its just not really functional for long wear unless you apply on fake nails or have wider nails.</li>
            <li> , TOO SMALL.</li>
            <li> so if you have small hands don&#x27;t buy for nails.  </li>
            <li> Only 1 was not up to par, but it was a bow and not a hello kitty, so not to sad about it.</li>
            <li> Definitley for long fake nails.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t hardly see her face.</li>
            <li> satisfied..not bad but not great..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use theses on my nails.  I&#x27;m also going to use them for making cards and scrap booking.</li>
            <li> Good for nail art, but more Hello Kitties would have been nice. Lots of cute bow. Will order again in the future!</li>
            <li> I was really expecting them to be a lot smaller then the picture but to my surprise they are as big as they look. As a new nail artist I really enjoyed them.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and I love hello kitty everything.  You will like these. I would buy these again.  So cute</li>
            <li> I haven;t tried this yet but they look adorable.</li>
            <li> Good arrival time and pretty pieces just wish it came in a wheel or something better than a bag... but cute..</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
            <li> ordered this a while ago to put on my nails. many of the hello kitties have messed up faces. usually hello kitty has a yellow nose. these do not. just so you know they are not rounded to fit your nails. but they are still very cute. came with a bunch of hello kittys and bows.</li>
            <li> These are the cutest Hello Kitty 3D nail art! I love the kitties and the pink bows are the perfect combo! Very fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> The pieces are the perfect size and are very good quality. Flat back for easy application on nail I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
            <li> fair price cute for nails and decorating</li>
            <li> These are far too big to place on nails and they have flat backs.  I bought to use on nails and when they arrived there was no way I was going to use on my nails.  I have large nails and long so if you have small hands don&#x27;t buy for nails.  Would be great on cell phones or scrap booking.</li>
            <li> Oh these are the cutest little things and they actually look like little kitty i love the fact that yes it takes a while to come it still doesnt feel like forever to get here! very worth the price</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. I can use these on other projects too, not just for nails. Such as a cell phone cover.</li>
            <li> Thanks for these, and my customers love these, I&#x27;m a manicurist and my clients love these, I need to order more and will early next week.  Thanks for the great service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carma, Orlando, FL</li>
            <li> the decals were too big to even fit on to the nail.. not too happy</li>
            <li> Out of 40 pcs. Only 1 was not up to par, but it was a bow and not a hello kitty, so not to sad about it.</li>
            <li> The Hello Kitty is not as pink as the pics. But for the price it was ok...</li>
            <li> ﻿the Kitty is not like it is in there pic hello Kitty nose is yellow mine are black and ﻿the kitty is wearing pink in there pic mine is just a plain white cat. Otherwise ﻿the price was good and it came before ﻿the estimated arrival so I gave it five stars just for that but if you want hello kitty that looks like hello kitty these might not be for you good service though just would&#x27;ve been happier with a better description of them item I was really going to get.</li>
            <li> I love hello kitty but I did not like how these turned out. They don&#x27;t look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li> Its okay, I guess. Its too big for us people with smaller hands and nails. It won&#x27;t fit 100% of the way so it gets caught up by the corners and comes off. I mean, it looks pretty its just not really functional for long wear unless you apply on fake nails or have wider nails. It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case. I might repurchase this products for clients, but definitely not for me. Besides, I though it would be 20/20. 20 Hello Kitty pieces and 20 bows, but nope.</li>
            <li> very cute items, great price. the bows are perfect size and the kittys are really nice. i would recommend this item</li>
            <li> Received the product within 4 days, the bows and hello kitty are adorable and exactly as described. Although they might be a little big to be used for nail art, but overall I am very satisfied and would order again.</li>
            <li> They arrived before the date I was told to expect them. They are exactly what  the photo shows and my granddaughter can not wait to use them when she does nails again.</li>
            <li> my niece loved the hello kitty and can&#x27;t wait to get them on</li>
            <li> They r so cute. Omg so in love lol!  But they are perfect and the e&#x27;er right amount. So there&#x27;s no worries 💅💅💅💅💅</li>
            <li> So much fun with my daughter. We get crafty.</li>
            <li> It came quickly in the mail. It looks just like the picture! Hello kitty and the bows are so cute! I will definitely be ordering again from them!!!</li>
            <li> hello kittys are great and bows to all of them where in good shape and none where chipped or missing parts love them i will buy more</li>
            <li> Very pretty and love the pink color.  The Hello Kitty faces are cute but it is missing a detail in the face.</li>
            <li> My clients  loved them</li>
            <li> Granddaughter and her mom are tickled pink with the product.  It arrived quickly and at a reasonable price.  Business doesn&#x27;t get amy better than that!</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with size, quality, colors over all awesome product</li>
            <li> The material and qualities are so poor and cheap looking!&lt;br /&gt;Better with more different size than one! Too big to put on nails</li>
            <li> satisfied..not bad but not great.. i wish it would contour to the nail bed more so it easier to glued to the nail</li>
            <li> Totally cute! They fit my nails, but if you have small nail beds, it may not fit on your nails.</li>
            <li> I love my Hello Kitty :)</li>
