            <li>This is my first time with this cleanser</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend this for your skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I want to first say that I am 49 years old, normal/dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in how few many blemishes I have since using it.</li>
            <li>But I had no issues with the Sublime Beauty Fresh Citrus facial scrub.  </li>
            <li>This product is, by far, way superior to other brand-name products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I need to use facial scrubs once in a while to clean out my pores and to get rid of dry skin cells on my face.</li>

            <li> i&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so we&#x27;ll see if it makes a difference in the long-term, but so far i&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very gentle, and whatever the &#x27;beads&#x27; are, they&#x27;re very small, so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re scraping the skin off your face.  </li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t take away lines and wrinkles completely, but my wrinkles under my eyes are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I used facial scrub before but it leaves my skin dry and scaly after using it.</li>
            <li> Also because I use a zit cream that dries my skin out, this scrub takes away all the dry skin away.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with facial scrubs is that sometimes the scrub is too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have now used the following products by Sublime Beauty for a little over a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found some scrubs are too rough and make my skin feel sore.  </li>
            <li> Not too drying, not too rough.</li>
            <li> I wash am &amp; pm, then apply other products....</li>
            <li> I use it along with other sublime beauty products.</li>
            <li> and then I went down to once a day.</li>
            <li> It has a slight citrus smell but is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> never let&#x27;s me down!</li>
            <li> Not too harsh for my face.  </li>
            <li> There are small beads that help to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has changed from dull to glowing BC</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out or had any side effects from using this scrub.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with any of these products.</li>

            <li> This scrub is really cool. I use it personally for a gentle exfoliation. I use it once a week as I have hyper sensitive skin. Even with my extra sensitive skin, it does not burn or break me out. I also occasionally use it twice a week when my face is exceptionally oily. During these times it helps to draw out the excess oils. It leaves my face looking bright and refreshed. It also leaves my skin baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SAMPLE PROVIDED*</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I use this scrub.  I have found some scrubs are too rough and make my skin feel sore.  This scrub smells great, and leaves my skin feeling silky yet exfoliated.  My new favorite scrub!</li>
            <li> I received the orange scrub as a sample and fell in love with the feel of it (and the fragrance)! It feels good on my face and even though it does exfoliate, it does so more pleasantly than other harsh scrubs. I felt clean and fresh after using. Ready now to get a full supply!</li>
            <li> I want to first say that I am 49 years old, normal/dry and sensitive skin.  I have now used the following products by Sublime Beauty for a little over a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collagen Serum&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic serum&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Scrub&lt;br /&gt;Face Whisperer® Neck &amp; Decollete&lt;br /&gt;Nourishing cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Retinol Serum&lt;br /&gt; Face Whisperer® Day Cream with Argireline&lt;br /&gt; Face Whisperer® Night Cream with Matrixyl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that the results have been nothing short of wonderful.  My skin is smoother and laugh lines less defined.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t take away lines and wrinkles completely, but my wrinkles under my eyes are less noticeable.  Another biggie for me is that my neck looks younger.  I have tried many lines and this is the first one that I have been pleased with every product.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliate! I wash my face with it before applying primer allowing for smooth application of foundation. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Awesome scrub! My face is smoother and clearer looking! Great for cleaning out my pores!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this facial scrub. I like the fresh scent and light sandy feeling. It leaves my skin deeply clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really helps my skin to stay fresh and look younger. That&#x27;s why I bought this item again with few more sublime products :)</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff!! I use it in the shower a couple of times a week, and my skin feels so much smoother afterwards. It is a pretty small&lt;br /&gt;bottle, but I don&#x27;t have to use very much. It would be nice if they made a larger sized bottle of this.</li>
            <li> i have fairly sensitive skin, so i was worried this might burn or redden my face, but i&#x27;m really pleased with the product.  it&#x27;s very gentle, and whatever the &#x27;beads&#x27; are, they&#x27;re very small, so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re scraping the skin off your face.  didn&#x27;t leave me red or dried out at all, but for sure my skin felt smoother and brighter after using.  i&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so we&#x27;ll see if it makes a difference in the long-term, but so far i&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
            <li> A good scrub.  Not too drying, not too rough.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Sublime Beauty product. Very gentle yet effective cleanser with mini microbeads. Love the citrus aroma too.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth product I purchased from Sublime Beauty. I&#x27;ve had great results so far with all of them (face whisperer advanced eye gel, neck and decollete cream, the ageless rapid tightener and the fresh citrus scrub. The citrus scrub is excellent, it cleans the pores and removes dead skin without being harsh; I feel my skin softer at each use, no redness. I also love the fact that not only this product but all the ones that I have tried from Sublime Beauty have a very subtle smell that tend to dissipate through out the day. I would definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so fresh and clean after using this scrub!</li>
            <li> Ewwww  smells so good &amp; after use my skin is cool &amp; softer, cleaner, doesn&#x27;t feel stiff. My only want is to package in a larger bottle....I may be overusing. I wash am &amp; pm, then apply other products....I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Sublime Beauty Fresh Citrus Scrub leaves your skin feeling refreshed. It has a slight citrus smell but is not strong at all. There are small beads that help to exfoliate your skin. It removes all the dirt and oils from your skin and leaves it squeaky clean. My skin feels really clean after using this scrub. The cucumber leaves a cooling sensation on your skin. It&#x27;s not harsh on my skin and does not cause any breakouts. I have oily combination skin and I feel that this scrub opens up my pores and removes excess oils leaving my skin feeling fresh. I use this scrub about every five days. The scrub comes in a 2 oz bottle. I received my bottle in a white organza pouch. I love that this is cruelty-free, paraben-free and made in the USA. I would highly recommend this scrub. My skin feels super clean. I received this product to test in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This has an awesome feel on my skin with a slight scent. Can feel very tiny particles that provide for a clean scrub. Leave your face feeling very fresh and clean. I like to use Sublimes Oxygen Cream afterwards to feed my skin! Great product, will keep on using!</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin. I need to use facial scrubs once in a while to clean out my pores and to get rid of dry skin cells on my face. The only problem I have with facial scrubs is that sometimes the scrub is too harsh on my skin. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with Sublime Beauty citrus scrub. The scrub is gentle on my skin, but definitely gets the work done. Since using this product, my skin feels a lot smoother and my pores appear tighter. I haven&#x27;t broken out or had any side effects from using this scrub. I love the citrus scent it has. It smells very fresh and clean. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. In my opinion, this is a great scrub to use if you&#x27;re looking for softer skin!</li>
            <li> Sublime Beauty is a GREAT product.</li>
            <li> This scrub is really great for cleaning up my pores. I have been using it for awhile now. I put about a dime size on my sponge and it&#x27;s like microdermabrasion cleanser. It has fine grains that help buff out the impurities on your face. When, I first got it I used it twice a day for the first two weeks and then I went down to once a day. I have noticed a difference in how few many blemishes I have since using it. Also because I use a zit cream that dries my skin out, this scrub takes away all the dry skin away. This has a very mild scent, which is good; when I seen the words &amp;#34;fresh citrus&amp;#34; I thought it would have a more defining citrus scent, I was glad it didn&#x27;t. I would recommend this product, it does what it says it does and leaves your skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love Sublime Beauty products, they never cease to amaze me.  This scrub smells incredible, and the results are as well.  I use this several times a week, and my skin feels wonderful.  I am not usually fond of scrubs, as I have facial scars that are very sensitive.  But I had no issues with the Sublime Beauty Fresh Citrus facial scrub.  I would highly recommend this for your skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub!  It smells citrusy and makes my skin feel and look very smooth and clean.  I will buy this one again!</li>
            <li> Subline beauty fresh citrus scrub leaves your face so soft and smooth.  I  put a dime size on my clairsonic you can feel the gentle beads cleaning your pores . I use it twice a week to make sure my skin is ready to reap the benefits of my face creams. Thanks  Subline for another great product.</li>
            <li> Love this! Goes on so nice and my face feels so clean and refreshed. Just wish the bottle was bigger. Great product .</li>
            <li> I love the Sublime beauty products and have tried many of them. The Collagen serum is fabulous. This is my first time with this cleanser and it is excellent. The fresh smell is invigorating and the little exfoliation is an added bonus.You cannot go wrong with any of these products.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this scrub.  Not too harsh for my face.  I use it along with other sublime beauty products.</li>
            <li> Sublime Beauty.....never let&#x27;s me down! Once again, I am totally blown away with how great a product this Fresh Citrus Scrub is! When it comes to exfoliating my skin and leaving it naturally beautiful, nothing beats this scrub. This product is, by far, way superior to other brand-name products I have tried in the past. I have very sensitive, sort of acne-prone skin &amp; this Fresh Citrus Scrub doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. It also does a great job balancing my skin &amp; giving it a smooth, soft texture. My skin has changed from dull to glowing BC I use this scrub in the morning, followed by Sublime Beauty&#x27;s ageless serum with Renovage &amp; Matrixyl &amp; finishing my morning routine with Face Whisperer day cream. My night time beauty ritual is to first, wash with fresh citrus scrub, followed by ageless serum again, hyaluronic serum or collagen mask, finished off with Face Whisperer night cream. All products are Sublime Beauty bc in my personal opinion they have the best face products! I received a discount on this scrub for my honest evaluation &amp; it is now my new favorite face scrub!</li>
            <li> The best cleanser scrub I&#x27;ve tried. I like this scrub so much. It cleans my skin thoroughly without striping skin’s moisture. I used facial scrub before but it leaves my skin dry and scaly after using it. This Sublime Citrus Scrub is very different. My skin looks refreshed after cleansing. What a nice treat for the skin once or twice a day. Safe for sensitive as well.  I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product to try and I am sharing my honest opinion.</li>
