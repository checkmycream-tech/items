            <li> This parfum is amazing specialy in cool weathers, but It is the only place where I cound found it, thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this perfume all the time 20 years ago and than the stores around me stopped selling. Thanks to Amazon I found it again. It seems my bodysmell has changed because it doesnt smell as good as it used to on me or maybe my smell has just changed. However, happy to have bought it.</li>
            <li> I did not know this item existed until a friend told me Amazon stocks it. I love Montana ever since it came out in 1986 and will forever purchase it from you. Unlike others it is a timeless perfume for me. What I love about it more is the fact that it is the authentic original and not counterfeit. If you keep giving me the real thing I promise to be forever AMAZON customer</li>

            <li> My wife loves this perfume.  Has been using it now for twenty years.  the most unique and beautiful of any she has ever worn.  Hard to find and it&#x27;s exclusivity is also part of the allure.</li>
