            <li>What is even more impressive is the low cost of this product.</li>

            <li>I have been worrying about stains on my tooth for many years together.</li>
            <li>Though I was not fully satisfied with his recommendation, I wanted to give a try.</li>
            <li>used to get more invitations for parties which I often reject.</li>
            <li>Nothing short of excellent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>They worked great and really took the stains off my teeth.</li>

            <li>I honestly love this product and whether you buy it or</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Ive tried all different types of whiting kits, but the Brilliant HD Kit is by FAR the best.</li>
            <li>Ok so here&#x27;s the thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve drank coffee and tea for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li>I also noticed so many compliments after a while of using it because the results appeared</li>
            <li>I find myself smiling a lot more now.</li>
            <li>My confidence is building more and more each day.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the tray system.</li>
            <li>(ok maybe 3 or 4) cups of coffee.  </li>
            <li>so obviously my teeth weren&#x27;t in the best shape.</li>
            <li>feel so much more confident now.</li>
            <li>I could not be more</li>
            <li>a lot more affordable than going to the dentist to get your teeth whitened, which on my budget I cannot afford.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I like the strips much better.</li>
            <li>It is done in this manner to make sure there is no sensitivity or pain to the treatment.</li>
            <li>, it helps to make sure the treatment stays longer.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I thought it worked way better than the stuff I tried from Walmart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Taste is better than some.</li>
            <li>appropriate time on box.&lt;br /&gt;Remineralization gel comes with kit, but it&#x27;s not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied the whitening gel with the syringe to most of my front teeth and then put on the tray to keep the gel in place.</li>
            <li>I love coffee and coco, so</li>
            <li>My teeth got about 3 shades whiter, which is actually better than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But its OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li>Better than crest strips for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy to be introduced to this product Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but also a good product worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I’m glad because it’s personalized.</li>
            <li>since I have been using it has brighten my teeth more whiter.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to lift any stains at all.</li>
            <li>After two treatments I was able to lift about 5 shades.</li>
            <li>They look so much better than what they did before.</li>
            <li>This is the best at home whitening system I have used...results are better than the white strips I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love the way Brilliant HD is effective and simple to use.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to have a good smile to go with my caffeinated, bubbly demeanor.</li>
            <li>and it just makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely in love with them</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of coffee and each time I use the trays my teeth look whiter and better.</li>
            <li>but this one is way better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it worked</li>
            <li>Otherwise fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I finally found something that makes my teeth look brilliant despite the abuse I put my teeth color through!</li>
            <li>I’ve always wanted whiter teeth like some of my favorite celebrities.</li>
            <li>One for your top teeth and one for your bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m in Love...</li>
            <li>There is so much to love about this whitening gel set, including the speed of whitening.</li>
            <li>I thought a tray system (as opposed to strips) would be a good idea because it would really coat my teeth and be effective.  </li>
            <li>So then today I went on the website for more information.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t love having to do two rounds, one whitening and one the protective gel.</li>
            <li>I put the trays on for 15 minutes and it had better results than a gel I had to leave on for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>the best thing about this for me was that it actually molds to your teeth.</li>
            <li>This product really works great.</li>
            <li>Be sure to filter by verified purchase.</li>
            <li>There nothing like having a bright smile that fills a room.</li>
            <li>This product feels much better on the sensitivity</li>
            <li>I will continue using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li>if you want confidence try this product…I can&#x27;t get over how much better</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that will wipe these stains off until this product.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best fit</li>
            <li>it happened, my roommate began professional whitening about two weeks before I started to use Brilliant HD.</li>
            <li>I have tried many solutions to yellowing teeth and had problems with almost all the products I used.</li>
            <li>Its nice to see a prodoct work as advertised and with Amazon rating product lets others share how good somthing really is and a lot of people rated as I have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Heat-molded trays fit perfectly to your mouth, making this no-hassle at home teeth whitening experience, no mess</li>
            <li>My teeth have progressively been getting whiter and I am feeling so much more confident about my smile!!</li>
            <li>SO FAR SO GOOD!</li>
            <li>But I have recently heard about the Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening kit from my friend who recommended me strongly to go for it.</li>
            <li>Unlike that other bogus kit, this one is perfect in its consistency and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two reasons, I would never again buy this product and I would strongly encourage others to look elsewhere for better and more legitimate products.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I would like to say good about this kit, is the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased about how easy it is to apply, and how quickly I began to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>The accessories included made this simple and neat to use as well as effective!!</li>
            <li>I have the brightest smile from this whitening kit!!</li>
            <li>I work in healthcare and didnt realize how important have a really bright smile</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic, I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips and had ok results, but this was much better.</li>
            <li>The results were great for me but eventually I kind of also dialed it back because the returns were diminishing.</li>
            <li>It is great the trays mold to the shape of your teeth, but I found them to be very bulky and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable to do the treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After several attempts purchasing whitening kits off the pharmacy shelf, I decided to give whitening one more try with the Brilliant HD kit.</li>
            <li>I have a professional mouthguard, and Brilliant HD&#x27;s trays fit like a glove just as my dentist-molded mouthguard does.</li>
            <li>Since I tried Brilliant HD results are better than the white strips I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never usually one to go by what others say, but I have to admit that I was really happy I did.</li>
            <li>The trays fit very comfortably and do not bother my gums.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s easy, and best of all, it actually works!</li>
            <li>sure this is a fine product.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit due to all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still amaZing and worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I did not see the same effect with Brilliant HD.  </li>
            <li>I am really happy with the progress and cannot wait to be completely finished.</li>
            <li>I saw a commercial for Brilliant HD that said it removed stains below the surface and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>NU2 Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit definitely made my smile brighter than before.  </li>
            <li>I find this system to be incredible, it made my teeth shine so white</li>
            <li>With 15 minutes here and there, (and while doing homework) I was able to get the beautiful shiny white teeth I&#x27;ve always admired on others...</li>
            <li>better, the trays were comfortable to use, and this was a benefit that I was not expecting.</li>
            <li>I dont trust the really cheap kits because im sure that they must be made in china.</li>
            <li>This is an incredible product i have only been using it for a month</li>
            <li>Brilliant HD will be my go-to whitener and is definitely a product I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Never before have I had this kind of success with a teeth whitening product.</li>
            <li>Have a photoshoot in a couple of weeks and really looking forward to having my teeth look as good as can be.</li>

            <li>It is such an easy, painless process and my teeth look incredible.</li>
            <li>If you want to have shiny white teeth every day, I would strongly recommend purchasing Brilliant HD.</li>
            <li>the gel actually has a nice pleasant taste to it.</li>
            <li>I love my smile again!</li>
            <li>The gel also tastes much better than others, fresh and minty!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different teeth whiting products and none of that have been able to mold to my teeth as well as this one, which is amazing because it&#x27;s not blotchy!</li>

            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Although I was happy with the results, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the cost, as I had to pay out of pocket due to lack of medical insurance!</li>
            <li>I just picked a day where I could clean and watch TV</li>
            <li>It cleans better, it is more premium than others I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>Everything comes packed for you, so its a no brainer way to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>The trays mold to my teeth perfectly, which make wearing them so easy and the whole process takes less than 15 minutes a day.</li>
            <li>with NO success, before purchasing Brilliant HD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it&#x27;s so fast.</li>
            <li>The product is very strong… it is extremely quick to whiten and lasts long… Must try!!</li>
            <li>People are treating me better because I&#x27;m able to smile now and have a better overall attitude.</li>
            <li>And I would recommend it to anyone out there who wants to whiten their teeth to get a better smile!</li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t have to take special appointments to visit the dentist when you can conveniently do it from the comfort of your home.</li>
            <li>but It was nothing special.</li>
            <li>I use other whitening kits as well, The kit I use depends on what is available when I need to whiten, but I always look for Brilliant HD first.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend brilliant HD for those who drink coffee,tea,and who want white teeth.</li>
            <li>While the wide range of great reviews seem to speak for themselves, I would like to add my two cents on this product.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews on Amazon, as most products come as described and are pretty self-explanatory.</li>
            <li>After using this method three times, I noticed a huge difference, and the price is worth it.</li>
            <li>love that this product is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After applying Brilliant HD, my teeth were noticeably whiter in a few days.</li>
            <li>But as I am a full time student, I don&#x27;t have the money to get it done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I tried a couple different products, and I have not had any good luck.</li>
            <li>Usually I don&#x27;t fall for the &amp;#34;teeth whitening kits&amp;#34; because in the past I have found they dont work, but I am so thrilled that I gave Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit a chance!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I paid full boat.</li>
            <li>&gt; Also loved that I needed no lights or things, it was simple to do with the syringes of whitening gel.&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li>good friend actually tried this HD whitening gel and bought a kit for me to try at home.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled as I was highly irritated to use the strips before stepping out every time and ordered it right away…</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and not messy at all!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and no expensive doctor visits.</li>
            <li>He uses it since the dentist recommended some other toothpaste to use and along with this it works great.</li>
            <li>Many of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; were written within days, many coming in on the same day!</li>
            <li>The results were great, I could really tell a difference, especially on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>Not these ones, they fit nicely and they actually work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After  going through the process, I quickly noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li>The solution seems fairly mild on your teeth, too.</li>
            <li>While my teeth weren&#x27;t &amp;#34;stained&amp;#34;, they weren&#x27;t white - just kind of like a really light beigey ivory.  </li>
            <li>I am really glad i found this item, i have been trying for years to get my teeth more white.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly years of neglect washed away from my teeth.</li>
            <li>I could not recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li>First off, the application was painless and the mold tray for your teeth seemed to fit quite well.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my results after only a couple of applications.  </li>
            <li>I saw results after the very first use, which doesn&#x27;t always happen.</li>
            <li>A few weeks later my smile is brighter and more awesome.</li>
            <li>My teeth got much much whiter very quickly as I was using this.</li>
            <li>kit is fast and easy and affordable.</li>
            <li>whole process is really easy, just follow the instructions on the pack.</li>
            <li>The product works really fast and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>In addition, it is more affordable than some products that really didn’t do much for me!</li>
            <li>This has a good taste and therefore I look forward to using it every single time I do, which is about two or three times a week.</li>
            <li>The treatments are very easy to do then more other whitening systems.</li>
            <li>8 more 5 star \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; from people who have not bought the product, and who have reviewed many of the exact same products (giving 5 star reviews for all...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m only a couple more treatments from having pearly whites!</li>
            <li>But it was so easy to use, totally hassle free, and affordable!  </li>
            <li>I have this as well as the one with improved tray(the trays fit better for my not-so-perfect teeth than any other brand!) and love them.</li>
            <li>After the first week I noticed the deep yellow stains being lifted, my teeth were already looking more attractive.  </li>
            <li>At the end of my first two weeks of using it, when she was a month into using hers, my teeth were clearly whiter than hers, yet she had spent a great deal more for her whitening system.</li>
            <li>But this gel taste GREAT, doesn&#x27;t burn my super sensitive gums, and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on my sparkling smile.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to purchase another kit, but the great reviews prompted me to take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off, lets just start by saying it is fairly cheap the price for this item is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The trays fit really well, no discomfort whatsoever.    </li>
            <li>It is amazing that my teeth are this white.  </li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy as much as I did.</li>
            <li>We are all sooooo very ripped off all the time on EVERYTHING in this world from companies being as cheap as they possibility can.</li>
            <li>My teeth look a lot better and I am surprised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every time I go out of the house people keep on making comments about how my smile literally sparkles.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m probably going to end up getting another one and trying again to get an even whiter smile.</li>
            <li>Now I can smile and not worry about the stains caused by drinking coffee and tea.</li>
            <li>It only takes about 15-20 minutes to do one treatment, and you can do it on your own schedule.  </li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li>When I contacted my doctor for treatment, he gave me a very big course that will take 2 months for the treatment to be effective.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to an even brighter smile than what I have now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a relief not to hide my smile anymore</li>
            <li>But it is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I was looking at several different products and came across the Brilliant HD kit.  </li>
            <li>When I smile for pictures I&#x27;m not embarrassed anymore.  </li>
            <li>honestly thought this product would be the same</li>
            <li>Needed a brighter smile</li>
            <li>At work people are giving me compliments on my smile now</li>
            <li>I can now smile with confidence</li>
            <li>YEARS WORTH OF STAINS</li>
            <li>It is very much worth</li>
            <li>of all the ones on the market, these are simple to use and quite effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its time to experience the Hollywood smile without paying thousands of dollars on in office dental treatments.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for something to brighten my smile, but could never find an affordable product.  </li>
            <li>TOTALLY worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted a whiter smile since I have surface stains from coffee, tea, etc.</li>
            <li>and I am surprised to be able to report my teeth</li>
            <li>I say that this product is worth your time.</li>
            <li>Confidence was low, so I decided to try brilliant HD teeth whitening kit, and within months my smile was as white as snow.</li>
            <li>Brilliant HD is an inexpensive dental grade whitening solution that is very easy to use, minus the mess.</li>
            <li>Great product to use, especially since there are so many other products out there that can be so misleading.</li>
            <li>This amazing kit really does whiten your teeth and it does it for so much cheaper than a professional clean</li>
            <li>This system totally transformed his smile!!!</li>
            <li>It worked for me, I was able to get my teeth about two shades whiter than I have been able to do with any other product.</li>
            <li>With Brilliant HD deluxe, I only had to whiten my teeth every six months, the results are really long lasting!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use (no messy gels, just trays to put in your mouth) and super fast!</li>
            <li>The first 4 times I used this, it was fine, and I saw some reasonable results.  </li>
            <li>I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>she was right...</li>
            <li>This competes right there with them.</li>
            <li>I tried it right away.</li>
            <li>This competes right there with them.</li>
            <li>How can we trust it if they can&#x27;t even spell treatment right?</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t spit right now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to give up my white teeth to reach my goal of becoming debt free.</li>
            <li>To get real results and have a bright white smile I had to try so many different gels</li>
            <li>Fast forward of being on a fixed income, I knew I could&#x27;nt afford more whitening treatments, so I began researching for different methods on my own.</li>
            <li>With very simple instructions I was able to quickly prepare the trays for use.  </li>
            <li>I’m about to get married and was looking for something to make my smile look extravagant.</li>
            <li>I would definitely say that this product works better than more professional grade whitening kits.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I feel like this product has more professional results than the other whiter I used to use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anybody looking to have a brighter smile!</li>
            <li>It worked really well and quickly without any pain or sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li>Its saves me time because its so simple to use and easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>Preparing the setup was quite easy and the instructions laid out how to do so in clear</li>
            <li>This was a huge waste of money and there is probably no chance that I&#x27;ll get any kind of refund.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products to get that hollywood smile, and I finally have it because of this product.</li>
            <li>The instructions were clear and easy to understand, and I had no issues using the kit.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth too and there was no burning, or discoloration on my gums which is always a huge worry.</li>
            <li>Well for my smile :).... After the first use my teeth were pearly white.</li>
            <li>They all seem to be reviewing many of the exact same products...which (surprise, surprise)</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am a pretty happy camper!</li>
            <li>I came across this product on Amazon and it was pretty affordable compared to some whitening kits.</li>
            <li>This kid worked well for me the first time</li>
            <li>noticed a change in my smiles shade after the first use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I noticed a change in the first week of using this.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it after I was satisfied with my white teeth and</li>
            <li>My top teeth were already pretty white, but the bottom ones were quite stained.</li>
            <li>People are really complimenting my smile.</li>
            <li>This kit absolutely got the job done just as I needed it!</li>
            <li>Thanks NuNutrients!</li>
            <li>but it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>You heat the trays up in hot water and then bite them to make an impression.</li>
            <li>But you must leave it on for 5 minutes the first time.</li>
            <li>This is the only over the counter teeth whitening kit that has not caused me any teeth sensitivity and you get a lot more product</li>
            <li>My teeth have a naturally yellow tint, and my lovely wife can&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li>I use it multiple times a week and my teeth are a lot better looking than before.</li>
            <li>I just wish that it worked on the first go.</li>
            <li>First use</li>
            <li>:) I already had relatively white teeth</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>It works fast!</li>
            <li>so my teeth were pretty stained.  </li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>I drink hot tea in the winter and iced tea in the summer</li>
            <li>Iced, Hot , latte</li>
            <li>At first I was terrified to try this because my roommate had tried the whitening strips and they burnt his gums.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product to whiten my teeth with relentlessly, tried so many different things</li>
            <li>and I find it’s not difficult to use this product and</li>
            <li>And to top it all, it&#x27;s WAY cheaper than Crest white strips.</li>
            <li>You can thank me later :)</li>
            <li>So much better than White Strips.</li>
            <li>It only takes 15 mins to see results and does so much more than whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The first night I did this</li>
            <li>Big mistake:)</li>
            <li>I used the blue stuff tonight though and it is so much better.</li>
            <li>I had to first apply it to a cotton swab and then into the tray.</li>
            <li>As with all whitening products just be sure to keep off your gums as much as possible to avoid gum tenderness.</li>
            <li>This was a first time experience for me.</li>
            <li>Do this by soaking them in some hot water then putting them into the mount and sucking the air out.</li>
            <li>Not difficult but do not have the fittings so hot that they burn the mouth.</li>
            <li>what everyone wants to know!</li>
            <li>The color of her teeth has changed significantly!&lt;br /&gt;I would defintely recommend this product for anyone who has a problem with their teeth and not being able to get them white!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Larger Syringe vs many smaller ones&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>Since it was my first time trying any whitening kit</li>
            <li>but I love my personal results.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll be the first to admit..</li>
            <li>Its always my first choice.</li>
            <li>You just have to become used to working with the trays and then making sure they stick properly to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I accidently messed up mouth peices when I put them in the hot water...</li>
            <li>the water was too hot when I did it</li>
            <li>The results were fast too!</li>
            <li>My teeth were much whiter in just two weeks!</li>
            <li>any day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>You do have to run some hot water over it at first and mold it to your teeth, but after that it makes whitening your teeth a breeze.</li>
            <li>Noticeable results on first treatment</li>
            <li>So naturally, I want to whiten my teeth for a rather cheap price.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written for anything</li>
            <li>I love shopping online to experiment with different teeth whitening kits.</li>
            <li>After first treatment I felt my teeth were cleaner and brighter.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;d used a teeth whitening kit before .  </li>
            <li>First you heat water to boiling in the microwave</li>
            <li>After the first treatment my teeth felt cleaner and looked whiter.  </li>
            <li>I started feeling the difference immediately after first use.</li>
            <li>I smoke a lot, and since using this product I have gotten rid of most of my stains, and have not seen them come back since.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience using a home whitening kit.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this! :)</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it said it would on the box.</li>
            <li>It is IMPERATIVE that you DON&#x27;T leave the trays in the cup of hot water longer than instructed--not one second more.</li>
            <li>and i haven&#x27;t used it again, and my gums are still more sensitive than normal.  </li>
            <li>And, like I say, sure enough I did have to leave it in longer for results.</li>
            <li>I admit I am an avid coffee drinker.</li>
            <li>I saw some results after the first  time.</li>
            <li>Thanks whoever makes this!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products.</li>
            <li>I’ve seen good results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also addicted to coffee, I have been since I was 17, and Brilliant HD deluxe not only erases the coffee stains, but repels new stains for the 6 month duration it lasts.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a noticeably whiter smile!</li>
            <li>Within days you will see that your teeth are whiten and you will be looking like a full brand new person.</li>
            <li>Maybe it didn’t have that much to do with how white my teeth were, but I felt more confident because of how white my teeth are now.</li>
            <li>Works like very pure, doesn&#x27;t cost that much.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous toothpastes, mouthwashes, and mouth guards all claiming to assist in the tooth whitening process, however, none have been as effective as the Brilliant HD Deluxe Whitening Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using the kit, my teeth had become a stained yellow color that was impossible to hide.</li>
            <li>Nice, I have other products then</li>
            <li>Start enjoying your new smile sooner than later, I have.</li>
            <li>many on the same day, of course) Fraud before your very eyes.</li>
            <li>Good kit, I only wish my hubby could have used it too with a 2nd set of mouth trays.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve tried a few home whitening products, and Brilliant HD &amp;#34;Deluxe Teeth Whitening&amp;#34; is the one I&#x27;ve decided to keep using regularly.</li>
            <li>I, too, was pulled in by the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have tried several whitening products but this seems to be the best because my teeth are not sensitive afterwards and I can use it right on my partial bridge.  </li>
            <li>furthermore, the mold used to make a retainer is very poor quality and did not form a good mold, no matter how many times I tried.</li>
            <li>The instructions are pretty straight forward.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a change on the first treatment.</li>
            <li>The trays are sturdy - unlike some other brands, they fit securely in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I could see a very noticeable difference in the first treatment.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt, I didn&#x27;t get burnt and my teeth look super and super white and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because many reviews said this product does not create any sensitivity, and it got such a high score with over 80 reviewers.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and am actually going to order another one for the future.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and am actually going to order another one for the future.</li>
            <li>Seemed easy enough</li>
            <li>Very decent product and does what it says.</li>
            <li>the chemical is definitely way too strong.</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong and if you get it on your gums it will burn and it even turned part of my gums white for while.</li>
            <li>So I am certain this will work well for smokers as well.</li>
            <li>I saw results quickly, there was no pain and no mess.</li>
            <li>with 1 treatment i saw significant whitening, and my teeth were pretty white to begin with.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended and I&#x27;m going to continue to use</li>
            <li>are back to the same brilliant sparkling white that they were when I was getting them whitened professionally!</li>
            <li>Not to sound like a total ad here, but this product is certainly quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the product truly works, and I saw an improvement of at least two shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This worked for me very well.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to pay a whole lot of money to a specialist</li>
            <li>There has been so much improvement</li>
            <li>even the teeth with stained fillings seemed much brighter.</li>
            <li>and I thank her so much.</li>
            <li>I tried the product and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I am really thankful to sellers and Amazon for listing out this product.</li>
            <li>I find this method is useful if your teeth are sensitive to this sort of thing</li>
            <li>whole time I had the trays in my mouth, I had saliva dribbling out</li>
            <li>Would defiantly recommend to anyone who wants visibly whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After one use, I really could tell my teeth were a shade lighter.  </li>
            <li>Funny how so many people love this product and all on the same few days!</li>
            <li>And it really was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very statisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>(so I&#x27;m on camera for the whole world to see).</li>
            <li>Going over the costs of having them whitened, I realized I would be paying too much.</li>
            <li>Really read these reviews and evaluate their credibility before buying.    </li>
            <li>I was not as attentive to reviews as I should have been when purchasing this product and used it several times.</li>
            <li>I ordered it, it came on time fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is reasonable to assume, it is so you can apply it in the mouth trays.</li>
            <li>The teeth molding part didn&#x27;t really have instructions and it wasn&#x27;t the easiest, but I got the mouth trays made.</li>
            <li>The price is real convenient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li>This product of s one of the real finds.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much time in the day</li>
            <li>After doing this I like to brush my teeth with just water and rinse my mouth real well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>The set was straight forward and had a minty taste.</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper than going to the dentist for a whitening treatment and convenient as well.</li>
            <li>The gel really hurt my gums</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice much of a whitening effect</li>
            <li>It is 100 percent thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Really whitens and does what it says.</li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone who wants to get teeth whitening at home to try this out.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Product does absolutely nothing, does not work.</li>
            <li>but it made my teeth so much whiter that you almost couldn&#x27;t even tell they</li>
            <li>Many products hurt my gums, I am sensitive to it, and simply don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Cleans and whitens, your teeth feel like new and shiny after using it the first time, you can really feel the diference.</li>
            <li>Everything was easy to use and it didn&#x27;t take long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deceiving with all the good reviews, but as other comments have noted, it seems those reviews are fabricated.</li>
            <li>But I decided to try a third time, and to read other reviews beforehand to see if there were any good suggestions.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this kit to anyone who wants a whiter smile!</li>
            <li>This product is so much better than the other at-home teeth whitening kits.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone - especially if your smile is your job!</li>
            <li>so I was excited for my next treatment.</li>
            <li>I look like a celeb now with my white smile!</li>
            <li>I love this product and will pick these over the other ones in the market</li>
            <li>I am satisfied as I have tried other products and nothing was working.</li>
            <li>I got my pearly white smile!  ,</li>
            <li>Tray system beats all other systems and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have fairly white teeth, but after trying the kit out for a few weeks, I can definitely see a change in whiteness in my teeth making me feel more confident to smile.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with how fast it really works!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on giving up my love for coffee anytime soon, seeing as I am a frequent night owl and need to stay up for long hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trays fit my mouth pretty comfortably, and with such a short wait period it gives me time to fit other things into my busy schedule.</li>
            <li>Ive been a smoker for a few years now, and its helped my smile go from dull to bright!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for  a good white cleaning system for a little while</li>
            <li>So as a result, my teeth have become embarrassingly  more stained than I like with WAY TOO MUCH black tea.</li>
            <li>Most of my stains have diminished and are a lot less noticeably.</li>
            <li>No, seriously.</li>
            <li>But I was out looking for a product that was decent on the wallet</li>
            <li>After purchasing and receiving the product within days, quickly I followed the kits instructions, placed the trays in my mouth daily and began noticing a rapid change!</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what I expected it to do in an adequate amount of time.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest you go ahead and try this product as you have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>Highly dissattisfied, will not order again or even recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend HD Brilliance to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recoemd this stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m doing it wrong, but the mouthpiece is too big  even with a couple of tries of molding to a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>This is also great for people who don&#x27;t have insurance (like me) because you can get the same grade products that the dentist would use for a very small cost.  </li>
            <li>With other brands I use, I get great results but they don&#x27;t last that long, the max was 3 months.</li>
            <li>So not only do they not know how to spell \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;, but they can&#x27;t even misspell it consistently!</li>
            <li>The trays are easy to use, and the whitening gel stays put and does not leak into the rest of your mouth, which other products tend to do.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish the applicator was skinnier and longer so that it would fit the gel into the cavity of the tray better.</li>
            <li>Folks, witness honest to goodness (dishonest) crooks.    </li>
            <li>I still have a few shades to go for sure.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to anyone looking to whiten their smile.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you from experience that most whitening processes are harsh on my mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be giving this another try in a few months, for sure.</li>
            <li>I gave it a shot after I saw how white my sister&#x27;s smile was.</li>
            <li>This made it where I was able to close my mouth completely without drool going down my face from the tabs sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just thought I owed them a little review for making me so happy and also for not being a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I try every new product that hits the shelf.</li>
            <li>As a student who also works, I tend to live off of coffee to help me stay alert during my day.</li>
            <li>The molds are easy to use and treatments of 15 minutes or less give progressive results.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me notice a visible difference from very early in usage.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It is as good as other brands and types of teeth whitening treatments, but I noticed that it is a little bit cheaper</li>
            <li>A dentist I had years ago tried to sell me an incredibly expensive whitening service, saying, &amp;#34;You know, you are a very attractive woman, but those yellow teeth really age you.&amp;#34; I dumped that dentist a long time ago!</li>
            <li>Another great thing is previously when I’ve used other whitening kits they’ve left a foaming sensation in my mouth that seems rather unnatural.</li>
            <li>My teeth were several shades whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li>but overall I found it pretty convenient.</li>
            <li>way better than any strips i have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I have done many teeth whitening kits in the past, none of them worked!&lt;br /&gt;I was truly amazed at this when I got the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I guess my teeth ARE sensitive!</li>
            <li>It says to start out at a 5 minute treatment for the first and add 5 minutes to the next 2 consecutive treatments.</li>
            <li>After I finished the first syringe, I started using the second one as I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>I cant stress it enough this whitening kit really works!</li>
            <li>so my teeth are already pretty white, but my husband...</li>
            <li>My teeth were already pretty white and it did still enhance them a bit.</li>
            <li>Results were noticeable after the first treatment, and two weeks later, after finishing up the treatments, my teeth were way cleaner</li>
            <li>This made my teeth white so fast!</li>
            <li>I doubt its legitimacy and am not sure that it&#x27;s safe.  </li>
            <li>First, the trays are just too big.  </li>
            <li>I actually took some sharp scissors and cut away some of the excess plastic, and it worked better.  </li>
            <li>The mold gives me a more secure feeling than other white stripes and it doesn&#x27;t leave much mess.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for anybody who wants whiter teeth instantly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if other tray systems are better, but this one was uncomfortable and potentially hazardous.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty white natural teeth according to my dentist, but I’ve always wanted whiter.</li>
            <li>I admit I was a tad bit apprehensive at first trying any at home kits, because I figured the only way to go is to go and have it professionally done.</li>
            <li>This kit far exceeds anything you would be at the store, in fact, it&#x27;s provides exactly the same results as the teeth</li>
            <li>Someone else pointed out than many of the reviews are fake, and I believe that to be true.  </li>
            <li>I could tell the difference in my smile after just a single use.</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear and simple and it only took me several days to notice a significant difference!</li>
            <li>I have always relied on the typical whitening strips to give my yellow teeth a bit of neatness.. and I always made sure to use it just before any meeting or party so that  the glow is visible..</li>
            <li>And mostly due to my own errors, this product did not work for me and was money down the drain.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my sister gave me some of NuNutrients&#x27; other products for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>But then I tried the Brilliant HD Kit and was shocked at the difference.</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t get a professional cleaning as often as I need either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gel is professional grade dont get it on your tongue</li>
            <li>My family also really likes it and they can see instant results.</li>
            <li>my teeth stayed white for over a year, but I was brushing after every meal and didn&#x27;t drink much Soda anymore.  </li>
            <li>but it made me self conscious.</li>
            <li>Like some of the issues before I got them this has also made me self conscious, so I decided to have me teeth whitened.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>were surprised when I said, I did not.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>, I was totally amazed at how much brighter my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>I used this product for about 3 times now, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with gum sensitivity so far.</li>
            <li>Had to discontinue use because it was making my teeth to sensitive.</li>
            <li>Instead of putting the gel in trays I rolled a q tip into the gel and applied it directly to my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and the gel</li>
            <li>my teeth are extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth try dipping the q tip in the gel that comes with this product.</li>
            <li>It is also made in the USA which I completely support.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Mine aren&#x27;t that sensitive but they are with this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be warned the gel may cause problems for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I would stick with crest white strips much easier and cleaner without gum irritation</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would prefer a brush to apply it directly to teeth, vs putting it in trays.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The box was not sealed very well and the numerous amount of misspellings on the box in my opinion is quite unprofessional.</li>
            <li>After my shower and skin care routine I boiled some water and placed the mouth trays in so that they can become soft</li>
            <li>however this one is the only one that really makes a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li>It would have saved my wallets some bucks for a professional .</li>
            <li>Teeth feel sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have had my teeth whitened before professionally.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine suggested to try this kit as he claimed that it gives professional results and the glow doesn’t get lost at all</li>
            <li>WOW there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li>I left them in there the whole 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Then you put the clear gel in the retainer or directly on the teeth indentions.</li>
            <li>Professional cleanings, and whitenings cost lots of money.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a Facebook logo that also doesn&#x27;t lead anywhere, so I tried looking for the company directly through my Facebook page, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to exist there</li>
            <li>but yellowing is just a natural thing with age.</li>
            <li>: None that I can see so far.</li>
            <li>So I was surprised by that 15 minute max.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>The cost is also way cheaper than what you would have to pay to have a professional do it so that alone caused me to give it a try</li>
            <li>and it looks professional.</li>
            <li>drink coffee regularly so only 3 treatments got me to a Hollywood White smile</li>
            <li>I became a master at that closed mouth smile,</li>
            <li>Have only been able to use a few times.</li>
            <li>There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars on a whitening kit when the solution is available for far less from NuNutrients!</li>
            <li>The other products I tried, I had problems with the trays fitting in my mouth without cutting me, but the trays supplied in here fit just right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dark complected so the original not whiteness of my teeth was really apparent.</li>
            <li>I have abnormally small teeth, so if I were to use the big trays that came with it my teeth would be even more sensitive.</li>
            <li>Buying this product you will get a few shades whiter teeth, giving you that movie star smile you always dreamed of !</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m done, and after a few days i already started seeing a whiter smile!</li>
            <li>well worth the money especially considering that most other whitening systems cost around the same and do half the job.</li>
            <li>The trays molded to my teeth, so that part worked fine, but they were bulky in my mouth and caused me to drool excessively.  </li>
            <li>If you want white teeth I&#x27;d recommend to use this product first to help whiten it, remember to brush after every meal, use mouthwash, and try to cut back on Soda.  </li>
            <li>I already had pretty white teeth, but, needed some perfecting to get them pearly white!</li>
            <li>I dialed back to once a week from twice a week and since I had already done a handful of treatments, my teeth were already getting pretty white.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because most products you get offline that claim to whitening your teeth</li>
            <li>Not going to lie, I was skeptical because of the price as most whitening kits tend to be higher up there</li>
            <li>Like the other 1-star reviewers, I wish I had read the other reviews more closely before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>but it comes back pretty much daily even when not using the product.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that my gums were burning, but I have a decent tolerence for pain, and decided to stick it out for ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on my teeth since trying out this whitening kit, two in the last week to be exact, and</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, especially now that the holidays are around the corner!</li>
            <li>I cracked open the kit for this one, it appeared to be well-designed and made from high quality materials.</li>
            <li>as for the whitening, this one caused significantly more pain to the gums and mouth, and far less whitening effect, than other whitening kits, even just strips from CVS.</li>
            <li>I normally used Colgate but that wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth as white as they was .so</li>
            <li>You just have to e careful around the gums because they can be irritated a little but other than that good product.</li>
            <li>While teeth whitening has primarily, in our household, been my husband&#x27;s thing, I&#x27;ve noticed that my normally very white teeth were getting a little yellower</li>
            <li>After nearly ruining my teeth with those old crest white strips...</li>
            <li>I come back after 2 weeks of using these and most of those reviews are gone and now a ton of negative reviews popped up.</li>
            <li>The results definitely exceeded my expectations, as I drink soda on a daily basis, which has really caused some discoloration over the years.</li>
            <li>Why spend so much money going to the DOC when you can get this kit to white shine your stained yellow teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so difficult to find something for a good price that ACTUALLY works....!</li>
            <li>I eat a lot of chocolates and hot cocao coffee due to this reason my tooth are brownish colour after using brillant hd  </li>
            <li>Caused major sensitivity to my teeth</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any stinging/bleeding which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other &amp;#34;one star&amp;#34; users noted, the packaging appears to have been tampered with, the syringes are not sealed in separate packages, and there are numerous misspellings on the package (no instructions other than what&#x27;s on the box.)</li>
            <li>I got this as I was looking for a way to whiten my teeth a little more then they were as I am a smoker and we all know that smoke will discolor your teeth among other things.</li>
            <li>I started to see slight results right away</li>
            <li>After using half of the kit I can actually see a very noticeable difference and can&#x27;t wait to see how much whiter my teeth get when this is all gone.</li>
            <li>I flashed her a smile and it looked like she was having a bad day, but she smiled back.</li>
            <li>The gel was not gel - it was clear liquid that could not possibly stay in anyone&#x27;s mouth to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>clear detail was not only reserved for the instruction manual.</li>
            <li>Clear detail is what I could see starting to appear on my teeth within 20 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact:  it only takes 10 minutes to do session because I really don&#x27;t like to leave whiteners on for a long time.</li>
            <li>The ingredients don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth at all, either, which is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li>Was much harsher than expected.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive dial it back.</li>
            <li>The next treatment can be for 10 minutes if you aren&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li>I tried the whitening strips they sell at my local drug store, but they hurt and made my teeth so sensitive.</li>
            <li>It completely removes all stains from my teeth, and makes them so white I can almost not believe it!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a whitening product for the teeth especially if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s always a plus, especially for the fact that it comes with two trays, when normally I can only find them with one.</li>
            <li>Spending a few dollars versus hundreds on teeth whitening at the dentist is worth it.</li>
            <li>I was slightly sensitive to the first few treatments but it went away.</li>
            <li>Removes decades worth of stains from your teeth in a few easy-to-do treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Provides dental-grade,</li>
            <li>I don’t know why the major companies are ignoring this style, because it’s much easier for me to apply this than other types of products.</li>
            <li>I have been paying for professional tooth whitening at my dentist&#x27;s office for years, but a few months ago I decided to try to be more frugal and cut down on unnecessary costs in an effort to become debt free.</li>
            <li>and I think that the cost is very competitive with other teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li>The treatments are only 15 minutes which are a definite plus for a busy mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first I was a little intimidated by the molds and syringes.</li>
            <li>Well, after about two weeks I noticed my teeth weren&#x27;t as dull off white looking color, they actually started looking like they should, instead of that obvious light yellow tinge a smoker/coffee drinker can often get from frequent usage/consumption.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend these trays over all other ones I have tried!</li>
            <li>After several failed attempts at whitening both professionally and at home, my teeth have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I saw results after the first use and achieved my desired results in less than a week!</li>
            <li>I stumble across this product on Amazon and read that it removes decades worth of stains from your teeth in a few easy-to-do treatments.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve got that down - and it took me a few tries to get it right, the rest was pretty basic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved coffee for as long as I can remember, but it really made me hate my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was swayed by the high level of average reviews, but now I think that many of those 5-star reviews must be fake.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product worked great.</li>

            <li> As always, my words and opinions are 100% my very own.</li>

            <li> I could tell a difference after the first use!!!!!</li>
            <li> And after trying out Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening, I had a very nice feedback that has made me accept all my invitations for parties, outings etc.</li>
            <li> It is simply AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I purchased Brilliant HD- Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit about 4 weeks ago</li>
            <li> This is the best whitening system that I&#x27;ve tried, I like the tray so much better than the strips</li>
            <li> That was not the case with the Brilliant HD- Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the best part about this product is that there was no nasty after-taste!!</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon and came across Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit</li>
            <li> Liked it!</li>
            <li> I did not like using the Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say I was pleasantly</li>
            <li> The molds are easy to use and treatments very effective!</li>
            <li> This is amazing, and I am so happy that I found this product, and wish I had found it sooner.</li>

            <li> and I am here to add to the good ones.</li>
            <li> The price is good for the amount and quality that you get too.</li>
            <li> But the Brilliant HD Kit sure did.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and tell the world that you want to look good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way to whiten your teeth in the comfort of your own privacy and see the results yourself.</li>
            <li> The heat-molded trays fit my teeth perfectly, and are a bargain, compared to what they would cost at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to know that what I&#x27;m using is what is also used by dentists.</li>
            <li> which is good</li>

            <li> I think this product is good for the price.</li>
            <li> this one, it looks like a good one.</li>

            <li> I  wasnt exactly sure this product would work as it says, because i had not heard of the brand before</li>
            <li> I have been worrying about stains on my tooth for many years together.</li>
            <li> Though I was not fully satisfied with his recommendation, I wanted to give a try.</li>
            <li> used to get more invitations for parties which I often reject.</li>

            <li> So totally buy this product if you&#x27;re aiming for awesome results!</li>
            <li> I honestly love this product and whether you buy it or</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Ive tried all different types of whiting kits, but the Brilliant HD Kit is by FAR the best.</li>
            <li> Ok so here&#x27;s the thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve drank coffee and tea for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li> I also noticed so many compliments after a while of using it because the results appeared</li>
            <li> I find myself smiling a lot more now.</li>
            <li> My confidence is building more and more each day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the tray system.</li>
            <li> (ok maybe 3 or 4) cups of coffee.  </li>
            <li> so obviously my teeth weren&#x27;t in the best shape.</li>
            <li> feel so much more confident now.</li>
            <li> I could not be more</li>
            <li> a lot more affordable than going to the dentist to get your teeth whitened, which on my budget I cannot afford.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I like the strips much better.</li>
            <li> It is done in this manner to make sure there is no sensitivity or pain to the treatment.</li>
            <li> , it helps to make sure the treatment stays longer.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I thought it worked way better than the stuff I tried from Walmart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taste is better than some.</li>
            <li> appropriate time on box.&lt;br /&gt;Remineralization gel comes with kit, but it&#x27;s not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied the whitening gel with the syringe to most of my front teeth and then put on the tray to keep the gel in place.</li>
            <li> I love coffee and coco, so</li>
            <li> My teeth got about 3 shades whiter, which is actually better than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But its OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li> Better than crest strips for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy to be introduced to this product Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but also a good product worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I’m glad because it’s personalized.</li>
            <li> since I have been using it has brighten my teeth more whiter.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to lift any stains at all.</li>
            <li> After two treatments I was able to lift about 5 shades.</li>
            <li> They look so much better than what they did before.</li>
            <li> This is the best at home whitening system I have used...results are better than the white strips I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love the way Brilliant HD is effective and simple to use.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to have a good smile to go with my caffeinated, bubbly demeanor.</li>
            <li> and it just makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely in love with them</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and each time I use the trays my teeth look whiter and better.</li>
            <li> but this one is way better.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it worked</li>
            <li> Otherwise fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I finally found something that makes my teeth look brilliant despite the abuse I put my teeth color through!</li>
            <li> I’ve always wanted whiter teeth like some of my favorite celebrities.</li>
            <li> One for your top teeth and one for your bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m in Love...</li>
            <li> There is so much to love about this whitening gel set, including the speed of whitening.</li>
            <li> I thought a tray system (as opposed to strips) would be a good idea because it would really coat my teeth and be effective.  </li>
            <li> So then today I went on the website for more information.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t love having to do two rounds, one whitening and one the protective gel.</li>
            <li> I put the trays on for 15 minutes and it had better results than a gel I had to leave on for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> the best thing about this for me was that it actually molds to your teeth.</li>
            <li> This product really works great.</li>
            <li> Be sure to filter by verified purchase.</li>
            <li> There nothing like having a bright smile that fills a room.</li>
            <li> This product feels much better on the sensitivity</li>
            <li> I will continue using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> if you want confidence try this product…I can&#x27;t get over how much better</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that will wipe these stains off until this product.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best fit</li>
            <li> it happened, my roommate began professional whitening about two weeks before I started to use Brilliant HD.</li>
            <li> I have tried many solutions to yellowing teeth and had problems with almost all the products I used.</li>
            <li> Its nice to see a prodoct work as advertised and with Amazon rating product lets others share how good somthing really is and a lot of people rated as I have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Heat-molded trays fit perfectly to your mouth, making this no-hassle at home teeth whitening experience, no mess</li>
            <li> My teeth have progressively been getting whiter and I am feeling so much more confident about my smile!!</li>
            <li> SO FAR SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> But I have recently heard about the Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening kit from my friend who recommended me strongly to go for it.</li>
            <li> Unlike that other bogus kit, this one is perfect in its consistency and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two reasons, I would never again buy this product and I would strongly encourage others to look elsewhere for better and more legitimate products.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I would like to say good about this kit, is the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased about how easy it is to apply, and how quickly I began to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> The accessories included made this simple and neat to use as well as effective!!</li>
            <li> I have the brightest smile from this whitening kit!!</li>
            <li> I work in healthcare and didnt realize how important have a really bright smile</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic, I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips and had ok results, but this was much better.</li>
            <li> The results were great for me but eventually I kind of also dialed it back because the returns were diminishing.</li>
            <li> It is great the trays mold to the shape of your teeth, but I found them to be very bulky and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable to do the treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several attempts purchasing whitening kits off the pharmacy shelf, I decided to give whitening one more try with the Brilliant HD kit.</li>
            <li> I have a professional mouthguard, and Brilliant HD&#x27;s trays fit like a glove just as my dentist-molded mouthguard does.</li>
            <li> Since I tried Brilliant HD results are better than the white strips I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never usually one to go by what others say, but I have to admit that I was really happy I did.</li>
            <li> The trays fit very comfortably and do not bother my gums.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s easy, and best of all, it actually works!</li>
            <li> sure this is a fine product.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit due to all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still amaZing and worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I did not see the same effect with Brilliant HD.  </li>
            <li> I am really happy with the progress and cannot wait to be completely finished.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for Brilliant HD that said it removed stains below the surface and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> NU2 Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit definitely made my smile brighter than before.  </li>
            <li> I find this system to be incredible, it made my teeth shine so white</li>
            <li> With 15 minutes here and there, (and while doing homework) I was able to get the beautiful shiny white teeth I&#x27;ve always admired on others...</li>
            <li> better, the trays were comfortable to use, and this was a benefit that I was not expecting.</li>
            <li> I dont trust the really cheap kits because im sure that they must be made in china.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product i have only been using it for a month</li>
            <li> Brilliant HD will be my go-to whitener and is definitely a product I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Never before have I had this kind of success with a teeth whitening product.</li>
            <li> Have a photoshoot in a couple of weeks and really looking forward to having my teeth look as good as can be.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use and and super quick, so when you need whiter teeth for that upcoming event or wedding, or whatever this is a great go to system.</li>
            <li> It is such an easy, painless process and my teeth look incredible.</li>
            <li> If you want to have shiny white teeth every day, I would strongly recommend purchasing Brilliant HD.</li>
            <li> the gel actually has a nice pleasant taste to it.</li>
            <li> I love my smile again!</li>
            <li> The gel also tastes much better than others, fresh and minty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different teeth whiting products and none of that have been able to mold to my teeth as well as this one, which is amazing because it&#x27;s not blotchy!</li>

            <li> which is a huge plus in my books.  </li>
            <li> I took the fit as a good sign and was ecstatic to see a marked difference in the color of my teeth in about three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was completely worth the money, and more if you ask me.</li>

            <li> pleased by the super quick shipping and the results.</li>
            <li> Application is super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> But the trays were oh so easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Brilliant HD-Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit is also very safe I have never experienced any side effects.</li>
            <li> : Quick easy treatments, noticeable whitening within</li>
            <li> I think I found my new favorite teeth whitening kit!</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it! :)</li>
            <li> I have found it to work very easily and will recommend it to people because it makes my teeth look clean when they really aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Smile!</li>
            <li> The gel did not taste funny, and I like that it was safe for enamel.  </li>
            <li> Id tell anyone who&#x27;s looking to have a brighter , stronger smile , this product is the way to go !</li>
            <li> mouth trays, while seeming to be of a higher quality than most.</li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> The first order lasted more than a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fake and whoever is bashing this product either has nothing better to do with their lives or works for another whitening company  </li>
            <li> The best part is that it is much cheaper than other similar teeth whitening formula and results are just great.</li>
            <li> They are not uncomfortable like so many others.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Although I was happy with the results, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the cost, as I had to pay out of pocket due to lack of medical insurance!</li>
            <li> I just picked a day where I could clean and watch TV</li>
            <li> It cleans better, it is more premium than others I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> Everything comes packed for you, so its a no brainer way to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> The trays mold to my teeth perfectly, which make wearing them so easy and the whole process takes less than 15 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> with NO success, before purchasing Brilliant HD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it&#x27;s so fast.</li>
            <li> The product is very strong… it is extremely quick to whiten and lasts long… Must try!!</li>
            <li> People are treating me better because I&#x27;m able to smile now and have a better overall attitude.</li>
            <li> And I would recommend it to anyone out there who wants to whiten their teeth to get a better smile!</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t have to take special appointments to visit the dentist when you can conveniently do it from the comfort of your home.</li>
            <li> but It was nothing special.</li>
            <li> I use other whitening kits as well, The kit I use depends on what is available when I need to whiten, but I always look for Brilliant HD first.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend brilliant HD for those who drink coffee,tea,and who want white teeth.</li>
            <li> While the wide range of great reviews seem to speak for themselves, I would like to add my two cents on this product.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on Amazon, as most products come as described and are pretty self-explanatory.</li>
            <li> After using this method three times, I noticed a huge difference, and the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> love that this product is very affordable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying Brilliant HD, my teeth were noticeably whiter in a few days.</li>
            <li> But as I am a full time student, I don&#x27;t have the money to get it done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I tried a couple different products, and I have not had any good luck.</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t fall for the &amp;#34;teeth whitening kits&amp;#34; because in the past I have found they dont work, but I am so thrilled that I gave Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit a chance!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I paid full boat.</li>
            <li> &gt; Also loved that I needed no lights or things, it was simple to do with the syringes of whitening gel.&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li> good friend actually tried this HD whitening gel and bought a kit for me to try at home.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled as I was highly irritated to use the strips before stepping out every time and ordered it right away…</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and not messy at all!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and no expensive doctor visits.</li>
            <li> He uses it since the dentist recommended some other toothpaste to use and along with this it works great.</li>
            <li> Many of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; were written within days, many coming in on the same day!</li>
            <li> The results were great, I could really tell a difference, especially on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> Not these ones, they fit nicely and they actually work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After  going through the process, I quickly noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> The solution seems fairly mild on your teeth, too.</li>
            <li> While my teeth weren&#x27;t &amp;#34;stained&amp;#34;, they weren&#x27;t white - just kind of like a really light beigey ivory.  </li>
            <li> I am really glad i found this item, i have been trying for years to get my teeth more white.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly years of neglect washed away from my teeth.</li>
            <li> I could not recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li> First off, the application was painless and the mold tray for your teeth seemed to fit quite well.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my results after only a couple of applications.  </li>
            <li> I saw results after the very first use, which doesn&#x27;t always happen.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later my smile is brighter and more awesome.</li>
            <li> My teeth got much much whiter very quickly as I was using this.</li>
            <li> kit is fast and easy and affordable.</li>
            <li> whole process is really easy, just follow the instructions on the pack.</li>
            <li> The product works really fast and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> In addition, it is more affordable than some products that really didn’t do much for me!</li>
            <li> This has a good taste and therefore I look forward to using it every single time I do, which is about two or three times a week.</li>
            <li> The treatments are very easy to do then more other whitening systems.</li>
            <li> 8 more 5 star \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; from people who have not bought the product, and who have reviewed many of the exact same products (giving 5 star reviews for all...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only a couple more treatments from having pearly whites!</li>
            <li> But it was so easy to use, totally hassle free, and affordable!  </li>
            <li> I have this as well as the one with improved tray(the trays fit better for my not-so-perfect teeth than any other brand!) and love them.</li>
            <li> After the first week I noticed the deep yellow stains being lifted, my teeth were already looking more attractive.  </li>
            <li> At the end of my first two weeks of using it, when she was a month into using hers, my teeth were clearly whiter than hers, yet she had spent a great deal more for her whitening system.</li>
            <li> But this gel taste GREAT, doesn&#x27;t burn my super sensitive gums, and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on my sparkling smile.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase another kit, but the great reviews prompted me to take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off, lets just start by saying it is fairly cheap the price for this item is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The trays fit really well, no discomfort whatsoever.    </li>
            <li> It is amazing that my teeth are this white.  </li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy as much as I did.</li>
            <li> We are all sooooo very ripped off all the time on EVERYTHING in this world from companies being as cheap as they possibility can.</li>
            <li> My teeth look a lot better and I am surprised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time I go out of the house people keep on making comments about how my smile literally sparkles.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m probably going to end up getting another one and trying again to get an even whiter smile.</li>
            <li> Now I can smile and not worry about the stains caused by drinking coffee and tea.</li>
            <li> It only takes about 15-20 minutes to do one treatment, and you can do it on your own schedule.  </li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> When I contacted my doctor for treatment, he gave me a very big course that will take 2 months for the treatment to be effective.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to an even brighter smile than what I have now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a relief not to hide my smile anymore</li>
            <li> But it is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I was looking at several different products and came across the Brilliant HD kit.  </li>
            <li> When I smile for pictures I&#x27;m not embarrassed anymore.  </li>
            <li> honestly thought this product would be the same</li>
            <li> Needed a brighter smile</li>
            <li> At work people are giving me compliments on my smile now</li>
            <li> I can now smile with confidence</li>
            <li> YEARS WORTH OF STAINS</li>
            <li> It is very much worth</li>
            <li> of all the ones on the market, these are simple to use and quite effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its time to experience the Hollywood smile without paying thousands of dollars on in office dental treatments.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something to brighten my smile, but could never find an affordable product.  </li>
            <li> TOTALLY worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a whiter smile since I have surface stains from coffee, tea, etc.</li>
            <li> and I am surprised to be able to report my teeth</li>
            <li> I say that this product is worth your time.</li>
            <li> Confidence was low, so I decided to try brilliant HD teeth whitening kit, and within months my smile was as white as snow.</li>
            <li> Brilliant HD is an inexpensive dental grade whitening solution that is very easy to use, minus the mess.</li>
            <li> Great product to use, especially since there are so many other products out there that can be so misleading.</li>
            <li> This amazing kit really does whiten your teeth and it does it for so much cheaper than a professional clean</li>
            <li> This system totally transformed his smile!!!</li>
            <li> It worked for me, I was able to get my teeth about two shades whiter than I have been able to do with any other product.</li>
            <li> With Brilliant HD deluxe, I only had to whiten my teeth every six months, the results are really long lasting!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use (no messy gels, just trays to put in your mouth) and super fast!</li>
            <li> The first 4 times I used this, it was fine, and I saw some reasonable results.  </li>
            <li> I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> she was right...</li>
            <li> This competes right there with them.</li>
            <li> I tried it right away.</li>
            <li> This competes right there with them.</li>
            <li> How can we trust it if they can&#x27;t even spell treatment right?</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t spit right now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to give up my white teeth to reach my goal of becoming debt free.</li>
            <li> To get real results and have a bright white smile I had to try so many different gels</li>
            <li> Fast forward of being on a fixed income, I knew I could&#x27;nt afford more whitening treatments, so I began researching for different methods on my own.</li>
            <li> With very simple instructions I was able to quickly prepare the trays for use.  </li>
            <li> I’m about to get married and was looking for something to make my smile look extravagant.</li>
            <li> I would definitely say that this product works better than more professional grade whitening kits.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I feel like this product has more professional results than the other whiter I used to use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anybody looking to have a brighter smile!</li>
            <li> It worked really well and quickly without any pain or sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> Its saves me time because its so simple to use and easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Preparing the setup was quite easy and the instructions laid out how to do so in clear</li>
            <li> This was a huge waste of money and there is probably no chance that I&#x27;ll get any kind of refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to get that hollywood smile, and I finally have it because of this product.</li>
            <li> The instructions were clear and easy to understand, and I had no issues using the kit.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth too and there was no burning, or discoloration on my gums which is always a huge worry.</li>
            <li> Well for my smile :).... After the first use my teeth were pearly white.</li>
            <li> They all seem to be reviewing many of the exact same products...which (surprise, surprise)</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am a pretty happy camper!</li>
            <li> I came across this product on Amazon and it was pretty affordable compared to some whitening kits.</li>
            <li> This kid worked well for me the first time</li>
            <li> noticed a change in my smiles shade after the first use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I noticed a change in the first week of using this.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after I was satisfied with my white teeth and</li>
            <li> My top teeth were already pretty white, but the bottom ones were quite stained.</li>
            <li> People are really complimenting my smile.</li>
            <li> This kit absolutely got the job done just as I needed it!</li>
            <li> Thanks NuNutrients!</li>
            <li> but it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> You heat the trays up in hot water and then bite them to make an impression.</li>
            <li> But you must leave it on for 5 minutes the first time.</li>
            <li> This is the only over the counter teeth whitening kit that has not caused me any teeth sensitivity and you get a lot more product</li>
            <li> My teeth have a naturally yellow tint, and my lovely wife can&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li> I use it multiple times a week and my teeth are a lot better looking than before.</li>
            <li> I just wish that it worked on the first go.</li>
            <li> First use</li>
            <li> :) I already had relatively white teeth</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> It works fast!</li>
            <li> so my teeth were pretty stained.  </li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> I drink hot tea in the winter and iced tea in the summer</li>
            <li> Iced, Hot , latte</li>
            <li> At first I was terrified to try this because my roommate had tried the whitening strips and they burnt his gums.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to whiten my teeth with relentlessly, tried so many different things</li>
            <li> and I find it’s not difficult to use this product and</li>
            <li> And to top it all, it&#x27;s WAY cheaper than Crest white strips.</li>
            <li> You can thank me later :)</li>
            <li> So much better than White Strips.</li>
            <li> It only takes 15 mins to see results and does so much more than whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The first night I did this</li>
            <li> Big mistake:)</li>
            <li> I used the blue stuff tonight though and it is so much better.</li>
            <li> I had to first apply it to a cotton swab and then into the tray.</li>
            <li> As with all whitening products just be sure to keep off your gums as much as possible to avoid gum tenderness.</li>
            <li> This was a first time experience for me.</li>
            <li> Do this by soaking them in some hot water then putting them into the mount and sucking the air out.</li>
            <li> Not difficult but do not have the fittings so hot that they burn the mouth.</li>
            <li> what everyone wants to know!</li>
            <li> The color of her teeth has changed significantly!&lt;br /&gt;I would defintely recommend this product for anyone who has a problem with their teeth and not being able to get them white!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Larger Syringe vs many smaller ones&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> Since it was my first time trying any whitening kit</li>
            <li> but I love my personal results.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll be the first to admit..</li>
            <li> Its always my first choice.</li>
            <li> You just have to become used to working with the trays and then making sure they stick properly to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I accidently messed up mouth peices when I put them in the hot water...</li>
            <li> the water was too hot when I did it</li>
            <li> The results were fast too!</li>
            <li> My teeth were much whiter in just two weeks!</li>
            <li> any day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> You do have to run some hot water over it at first and mold it to your teeth, but after that it makes whitening your teeth a breeze.</li>
            <li> Noticeable results on first treatment</li>
            <li> So naturally, I want to whiten my teeth for a rather cheap price.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written for anything</li>
            <li> I love shopping online to experiment with different teeth whitening kits.</li>
            <li> After first treatment I felt my teeth were cleaner and brighter.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d used a teeth whitening kit before .  </li>
            <li> First you heat water to boiling in the microwave</li>
            <li> After the first treatment my teeth felt cleaner and looked whiter.  </li>
            <li> I started feeling the difference immediately after first use.</li>
            <li> I smoke a lot, and since using this product I have gotten rid of most of my stains, and have not seen them come back since.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience using a home whitening kit.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this! :)</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it said it would on the box.</li>
            <li> It is IMPERATIVE that you DON&#x27;T leave the trays in the cup of hot water longer than instructed--not one second more.</li>
            <li> and i haven&#x27;t used it again, and my gums are still more sensitive than normal.  </li>
            <li> And, like I say, sure enough I did have to leave it in longer for results.</li>
            <li> I admit I am an avid coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> I saw some results after the first  time.</li>
            <li> Thanks whoever makes this!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products.</li>
            <li> I’ve seen good results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also addicted to coffee, I have been since I was 17, and Brilliant HD deluxe not only erases the coffee stains, but repels new stains for the 6 month duration it lasts.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a noticeably whiter smile!</li>
            <li> Within days you will see that your teeth are whiten and you will be looking like a full brand new person.</li>
            <li> Maybe it didn’t have that much to do with how white my teeth were, but I felt more confident because of how white my teeth are now.</li>
            <li> Works like very pure, doesn&#x27;t cost that much.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous toothpastes, mouthwashes, and mouth guards all claiming to assist in the tooth whitening process, however, none have been as effective as the Brilliant HD Deluxe Whitening Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using the kit, my teeth had become a stained yellow color that was impossible to hide.</li>
            <li> Nice, I have other products then</li>
            <li> Start enjoying your new smile sooner than later, I have.</li>
            <li> many on the same day, of course) Fraud before your very eyes.</li>
            <li> Good kit, I only wish my hubby could have used it too with a 2nd set of mouth trays.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve tried a few home whitening products, and Brilliant HD &amp;#34;Deluxe Teeth Whitening&amp;#34; is the one I&#x27;ve decided to keep using regularly.</li>
            <li> I, too, was pulled in by the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have tried several whitening products but this seems to be the best because my teeth are not sensitive afterwards and I can use it right on my partial bridge.  </li>
            <li> furthermore, the mold used to make a retainer is very poor quality and did not form a good mold, no matter how many times I tried.</li>
            <li> The instructions are pretty straight forward.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a change on the first treatment.</li>
            <li> The trays are sturdy - unlike some other brands, they fit securely in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I could see a very noticeable difference in the first treatment.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt, I didn&#x27;t get burnt and my teeth look super and super white and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because many reviews said this product does not create any sensitivity, and it got such a high score with over 80 reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and am actually going to order another one for the future.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and am actually going to order another one for the future.</li>
            <li> Seemed easy enough</li>
            <li> Very decent product and does what it says.</li>
            <li> the chemical is definitely way too strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong and if you get it on your gums it will burn and it even turned part of my gums white for while.</li>
            <li> So I am certain this will work well for smokers as well.</li>
            <li> I saw results quickly, there was no pain and no mess.</li>
            <li> with 1 treatment i saw significant whitening, and my teeth were pretty white to begin with.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended and I&#x27;m going to continue to use</li>
            <li> are back to the same brilliant sparkling white that they were when I was getting them whitened professionally!</li>
            <li> Not to sound like a total ad here, but this product is certainly quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most importantly, the product truly works, and I saw an improvement of at least two shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This worked for me very well.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to pay a whole lot of money to a specialist</li>
            <li> There has been so much improvement</li>
            <li> even the teeth with stained fillings seemed much brighter.</li>
            <li> and I thank her so much.</li>
            <li> I tried the product and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I am really thankful to sellers and Amazon for listing out this product.</li>
            <li> I find this method is useful if your teeth are sensitive to this sort of thing</li>
            <li> whole time I had the trays in my mouth, I had saliva dribbling out</li>
            <li> Would defiantly recommend to anyone who wants visibly whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After one use, I really could tell my teeth were a shade lighter.  </li>
            <li> Funny how so many people love this product and all on the same few days!</li>
            <li> And it really was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very statisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> (so I&#x27;m on camera for the whole world to see).</li>
            <li> Going over the costs of having them whitened, I realized I would be paying too much.</li>
            <li> Really read these reviews and evaluate their credibility before buying.    </li>
            <li> I was not as attentive to reviews as I should have been when purchasing this product and used it several times.</li>
            <li> I ordered it, it came on time fast shipping</li>
            <li> It is reasonable to assume, it is so you can apply it in the mouth trays.</li>
            <li> The teeth molding part didn&#x27;t really have instructions and it wasn&#x27;t the easiest, but I got the mouth trays made.</li>
            <li> The price is real convenient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li> This product of s one of the real finds.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much time in the day</li>
            <li> After doing this I like to brush my teeth with just water and rinse my mouth real well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> The set was straight forward and had a minty taste.</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper than going to the dentist for a whitening treatment and convenient as well.</li>
            <li> The gel really hurt my gums</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice much of a whitening effect</li>
            <li> It is 100 percent thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Really whitens and does what it says.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone who wants to get teeth whitening at home to try this out.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Product does absolutely nothing, does not work.</li>
            <li> but it made my teeth so much whiter that you almost couldn&#x27;t even tell they</li>
            <li> Many products hurt my gums, I am sensitive to it, and simply don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Cleans and whitens, your teeth feel like new and shiny after using it the first time, you can really feel the diference.</li>
            <li> Everything was easy to use and it didn&#x27;t take long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deceiving with all the good reviews, but as other comments have noted, it seems those reviews are fabricated.</li>
            <li> But I decided to try a third time, and to read other reviews beforehand to see if there were any good suggestions.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this kit to anyone who wants a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> This product is so much better than the other at-home teeth whitening kits.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone - especially if your smile is your job!</li>
            <li> so I was excited for my next treatment.</li>
            <li> I look like a celeb now with my white smile!</li>
            <li> I love this product and will pick these over the other ones in the market</li>
            <li> I am satisfied as I have tried other products and nothing was working.</li>
            <li> I got my pearly white smile!  ,</li>
            <li> Tray system beats all other systems and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have fairly white teeth, but after trying the kit out for a few weeks, I can definitely see a change in whiteness in my teeth making me feel more confident to smile.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with how fast it really works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on giving up my love for coffee anytime soon, seeing as I am a frequent night owl and need to stay up for long hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trays fit my mouth pretty comfortably, and with such a short wait period it gives me time to fit other things into my busy schedule.</li>
            <li> Ive been a smoker for a few years now, and its helped my smile go from dull to bright!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for  a good white cleaning system for a little while</li>
            <li> So as a result, my teeth have become embarrassingly  more stained than I like with WAY TOO MUCH black tea.</li>
            <li> Most of my stains have diminished and are a lot less noticeably.</li>
            <li> No, seriously.</li>
            <li> But I was out looking for a product that was decent on the wallet</li>
            <li> After purchasing and receiving the product within days, quickly I followed the kits instructions, placed the trays in my mouth daily and began noticing a rapid change!</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I expected it to do in an adequate amount of time.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest you go ahead and try this product as you have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Highly dissattisfied, will not order again or even recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend HD Brilliance to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recoemd this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m doing it wrong, but the mouthpiece is too big  even with a couple of tries of molding to a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> This is also great for people who don&#x27;t have insurance (like me) because you can get the same grade products that the dentist would use for a very small cost.  </li>
            <li> With other brands I use, I get great results but they don&#x27;t last that long, the max was 3 months.</li>
            <li> So not only do they not know how to spell \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;, but they can&#x27;t even misspell it consistently!</li>
            <li> The trays are easy to use, and the whitening gel stays put and does not leak into the rest of your mouth, which other products tend to do.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the applicator was skinnier and longer so that it would fit the gel into the cavity of the tray better.</li>
            <li> Folks, witness honest to goodness (dishonest) crooks.    </li>
            <li> I still have a few shades to go for sure.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to anyone looking to whiten their smile.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you from experience that most whitening processes are harsh on my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be giving this another try in a few months, for sure.</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot after I saw how white my sister&#x27;s smile was.</li>
            <li> This made it where I was able to close my mouth completely without drool going down my face from the tabs sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just thought I owed them a little review for making me so happy and also for not being a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I try every new product that hits the shelf.</li>
            <li> As a student who also works, I tend to live off of coffee to help me stay alert during my day.</li>
            <li> The molds are easy to use and treatments of 15 minutes or less give progressive results.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me notice a visible difference from very early in usage.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It is as good as other brands and types of teeth whitening treatments, but I noticed that it is a little bit cheaper</li>
            <li> A dentist I had years ago tried to sell me an incredibly expensive whitening service, saying, &amp;#34;You know, you are a very attractive woman, but those yellow teeth really age you.&amp;#34; I dumped that dentist a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Another great thing is previously when I’ve used other whitening kits they’ve left a foaming sensation in my mouth that seems rather unnatural.</li>
            <li> My teeth were several shades whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li> but overall I found it pretty convenient.</li>
            <li> way better than any strips i have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have done many teeth whitening kits in the past, none of them worked!&lt;br /&gt;I was truly amazed at this when I got the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I guess my teeth ARE sensitive!</li>
            <li> It says to start out at a 5 minute treatment for the first and add 5 minutes to the next 2 consecutive treatments.</li>
            <li> After I finished the first syringe, I started using the second one as I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I cant stress it enough this whitening kit really works!</li>
            <li> so my teeth are already pretty white, but my husband...</li>
            <li> My teeth were already pretty white and it did still enhance them a bit.</li>
            <li> Results were noticeable after the first treatment, and two weeks later, after finishing up the treatments, my teeth were way cleaner</li>
            <li> This made my teeth white so fast!</li>
            <li> I doubt its legitimacy and am not sure that it&#x27;s safe.  </li>
            <li> First, the trays are just too big.  </li>
            <li> I actually took some sharp scissors and cut away some of the excess plastic, and it worked better.  </li>
            <li> The mold gives me a more secure feeling than other white stripes and it doesn&#x27;t leave much mess.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for anybody who wants whiter teeth instantly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other tray systems are better, but this one was uncomfortable and potentially hazardous.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty white natural teeth according to my dentist, but I’ve always wanted whiter.</li>
            <li> I admit I was a tad bit apprehensive at first trying any at home kits, because I figured the only way to go is to go and have it professionally done.</li>
            <li> This kit far exceeds anything you would be at the store, in fact, it&#x27;s provides exactly the same results as the teeth</li>
            <li> Someone else pointed out than many of the reviews are fake, and I believe that to be true.  </li>
            <li> I could tell the difference in my smile after just a single use.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and simple and it only took me several days to notice a significant difference!</li>
            <li> I have always relied on the typical whitening strips to give my yellow teeth a bit of neatness.. and I always made sure to use it just before any meeting or party so that  the glow is visible..</li>
            <li> And mostly due to my own errors, this product did not work for me and was money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my sister gave me some of NuNutrients&#x27; other products for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> But then I tried the Brilliant HD Kit and was shocked at the difference.</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t get a professional cleaning as often as I need either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gel is professional grade dont get it on your tongue</li>
            <li> My family also really likes it and they can see instant results.</li>
            <li> my teeth stayed white for over a year, but I was brushing after every meal and didn&#x27;t drink much Soda anymore.  </li>
            <li> but it made me self conscious.</li>
            <li> Like some of the issues before I got them this has also made me self conscious, so I decided to have me teeth whitened.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> were surprised when I said, I did not.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> , I was totally amazed at how much brighter my teeth looked.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 3 times now, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with gum sensitivity so far.</li>
            <li> Had to discontinue use because it was making my teeth to sensitive.</li>
            <li> Instead of putting the gel in trays I rolled a q tip into the gel and applied it directly to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and the gel</li>
            <li> my teeth are extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth try dipping the q tip in the gel that comes with this product.</li>
            <li> It is also made in the USA which I completely support.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Mine aren&#x27;t that sensitive but they are with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned the gel may cause problems for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I would stick with crest white strips much easier and cleaner without gum irritation</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would prefer a brush to apply it directly to teeth, vs putting it in trays.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The box was not sealed very well and the numerous amount of misspellings on the box in my opinion is quite unprofessional.</li>
            <li> After my shower and skin care routine I boiled some water and placed the mouth trays in so that they can become soft</li>
            <li> however this one is the only one that really makes a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> It would have saved my wallets some bucks for a professional .</li>
            <li> Teeth feel sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have had my teeth whitened before professionally.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine suggested to try this kit as he claimed that it gives professional results and the glow doesn’t get lost at all</li>
            <li> WOW there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li> I left them in there the whole 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> Then you put the clear gel in the retainer or directly on the teeth indentions.</li>
            <li> Professional cleanings, and whitenings cost lots of money.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a Facebook logo that also doesn&#x27;t lead anywhere, so I tried looking for the company directly through my Facebook page, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to exist there</li>
            <li> but yellowing is just a natural thing with age.</li>
            <li> : None that I can see so far.</li>
            <li> So I was surprised by that 15 minute max.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> The cost is also way cheaper than what you would have to pay to have a professional do it so that alone caused me to give it a try</li>
            <li> and it looks professional.</li>
            <li> drink coffee regularly so only 3 treatments got me to a Hollywood White smile</li>
            <li> I became a master at that closed mouth smile,</li>
            <li> Have only been able to use a few times.</li>
            <li> There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars on a whitening kit when the solution is available for far less from NuNutrients!</li>
            <li> The other products I tried, I had problems with the trays fitting in my mouth without cutting me, but the trays supplied in here fit just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark complected so the original not whiteness of my teeth was really apparent.</li>
            <li> I have abnormally small teeth, so if I were to use the big trays that came with it my teeth would be even more sensitive.</li>
            <li> Buying this product you will get a few shades whiter teeth, giving you that movie star smile you always dreamed of !</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m done, and after a few days i already started seeing a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> well worth the money especially considering that most other whitening systems cost around the same and do half the job.</li>
            <li> The trays molded to my teeth, so that part worked fine, but they were bulky in my mouth and caused me to drool excessively.  </li>
            <li> If you want white teeth I&#x27;d recommend to use this product first to help whiten it, remember to brush after every meal, use mouthwash, and try to cut back on Soda.  </li>
            <li> I already had pretty white teeth, but, needed some perfecting to get them pearly white!</li>
            <li> I dialed back to once a week from twice a week and since I had already done a handful of treatments, my teeth were already getting pretty white.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because most products you get offline that claim to whitening your teeth</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, I was skeptical because of the price as most whitening kits tend to be higher up there</li>
            <li> Like the other 1-star reviewers, I wish I had read the other reviews more closely before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> but it comes back pretty much daily even when not using the product.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that my gums were burning, but I have a decent tolerence for pain, and decided to stick it out for ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on my teeth since trying out this whitening kit, two in the last week to be exact, and</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, especially now that the holidays are around the corner!</li>
            <li> I cracked open the kit for this one, it appeared to be well-designed and made from high quality materials.</li>
            <li> as for the whitening, this one caused significantly more pain to the gums and mouth, and far less whitening effect, than other whitening kits, even just strips from CVS.</li>
            <li> I normally used Colgate but that wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth as white as they was .so</li>
            <li> You just have to e careful around the gums because they can be irritated a little but other than that good product.</li>
            <li> While teeth whitening has primarily, in our household, been my husband&#x27;s thing, I&#x27;ve noticed that my normally very white teeth were getting a little yellower</li>
            <li> After nearly ruining my teeth with those old crest white strips...</li>
            <li> I come back after 2 weeks of using these and most of those reviews are gone and now a ton of negative reviews popped up.</li>
            <li> The results definitely exceeded my expectations, as I drink soda on a daily basis, which has really caused some discoloration over the years.</li>
            <li> Why spend so much money going to the DOC when you can get this kit to white shine your stained yellow teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find something for a good price that ACTUALLY works....!</li>
            <li> I eat a lot of chocolates and hot cocao coffee due to this reason my tooth are brownish colour after using brillant hd  </li>
            <li> Caused major sensitivity to my teeth</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any stinging/bleeding which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other &amp;#34;one star&amp;#34; users noted, the packaging appears to have been tampered with, the syringes are not sealed in separate packages, and there are numerous misspellings on the package (no instructions other than what&#x27;s on the box.)</li>
            <li> I got this as I was looking for a way to whiten my teeth a little more then they were as I am a smoker and we all know that smoke will discolor your teeth among other things.</li>
            <li> I started to see slight results right away</li>
            <li> After using half of the kit I can actually see a very noticeable difference and can&#x27;t wait to see how much whiter my teeth get when this is all gone.</li>
            <li> I flashed her a smile and it looked like she was having a bad day, but she smiled back.</li>
            <li> The gel was not gel - it was clear liquid that could not possibly stay in anyone&#x27;s mouth to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> clear detail was not only reserved for the instruction manual.</li>
            <li> Clear detail is what I could see starting to appear on my teeth within 20 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact:  it only takes 10 minutes to do session because I really don&#x27;t like to leave whiteners on for a long time.</li>
            <li> The ingredients don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth at all, either, which is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li> Was much harsher than expected.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive dial it back.</li>
            <li> The next treatment can be for 10 minutes if you aren&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li> I tried the whitening strips they sell at my local drug store, but they hurt and made my teeth so sensitive.</li>
            <li> It completely removes all stains from my teeth, and makes them so white I can almost not believe it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a whitening product for the teeth especially if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s always a plus, especially for the fact that it comes with two trays, when normally I can only find them with one.</li>
            <li> Spending a few dollars versus hundreds on teeth whitening at the dentist is worth it.</li>
            <li> I was slightly sensitive to the first few treatments but it went away.</li>
            <li> Removes decades worth of stains from your teeth in a few easy-to-do treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Provides dental-grade,</li>
            <li> I don’t know why the major companies are ignoring this style, because it’s much easier for me to apply this than other types of products.</li>
            <li> I have been paying for professional tooth whitening at my dentist&#x27;s office for years, but a few months ago I decided to try to be more frugal and cut down on unnecessary costs in an effort to become debt free.</li>
            <li> and I think that the cost is very competitive with other teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li> The treatments are only 15 minutes which are a definite plus for a busy mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first I was a little intimidated by the molds and syringes.</li>
            <li> Well, after about two weeks I noticed my teeth weren&#x27;t as dull off white looking color, they actually started looking like they should, instead of that obvious light yellow tinge a smoker/coffee drinker can often get from frequent usage/consumption.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend these trays over all other ones I have tried!</li>
            <li> After several failed attempts at whitening both professionally and at home, my teeth have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first use and achieved my desired results in less than a week!</li>
            <li> I stumble across this product on Amazon and read that it removes decades worth of stains from your teeth in a few easy-to-do treatments.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve got that down - and it took me a few tries to get it right, the rest was pretty basic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved coffee for as long as I can remember, but it really made me hate my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was swayed by the high level of average reviews, but now I think that many of those 5-star reviews must be fake.  </li>
            <li> This product works and it&#x27;s so hard to find kits that actually do the job right.  </li>
            <li> First, it lists carbamide peroxide as an active ingredient, which other products use as well, but no where does it list the concentration.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first about the price having been disappointed by so many other products, but after I saw results right away</li>
            <li> Firstly, the items arrive in packets that are hard to keep fresh and the retainer pack is hard to close back.</li>
            <li> Overtime I had become extremely self conscious of my yellow teeth that my confidence was beginning to waiver.</li>
            <li> I made an effort to only use as much of the gel as necessary, didn&#x27;t go overboard, as per the instructions.</li>
            <li> Usually, I brush my teeth with Ultra Brite toothpaste, but it never really produces a pearly white smile.</li>
            <li> The tray is a pain to use its hard, and every time you want to use the whitening you have to put the tray in hot water to form to your teeth.</li>
            <li> Are VERY hard to mold, they are super bluky as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the effort or risk of making your teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not sure that should make a difference, or if I used too much of the gel.  </li>
            <li> The directions are clear, the process is simple, and it only took me a few minutes to see immediate results.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to whiten their teeth without waiting long to notice results.</li>
            <li> The final treatment can be as long as 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The results are long lasting and application is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I can only use it for about 5 mins at a time, since my gag reflex won&#x27;t allow me to have it in too long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience to sit in a chair to get my teeth whitened for a long period, especially with my mouth open.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This kit is very professional and you can see results in little then 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Very much worth the price since getting your teeth whitened professionally can be so expensive.</li>
            <li> Last year, I purchased a tooth whitening kit from Groupon that was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The one thing is there is not very much of the blue remineralizing gel.</li>
            <li> I am a smoker and coffee drinkers, and before starting this product I had some pretty bad staining to my right front teeth.</li>
            <li> There were just a few changes that weren&#x27;t really noticeable to other people</li>
            <li> I returned the product for refund when I noted the misspelling of Treatment (Treamtent) on the product box, other misspellings (Brialliant) on their websites, and the many obviously fake reviews.</li>
            <li> professional strength teeth whitening results in as little as 15 minutes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit difficult to clean for future applications.</li>
            <li> Very few people are mega wealth and can afford steady laser teeth whitening, even with Groupon.</li>
            <li> The mold fit well and wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> that really awkward one that kind of ruins pictures.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I held mine in the hot water too long because its shape completely collapsed and it stuck to itself rendering it unusable.</li>
            <li> I will DEFINITELY be getting this regularly to combat the unwanted side effects of my dark drink addiction.</li>
            <li> You match the time you spent on whitening and do same amount of time rehydrating.  </li>
            <li> then they have been in a long while.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long for it to take effect either</li>
            <li> Have been a long time user.</li>
            <li> Three days later I again did the whitening treatment at night and slightly increased the time I left it on.</li>
            <li> I usually have very sensitive teeth but had no problems with this kit.</li>
            <li> Also, I usually have very sensitive teeth but had no problems with this kit.</li>
            <li> Make sure you choose this before any expensive ways from the Dentist!</li>
            <li> I got them off earlier this year, and due to them I have some stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I use it about three times a week which is also similar to other products.</li>
            <li> I did it every other day and then dialed it back to about twice a week.</li>
            <li> The price compared to the other Kits I&#x27;ve seen around is very low.</li>
            <li> and the results seem to last longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> I use it about three times a week which is also similar to other products.</li>
            <li> Lastly comes the blue gel, this only takes a small amount and spread it like the gel</li>
            <li> I have tried countless other brands and products</li>
            <li> At a cost of only $39.99, I figured I had nothing to lose, compared to other products.</li>
            <li> It molds to my face so it will not slip off, similar to some other products like whitening strips and whatnot.</li>
            <li> He said he reccomends all his patients who are serious about that white smile but have a little harder time getting there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t try it for very long.</li>
            <li> The results were dramatic so it is worth some discomfort.</li>
            <li> After only a few days I started to notice a big difference in the coloring of my teeth.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> After using this a few times I threw the product away, something I almost never do since I don&#x27;t like to waste anything, especially when I&#x27;ve spent a decent amount of money on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read every single review for every whitener of it&#x27;s type before I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I have used Crest whitestrips in the past and they have always affected my already sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for whiter teeth since I am noticing some yellow staining due to coffee, yuck!  </li>
            <li> You know, I&#x27;d just about given up believing that anything short of spending half my life in a dentist&#x27;s chair could brighten these teeth of mine.</li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably less yellow</li>
            <li> , my teeth have become a lot less white.</li>
            <li> Or should i say, they were less white before I started using this!</li>
            <li> The product came with the box bent in half and already open.</li>
            <li> It does not take long to notice results unlike those other products that takes weeks or even months.</li>
            <li> could have spent 10 dollars less and bought a product that actually worked.</li>
            <li> , how ever I can have it :) super bad habit for my poor teeth!</li>
            <li> I bought it without reading the 1-star reviews, so I was not aware that this was full of fake 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li> Been known to drink a little red wine from time to time, as well.</li>
            <li> They all seem to help a little, but only short-term.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, having tried several other &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; products on the market that promised me glowing pearly whites.</li>
            <li> IN AS LITTLE AS 1 TREAMTENT\\&quot; and \\&quot;TREAMENTS FROM 5 TO 15 MINUTES DAILY FOR UP TO 15 DAYS\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried several other teeth whitening stuff previously</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to use, causes much drool and doesn&#x27;t come with enough mineralization gel.</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure how much of the product to apply to the tray, it just says to use a small bead for each tooth.  </li>
            <li> Total waste</li>
            <li> This looks like a carefully choreographed ruse.</li>
            <li> It only took a few days for me to see results.  </li>
            <li> In just a few weeks my teeth are very white.</li>
            <li> After just few minutes I see big difference on my teeth</li>
            <li> just be careful not to over do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time researching tooth whitening, and I tried a couple &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The aging of my teeth made for yellowish even tan areas on my teeth, but in a few uses I have white teeth again.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> total waste of money.</li>
            <li> but no where near as thick.</li>
            <li> Up against my pale face, my teeth looked like they had been colored by a yellow marker.</li>
            <li> Even when I was vigilant about spitting regularly, because the upper tray presses against the pallet and the excessive salivation causes the product to spread and be trapped by the tray, my pallet got burned each time I used the product.  </li>
            <li> of course there will be NO difference just like every other product ive spent ALOT of money on.....</li>
            <li> One of the main reason behind this rejection was just my tooth color.</li>
            <li> I could only leave it on for a few minutes less</li>
            <li> I have used whitening products in the past that leave white rims on my teeth</li>
            <li> There was this one stain on one of my bottom teeth that I’ve tried to remove before with other whitening kits and using whitening toothpaste, and this did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your teeth are an extremely visible feature of your face and can say a lot about you.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the Amazon discount is extremely generous on this product.</li>
            <li> so I did it for a while every other day.</li>
            <li> then those other brands as well.</li>
            <li> It’s lower than strips and other things I’ve seen on the market</li>
            <li> I have been drinking coffee for years now and along with a combination of other things</li>
            <li> I have tried other whitening kits from my dentist and they all have made my gums break out.  </li>
            <li> Ive found other products damaging on my enamel.</li>
            <li> I squirt a small amount of gel into the teeth tray and stick it in my mouth for ten, fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> It’s lower than strips and other things I’ve seen on the market</li>
            <li> I am writing this to save other people...</li>
            <li> Their timing is within days of each other.</li>
            <li> are white no more stains</li>
            <li> She tried crest whitening strips an also some other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had to use my other ones, as these hurt to use.&lt;br /&gt;The small white tip that came with the kit, had no directions for use.</li>
            <li> But BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> The ingredients do not give me tooth sensitivity like other products do.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you struggle with teeth that are tarnished from tea and coffee and other food and drinks.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, there are mis-spellings on the box, something that doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence.  </li>
            <li> I have tried aquafresh, crest 3d, and a similar tray/gel system in the past, and never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After being disappointed over and over by the flavor, burning and general ineffectiveness of the other whiteners I&#x27;ve tried, I didn&#x27;t have much hope that this one would be any different.</li>
            <li> Finding a quality whitening system is a frustrating, costly process if one tries product after product with modest results.</li>
            <li> Holy cow.</li>
            <li> Trays were hard to mold properly but other than that it works like a charm and has whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> because I have a lot of build up stains due to drinking coffee often and black.</li>
            <li> considering I drink a lot of dark colored drinks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid to smile in photos</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> After years of drinking coffee I have always noticed my teeth have gotten some minor stains that I was not able to remove with just toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I also dont trust the 150$+ kits because they are fooling the customer on a product that is obviously not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, I am much too wary of this product to ever use it again.  </li>
            <li> whole thing was a bit cumbersome and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> my teeth do have aged stains on them but with this product it takes away literally years of accumulated stains away with just a few uses.</li>
            <li> All the other high reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> and I just bite down</li>
            <li> But I hunkered down and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I have used other teeth whitener and somehow those cause my teeth to ache a little when I use them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unbelievably, all the pesky stains that seemed almost built into my teeth after 10 other whitening products were astonishly removed!</li>
            <li> but what I noticed was those little corners hard to get to wasn&#x27;t as white.</li>
            <li> I buy very heavily from Amazon due to living remotely and its been a life changing experience.</li>
            <li> I always felt like the strips just moved the gel around on the front few teeth and did nothing for my other teeth.</li>
            <li> It also takes less time to use than the whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> So it had the honors of trying to remove all the pesky stains that remained after using the previous 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> but it cost a lot less.  </li>
            <li> Less Drool&lt;br /&gt;Mouth</li>
            <li> Works less because its less time in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This kit  comes with everything you need - syringes, mineralization gel, teeth molds and a moldable tray everything you would get at the dentist but for way less the cost.</li>
            <li> I will consider this a lesson learned and next time will not be so naïve as to blindly trust the \\&quot;user\\&quot; reviews without further investigation.    </li>
            <li> To start, the box had been previously opened and was taped close.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the price, but decided my stained teeth made me uncomfortable enough that it was a worthy investment.</li>
            <li> Other systems are cumbersome,sloppy, require mixing, or just plainly don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Using this product is less harmful on my teeth, so drinking cold or hot things doesn&#x27;t shock my teeth.  </li>
            <li> There are people out there (me) who want whiter teeth or some system, but don’t want to stand around trying to stick flimsy pieces of disposable plastic onto their teeth and then mess up and try to readjust them</li>
            <li> No, not true.</li>
            <li> , I used to smoke and drink a lot of coffee for twenty years and it left me with a very unpleasant smile.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much tried every brand of whitening trays and strips, they taste horrible, fall off, or just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> considering I have in the past with other whitening products.</li>
            <li> and I imagine it will work again, but I want to give it a little time between treatments before I go for it again.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to use it</li>
            <li> so I used a little bit at a time, but still works</li>
            <li> It’s cooling and minty but my teeth end up hurting a little bit.</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of setup but</li>
            <li> First time splurging on a whitening kit like this (40 bucks is expensive to me!</li>
            <li> it has a little micro applicator tip  </li>
            <li> After as little as two treatments I saw noticeable results.</li>
            <li> YOU PRODUCT MAKER FOR PUTTING A LITTLE MONEY INTO YOUR PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Which is why it&#x27;s a cruel joke that I also love coffee and cigarettes!</li>
            <li> It burned my gums, caused excessive salivation, burned my pallet, doesn&#x27;t list the strength of the active ingredient, and doesn&#x27;t appear to be made in the U.S.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because it has done what other whitening products have failed to do for me!</li>
            <li> Just not worth the pain and trouble for very little if any payoff.</li>
            <li> cause I don&#x27;t want to be reminded how ugly my smile is.</li>
            <li> And I am REALLY very upset by the dishonest practice of the company, putting up fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Tried it out for a few weeks and the results have been staggering.</li>
            <li> This is fully recommended to anyone who would like to make their teeth a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li> but I was looking for something different as I was not happy with the strips.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I came across this product, after about I few days of use</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t do this everyday...</li>
            <li> You just have to squirt the gel into the mouth piece and stick it in your mouth for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Started to use this product a few weeks ago, maybe three weeks.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are easily a few shades lighter.  </li>
            <li> I got the kit and in a few days I received my package and started using it.</li>
            <li> did not work  waste of money.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to do it every few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker and a heavy coffee drinker</li>
            <li> system has a few flaws.  </li>
            <li> It removes years of unwanted stains within a few treatments.</li>
            <li> Waste in money.</li>
            <li> I received the order in just a few days and could not wait to put the product to the test.  </li>
            <li> I just hope that my review will save others from throwing away cash on a crap product and feeling like chump for not looking more closely at the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The affordable price left me somewhat skeptical due to the fact I&#x27;ve had no luck at all with the pharmacy offerings.</li>
            <li> After a week of using this product, there isn&#x27;t a single trace of any of my bad habits, and my teeth look like they may have been done professionally!</li>
            <li> This home whitening kit is also a lot less expensive then seeing a dentist to do the same job.</li>
            <li> So, the bottom was pretty bad looking.</li>
            <li> Other products have left me disappointed and with the same dull, yellowness.</li>
            <li> so I will definitely be using this again to help combat those tough stains!</li>
            <li> I kept refusing to get braces for years because I wanted to avoid the ugly metal, and my teeth were straight already.</li>
            <li> and it works just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> This is a plus as I have a tiny mouth and treatments can be difficult.  </li>
            <li> I have tried others in the past</li>
            <li> All in one small box.  </li>
            <li> But after seeing the results from just a few treatments I am a believer in this kit!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on this routing for the past 9-10 years</li>
            <li> However this sub-par customer service, as well as shady business practices, I will never order from this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and they usually just whiten my teeth a shade or two.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on all of the glowing 5-star reviews, which I admittedly did not scrutinize enough to realize they were all fake.  </li>
            <li> Usually 5 to 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I usually have tooth sensitivity with whitening products, and I didn&#x27;t have this issue with this kit, so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One day, I had been shopping on Amazon for my usual collection of reality tv shows dvds, and deviated to the home health and beauty section.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will try it again or throw it away.  </li>
            <li> I took the trays out thinking AS USUAL</li>
            <li> First review I have ever written because I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I just got some no satisfying results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to use than what to me seems a rather outdated and awkward whitening strip system - Those never did stay on like they should have.</li>
            <li> and then it just gets messy and ridiculous.</li>
            <li> My previous experience with teeth whitening kits had left me with the impression that the experience was unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not super white, but I don&#x27;t smoke so they aren&#x27;t quite as bad as smokers teeth.  </li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be too hard if it were for a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> I hope the Amazon law suit bites this company in the ass really hard.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting teeth sensitivity (a common side effect, I&#x27;ve heard),</li>
            <li> I had not smiled for years cause of my stained teeth.  </li>
            <li> I take at least 3 to 4 coffee and 4 to 5 tea per day.</li>
            <li> —my teeth have probably whitened at least two or three shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I think my teeth have brightened at least three shades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a whitening fanatic</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d recommend to anyone I know and like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beware of the fake reviews on here and all other NuNutrients products.</li>
            <li> She forced me to use this kit and threatened serious consequences if I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I am a coffee drinker and have been drinking coffee for years, I thought my teeth needed some serious whitening</li>
            <li> I think if I were seriously considering whitening my teeth, I&#x27;d see a dentist that specializes in this process.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> This product works, I&#x27;ve done about 5 treatments and have seen serious improvement in the whiteness in my teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth were stained and needed some serious whitening.</li>
            <li> Ill use this product again in a few months to continue to make my teeth shine.</li>
            <li> Definitely irritated my teeth, the mold taste awful, and didn’t hold long.</li>
            <li> agree to some of the negative reviews here!</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that tea stains teeth worse than coffee</li>
            <li> Your jaw gets tired of clenching them, even after molding them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an addicted coffee drinker and coffee stains and discolored teeth are just some of the disadvantages that come along.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE product and a complete waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I have been reading reviews like crazy on a whitening kit that would help my teeth not look so dull and yellowish.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a little secret: I hate going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> and it was terribly messy, awkward and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I have been skeptical of take-home teeth whitening solutions after trying a few and being disappointed when they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Well, needless to say, my teeth were still in dire need of whitening.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews, I was still a bit skeptical</li>
            <li> This is totally fake.</li>
            <li> fake reviews , fake kit</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I am a tea drinker.  </li>
            <li> I recommended anyone who&#x27;s looking to whiten their teeth without having to go to the dentist for expensive treatment to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Almost all the  five star reviews for this product are fake.</li>
            <li> I can only leave this on about 5 minutes otherwise I have horrible shooting pains in my teeth/gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been difficult to drink and eat</li>
            <li> Ill just have to get another.</li>
            <li> item seems fake and there are misspellings on the box.</li>
            <li> But to me the mouth guard technique is quite uncomfortable and saliva just pours out of my mouth</li>
            <li> Not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have no idea, and that&#x27;s scary.  </li>
            <li> It is sad amazon allows fake readings and allows for</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work and 5 star reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have used a lot of tooth whitening kits in my day.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of products like this because I feel like I have tried EVERY one on the planet.</li>
            <li> I hardly leave reviews on items I purchase on amazon, but I&#x27;m so disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Too bad, because my teeth have taken a turn for the worse.</li>
            <li> Very painful, I think it killed my gum tissue.  </li>
            <li> needless to say that I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> My teeth were in desperate need of some whitening after decades of stains.</li>
            <li> I found the mould making process awkward.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box, one of the syringes with the cleaning material had already been used, and the mouth piece had a piece missing, indicating it could have also been used, which is disgusting.</li>
            <li> product is potentially dangerous.</li>
            <li> However, I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I do not have dental insurance, and this product saved me an expensive trip to the dentist!</li>
            <li> I was suffering from ugly yello stains on two front teeth and was in desperate need of finding a affordable solution.</li>
            <li> zoom whitening(which is very expensive) but my friend told me about this kit.</li>
            <li> Yes, because it&#x27;s virtually impossible.</li>
            <li> I have had bad habits in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> Bad foods, sugars.</li>
            <li> However, there was some burning but not so bad I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> It never taste bad or anything chemicals.</li>
            <li> I still have bad habits</li>
            <li> As my teeth were badly stained from years of drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes, I&#x27;ve tried almost all over-the-counter whitening products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so bad.</li>
            <li> NuNutrients makes a lot of stuff, and I have never had a bad experience with one of their products.</li>
            <li> After trying some products from the store and being sorely disappointed I decided to see what the internet had to offer.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My schedule is horrible and I have been ingesting coffee like a madman.</li>
            <li> Worst whitening kit I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I use a whitening product every 2 years or so, and this is the worst product I have used to date.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, horrible quality</li>
            <li> Horrible product, does not work.</li>
            <li> Literally terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great deal here. I would say to go out and grab it just like all these fine people here. The price is right, the method is great. I have found it to work very easily and will recommend it to people because it makes my teeth look clean when they really aren&#x27;t. Love it.</li>
            <li> My schedule is horrible and I have been ingesting coffee like a madman. Too bad, because my teeth have taken a turn for the worse. They look kind of yellow-y and so I came on here to look for good reviews since I can&#x27;t break the bank on this one. Saw the reviews here and I am here to add to the good ones. I used it for a handful of treatments and my teeth are two tones lighter. Loving it.</li>
            <li> I have had bad habits in my lifetime. Smoking, drinking, coffee, everything. Bad foods, sugars. My teeth are a wreck. They need a lot of help. I am glad that this product here helps. It is as good as other brands and types of teeth whitening treatments, but I noticed that it is a little bit cheaper and it works just as well, if not better. Love it.</li>
            <li> Tried it out for a few weeks and the results have been staggering. Will be doing this into the future. My teeth look a lot better and I am surprised. Why haven&#x27;t I been doing this earlier? The price is good for the amount and quality that you get too.</li>
            <li> My teeth were several shades whiter after the first use.</li>
            <li> Worst whitening kit I have ever used. Beware! Not approved by the American Dental Association. Packing contains spelling errors and does not list ingredients. Probably not the safest thing to be putting on your teeth.</li>
            <li> This worked out great! It helped me whiten my teeth! And I would recommend it to anyone out there who wants to whiten their teeth to get a better smile! Make sure you choose this before any expensive ways from the Dentist!</li>
            <li> Well, the molds melted when I tried to heat them... Total waste unless I use q-tips.</li>
            <li> Whitens teeth but it burns if you get it on your gums.</li>
            <li> I eat a lot of chocolates and hot cocao coffee due to this reason my tooth are brownish colour after using brillant hd  there is lot of whiteness in my tooth</li>
            <li> This looks like a carefully choreographed ruse. Many of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; were written within days, many coming in on the same day! Look at Nov 19, 2014, for instance. 15 5-star review in one day! And as of this date, it shows that only 3 of the 97 5-star reviews have actually purchased the product. And those three have only reviewed this one product. Fishy, eh? Yes, because it&#x27;s virtually impossible. And check out the reviewers. They all seem to be reviewing many of the exact same products...which (surprise, surprise) they also have not actually purchased. If it smells like a scam... Folks, witness honest to goodness (dishonest) crooks.    Update: Look at Nov 20th. 8 more 5 star \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; from people who have not bought the product, and who have reviewed many of the exact same products (giving 5 star reviews for all...many on the same day, of course) Fraud before your very eyes. Stay tuned...</li>
            <li> Excellent! You know, I&#x27;d just about given up believing that anything short of spending half my life in a dentist&#x27;s chair could brighten these teeth of mine. But the Brilliant HD Kit sure did. My stubborn stains come from 20-plus years of drinking a pot of coffee every morning. Yes, a pot. Every morning. Been known to drink a little red wine from time to time, as well. Whatever the culprit, my teeth tend to be perpetually yellow and dingy. Excellent!   Here&#x27;s a little secret: I hate going to the dentist. So, I don&#x27;t get a professional cleaning as often as I need either. I try every new product that hits the shelf. They all seem to help a little, but only short-term. But then I tried the Brilliant HD Kit and was shocked at the difference. And it lasts! I&#x27;m sold. Bring on the coffee!</li>
            <li> I have used whitening products in the past that leave white rims on my teeth and I have to say that I did not see the same effect with Brilliant HD.  My teeth actually did whiten with each use - evenly. I was also a smoker so I was impressed with how well the system worked within the time frame recommended. The trays fit really well, no discomfort whatsoever.    I also have to say that I did not experience teethe sensitivity after using this whitening kit either, which is impressive considering I have in the past with other whitening products. This home whitening kit is also a lot less expensive then seeing a dentist to do the same job. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a home treatment option for teeth whitening. It saves money and just as effective. Needless to say, I am a pretty happy camper!</li>
            <li> I’m about to get married and was looking for something to make my smile look extravagant. I came across this product on Amazon and it was pretty affordable compared to some whitening kits. I tried it and can’t recommend it enough. There was this one stain on one of my bottom teeth that I’ve tried to remove before with other whitening kits and using whitening toothpaste, and this did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I go out of the house people keep on making comments about how my smile literally sparkles. I think I’ve even convinced my fiancé to give it a try. Another great thing is previously when I’ve used other whitening kits they’ve left a foaming sensation in my mouth that seems rather unnatural. With this stuff, I just feel like I just came back from a teeth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High recommend!</li>
            <li> This product was like an answer to my prayers! A friend recommended it to me when I was complaining about how the drug store brand ones weren&#x27;t working for me at all. I was skeptical because of the price, but decided my stained teeth made me uncomfortable enough that it was a worthy investment. SO glad I did. From the first time I started using it a couple weeks ago to now, the difference in the whiteness of my teeth is so stunning I have been getting compliments on top of compliments. It&#x27;s amazing. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product can help people who drink coffee and smoke to whiten their teeth. People who have dulled the whiteness of their teeth throught the years can depend on this product to rescue them. Your teeth are an extremely visible feature of your face and can say a lot about you. Do yourself a favor and tell the world that you want to look good and you want whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this product. While teeth whitening has primarily, in our household, been my husband&#x27;s thing, I&#x27;ve noticed that my normally very white teeth were getting a little yellower (I blame all the Starbucks I&#x27;ve been drinking !) and so I picked this item up do the great reviews. It did not disappoint. It only took about fifteen minutes and I was expecting teeth sensitivity (a common side effect, I&#x27;ve heard), but that was not something I experienced (thankfully, because I don&#x27;t like pain !). I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and have noticed a difference and will be reordering this soon !</li>
            <li> Great product to use, especially since there are so many other products out there that can be so misleading. I gained about a shade whiter after using the kit for a week and am still seeing results as I continue to use it. Very much worth the price since getting your teeth whitened professionally can be so expensive. It&#x27;s a great way to whiten your teeth in the comfort of your own privacy and see the results yourself. I continue using this kit and telling friends about it and continue seeing great results.</li>
            <li> This worked for me very well. First off, the application was painless and the mold tray for your teeth seemed to fit quite well. I followed the instructions and applied every day for about 2 weeks. My teeth were several shades whiter and that makes me very happy. I can show how happy it makes me with my new, brighter smile as well! Not to sound like a total ad here, but this product is certainly quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably going to end up getting another one and trying again to get an even whiter smile. I still have a few shades to go for sure. This kid worked well for me the first time and I imagine it will work again, but I want to give it a little time between treatments before I go for it again. This is fully recommended to anyone who would like to make their teeth a few shades whiter. Go ahead and pick it up.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for whiter teeth since I am noticing some yellow staining due to coffee, yuck!  Brillant HD-Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit helps take away even years of staining which is a plus.  The treatments are only 15 minutes which are a definite plus for a busy mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product is very affordable.  Who has time to waist money on treatments that cost an arm and leg and probably doesn&#x27;t even produce effective results?  Definitely not me.  The heat molded trays fit nicely in the mouth.  This is a plus as I have a tiny mouth and treatments can be difficult.  I like this way better than whitening strips.</li>
            <li> The product definitely works as advertised. The ingredients don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth at all, either, which is definitely a plus. Application is super easy to use.  The heat-molded trays fit my teeth perfectly, and are a bargain, compared to what they would cost at the dentist office. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Smile! I am! I wasn&#x27;t sure about trying this at home but I was so glad I did. The results were amazing. The accessories included made this simple and neat to use as well as effective!! Made in the USA is something I always look for and Brilliant HD is made right here in the US. It&#x27;s good to know that what I&#x27;m using is what is also used by dentists.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!❤️❤️ left my teeth feeling cleaner an looking whiter within one use. I recommended it to all my fellow tea and coffee drinkers!! Haha great product.</li>
            <li> I smoke and drink coffee/tea. This product has helped me notice a visible difference from very early in usage. It&#x27;s also a lot cheaper than going to the dentist to pay for a whitening procedure. Very highly recommended and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it! :)</li>
            <li> Last year, I purchased a tooth whitening kit from Groupon that was a complete waste of money. The gel was not gel - it was clear liquid that could not possibly stay in anyone&#x27;s mouth to whiten teeth. Well, needless to say, my teeth were still in dire need of whitening. I was a little hesitant to purchase another kit, but the great reviews prompted me to take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased by the super quick shipping and the results. Unlike that other bogus kit, this one is perfect in its consistency and very easy to use. Now I can smile and not worry about the stains caused by drinking coffee and tea. A dentist I had years ago tried to sell me an incredibly expensive whitening service, saying, &amp;#34;You know, you are a very attractive woman, but those yellow teeth really age you.&amp;#34; I dumped that dentist a long time ago! There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars on a whitening kit when the solution is available for far less from NuNutrients!</li>
            <li> I used to buy whitening strips. They worked ok. But then I found this whitening kit through online searching. Not only is this product affordable, it makes me teeth whiter. which is good considering I drink a lot of dark colored drinks. Honestly, I feel like this product has more professional results than the other whiter I used to use. I plan on buying it again.</li>
            <li> Directions are easy to read and follow&lt;br /&gt;The gel is professional grade dont get it on your tongue&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a change in my smiles shade after the first use&lt;br /&gt;I drink coffee regularly so only 3 treatments got me to a Hollywood White smile</li>
            <li> Heads up so you don&#x27;t fall for scams in future purchases, if the reviewer isn&#x27;t listed as an Amazon verified purchase...then that person did not purchase the product and therefore their review should not be valid in choosing a product for yourself.</li>
            <li> I stumble across this product on Amazon and read that it removes decades worth of stains from your teeth in a few easy-to-do treatments. so i went and decided to give it a try. First I have to say, the price is fantastic, I&#x27;ve used whitestrips and had ok results, but this was much better. The results were great, I could really tell a difference. I usually have very sensitive teeth but had no problems with this kit. I am very satisfied and am actually going to order another one for the future.</li>
            <li> I have used teeth whitening strips before for teeth cleaning but I was looking for something different as I was not happy with the strips. As I was browsing the internet, I came across this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I must say that I was very pleased after using the product. It was quick and easy to use and worked better than the strips. Also, you don&#x27;t have to take special appointments to visit the dentist when you can conveniently do it from the comfort of your home. It is also very economical to use. I would highly recommend this product. My family also really likes it and they can see instant results. I have recommended this product to my friends too and they are thankful to me after seeing the results. I would highly suggest you go ahead and try this product as you have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. At first I was skeptical, having tried several other &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; products on the market that promised me glowing pearly whites. I never found the results that I wanted, I almost gave up until a friend recommended Brilliant HD to me. I drink a lot of coffee and regular baking soda didn&#x27;t seem to do the trick to remove stains. I am so happy with this product. I definitely noticed a difference in my teeth, after one use. It&#x27;s great.  I give this 5 stars, it does what it says it will and I noticed a change in the first week of using this. For the price, I feel I got more than the value. This product lives up to it&#x27;s promise :) :)</li>
            <li> I have used Brilliant HD before and it worked great.  It only took a few days for me to see results.  I stopped using it after I was satisfied with my white teeth and my teeth stayed white for over a year, but I was brushing after every meal and didn&#x27;t drink much Soda anymore.  I did drink a lot of Starbucks though.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also doesn&#x27;t cause your teeth to ache/hurt while using it.  I have used other teeth whitener and somehow those cause my teeth to ache a little when I use them.  If you want white teeth I&#x27;d recommend to use this product first to help whiten it, remember to brush after every meal, use mouthwash, and try to cut back on Soda.  It worked for me.  All in all, this is a good product for whiter teeth and I believe it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a whitening kit like this one before! This kit is highly effective and works to get the stains off your teeth. Within days you will see that your teeth are whiten and you will be looking like a full brand new person. The treatments are very easy to do then more other whitening systems. This kit is very professional and you can see results in little then 15 minutes. I like how the gel is enamel safe and good to use on your teeth. I would buy this again and I like how it is affordable.</li>
            <li> I kept refusing to get braces for years because I wanted to avoid the ugly metal, and my teeth were straight already. There were just a few changes that weren&#x27;t really noticeable to other people but it made me self conscious. I decided finally since I want perfect wedding photos to get the braces. I got them off earlier this year, and due to them I have some stains on my teeth. Like some of the issues before I got them this has also made me self conscious, so I decided to have me teeth whitened.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to pay a whole lot of money to a specialist so I decided to try a kit instead. After reading all of the reviews, I was still a bit skeptical but I decided to try it anyway. There has been so much improvement I am really happy with the progress and cannot wait to be completely finished. I love my smile again!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after 2 days!</li>
            <li> My top teeth were already pretty white, but the bottom ones were quite stained. I am a smoker and occasionally drink red wine and coffee, and have had fillings on the bottom row. So, the bottom was pretty bad looking. I saw a commercial for Brilliant HD that said it removed stains below the surface and decided to give it a try. The price is fantastic, I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips and had ok results, but this was much better. Yes, it takes some time (4 twenty minute bleachings with a 10 minute wait period in between) but overall I found it pretty convenient. I just picked a day where I could clean and watch TV and it was really easy. The results were great, I could really tell a difference, especially on my bottom teeth. I know it says it doesn&#x27;t whiten dental work, but even the teeth with stained fillings seemed much brighter. Also, I usually have very sensitive teeth but had no problems with this kit. I made an effort to only use as much of the gel as necessary, didn&#x27;t go overboard, as per the instructions. I am very satisfied and am actually going to order another one for the future.</li>
            <li> I have been drinking coffee for a number of years now and tried many whitening products and none come close to BRILLANT. Great name for a great product I might add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends and family all asked if I had my teeth professionaly whitening and were surprised when I said, I did not. I saved hundreds of dollars using BRILLANT HD. A++++ all the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly endorsed by me!!! :)</li>
            <li> As a coffee drinker, this product has worked wonders for me. I have tried numerous toothpastes, mouthwashes, and mouth guards all claiming to assist in the tooth whitening process, however, none have been as effective as the Brilliant HD Deluxe Whitening Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using the kit, my teeth had become a stained yellow color that was impossible to hide. Up against my pale face, my teeth looked like they had been colored by a yellow marker. Working in sales, confidence is everything. Overtime I had become extremely self conscious of my yellow teeth that my confidence was beginning to waiver. Nunutrient&#x27;s whitening kit did wonder&#x27;s for my teeth and solidified my confidence. Not to mention, the Amazon discount is extremely generous on this product.</li>
            <li> BEST TEETH WHITING PRODUCT EVER</li>
            <li> Thank you for this teeth whitening kit. After only 3 days, I noticed a visible difference in the whiteness of my teeth! This product is at a great price point, costs way less than teeth whitening would be at a dentist office and is every bit as effective. Great seller!</li>
            <li> I should have checked the one star reviews before buying. I learned my lesson. This is totally fake. All the other high reviews are fake. Please don&#x27;t fall for this scam like I did.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product to see if it would make a difference and to my surprise it works great. In just a few weeks my teeth are very white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid now with my teeth yellowing as I age because I have this Brilliant HD to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> People are really complimenting my smile. I use this product only twice a week but it has great results for me. Thanks Brilliant Hd.</li>
            <li> I did not have any sensitivity issues so I used daily for over 2  weeks and saw no change. I can not speak to the forms as I used my invisalign. Waste of money. ;(</li>
            <li> I already had pretty white teeth, but, needed some perfecting to get them pearly white! This kit absolutely got the job done just as I needed it! I even have a picture to prove it! Look at how bright my teeth are looking! I love it! Thanks NuNutrients! Great kit!</li>
            <li> Being a smoker forever, I was happy to see this teeth whitener in a gel form.  It is very easy to use and not messy at all!  It is amazing that my teeth are this white.  I had not smiled for years cause of my stained teeth.  This awesome product brought my smile back! Thank You!</li>
            <li> After having purchased several different whitening kits from the store, I didn&#x27;t hold out a lot of hope for this one. My teeth were in desperate need of some whitening after decades of stains. Other products have left me disappointed and with the same dull, yellowness. I could tell the difference in my smile after just a single use. However, there was some burning but not so bad I had to stop using it. I have sensitive teeth so it might not be as noticeable for others. The results were dramatic so it is worth some discomfort. I have found my go-to product for whitening now.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results! My teeth are noticeably a couple shades whiter. It was easy and comfortable to use. I have tried others in the past and I would definitely buy this one again, especially for this price. I recommend it, its a quality product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly. Well for my smile :).... After the first use my teeth were pearly white. It was completely worth the money, and more if you ask me. Seeing that I&#x27;ve found this product to work for me, I will defintely be sticking to it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazingly easy to use teeth whitening system that you can use at home without going to the dentist and paying exorbitant fees.  It comes with everything you need - syringes, mineralization gel, teeth molds and a moldable tray.  All in one small box.  I must admit I have never used teeth whiteners whether they be store-bought or from the dentist.  My teeth are not super white, but I don&#x27;t smoke so they aren&#x27;t quite as bad as smokers teeth.  But after seeing the results from just a few treatments I am a believer in this kit!  This is also great for people who don&#x27;t have insurance (like me) because you can get the same grade products that the dentist would use for a very small cost.  It only takes about 15-20 minutes to do one treatment, and you can do it on your own schedule.  The packaging leaves a bit to be desired as it did not look sterile when arrived and the components were not contained as you would get at the dentists office.  Even though after using it I am happy with the results and it is a great product which is why I gave it 5 stars.  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> My aunt got this and she let me try it out. I have fairly white teeth, but after trying the kit out for a few weeks, I can definitely see a change in whiteness in my teeth making me feel more confident to smile. I plan on using this for a while to keep my teeth white shiny.</li>
            <li> One of the best whitening products on the market! I have this as well as the one with improved tray(the trays fit better for my not-so-perfect teeth than any other brand!) and love them. The whitening product is the same though. It makes a huge difference and I recommend it constantly!</li>
            <li> Good deal for the money! I had paid hundreds of dollars at the dentist&#x27;s office for something I could have done myself with this, and it seems to have produced the same results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was very easy to work/do, and the tray molds to you mouth easily with heat.  The gel did not taste funny, and I like that it was safe for enamel.  It also takes less time to use than the whitening strips.  Whitening strips take 30 minutes each treatment.  This takes 15-20. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I must admit I was always embarrassed of my teeth because they always had a yellowish tint over them. I applied it and within a couple of weeks my teeth transitioned from yellow to an off white. Definitely recommend to anyone looking to whiten their smile.</li>
            <li> Tray system does not waddle around with nonsense and leaves your mouth feeling molded and I can fit it into my mouth easily. Love it. Simple and deserves your attention.</li>
            <li> This product is so much better than the other at-home teeth whitening kits. NuNutrients include heated trays that conform perfectly to the shape of my teeth. After only a few days I started to notice a big difference in the coloring of my teeth. You should see my before-and-after photos! I am so much more confident now when I smile. I love showing off my pearly whites.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this whitening kit is the real thing, and I cant believe how affordable it was to receive great whitening results. The molding directions were very easy to follow, and even easier to use. I am a coffee drinker and have been drinking coffee for years, I thought my teeth needed some serious whitening and I came across this product, after about I few days of use, I was totally amazed at how much brighter my teeth looked. I am very much in LOVE!!! with this product and will continue to use it until I receive my desired result. I am happy to have found such a great whitening product!! (Thankfully, now I do not have to give up coffee). :)</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and will update this review after I finish it. SO FAR SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> I am smiling from ear to ear! This product did exactly what I expected it to do in an adequate amount of time. I was suffering from ugly yello stains on two front teeth and was in desperate need of finding a affordable solution. My friend had referred me to this product and I thank her so much. I was patient and received excellent results!</li>
            <li> I could only leave it on for a few minutes less and it seems to be okay for me. After just few minutes I see big difference on my teeth and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to use it so I used a little bit at a time, but still works so I try the recommended amount and that&#x27;s when I saw how brilliant my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I will choose this product over branded ones because the price is way cheaper but it works the same as those branded one. I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well and easy to use. I like it better than the strips.</li>
            <li> As a coffee drinker and cigar smoker, my teeth have been stained to shades of yellow and are not the way I want my teeth to look.  I purchased Brilliant HD- Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit about 4 weeks ago and I have been really satisfied with the results.  After the first week I noticed the deep yellow stains being lifted, my teeth were already looking more attractive.  After four weeks, I am finally starting to see my teeth the way they used to be years ago.  Best of all, it&#x27;s easy to use and much more affordable than going to a dentist for a cleaning and harmful bleaching.</li>
            <li> Definitely irritated my teeth, the mold taste awful, and didn’t hold long.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 3 times now, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with gum sensitivity so far. I think it&#x27;s been working well and I can see my teeth are a lot whiter. I&#x27;ll keep using it until I get to the desired point.. but I can&#x27;t do this everyday... will probably just do it two to three times per week.</li>
            <li> Avoid this product at all costs. I bought it without reading the 1-star reviews, so I was not aware that this was full of fake 5-star reviews. I tried the product and it did absolutely nothing. I know I cannot return it, so I&#x27;ll just have to try to forget about the fact that I got scammed.</li>
            <li> I have two words, &amp;#34;amazing product&amp;#34;! The Brilliant HD Whitening Kit has made my teeth whiter than my dentist ever could. What is even more impressive is the low cost of this product. I must admit that I am a bit meticulous, albeit obsessive, about having white teeth. Over the years, I have tried dozens of products and none of them come close to Brilliant HD. Those who have tried whitening systems will attest that molding trays can be a huge headache. Not these ones, they fit nicely and they actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying Brilliant HD, my teeth were noticeably whiter in a few days. I have been using the product for about a month now and I have had friends compliment me on my teeth and even had one of my closest friends ask if I had bleached them - incredible! If you want to have shiny white teeth every day, I would strongly recommend purchasing Brilliant HD. Why? Because it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s easy, and best of all, it actually works!</li>
            <li> I  wasnt exactly sure this product would work as it says, because i had not heard of the brand before but it works pretty well.  Cleans and whitens, your teeth feel like new and shiny after using it the first time, you can really feel the diference.</li>
            <li> I have been worrying about stains on my tooth for many years together. I take at least 3 to 4 coffee and 4 to 5 tea per day. When I contacted my doctor for treatment, he gave me a very big course that will take 2 months for the treatment to be effective. But I have recently heard about the Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening kit from my friend who recommended me strongly to go for it. Though I was not fully satisfied with his recommendation, I wanted to give a try. Next day I placed my order in Amazon. I started using the kit and I was feeling &amp;#34;OMG!! It is working and is fantastic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get more invitations for parties which I often reject. One of the main reason behind this rejection was just my tooth color. Always I had thought people should not observe my tooth. And after trying out Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening, I had a very nice feedback that has made me accept all my invitations for parties, outings etc. I am really thankful to sellers and Amazon for listing out this product. I was also very happy about the Amazon free delivery.</li>
            <li> I have pretty white natural teeth according to my dentist, but I’ve always wanted whiter. NU2 Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit definitely made my smile brighter than before.  The kit comes with 2 10 ML syringes, 2 mouth trays 1 for upper and 1 for lower teeth, try case, and remineralization gel.  The instructions are pretty straight forward.  You will see results in  no time.</li>
            <li> Was much harsher than expected. Had to discontinue use because it was making my teeth to sensitive.</li>
            <li> I flashed her a smile and it looked like she was having a bad day, but she smiled back. Maybe it didn’t have that much to do with how white my teeth were, but I felt more confident because of how white my teeth are now. Great product.</li>
            <li> I used the q tip method in some of these reviews. Instead of putting the gel in trays I rolled a q tip into the gel and applied it directly to my teeth. You can’t do that with strips because they are on strips and you can’t separate them. I find this method is useful if your teeth are sensitive to this sort of thing and it’s very easy for me to control. Recommended.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive dial it back. Personally I had no problems so I did it for a while every other day. The results were great for me but eventually I kind of also dialed it back because the returns were diminishing. I still keep it up but maybe only twice or once a week. I still credit Shine for making my teeth white though.</li>
            <li> Nothing short of excellent. Teeth are returning to their pre-coffee days. Spending a few dollars versus hundreds on teeth whitening at the dentist is worth it.</li>
            <li> There’s this new system with Brilliant HD and I just bite down and it doesn’t fall out. If the strips worked out I bet they would make my teeth look good like they do now. I swear my teeth are three shades lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product. My teeth had some stains that would not go away with daily brushing! I was always embarrassed of smiling and showing my teeth. Now after using this product I feel confident to smile without being worried about my teeth. It does not take long to notice results unlike those other products that takes weeks or even months. I definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to whiten their teeth without waiting long to notice results.</li>
            <li> I don’t know why the major companies are ignoring this style, because it’s much easier for me to apply this than other types of products. Simple to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been embarrassed by the color of my teeth, I used to smoke and drink a lot of coffee for twenty years and it left me with a very unpleasant smile. I&#x27;m always afraid to smile in photos cause I don&#x27;t want to be reminded how ugly my smile is. I don&#x27;t have the money to have my teeth whitened at the dentist, so when my sister mentioned Brilliant HD&#x27;s brand of teeth whitening products, I figured &#x27;What the heck&#x27;. i tried it out a few times and boy was I impressed. My teeth look 20 times whiter and now I&#x27;m smiling all the time. It is such a confidence booster to have great looking teeth and to be able to smile. People are treating me better because I&#x27;m able to smile now and have a better overall attitude. I highly recommend picking up Brilliant HD!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the hassle that I have to go through to use this product. Will never buy again!</li>
            <li> I use it about two or three times a week and my teeth have grown two shades lighter. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the best whitening system that I&#x27;ve tried, I like the tray so much better than the strips (it gets every inch instead of coming out splotchy) You just have to e careful around the gums because they can be irritated a little but other than that good product.</li>
            <li> Caused major sensitivity to my teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s made a difference in the whiteness of my teeth or not.  I found the mould making process awkward. You heat the trays up in hot water and then bite them to make an impression. It&#x27;s really a huge mouthful of plastic or silicone or whatever the tray is made of.  Then you apply the whitening gel to your teeth or into the tray cavities and sink your teeth into the tray.  This wouldn&#x27;t be too hard if it were for a minute or two.  But you must leave it on for 5 minutes the first time. The next treatment can be for 10 minutes if you aren&#x27;t sensitive. The final treatment can be as long as 15 minutes. After the treatment, you apply a remineralization gel to your teeth for 15 minutes. This rehydrates your enamel and decreases sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;The whole time I had the trays in my mouth, I had saliva dribbling out and it was terribly messy, awkward and unpleasant. I think if I were seriously considering whitening my teeth, I&#x27;d see a dentist that specializes in this process.  It&#x27;s not worth the effort or risk of making your teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is the only over the counter teeth whitening kit that has not caused me any teeth sensitivity and you get a lot more product then those other brands as well. I&#x27;ve used it twice already and my teeth look great! Looking forward to an even brighter smile than what I have now.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after the first use!!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and worked like a charm! I started to see slight results right away and now my teeth are definitely whiter than they were before. And great price too!</li>
            <li> Great product. Ive always had stains on my teeth and tried numerous products- needless to say that I was very skeptical. They worked great and really took the stains off my teeth. The Heat-molded trays work well. Would defiantly recommend to anyone who wants visibly whiter teeth. Five starts.</li>
            <li> I find this system to be incredible, it made my teeth shine so white, I was convinced I don&#x27;t drink tea or coffee. It is super easy to use and and super quick, so when you need whiter teeth for that upcoming event or wedding, or whatever this is a great go to system. I prefer it to strips and I like knowing it was made here in the US, as well as the fact that it is the same caliber stuff as the dentist would use, for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> My teeth have a naturally yellow tint, and my lovely wife can&#x27;t stand it.  She forced me to use this kit and threatened serious consequences if I didn&#x27;t.  After all the bickering, I have to admit....she was right...again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one use, I really could tell my teeth were a shade lighter.  I did not feel any sensitivity in my gums or have any side effects.  There was no taste to anything. Everything was easy to use and it didn&#x27;t take long.  And no, my wife didn&#x27;t make me write this.</li>
            <li> Funny how so many people love this product and all on the same few days! It must be a miracle</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as well to whiten my teeth. I think I am really smiling more because I feel more confident in my teeth. Thanks a lot Brilliant HD.</li>
            <li> I use this product three times a week and my results have been pretty great. My teeth are noticeably less yellow and I feel like the enamel is back to being pearly white. You just have to squirt the gel into the mouth piece and stick it in your mouth for a few minutes. It’s a pretty easy system and a pretty good bargain.</li>
            <li> I think this product is good for the price. It’s lower than strips and other things I’ve seen on the market and I have received similar results from all of these things. This competes right there with them. I use it about three times a week which is also similar to other products.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the tray system that this product employs. It’s easy to use and I think that the cost is very competitive with other teeth whitening products. I use it multiple times a week and my teeth are a lot better looking than before.</li>
            <li> with 1 treatment i saw significant whitening, and my teeth were pretty white to begin with. way better than any strips i have used in the past.</li>
            <li> fake reviews , fake kit</li>
            <li> This product is surprisingly effective. I didn&#x27;t really notice a change on the first treatment. However, after trying again, there was a noticeable lift in the color of my teeth. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it has been working and because it came perfectly on time. I just wish that it worked on the first go.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm! I have been drinking coffee for years now and along with a combination of other things, my teeth have become a lot less white. Or should i say, they were less white before I started using this! Im extremely happy with the results, makes me feel better about showing off my smile!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved coffee for as long as I can remember, but it really made me hate my teeth.  I became a master at that closed mouth smile, that really awkward one that kind of ruins pictures.  I tried the whitening strips they sell at my local drug store, but they hurt and made my teeth so sensitive. Luckily, my sister gave me some of NuNutrients&#x27; other products for Christmas.  I found their teeth whitening kit from their amazon page and bought it immediately.  It worked really well and quickly without any pain or sensitivity issues.  This product is consistent with the great quality that I&#x27;ve come to expect from NuNutrients.</li>
            <li> It’s cooling and minty but my teeth end up hurting a little bit. I dialed back to once a week from twice a week and since I had already done a handful of treatments, my teeth were already getting pretty white. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a teeth whitening kit until I stumbled upon this. I thought like, oh well, I&#x27;ll just ake this one, it looks like a good one. And it really was. I&#x27;m very statisfied with my purchase. My teeth got much much whiter very quickly as I was using this. Definitly recommend this fi you are looking for a good teeth whitener kit!</li>
            <li> First use :) I already had relatively white teeth but what I noticed was those little corners hard to get to wasn&#x27;t as white. This product is amazing and the tray you can adjust to your teeth by boiling it which helps so much with those corners! I recommend this to everybody :)</li>
            <li> Scam scam! I want my money back!</li>
            <li> I always have yellowish teeth and im looking for a home remedy treatment for it. When i bump to this product while browsing amazon. I said i give this a shot. When i received the product it is quite good instruction. I tried it right away. It is easy to apply on the teeth. I never feel any sensitivity on my gums. It never taste bad or anything chemicals. One this is just take a lot of time waiting thats why i give it a 4 star, im just not being patient but over all this is a great product. It give my teeth whitening instanly. I will recommend this for a friend</li>
            <li> Started to use this product a few weeks ago, maybe three weeks. I did it every other day and then dialed it back to about twice a week. My teeth have seen results and I am pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  I combed through millions of reviews and finally settled on these.  Just not worth the pain and trouble for very little if any payoff.</li>
            <li> I had sensitivity after using this product 4 days in a row, so I decided to only use it 3 times a week and the sensitivity went away. It really works! You&#x27;ll like the results just be careful not to over do it.</li>
            <li> The minty aftertaste was a nice touch-- Ill use this product again in a few months to continue to make my teeth shine. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Love it.</li>
            <li> The tray fits right in your mouth and it’s very comfortable. Great product and its very effective to me.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product if you want amazing teeth. Very few people are mega wealth and can afford steady laser teeth whitening, even with Groupon. Now with Brilliant HD Deluxe whitening kit, you can have the next best thing! So apply it every day for a period of 15 days. Do not over do it with the hope of &amp;#34;faster&amp;#34; results. So relax, and allow this product to work its​ magic. Rest assured, this product will not hurt the enamel of your teeth. You are able to whiten safely. So totally buy this product if you&#x27;re aiming for awesome results!</li>
            <li> The first thing I would like to say good about this kit, is the price. The price compared to the other Kits I&#x27;ve seen around is very low. And that&#x27;s always a plus, especially for the fact that it comes with two trays, when normally I can only find them with one. The gel is fantastic, and within a couple of days I was already able to tell a difference in the shine of my smile.</li>
            <li> i think it whitens my teeth.</li>
            <li> This system works! The moldable trays are so much better than strips at holding the gel right where it is needed. It works fast! I could see a difference after only one treatment. This was so easy and gave me the whitening boost I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was pretty impressed with this whitening kit.  The trays fit very comfortably and do not bother my gums.  I have sensitive gums and the gel did not seem to irritate me at all.  I have tried other whitening kits from my dentist and they all have made my gums break out.  I was able to keep the trays in for the full time without any discomfort.  The best part of all, my teeth a noticeably whiter.  I have used the product three times and see a huge difference.  I drink a ton of coffee and tea so my teeth were pretty stained.  I would definitely say that this product works better than more professional grade whitening kits.  I would highly recommend this product, especially now that the holidays are around the corner!</li>
            <li> After nearly ruining my teeth with those old crest white strips... My enamel is basically gone and teeth are beyond sensitive&#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt; My dentist told me about Brilliant HD and how it&#x27;s isnt a health hazard! He said he reccomends all his patients who are serious about that white smile but have a little harder time getting there.&lt;br /&gt; I honestly love this product and whether you buy it or not- I&#x27;ll be a lifelong customer. It&#x27;s so difficult to find something for a good price that ACTUALLY works....! Just thought I owed them a little review for making me so happy and also for not being a waste of money. Haha!</li>
            <li> I have done many teeth whitening kits in the past, none of them worked!&lt;br /&gt;I was truly amazed at this when I got the results.&lt;br /&gt;I bought so many before I&#x27;m so great full for this!&lt;br /&gt;Hopoe you all good luck with this too!</li>
            <li> Burns gums if they drip onto gums. Turn them white.</li>
            <li> Yellowing teeth is a part of life. Get used to it. But to battle it, we have weapons. This product here is good for that and it has helped me a lot. My teeth are a lot whiter than when I started using it and I am very happy with the results. Give this one a try and you may be writing a recommendation on here next.</li>
            <li> I, too, was pulled in by the positive reviews. I will sort by verified purchase as well, moving forward. This product is difficult to use, causes much drool and doesn&#x27;t come with enough mineralization gel. It is not worth the money. Please, please save your money and look elsewhere. It&#x27;s not worth it. And I am REALLY very upset by the dishonest practice of the company, putting up fake reviews. I hope the Amazon law suit bites this company in the ass really hard.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money. I can&#x27;t get over how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the effectiveness of this product.  My dentist told me that tea stains teeth worse than coffee and unfortunately I am a tea drinker.  I drink hot tea in the winter and iced tea in the summer and so my teeth pay the price.  I have tried several whitening products but this seems to be the best because my teeth are not sensitive afterwards and I can use it right on my partial bridge.  It&#x27;s a relief not to hide my smile anymore and the results seem to last longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Life ! I love it. Ive always been the biggest Coffee Junkie. Iced, Hot , latte, how ever I can have it :) super bad habit for my poor teeth! Ive tried all different types of whiting kits, but the Brilliant HD Kit is by FAR the best. Its saves me time because its so simple to use and easy to clean up. Its perfect for travel as well !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my teeth are extremely sensitive. Ive found other products damaging on my enamel. Using this product is less harmful on my teeth, so drinking cold or hot things doesn&#x27;t shock my teeth.  I can use this right before a date, and feel confident in smiling and laughing while I&#x27;m out. Im also a contracted model, so nights before any photo shoot or casting, its my best friend. Id tell anyone who&#x27;s looking to have a brighter , stronger smile , this product is the way to go !</li>
            <li> Ok so here&#x27;s the thing. At first I was terrified to try this because my roommate had tried the whitening strips and they burnt his gums. But now I have recently moved to CA and I&#x27;ve begun to do a lot of print and extra work (so I&#x27;m on camera for the whole world to see). I&#x27;ve drank coffee and tea for more than 15 years. I&#x27;m dark complected so the original not whiteness of my teeth was really apparent. But I hunkered down and gave it a try. It didn&#x27;t hurt, I didn&#x27;t get burnt and my teeth look super and super white and shiny.  I smiled when I looked in the mirror. Every time I walk by a mirror I have to check my teeth again. I&#x27;ve even laid low on the coffee and tea. So even though maybe I wont need it that often, I&#x27;d definitely use it again and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone - especially if your smile is your job!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to whiten my teeth with relentlessly, tried so many different things but none works as truly as this. Many products hurt my gums, I am sensitive to it, and simply don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;This kit is fast and easy and affordable. I saw results quickly, there was no pain and no mess. I also noticed so many compliments after a while of using it because the results appeared gradually-- that&#x27;s how you know it is a safe and effective product. It comes with everything you need so you don&#x27;t have to buy extra tools for the kit. It&#x27;s very safe and effective and you can do things while you have the product on.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this and to try it out.</li>
            <li> I find myself smiling a lot more now. Two or three times a week I squirt a small amount of gel into the teeth tray and stick it in my mouth for ten, fifteen minutes. It’s that easy. There is a little bit of setup but that’s fine—my teeth have probably whitened at least two or three shades whiter. My confidence is building more and more each day.</li>
            <li> I think this product is good for the price. It’s lower than strips and other things I’ve seen on the market and I have received similar results from all of these things. This competes right there with them. I use it about three times a week which is also similar to other products.</li>
            <li> I still have bad habits so I need to combat them with a teeth whitener. I found this and it’s part of my routine now. My teeth have become whiter and remained that way. I use it about twice a week and I find it’s not difficult to use this product and the gel actually has a nice pleasant taste to it.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth try dipping the q tip in the gel that comes with this product. It is easier than both the tray system and the strip system, and it has become the way that I apply this formula. I’ve seen good results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This was the best whitening system I&#x27;ve tried so far. Being a student and staying up way later than any human should poses a problem when you don&#x27;t drink energy drinks or coffee. So as a result, my teeth have become embarrassingly  more stained than I like with WAY TOO MUCH black tea. I was nervous to try this, as I&#x27;ve heard that teeth whiteners weaken enamel and could cause tooth sensitivity. I&#x27;ve not noticed any problems with this system. I absolutely LOVE the tray system. It&#x27;s so much easier to use than what to me seems a rather outdated and awkward whitening strip system - Those never did stay on like they should have. But the trays were oh so easy and quick. With 15 minutes here and there, (and while doing homework) I was able to get the beautiful shiny white teeth I&#x27;ve always admired on others... And best yet, I don&#x27;t have to give up my tea-drinking habit. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Professional strength&lt;br /&gt;Low-price compared to going to the dentist&lt;br /&gt;Several treatments in one box&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have not fallen out&lt;br /&gt;No gross aftertaste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;That I didn&#x27;t find it sooner</li>
            <li> Beware of the fake reviews on here and all other NuNutrients products.</li>
            <li> While the wide range of great reviews seem to speak for themselves, I would like to add my two cents on this product. Most importantly, the product truly works, and I saw an improvement of at least two shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better, the trays were comfortable to use, and this was a benefit that I was not expecting. My previous experience with teeth whitening kits had left me with the impression that the experience was unpleasant. That was not the case with the Brilliant HD- Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the price is right, and it is a great value given the great results that you are sure to achieve. I could not recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective. I have always been wary about teeth whitening gels, but I decided to give this a try instead of spending more money on a dentist to whiten them. I noticed some results two days after applying the gel. It does take some time to get your teeth sparkling white, especially for me since I was drinking coffee and smoking. But it is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> After having discolored teeth for a while, i made a trip to the dentist. After going through a deep cleaning, I realized my teeth weren&#x27;t as white as I wanted them. Going over the costs of having them whitened, I realized I would be paying too much. Then I came across Brilliant HD-deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit. After  going through the process, I quickly noticed an improvement. My teeth began to look whiter, and gave me a boost of confidence. I recommended anyone who&#x27;s looking to whiten their teeth without having to go to the dentist for expensive treatment to buy this product. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on Amazon, as most products come as described and are pretty self-explanatory. I am writing this to save other people... DO NOT BUY this product. It&#x27;s deceiving with all the good reviews, but as other comments have noted, it seems those reviews are fabricated. The product came with the box bent in half and already open. Upon opening the box, one of the syringes with the cleaning material had already been used, and the mouth piece had a piece missing, indicating it could have also been used, which is disgusting. I&#x27;m sending it back now. Save your money. Really read these reviews and evaluate their credibility before buying.    Also, \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; is misspelled twice on the front of the box. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I bought this because there were multiple reviews on this product that were 4-5 stars. Nothing below 4 stars. I come back after 2 weeks of using these and most of those reviews are gone and now a ton of negative reviews popped up. Which is good because I thought I was being scammed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the box. IT CAME OPENED AND WAS TAPED SHUT WITH SCOTCH TAPE. The box had multiple misspellings on it.(treamtent?). The trays are too big for your mouth. Your jaw gets tired of clenching them, even after molding them. And finally this product doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have spent 10 dollars less and bought a product that actually worked. Highly dissattisfied, will not order again or even recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I get up at 4am every day, and my only savior is my morning 2 (ok maybe 3 or 4) cups of coffee.  I&#x27;ve been on this routing for the past 9-10 years so obviously my teeth weren&#x27;t in the best shape. I was looking at several different products and came across the Brilliant HD kit.  Seemed easy enough so I went for it. Hand down, best purchase of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel so much more confident now. When I smile for pictures I&#x27;m not embarrassed anymore.  Heck, even my facebook photos are getting more likes!  I would recommend this to anyone.  It has done wonders for me!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this brand, and I have to say, I&#x27;m very impressed with the results. After one treatment, my teeth are several shades lighter... even got rid of stubborn coffee stains. There&#x27;s definitely a visible difference - a week on and I&#x27;m still getting compliments from my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole process is really easy, just follow the instructions on the pack. The trays are sturdy - unlike some other brands, they fit securely in your mouth. The solution seems fairly mild on your teeth, too. I didn&#x27;t experience any stinging/bleeding which is a major plus. And to top it all, it&#x27;s WAY cheaper than Crest white strips.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE. Almost all the  five star reviews for this product are fake. Their timing is within days of each other. I was not as attentive to reviews as I should have been when purchasing this product and used it several times. I noticed pain in my teeth and returned to the reviews to see if others were experiencing similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is potentially dangerous. I don&#x27;t know why there are so many fake reviews or where they are coming from but PLEASE don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did!</li>
            <li> As my teeth were badly stained from years of drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes, I&#x27;ve tried almost all over-the-counter whitening products. This was number 11 in my trials of all teeth whitening products I&#x27;ve tried. So it had the honors of trying to remove all the pesky stains that remained after using the previous 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I cracked open the kit for this one, it appeared to be well-designed and made from high quality materials. Preparing the setup was quite easy and the instructions laid out how to do so in clear detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But clear detail was not only reserved for the instruction manual. Oh no, my friends. Clear detail is what I could see starting to appear on my teeth within 20 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievably, all the pesky stains that seemed almost built into my teeth after 10 other whitening products were astonishly removed! I could not be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for quick, easy and extremely effective whitening, then this is the one you need to get! No, seriously. Just stop looking now, press the purchase button and be done with it. You can thank me later :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. A great dental grade whitening kit that removed all my stains. It saved me a trip to the dentist and money!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier to receive this product. I have been looking for  a good white cleaning system for a little while because I have a lot of build up stains due to drinking coffee often and black. So much better than White Strips. It is also made in the USA which I completely support. For the price, it is a deal and is easy to use. It has taken a lot of stains off of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot more affordable than going to the dentist to get your teeth whitened, which on my budget I cannot afford. It only takes 15 mins to see results and does so much more than whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I drink tons of coffee throughout the day and I used to be quite the smoker. I have been reading reviews like crazy on a whitening kit that would help my teeth not look so dull and yellowish. I don&#x27;t plan on giving up my love for coffee anytime soon, seeing as I am a frequent night owl and need to stay up for long hours. I admit I was a tad bit apprehensive at first trying any at home kits, because I figured the only way to go is to go and have it professionally done. But as I am a full time student, I don&#x27;t have the money to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;  So I tried a couple different products, and I have not had any good luck. No luck until now that is. The other products I tried, I had problems with the trays fitting in my mouth without cutting me, but the trays supplied in here fit just right. And the best part about this product is that there was no nasty after-taste!! My teeth have progressively been getting whiter and I am feeling so much more confident about my smile!! Great product, would recommend to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> My dad and I drink a lot of coffee through out the day and my teeth started to stain I normally used Colgate but that wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth as white as they was .so I searched Amazon and came across Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit I was skeptical at first because most products you get offline that claim to whitening your teeth don&#x27;t work.but with great reviews, free shipping, and only $40  I couldn&#x27;t beat it. I ordered it, it came on time fast shipping I follow direction started using it and it worked my teeth are white no more stains and I still drink my coffee I also got a kit for my dad and not he have a better smile as well. I highly recommend brilliant HD for those who drink coffee,tea,and who want white teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I like the strips much better. I can only leave this on about 5 minutes otherwise I have horrible shooting pains in my teeth/gums. Have only been able to use a few times. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have sensitive teeth. Mine aren&#x27;t that sensitive but they are with this.</li>
            <li> The first night I did this, I forgot to use the blue tube of mineralizing gel. Big mistake:) I guess my teeth ARE sensitive! It&#x27;s been difficult to drink and eat it&#x27;s so bad. I used the blue stuff tonight though and it is so much better. DON&#x27;T FORGET THAT STEP!&lt;br /&gt;Because I have a retainer from having had braces, I used it instead of the trays that came with the kit. I have abnormally small teeth, so if I were to use the big trays that came with it my teeth would be even more sensitive. My only complaint is that I wish the applicator was skinnier and longer so that it would fit the gel into the cavity of the tray better. I had to first apply it to a cotton swab and then into the tray. I received this for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I was sent this kit to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  This kit is super easy to use and I have had great results with it.  My teeth are easily a few shades lighter.  This kit far exceeds anything you would be at the store, in fact, it&#x27;s provides exactly the same results as the teeth whitening gel I get from my dentist but it cost a lot less.  This kit will be added to my arsenal of go-to products and I will continue to use as needed!  As with all whitening products just be sure to keep off your gums as much as possible to avoid gum tenderness.</li>
            <li> This was a first time experience for me. It requires some work to do it correctly. First thing is making the mouth pieces more molded for a better comfort fit. Do this by soaking them in some hot water then putting them into the mount and sucking the air out. Not difficult but do not have the fittings so hot that they burn the mouth. Next put the gel into each mouth piece and insert them. It says to start out at a 5 minute treatment for the first and add 5 minutes to the next 2 consecutive treatments. Total time should only be 15 minutes max with the gel. It is done in this manner to make sure there is no sensitivity or pain to the treatment. Lastly comes the blue gel, this only takes a small amount and spread it like the gel but no where near as thick. This is left in for 15 minutes as well, it helps to make sure the treatment stays longer.&lt;br /&gt;Now what everyone wants to know! Does it work? Yes it does. I could see a very noticeable difference in the first treatment. The next 4 treatments I have done it is not as noticeable but it does keep working on cleaning and whitening teeth. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the mouth pieces having the tabs for soaking them to form them. After I formed mine I removed those tabs. This made it where I was able to close my mouth completely without drool going down my face from the tabs sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to thank Brilliant HD for sending me this to test. I am extremely happy with the results and would recommend this for anyone looking for a teeth whitening system.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I thought it worked way better than the stuff I tried from Walmart. After using half of the kit I can actually see a very noticeable difference and can&#x27;t wait to see how much whiter my teeth get when this is all gone.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent teeth whitening kit that my friend has told me about. He uses it since the dentist recommended some other toothpaste to use and along with this it works great. The kit itself is convenient and easy to use also gets the job done. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am so embarrassed to admit that I was scammed. Like many of the other &amp;#34;one star&amp;#34; users noted, the packaging appears to have been tampered with, the syringes are not sealed in separate packages, and there are numerous misspellings on the package (no instructions other than what&#x27;s on the box.) This was a huge waste of money and there is probably no chance that I&#x27;ll get any kind of refund. I just hope that my review will save others from throwing away cash on a crap product and feeling like chump for not looking more closely at the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mom some months ago and I waited for her results just to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works so well that we have recommended it to several friends of ours.&lt;br /&gt;My mom has had a problem whitening her teeth for awhile. She tried crest whitening strips an also some other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly thought this product would be the same but I started noticing results in about 2 weeks. The color of her teeth has changed significantly!&lt;br /&gt;I would defintely recommend this product for anyone who has a problem with their teeth and not being able to get them white!</li>
            <li> I looked up a teeth-whitening solution that I could administer while I hit the books and found this product.And this porduct is really effective.</li>
            <li> Package came in shambles, instructions are somewhat confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned the gel may cause problems for people with sensitive teeth. I would stick with crest white strips much easier and cleaner without gum irritation</li>
            <li> Lasts forever! Works awesome!</li>
            <li> Pros: Less Drool&lt;br /&gt;Mouth tray seemed sturdier&lt;br /&gt;Larger Syringe vs many smaller ones&lt;br /&gt;Came with Mouth tray holder&lt;br /&gt;Little white applicator tip&lt;br /&gt;Directions came on box.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is better than some. (It&#x27;s inevitable you&#x27;re gonna end up tasting the stuff)&lt;br /&gt;It actually whitens.&lt;br /&gt;Has appropriate time on box.&lt;br /&gt;Remineralization gel comes with kit, but it&#x27;s not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not supposed to be used for longer periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;No Light. (Others, I have bought came with alight, to help achieve faster results, and mentioned mixing with a tad of water helps activate it faster)&lt;br /&gt;Would prefer a brush to apply it directly to teeth, vs putting it in trays.&lt;br /&gt;The mouth trays, while seeming to be of a higher quality than most. Are VERY hard to mold, they are super bluky as well. I had to use my other ones, as these hurt to use.&lt;br /&gt;The small white tip that came with the kit, had no directions for use. It is reasonable to assume, it is so you can apply it in the mouth trays. But, some people may not have figured that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, everything was just thrown in the box, not wrapped up or nothing.  The box was not sealed very well and the numerous amount of misspellings on the box in my opinion is quite unprofessional.It 1 star for the simple fact, It does indeed whiten your teeth. However this sub-par customer service, as well as shady business practices, I will never order from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;product received for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I received this kit about a week ago and that night I immediately put it to the test! After years of drinking coffee I have always noticed my teeth have gotten some minor stains that I was not able to remove with just toothpaste. After my shower and skin care routine I boiled some water and placed the mouth trays in so that they can become soft and I could make them fit on my mouth. I applied the whitening gel with the syringe to most of my front teeth and then put on the tray to keep the gel in place. Since it was my first time trying any whitening kit I only left it on for 5 minutes per the instructions. After the 5 minutes was up I removed the trays from my mouth and rinsed away the gel. I could already see results and I did not feel any sensitivity on my teeth so I was excited for my next treatment. Three days later I again did the whitening treatment at night and slightly increased the time I left it on. Once I rinsed I could see even more whitening happening on my teeth! Most of my stains have diminished and are a lot less noticeably. I did not have any sensitivity or damage to my teeth and I am happy I was able to try this product. I highly recommend this product for anybody looking to have a brighter smile! I got this product free to review but I love my personal results.</li>
            <li> I dont like crest whitestrips (they dont work for me) so i settled on the tray-style option of teeth whitening. Theres a huge spectrum of what you can buy out there, ranging from 15$ all the way up to 150+++. I dont trust the really cheap kits because im sure that they must be made in china. I also dont trust the 150$+ kits because they are fooling the customer on a product that is obviously not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a happy medium which is why i bought it. I look like a celeb now with my white smile!</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening kit is very easy to use. You need just apply the gel and then let the light to do the work.  The fact:  it only takes 10 minutes to do session because I really don&#x27;t like to leave whiteners on for a long time. I am really have sensitive teeth but didn&#x27;t notice any discomfort when I am using Brilliant HD. After the two sessions, I notice big improvement. The directions say I can continue to use the kit to get my teeth whiter and whiter, I will definitely do so.</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t fall for the &amp;#34;teeth whitening kits&amp;#34; because in the past I have found they dont work, but I am so thrilled that I gave Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit a chance! I love coffee and coco, so i&#x27;ll be the first to admit..my teeth do have aged stains on them but with this product it takes away literally years of accumulated stains away with just a few uses. I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> Needed a brighter smile so I started looking for teeth whitening kits. A friend told me about this one that they bought from amazon and sent me the link. I got the kit and in a few days I received my package and started using it. A few weeks later my smile is brighter and more awesome. Definitely check this out.</li>
            <li> My teeth got about 3 shades whiter, which is actually better than I had hoped for. It was a bit clunky to use, but since it worked, I&#x27;m happy with the product. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> The results are long lasting and application is a breeze. The trays fit well and the syringes make this system easier to distribute onto the trays. I use other whitening kits as well, The kit I use depends on what is available when I need to whiten, but I always look for Brilliant HD first. With Brilliant HD deluxe, I only had to whiten my teeth every six months, the results are really long lasting! With other brands I use, I get great results but they don&#x27;t last that long, the max was 3 months. I&#x27;m also addicted to coffee, I have been since I was 17, and Brilliant HD deluxe not only erases the coffee stains, but repels new stains for the 6 month duration it lasts. So I am certain this will work well for smokers as well. I love brilliant hd. Its always my first choice. Works for me!</li>
            <li> Never before have I had this kind of success with a teeth whitening product. I have tried countless other brands and products however this one is the only one that really makes a difference in my teeth. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a noticeably whiter smile!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big coffee drinker, a red wine drinker or a smoker.  It&#x27;s been said that all of this stuff impacts how stained your teeth become.  While my teeth weren&#x27;t &amp;#34;stained&amp;#34;, they weren&#x27;t white - just kind of like a really light beigey ivory.  I hate it so that&#x27;s why I tried the Brilliant HD.  I&#x27;ve done it for three weeks now and I can see the different.  Some people at work have actually mentioned that my teeth are whiter.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.  You just have to become used to working with the trays and then making sure they stick properly to your teeth.  Once you&#x27;ve got that down - and it took me a few tries to get it right, the rest was pretty basic.  There&#x27;s a bit of teeth sensitivity but that&#x27;s to be expected.  All in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> i only used this product once and it bleached my gum and i still feel the sting in my mouth. the chemical is definitely way too strong. regret buying</li>
            <li> The teeth molding part didn&#x27;t really have instructions and it wasn&#x27;t the easiest, but I got the mouth trays made.</li>
            <li> Love it. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the trays. But its working. After I finished the first syringe, I started using the second one as I brush my teeth. Works less because its less time in my mouth. But its OK. Will order again soon. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li> Liked it! Good kit, I only wish my hubby could have used it too with a 2nd set of mouth trays. Ill just have to get another.</li>
            <li> I would pay five times over the cost of this product for the results I experienced. It is simply AMAZING! Using this teeth whitening kit for a week gave me results similar to a trip to the dentist WITHOUT the hole in my pocket! I think my teeth have brightened at least three shades and I&#x27;m only a couple more treatments from having pearly whites! If you&#x27;re hesitant, don&#x27;t be. This kit dominates the others!</li>
            <li> This product works great. I can only use it for about 5 mins at a time, since my gag reflex won&#x27;t allow me to have it in too long. But it&#x27;s still amaZing and worth the money. Better than crest strips for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an addicted coffee drinker and coffee stains and discolored teeth are just some of the disadvantages that come along. One of my friends recommended Brilliant HD teeth whitening kit as a solution to my problem. I took his advise and brought this pack from amazon itself. The product works really fast and it is easy to use. It took me just one weekend day to get pearly white teeth. I&#x27;m really happy to be introduced to this product Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I got this as I was looking for a way to whiten my teeth a little more then they were as I am a smoker and we all know that smoke will discolor your teeth among other things. But I was out looking for a product that was decent on the wallet but also a good product worth the money. After I ordered and received it I tried it and didn&#x27;t think much as it was one of those things where you have to wait after a few applications before any noticeable improvement. Well, after about two weeks I noticed my teeth weren&#x27;t as dull off white looking color, they actually started looking like they should, instead of that obvious light yellow tinge a smoker/coffee drinker can often get from frequent usage/consumption. I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed as it&#x27;s working and I still got quite a bit of the box left to use.</li>
            <li> This kit is fantastic. It completely removes all stains from my teeth, and makes them so white I can almost not believe it! With only two uses of these trays, I have noticed an incredible change in my smile! The price is so much better than going to a dentist, and I could not imagine any better results! The trays are easy to use, and the whitening gel stays put and does not leak into the rest of your mouth, which other products tend to do. The gel also tastes much better than others, fresh and minty! It is such an easy, painless process and my teeth look incredible. I would certainly recommend these trays over all other ones I have tried!</li>
            <li> First time splurging on a whitening kit like this (40 bucks is expensive to me! LOL) but well worth it! Loved the results after 5 weeks!</li>
            <li> This is great teeth whiting.  My teethe looked great after using only once, barb</li>
            <li> I had lots of problems with strips, but I found this tray system easy to use. Stuck it in my mouth to mold it and I’m glad because it’s personalized. It stays in my mouth and I use this product about three times a week with no problems.</li>
            <li> Wish I could have discovered this product a lot sooner. It would have saved my wallets some bucks for a professional . since I have been using it has brighten my teeth more whiter. Love it !!!</li>
            <li> surprisingly easy to put on and I can already see my teeth whitening and it is Lasting me quite a bit. I would totally buy it again when I have money lol</li>
            <li> I think the biggest selling point of this product is the mouth guard. There are people out there (me) who want whiter teeth or some system, but don’t want to stand around trying to stick flimsy pieces of disposable plastic onto their teeth and then mess up and try to readjust them and then it just gets messy and ridiculous. With Shine you just squirt and pop it in your mouth and it’s done. The results have been good too, for me.</li>
            <li> The tray system is good, easy to use. I use product three times a week, I have no problems and my teeth are nicer looking.</li>
            <li> I accidently messed up mouth peices when I put them in the hot water...the water was too hot when I did it so it melted a lot but they still work, great product!</li>
            <li> Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit is a wonderful kit. Getting your teeth whitened can be so costly at the dentist office. This saves me hundreds and I don&#x27;t have to see the dentist to get it done which is a huge plus in my books.  This kit  comes with everything you need - syringes, mineralization gel, teeth molds and a moldable tray everything you would get at the dentist but for way less the cost. I drink a lot of coffee so I was thinking going into this I wouldn&#x27;t be able to lift any stains at all. However, I was wrong! One treatment only takes 15 to 20 mins tops. After two treatments I was able to lift about 5 shades. They look so much better than what they did before. I am so happy and will be using every week!!</li>
            <li> This is the best at home whitening system I have used...results are better than the white strips I&#x27;ve used. The molds are easy to use and treatments of 15 minutes or less give great results! I&#x27;m re-ordering! The first order lasted more than a month.</li>
            <li> Love the way Brilliant HD is effective and simple to use. Also really excited about the quick results! Have a photoshoot in a couple of weeks and really looking forward to having my teeth look as good as can be. Recommend this if you are looking for a product that you will not regret purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time researching tooth whitening, and I tried a couple &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; with NO success, before purchasing Brilliant HD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it&#x27;s so fast. I&#x27;m a mom of 3...so trying to squeeze in time for beauty regimens can get tricky! The trays are comfortable, and the product didn&#x27;t bother my teeth at all. The results were fast too! I will be reordering once I&#x27;m almost out.</li>
            <li> The Brilliant HD Teeth Whitening system is amazing!!! After several failed attempts at whitening both professionally and at home, my teeth have never looked better. The trays mold to my teeth perfectly, which make wearing them so easy and the whole process takes less than 15 minutes a day. I saw results after the first use and achieved my desired results in less than a week! This system saves you time and money and best of all delivers what it promises! I would highly recommend HD Brilliance to anyone. I know this is the only whitening option I will use in the future!!!</li>
            <li> This teeth whitener has to be the best that there is on the market. First off, lets just start by saying it is fairly cheap the price for this item is very reasonable. This deluxe whitner was real easy to use. I would strongly reccomend this. It has made a drastic difference on my teeth. My teeth have never been this white. If you always questioned how to get sparkly perly whites then this is your answer. I wouldnt reccomend anything else. Buy it now! The price is real convenient. Hope you enjoy as much as I did. I cant stress it enough this whitening kit really works!</li>
            <li> So, I decided I would give this product a try. As a student who also works, I tend to live off of coffee to help me stay alert during my day. Downside of that? Staining of the teeth. And I take pride in my appearance and I work in customer service so I wanted to have a good smile to go with my caffeinated, bubbly demeanor. So I tried out this product and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a reasonable time frame. The mold fit well and wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable. My teeth were much whiter in just two weeks! At work people are giving me compliments on my smile now and it just makes me feel better about myself. Not going to lie, I was skeptical because of the price as most whitening kits tend to be higher up there but this was a good bargain. I&#x27;m recommending it to my friends and family now.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee throughout the day so I try to whiten my teeth as often as I can. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and they usually just whiten my teeth a shade or two. Using the Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit though clearly whitened my teeth by several shades! I was so impressed. I can now smile with confidence and I don&#x27;t have to give up my coffee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use and well worth the money especially considering that most other whitening systems cost around the same and do half the job. I love the trays too as I find that they are far superior to the strips. I always felt like the strips just moved the gel around on the front few teeth and did nothing for my other teeth. With the trays and gel that is provided in this kit, I felt like all my teeth were getting coated. I will definitely be purchasing this product again and I recommend it to anyone looking to get what they actually paid for.</li>
            <li> I love how easy and how effective this product is! In addition, it is more affordable than some products that really didn’t do much for me! This whitening kit is so easy to use and it actually works! The instructions are clear and simple and it only took me several days to notice a significant difference! I highly recommend this product because it has done what other whitening products have failed to do for me! I love this product and will pick these over the other ones in the market any day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 14 days. I do NOT see any obvious result . Teeth feel sensitive afterwards. The package of the product doesn&#x27;t look legitimate. made in us</li>
            <li> Like the other 1-star reviewers, I wish I had read the other reviews more closely before purchasing.  I purchased this based on all of the glowing 5-star reviews, which I admittedly did not scrutinize enough to realize they were all fake.  I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and have seen ZERO difference in my teeth.  I will consider this a lesson learned and next time will not be so naïve as to blindly trust the \\&quot;user\\&quot; reviews without further investigation.    Additionally, my box also had misspellings on the front of it.  I don&#x27;t know where the picture of the box they used here came from, but my box says this on the front:  \\&quot;REMOVE YEARS WORTH OF STAINS IN AS LITTLE AS 1 TREAMTENT\\&quot; and \\&quot;TREAMENTS FROM 5 TO 15 MINUTES DAILY FOR UP TO 15 DAYS\\&quot;.  So not only do they not know how to spell \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;, but they can&#x27;t even misspell it consistently!</li>
            <li> The tray system rules. It&#x27;s easy to use and fits in my mouth, because it was made to. You do have to run some hot water over it at first and mold it to your teeth, but after that it makes whitening your teeth a breeze. It&#x27;s really easy and I would recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fake and whoever is bashing this product either has nothing better to do with their lives or works for another whitening company  Anyways.. Here goes. I have been drinking a lot of tea and coffee over the last 2 years and when I looked in the mirror realized I looked more like a bum&#x27;s smile than the guy I had always known..lol. I buy very heavily from Amazon due to living remotely and its been a life changing experience. This product of s one of the real finds. I have had my teeth whitened before professionally. It hurt. For days. This stuff is amazing. I wasn&#x27;t after a lunar landing white..just an upgrade that didn&#x27;t make me look like I had whitening done. It worked. No sensitivity. I am over the top happy. Highly recoemd this stuff. One thing..it has a little micro applicator tip  If you use it on the blue as well as the whitener it&#x27;s a bit difficult to clean for future applications. Wish the had put two in the kit..probably cost a nickel  Anyway..small this ng for such a great product. And no..I didn&#x27;t get it for freeeeeee..I paid full boat. Take the chance you will be happah!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this whitening system!! I&#x27;m a whitening fanatic so my teeth are already pretty white, but my husband... Ughhh... He&#x27;s a smoker &amp; drinker so his teeth... Not so pearly white. This system totally transformed his smile!!! Very impressed with the results for an at home kit! People keep asking where he went (dentist wise) and it was done right at home!!!</li>
            <li> I hardly leave reviews on items I purchase on amazon, but I&#x27;m so disappointed with this one. I received an open box but I still gave it a chance because it might of opened because of the handling of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree to some of the negative reviews here! item seems fake and there are misspellings on the box. How can we trust it if they can&#x27;t even spell treatment right? I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m doing it wrong, but the mouthpiece is too big  even with a couple of tries of molding to a perfect fit. did not work  waste of money.</li>
            <li> This kit does a great job right away.  It is very much worth it&#x27;s price.  I read every single review for every whitener of it&#x27;s type before I bought it.  If you don&#x27;t care to bother to do the same, read no further.  This is the one.</li>
            <li> Product has noticeably whitened teeth somewhat. My teeth were already pretty white and it did still enhance them a bit. But to me the mouth guard technique is quite uncomfortable and saliva just pours out of my mouth so I must do it over the sink. And it leaves a plaque like substance where the gums meet the teeth. It can be removed easily with brushing or flossing but it comes back pretty much daily even when not using the product. Pros and cons to the product.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much tried every brand of whitening trays and strips, they taste horrible, fall off, or just don&#x27;t work. A friend of mine recommended Brilliant HD and I am absolutely in love with them I will never go back to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;The best part about Brilliant HD is that they don&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive. The trays fit well too. I drink a lot of coffee and each time I use the trays my teeth look whiter and better. I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found a whitening product that truly does work!!!</li>
            <li> Noticeable results on first treatment</li>
            <li> I have always relied on the typical whitening strips to give my yellow teeth a bit of neatness.. and I always made sure to use it just before any meeting or party so that  the glow is visible.. A friend of mine suggested to try this kit as he claimed that it gives professional results and the glow doesn’t get lost at all.. I was thrilled as I was highly irritated to use the strips before stepping out every time and ordered it right away… Well, I must say that the results are 100%... The product is very strong… it is extremely quick to whiten and lasts long… Must try!!</li>
            <li> Nice, I have other products then this but this one is way better. It cleans better, it is more premium than others I&#x27;ve seen so far. I would recommend having this then others. Works like very pure, doesn&#x27;t cost that much. Not too expensive. Easy to use, No problems at all after using this. Would recommend if you want some shiny white teeth!</li>
            <li> This product works, I&#x27;ve done about 5 treatments and have seen serious improvement in the whiteness in my teeth. But BE CAREFUL! This stuff is strong and if you get it on your gums it will burn and it even turned part of my gums white for while.</li>
            <li> This has been easy to use and effective. I like that there is an enamel strengthener to use after whitening. It has made short work of coffee stains. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love taking care of my teeth! I brush and floss every day, plus I have a dental scaler and pick to do my at home. So naturally, I want to whiten my teeth for a rather cheap price. The mold gives me a more secure feeling than other white stripes and it doesn&#x27;t leave much mess. Some stripes don&#x27;t hit all parts of my tooth, but the mold gets all of it. The ingredients do not give me tooth sensitivity like other products do. Also, the white last for a while so I don&#x27;t have to do it every few months.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written for anything but this has worked so well I just wanted to put my 2 cents in. I don&#x27;t have much time in the day but it&#x27;s so easy and comfortable to just pop the molds in while I&#x27;m showering and take em out once I&#x27;m done showering. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it worked but once I saw a picture of me from before the treatments WOW there&#x27;s a difference. I was slightly sensitive to the first few treatments but it went away. The one thing is there is not very much of the blue remineralizing gel. Otherwise fantastic product!</li>
            <li> My teeth were stained and needed some serious whitening. I did indeed get results from using this kit. I am satisfied as I have tried other products and nothing was working. I thought I was never going to get whiter teeth ever again. It&#x27;s easy to use so that&#x27;s another plus.</li>
            <li> I am really glad i found this item, i have been trying for years to get my teeth more white. This is an incredible product i have only been using it for a month and i already notice the difference. Its very simple to apply and i dont feel any pain using this product, its the perfect balance between strength and comfort.</li>
            <li> Being a coffee, tea, and red wine drinker I&#x27;m always trying to keep my teeth from getting stained. After trying some products from the store and being sorely disappointed I decided to see what the internet had to offer. This product had such great reviews so decided to try it. I am so happy I did! I finally found something that makes my teeth look brilliant despite the abuse I put my teeth color through!</li>
            <li> I’ve always wanted whiter teeth like some of my favorite celebrities. I love shopping online to experiment with different teeth whitening kits. I decided to try Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit due to all the rave reviews. This is a good home whitening kit that I would recommend if you want a convenient way to remove stains from your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and I can tell you from experience that most whitening processes are harsh on my mouth. It’s pain that I cannot stand for, even at 15 or 20 minutes. But this product works wonders, and I feel like it’s great for people with my condition, which seems to be a lot of people. I recommend it and it was a painless process.</li>
            <li> This Brilliant HD deluxe teeth whitening kit does a great job on your teeth!  It&#x27;s not a trip to the dentist but it does whiten your teeth.  After first treatment I felt my teeth were cleaner and brighter.  This was the first time I&#x27;d used a teeth whitening kit before .  I can say it was a success.&lt;br /&gt;  Getting started I began having flashbacks of my childhood days when I had to have retainers in my mouth overnight with fluoride treatments.  First you heat water to boiling in the microwave and after the water has boiled put the retainers into the water.  Usually 5 to 10 seconds.  I left them in there the whole 10 seconds. This softens the molds so they can shape to your teeth.  One for your top teeth and one for your bottom teeth. Then you put the clear gel in the retainer or directly on the teeth indentions. Try not to overfill tray or get it on the gums.  Just to prevent potential sensitivity.  I started out for the 5 minutes.  Then worked my way up to the 15 minutes.  I had no sensitivity to the gel at all.  It was kind of bubbly.  After that&#x27;s done you rinse the trays and apply the blue gel. You do the same thing with the blue gel.  The blue gel rehydrates the teeth.  You match the time you spent on whitening and do same amount of time rehydrating.  After doing this I like to brush my teeth with just water and rinse my mouth real well.  It&#x27;s very simple.&lt;br /&gt;  After the first treatment my teeth felt cleaner and looked whiter.  I recommend this product if you struggle with teeth that are tarnished from tea and coffee and other food and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;  This product arrived to me quickly and was packaged safely.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.  As always, my words and opinions are 100% my very own.</li>
            <li> It did the job but It was nothing special. The set was straight forward and had a minty taste. Nothing to complain about though</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and I have tried several other teeth whitening stuff previously but nothing works as great as Brilliant HD- Deluxe Teeth Whitening kit. I started feeling the difference immediately after first use. The best part is that it is much cheaper than other similar teeth whitening formula and results are just great. Believe me, it will save you lot of money and hassle of visiting your dentist for teeth whitening treatments. I recommend Brilliant HD - Deluxe Whitening kit even for sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m in Love...Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening is awesome. I received almost instant results. After years of smoking and drinking colas my teeth were stained and yellowing.  After as little as two treatments I saw noticeable results. Thanks your are Brilliant.</li>
            <li> 15 minutes a day for two weeks is all it took to get rid of years of smoking and coffee stains. Results were noticeable after the first treatment, and two weeks later, after finishing up the treatments, my teeth were way cleaner then they have been in a long while.This kit is simple to use and the heat molded mouth pieces made all the difference in terms of comfort. Even though it uses a Peroxide based formula, I didn&#x27;t notice any discomfort or increased sensitivity while using it. I liked the comfort and ease of use offered by this kit and was very pleased with the results. I&#x27;ll be giving this another try in a few months, for sure.</li>
            <li> There is so much to love about this whitening gel set, including the speed of whitening. I was amazed at how quickly years of neglect washed away from my teeth. The aging of my teeth made for yellowish even tan areas on my teeth, but in a few uses I have white teeth again.&lt;br /&gt; Also loved that I needed no lights or things, it was simple to do with the syringes of whitening gel.&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the ones on the market, these are simple to use and quite effective. It was much cheaper than going to the dentist for a whitening treatment and convenient as well.</li>
            <li> This product also is a great one that really works! Professional cleanings, and whitenings cost lots of money. This product works and it&#x27;s so hard to find kits that actually do the job right.  NuNutrients Brilliant HD deluxe whitening kit is perfect and has all the bells and whistles just like in a dental office.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This made my teeth white so fast! Ive been a smoker for a few years now, and its helped my smile go from dull to bright! I was surprised with how fast it really works! I would tell all my friends about this.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY.  At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d recommend to anyone I know and like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two reasons, I would never again buy this product and I would strongly encourage others to look elsewhere for better and more legitimate products.  After using this a few times I threw the product away, something I almost never do since I don&#x27;t like to waste anything, especially when I&#x27;ve spent a decent amount of money on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason One:  I did not like using the Brilliant HD - Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit.  I thought a tray system (as opposed to strips) would be a good idea because it would really coat my teeth and be effective.  I don&#x27;t know if other tray systems are better, but this one was uncomfortable and potentially hazardous.  The trays molded to my teeth, so that part worked fine, but they were bulky in my mouth and caused me to drool excessively.  I had to either stand over the sink or have a bowl to spit into and tissues to wipe my mouth.  The one time I thought, &amp;#34;Ugh, I can&#x27;t spit right now, I&#x27;ll just swallow a little,&amp;#34; I ended up burning my throat and vowed never to try that again.  Even when I was vigilant about spitting regularly, because the upper tray presses against the pallet and the excessive salivation causes the product to spread and be trapped by the tray, my pallet got burned each time I used the product.  After two uses I started looking into whitening strips instead.  But I decided to try a third time, and to read other reviews beforehand to see if there were any good suggestions.  In short, there weren&#x27;t, and what I read led me to the second reason I would caution everyone against buying this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason Two:  I doubt its legitimacy and am not sure that it&#x27;s safe.  First, it lists carbamide peroxide as an active ingredient, which other products use as well, but no where does it list the concentration.  Not on the box, not on the website.  Is it 16%? 22%? 44%?  I have no idea, and that&#x27;s scary.  I would never have bought sucha product if I had realized that it didn&#x27;t list this important health/safety information.  I was swayed by the high level of average reviews, but now I think that many of those 5-star reviews must be fake.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there are mis-spellings on the box, something that doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence.  The box lists the physical address and a website for the product, but no where does it give a phone number, nor any instructions on how to reach customer service.  Whether this is a question of legitimacy or not, I nonetheless find it problematic that I can&#x27;t contact a human being to ask questions about the ingredients or usage, never mind to ask for a refund.  So then today I went on the website for more information.  All of the links lead to the same place...a list of products.  Even the &amp;#34;Contacts&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;About Us&amp;#34; pages only list products, and not any contact information.  There&#x27;s a Facebook logo that also doesn&#x27;t lead anywhere, so I tried looking for the company directly through my Facebook page, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to exist there either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I am much too wary of this product to ever use it again.  If I could complain to the company, I would, but the company probably isn&#x27;t based in the U.S. and doesn&#x27;t have any means of contacting them.  It burned my gums, caused excessive salivation, burned my pallet, doesn&#x27;t list the strength of the active ingredient, and doesn&#x27;t appear to be made in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different product.</li>
            <li> The gel really hurt my gums</li>
            <li> I only used this kit 3 times.  It is great the trays mold to the shape of your teeth, but I found them to be very bulky and it wasn&#x27;t comfortable to do the treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice much of a whitening effect but I didn&#x27;t try it for very long. I also didn&#x27;t love having to do two rounds, one whitening and one the protective gel. I usually have tooth sensitivity with whitening products, and I didn&#x27;t have this issue with this kit, so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing was a bit cumbersome and uncomfortable which is why I stopped using it. My two cents.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for anybody who wants whiter teeth instantly. I&#x27;ve tried many products to get that hollywood smile, and I finally have it because of this product. I&#x27;m very pleased about how easy it is to apply, and how quickly I began to notice a difference. I use this all the time now, and am very happy with this purchase ! Buying this product you will get a few shades whiter teeth, giving you that movie star smile you always dreamed of ! This is amazing, and I am so happy that I found this product, and wish I had found it sooner. No amount of home remedies, bleach or over the counter products gave me the smile I wanted until Brilliant HD. I smoke a lot, and since using this product I have gotten rid of most of my stains, and have not seen them come back since. It&#x27;s affordable, brilliant, and everything you could ask for to obtain a great smile all in one kit.</li>
            <li> Four years ago, I went to the dentist to get my teeth whitened. Although I was happy with the results, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the cost, as I had to pay out of pocket due to lack of medical insurance! Fast forward of being on a fixed income, I knew I could&#x27;nt afford more whitening treatments, so I began researching for different methods on my own. Usually, I brush my teeth with Ultra Brite toothpaste, but it never really produces a pearly white smile. My research included Colgate Optic White, but again, I just did not get the results I wanted. One day, I had been shopping on Amazon for my usual collection of reality tv shows dvds, and deviated to the home health and beauty section. There, I stumbled upon the HD Whitening- At a cost of only $39.99, I figured I had nothing to lose, compared to other products. After purchasing and receiving the product within days, quickly I followed the kits instructions, placed the trays in my mouth daily and began noticing a rapid change! I got my pearly white smile!  ,</li>
            <li> I do not have dental insurance, and this product saved me an expensive trip to the dentist! This was my first experience using a home whitening kit. The instructions were clear and easy to understand, and I had no issues using the kit. The results definitely exceeded my expectations, as I drink soda on a daily basis, which has really caused some discoloration over the years. I bought this kit before being a bridesmaid in a friend&#x27;s wedding, and the photos came out great! I would definitely purchase again, and next time I will take before and after photos!</li>
            <li> This is a great teeth whitening kit for the price! Really easy to use and I got two shades whiter. I&#x27;m a smoker and a heavy coffee drinker so I will definitely be using this again to help combat those tough stains!</li>
            <li> The molds are easy to use and treatments of 15 minutes or less give progressive results. The pill itself is really easy to swallow. Very highly recommended and I&#x27;m going to continue to use</li>
            <li> I have a great smile but I drink a lot of coffee. It keeps me going but because of that I have off white teeth and I&#x27;m self confident about my smile. Every since I&#x27;ve tried this amazon product my teeth have been as white as snow and I still drink my cup of joe every morning. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I have the brightest smile from this whitening kit!! It&#x27;s super easy to use (no messy gels, just trays to put in your mouth) and super fast! I put the trays on for 15 minutes and it had better results than a gel I had to leave on for 30 minutes. I drink a lot of coffee and one use of this practically erased those stains. 2 uses and they were gone! I have very sensitive teeth too and there was no burning, or discoloration on my gums which is always a huge worry. I definitely recommend this! :)</li>
            <li> the best thing about this for me was that it actually molds to your teeth. I&#x27;ve tried so many different teeth whiting products and none of that have been able to mold to my teeth as well as this one, which is amazing because it&#x27;s not blotchy! It doesn&#x27;t take long for it to take effect either, i can pop in the gel at night before i go to bed, answer last minute emails, take out the trash, etc. and take it out and i&#x27;m done, and after a few days i already started seeing a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and its ease of use. It molds to my face so it will not slip off, similar to some other products like whitening strips and whatnot. Nice product.</li>
            <li> My confidence has been boosted maybe five fold. My teeth look great and I am glad because I have always taken good care of them but yellowing is just a natural thing with age. This product really works great.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it said it would on the box. My teeth look great. Very Happy.</li>
            <li> It is IMPERATIVE that you DON&#x27;T leave the trays in the cup of hot water longer than instructed--not one second more. This is to make them flexible enough to mold them to your teeth prior to first-time use. Unfortunately, I held mine in the hot water too long because its shape completely collapsed and it stuck to itself rendering it unusable. I tried to put the gel on my teeth and holding my lips apart but you don&#x27;t want to know about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this is a fine product. And mostly due to my own errors, this product did not work for me and was money down the drain. Also does the company HAVE to use syringes to apply the gel? That&#x27;s kind of intimidating. Wouldn&#x27;t a tube work just as well?</li>
            <li> Most reviews here are fake. Be sure to filter by verified purchase.</li>
            <li> Buyers beware. I returned the product for refund when I noted the misspelling of Treatment (Treamtent) on the product box, other misspellings (Brialliant) on their websites, and the many obviously fake reviews. This raises questions about the legitimacy of the product and doubts in my mind whether it was made in the USA as claimed.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product.  Someone else pointed out than many of the reviews are fake, and I believe that to be true.  I bought this because many reviews said this product does not create any sensitivity, and it got such a high score with over 80 reviewers.  I use a whitening product every 2 years or so, and this is the worst product I have used to date.  I have tried aquafresh, crest 3d, and a similar tray/gel system in the past, and never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system has a few flaws.  First, the trays are just too big.  I have a big mouth, my wife tells me all the time, but especially the lower tray is just way too big.  I actually took some sharp scissors and cut away some of the excess plastic, and it worked better.  My main complaint is the sensitivity.  I am not exactly sure how much of the product to apply to the tray, it just says to use a small bead for each tooth.  The first 4 times I used this, it was fine, and I saw some reasonable results.  The last time I used it, I had just flossed.  Not sure that should make a difference, or if I used too much of the gel.  I noticed immediately that my gums were burning, but I have a decent tolerence for pain, and decided to stick it out for ten minutes.  When I took the trays out, my gums had turned white where the gel had touched.  Very painful, I think it killed my gum tissue.  It is two days later and i haven&#x27;t used it again, and my gums are still more sensitive than normal.  Not sure if I will try it again or throw it away.  Either way I am dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Brilliant HD Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit is a easy to use, inexpensive, gentle on your gums. Brilliant HD is an inexpensive dental grade whitening solution that is very easy to use, minus the mess. It removes years of unwanted stains within a few treatments. Its worth every penny to remove those stains, so you can smile bright with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its time to experience the Hollywood smile without paying thousands of dollars on in office dental treatments. I have tried several whitening kits, well my search is over. There nothing like having a bright smile that fills a room. Start enjoying your new smile sooner than later, I have. I recommend Brilliant HD :-)</li>
            <li> The tray is a pain to use its hard, and every time you want to use the whitening you have to put the tray in hot water to form to your teeth. I would of rather have bought crest whitening strips ...plus I haven&#x27;t seen any difference... Waste in money.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest whitestrips in the past and they have always affected my already sensitive teeth. This product feels much better on the sensitivity and I have noticed my teeth look two shades whiter after only my third application of this. This has been working wonders for my smoke stained teeth.</li>
            <li> This product bleached my gums!!!! The trays do not stay in place, nor do they conform to fit my teeth at all. HORRIBLE product and a complete waste of money!!</li>
            <li> My smile is more confident, people are noticing. It is 100 percent thanks to this product. I use it about twice a week and I have no issues at all. Good product. Perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scam. Doesn&#x27;t work, horrible quality</li>
            <li> It ACTUALLY WORKS!  Not just a little..not &amp;#34;&amp;#34;well..sort of &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;  I took the trays out thinking AS USUAL of course there will be NO difference just like every other product ive spent ALOT of money on.....but. &#x27;wait, no sh*t ! Really !!!  My teeth are actually white and VERY white at that!&lt;br /&gt;  THANK YOU PRODUCT MAKER FOR PUTTING A LITTLE MONEY INTO YOUR PRODUCT SO THAT it &amp;#34;actually&amp;#34; does what it claims to do.  We are all sooooo very ripped off all the time on EVERYTHING in this world from companies being as cheap as they possibility can.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Works really well. I recommended this to my sister and she loved it too and bought it twice. Have been a long time user. Really whitens and does what it says. Brilliant HD-Deluxe Teeth Whitening Kit is also very safe I have never experienced any side effects. I am very glad I found this. I will continue using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try to whiten my teeth for ages, but haven&#x27;t gotten to actually try it out. Used it for the first time and the results were great. It&#x27;s easy to use and no expensive doctor visits. Very decent product and does what it says. I would recommend anyone who wants to get teeth whitening at home to try this out.</li>
            <li> I found this product and thought I would give it a try.  I had been looking for something to brighten my smile, but could never find an affordable product.  I was really happy to get free shipping as well.  I received the order in just a few days and could not wait to put the product to the test.  With very simple instructions I was able to quickly prepare the trays for use.  The trays were very comfortable and they stayed in place.  I have used the Crest strips and they do not stick so the solution could not work.  I was very pleased with my results after only a couple of applications.  I would give this a thumbs up and recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> if you want confidence try this product…I can&#x27;t get over how much better I look with white teeth.</li>
            <li> I personally enjoy the tray system. Whitening strips fell out of my mouth so I am looking forward to using this more often and avoiding that kind of experience.</li>
            <li> It really works. I done the process 3 times now and you can actually see the shades of whiting each time. Its nice to see a prodoct work as advertised and with Amazon rating product lets others share how good somthing really is and a lot of people rated as I have.</li>
            <li> Trays were hard to mold properly but other than that it works like a charm and has whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> Removes decades worth of stains from your teeth in a few easy-to-do treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Provides dental-grade, professional strength teeth whitening results in as little as 15 minutes I know&lt;br /&gt;Heat-molded trays fit perfectly to your mouth, making this no-hassle at home teeth whitening experience, no mess no sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Quick easy treatments, noticeable whitening within days&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None that I can see so far.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, does not work. Waster $33 on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piece of advice - Use baking soda with water as a paste for tooth whitening. Natural, free of cost and works very effectively. Wish I had known this before wasting $33 on this product.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. Please save you money. I did multiply treatments and found no change in appearance. It is sad amazon allows fake readings and allows for it&#x27;s customers to be scammed. This is the second product I have bought from amazon that turned out to be a scam. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t start working until I began leaving in for longer than the prescribed 15 minute maximum. I began leaving in for 20-30 minutes and began seeing results. No gum sensitivity. I may be mistaken, but I thought when you go to the dentist for this, they prescribe leaving what they give you in for longer than 15 minutes (I&#x27;ve never done it at the dentist, but I have inquired about it once or twice). So I was surprised by that 15 minute max. And, like I say, sure enough I did have to leave it in longer for results.</li>
            <li> This has a good taste and therefore I look forward to using it every single time I do, which is about two or three times a week. My teeth look great and probably are two to three shades lighter than they were before I started. Tray system beats all other systems and I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best way to regain the perfect health of your teeth. Why spend so much money going to the DOC when you can get this kit to white shine your stained yellow teeth. I&#x27;ve benefited from it and thus recommend others to take advantage of this kit and save time and money going to the DOC.</li>
            <li> First review I have ever written because I was so disappointed. To start, the box had been previously opened and was taped close. Claims you will see results the same day. No, not true. I have yet to see any difference. Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the items arrive in packets that are hard to keep fresh and the retainer pack is hard to close back. furthermore, the mold used to make a retainer is very poor quality and did not form a good mold, no matter how many times I tried. as for the whitening, this one caused significantly more pain to the gums and mouth, and far less whitening effect, than other whitening kits, even just strips from CVS. total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for you if youy drink too much coffee/tea. Your teeth will definitely see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work and 5 star reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> I admit I am an avid coffee drinker. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that will wipe these stains off until this product. I saw some results after the first  time. This the best!</li>
            <li> After several attempts purchasing whitening kits off the pharmacy shelf, I decided to give whitening one more try with the Brilliant HD kit. The affordable price left me somewhat skeptical due to the fact I&#x27;ve had no luck at all with the pharmacy offerings. I was impressed right away with the mold trays. These are by far the best fit I&#x27;ve had of all I&#x27;ve tried. They are not uncomfortable like so many others. I have a professional mouthguard, and Brilliant HD&#x27;s trays fit like a glove just as my dentist-molded mouthguard does. I took the fit as a good sign and was ecstatic to see a marked difference in the color of my teeth in about three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it happened, my roommate began professional whitening about two weeks before I started to use Brilliant HD. At the end of my first two weeks of using it, when she was a month into using hers, my teeth were clearly whiter than hers, yet she had spent a great deal more for her whitening system. Finding a quality whitening system is a frustrating, costly process if one tries product after product with modest results. Brilliant HD will be my go-to whitener and is definitely a product I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I think I found my new favorite teeth whitening kit! The directions are clear, the process is simple, and it only took me a few minutes to see immediate results. The tray was easy to set up and put in place. I washed the dishes and put them away while I was doing this, so it didn&#x27;t take any time to do. By the time I was done straightening up the kitchen after dinner, it was time to see my results.       I&#x27;m a daily coffee and tea drinker, so there was definitely work to be done on my tooth shade. I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on my teeth since trying out this whitening kit, two in the last week to be exact, and that&#x27;s NEVER happened. I can only thank this kit for the extra attention. I will DEFINITELY be getting this regularly to combat the unwanted side effects of my dark drink addiction. Thanks whoever makes this!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this whitening kit! I have tried so many different products. Strips, mouthwashes, retainers, toothpastes, literally everything. I finally went online and checked out the reviews for this product. I&#x27;m never usually one to go by what others say, but I have to admit that I was really happy I did. I was a little worried at first about the price having been disappointed by so many other products, but after I saw results right away I knew not to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays fit my mouth pretty comfortably, and with such a short wait period it gives me time to fit other things into my busy schedule. I recommend using the kit at night, that way its the last thing you do before bed. I am a smoker and coffee drinkers, and before starting this product I had some pretty bad staining to my right front teeth. After a week of using this product, there isn&#x27;t a single trace of any of my bad habits, and my teeth look like they may have been done professionally! TOTALLY worth it. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Literally terrible. Product does absolutely nothing, does not work. This is 100% a scam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a whiter smile since I have surface stains from coffee, tea, etc. The only reason I haven&#x27;t gone to get them whitened is because it is so costly. I have been skeptical of take-home teeth whitening solutions after trying a few and being disappointed when they don&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t have the patience to sit in a chair to get my teeth whitened for a long period, especially with my mouth open.&lt;br /&gt;My good friend actually tried this HD whitening gel and bought a kit for me to try at home. It was affordable and easy to use. I just had to insert the gel trays into my mouth and mold it to my teeth with whitening gel in order to remove those stubborn stains. After using this method three times, I noticed a huge difference, and the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> Brillant HD teeth whitening kit is easy to use system.I have tried multiple  systems and have not had any luck.Other systems are cumbersome,sloppy, require mixing, or just plainly don&#x27;t work. I am a coffee drinker , wine drinker and I smoke.Stained teeth are no stranger to me.&lt;br /&gt;I was about to give up on at home teeth whitening kits.I even considered going to the dentist for flash/zoom whitening(which is very expensive) but my friend told me about this kit. Her teeth were very white.....and I know what they looked like before.So I tried it and it worked great.I could tell the diffrence with one treatment.After one week all my stains were gone.I could not believe how white they were. I work in healthcare and didnt realize how important have a really bright smile helped my confidence.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Doesn&#x27;t mention if the mouth trays are BPA free and what is with all the spelling mistakes all over the packaging? I was given this product free of charge to review. My thoughts are my own.  *Edit* This company tried to get me to remove my review with a song and dance about how the guy was going to lose his job over my review. The review will not be removed. Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> I have been paying for professional tooth whitening at my dentist&#x27;s office for years, but a few months ago I decided to try to be more frugal and cut down on unnecessary costs in an effort to become debt free. My tooth whitening services were one of the things I decided to forego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve tried a few home whitening products, and Brilliant HD &amp;#34;Deluxe Teeth Whitening&amp;#34; is the one I&#x27;ve decided to keep using regularly. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I am surprised to be able to report my teeth are back to the same brilliant sparkling white that they were when I was getting them whitened professionally! I am amazed. After being disappointed over and over by the flavor, burning and general ineffectiveness of the other whiteners I&#x27;ve tried, I didn&#x27;t have much hope that this one would be any different. But this gel taste GREAT, doesn&#x27;t burn my super sensitive gums, and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on my sparkling smile. I&#x27;m so relieved to know I don&#x27;t have to give up my white teeth to reach my goal of becoming debt free. I&#x27;m recommend this product to EVERYONE for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this.  It worked so well. No teeth sensitivity afterwards.  I am already recommending to friends.</li>
            <li> I say that this product is worth your time. It worked for me, I was able to get my teeth about two shades whiter than I have been able to do with any other product. Everything comes packed for you, so its a no brainer way to clean your teeth. The cost is also way cheaper than what you would have to pay to have a professional do it so that alone caused me to give it a try and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> There is nothing I love more than nice, white teeth. Which is why it&#x27;s a cruel joke that I also love coffee and cigarettes! Needless to say, I have used a lot of tooth whitening kits in my day. This one is great! I saw results after the very first use, which doesn&#x27;t always happen. It is easy to use and everything you need is included in the kit. Another thing I like about this kit is the company: NuNutrients makes a lot of stuff, and I have never had a bad experience with one of their products. I give this five stars.</li>
            <li> Teeth used to have an unsightly shade of yellow over them for years from countless mornings of coffee and cigarettes. Confidence was low, so I decided to try brilliant HD teeth whitening kit, and within months my smile was as white as snow. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Brilliant HD is the best at home whitening system I have used. To get real results and have a bright white smile I had to try so many different gels but I just got some no satisfying results. Since I tried Brilliant HD results are better than the white strips I&#x27;ve used. The molds are easy to use and treatments very effective! I&#x27;m re-ordering!</li>
            <li> I have tried many solutions to yellowing teeth and had problems with almost all the products I used. Some products like whitening strips would cause my teeth lots of pain because of my sensitivity and some just didn&#x27;t show any results. This product worked great. It didn&#x27;t give me trophy white teeth but it made my teeth so much whiter that you almost couldn&#x27;t even tell they are/ were as stained as they were. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a whitening product for the teeth especially if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try yet another teeth whitening kit, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! I&#x27;m a coffee and wine drinker, as well as a cigar smoker, so I was determined to find a product that actually worked. At first I was a little intimidated by the molds and syringes. I felt like I was supposed to be at the dentist&#x27;s office.  But it was so easy to use, totally hassle free, and affordable!  I would definitely recommend this kit to anyone who wants a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> This amazing kit really does whiten your teeth and it does it for so much cheaper than a professional clean and it looks professional. If you want shiny pearly whites then this is the product for you. I noticed whiter teeth in only a short period of time</li>
            <li> Holy cow. This stuff works. I am always skeptical of products like this because I feel like I have tried EVERY one on the planet. I gave it a shot after I saw how white my sister&#x27;s smile was. She said she bought this on Amazon and send me to another link to buy it. WOWSERS. In one day-- no kidding---- someone said my teeth were &amp;#34;really white.&amp;#34; I was amazed. !</li>
