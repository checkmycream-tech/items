    <ol>
            <li>Best stuff ever,wished my Walmart carried it again</li>
            <li>Works great, been using it for years!  </li>
            <li>their price was great and delivery was very quick!!!!</li>
            <li>great product; swiftly delivered.</li>
            <li>Although these were not for me, my brother says that they are the best item available to keep your dentures in place.  </li>
            <li>good price for a good product</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s nothing &amp;#34;oozing&amp;#34; out like there would be with denture adhesive creams, so I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>I love the product, it keeps food out and works well</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d do just as well, or better, buying Fixadent or Secure Denture Bonding cream (much better for the money).</li>
            <li>The product itself is excellent, the only one of this genre to adequately secure my mother&#x27;s dentures - her having a high roof/palate.</li>
            <li>Yes, my Super PoliGrip strips did meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>Although a pity I had to spend more to have it posted from the US than its cost price, I was grateful to be able to access it.</li>
            <li>They came on time, and now I can smile again.</li>
            <li>This seller sent the item right away</li>
            <li>but no one wants them!  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stick well and it feels funny in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed these.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very please with the service.</li>
            <li>These strips hold ok, but in my opinion they are not worth the money.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed alright not messy</li>
            <li>I cut the strips and that a little better.</li>
            <li>While it is a bit tricky with the strips sticking to my fingers they kept my upper denture much flatter against the roof of my mouth than the denture cream.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying them again and hope the UK-based stores will have them in stock back from prior relegation.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of icky, but it&#x27;s simple to remove with a toothbrush, maybe finish it up with some Listerine just to make sure there isn&#x27;t anything left behind that you missed.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It is a really cool product it last me 3 days paste or powder only last me a day and a half I would definitely recommend</li>

            <li> They usually stay on pretty well, and if they do get loose, I just have to &amp;#34;re-lick&amp;#34; and put some pressure on the fake teeth.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but then after a few minutes in your mouth it feels like spit!</li>
            <li> and they were no good at all, for me anyway.  </li>
            <li> Seals stuck to my gums and was Difficult to remove.</li>

            <li> I had tried Sea Bond wafers which had no grip at all on my gums, so I gave Poligrip Strips a try. I placed the three strips according to package directions, put my dentures in and bit down as directed. I removed the strips that night and used the strips again this morning. While it is a bit tricky with the strips sticking to my fingers they kept my upper denture much flatter against the roof of my mouth than the denture cream. I am sold on these and will buy a larger quantity next time!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever,wished my Walmart carried it again</li>
            <li> Although these were not for me, my brother says that they are the best item available to keep your dentures in place.  Believe it or not they are not available in Australia, so Amazon is the only place he can get them.</li>
            <li> For months we&#x27;d been stalking this elusive product in a variety of stores and from the Britain-based branch themselves. The product itself is excellent, the only one of this genre to adequately secure my mother&#x27;s dentures - her having a high roof/palate. Although a pity I had to spend more to have it posted from the US than its cost price, I was grateful to be able to access it. I will certainly be buying them again and hope the UK-based stores will have them in stock back from prior relegation.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work like the description said. Seals didn&#x27;t hold long enough. Seals stuck to my gums and was Difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> It is a really cool product it last me 3 days paste or powder only last me a day and a half I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use dentures, but someone suggested these for applying fake buck teeth (more specifically, ones made from fake nails). They usually stay on pretty well, and if they do get loose, I just have to &amp;#34;re-lick&amp;#34; and put some pressure on the fake teeth. When taking them off, they do leave a sticky gunk (which would be the poligrip strip, obviously) and it&#x27;s kind of icky, but it&#x27;s simple to remove with a toothbrush, maybe finish it up with some Listerine just to make sure there isn&#x27;t anything left behind that you missed.&lt;br /&gt;But there&#x27;s nothing &amp;#34;oozing&amp;#34; out like there would be with denture adhesive creams, so I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> stil have that gum felling when your dentures out. I cut the strips and that a little better.</li>
            <li> good price for a good product</li>
            <li> great product; swiftly delivered.</li>
            <li> Dad doesn&#x27;t like these at all.  Tossed them in the trash.</li>
            <li> Yes, my Super PoliGrip strips did meet my expectations. They came on time, and now I can smile again. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed these.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try these and they were no good at all, for me anyway.  They didn&#x27;t hold my lower denture in at all.  I will never use them again.  Shoot, I&#x27;m trying to give the rest of them away but no one wants them!  Not the seller&#x27;s fault.  This seller sent the item right away and I&#x27;m very please with the service.</li>
            <li> Works great, been using it for years!  their price was great and delivery was very quick!!!!</li>
            <li> These strips hold ok, but in my opinion they are not worth the money. You&#x27;d do just as well, or better, buying Fixadent or Secure Denture Bonding cream (much better for the money).</li>
            <li> At first it seemed alright not messy but then after a few minutes in your mouth it feels like spit! They don&#x27;t stick well and it feels funny in your mouth.I had to go back to my Denture Adhesive Cream.Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Same as drug store without the embarassment of buying. I love the product, it keeps food out and works well</li>
