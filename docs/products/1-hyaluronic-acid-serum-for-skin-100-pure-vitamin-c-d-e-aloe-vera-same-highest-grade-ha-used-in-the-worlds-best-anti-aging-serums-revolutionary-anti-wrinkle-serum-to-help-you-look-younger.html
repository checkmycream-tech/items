            <li>received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>The word &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; freaked me out at first, but after using it I loved it!</li>
            <li>and I am pleased to report that my drop spots are improving.</li>
            <li>am in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>i love this serum.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the combo of the acid and vitamins</li>
            <li>They love it.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed immediately by the change in hydration of my skin, which only took a day.</li>
            <li>when I run out of this I shall be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>The packaging and size of this bottle is ideal for convenient and frequent use.  </li>
            <li>The formula is designed to lock in moisture when used under your favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Used mostly as a moisturizer, hyaluronic acid can hold up to 3,000 times its weight in water.</li>
            <li>make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It’s not a miracle product though, and you should still use a good moisturizer with it, but it absolutely does wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic acid is safe for even the most sensitive of skin types, making it a popular ingredient for many skin care</li>
            <li>My skin actually got brighter and looks more healthy!!</li>
            <li>You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application.</li>
            <li>The fine wrinkles I have are noticeably fading.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instantly plump fine lines while reducing the appearance of wrinkles gradually&lt;br /&gt;Add</li>
            <li>and although I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with signs of aging, it hasn&#x27;t seemed to have made a drastic difference toward the lines under and around my eyes either.  </li>
            <li>It gives me that baby smooth skin that I’ve always</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this Serum.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m pretty enjoying using this serum.</li>
            <li>You have found another lifelong customer Angelizer, and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great serum!</li>
            <li>I love this serum so much.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin.</li>
            <li>However, while abundant when you&#x27;re younger, the amount produced decreases with age.</li>
            <li>It is clear that once the serum and moisturizer have been applied, the skin is much more hydrated and the moisture isn&#x27;t going to evaporate or wipe off.</li>
            <li>As a result, hyaluronic acid serums help deliver powerful hydration to the skin in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use the hyaluronic acid serum right after cleansing and apply a moisturizer after it dries.</li>
            <li>I went, looking for the right vitamin/chemical/etc to use.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this serum and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I have noticed the area&#x27;s that needed moisture, are looking better only after about a week of use!</li>
            <li>A wonderful product without the expensive price.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Well, I think it&#x27;s going to take a little more time which is just fine because it took awhile to earn them.</li>
            <li>I found out about this hyaluronic acid serum by accident and after trying it for the first time, I was very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>This product really does do everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue behind after you use it (which is great).</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have some dry spots on my face as well as those lovely lines we get as we mature.</li>
            <li>Product works well with my moisturizer making my skin smooth to the touch and improve skin tone smile lines are less visable will continue to use this product</li>
            <li>The general formula of this product is similar to that of Estee Lauder&#x27;s Advanced Night Repair serum but is much cheaper in terms of price/Fl. Oz and has the added bonus of containing extra vitamins and Aloe Vera.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed some fine lines on my forehead and have some slight crows feet around my eyes.</li>
            <li>So I have had oily, sensitive and acne prone skin pretty much my entire life.</li>
            <li>I did a comparison of the serum using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled in.</li>
            <li>After using it several times, my skin has never looked so vibrant!</li>
            <li>As far as the lines and wrinkles?</li>
            <li>This acid is a naturally occurring acid in the body.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s worked wonders.</li>
            <li>If your unfamiliar with Hyaluronic Acid, basically it is a naturally occurring ingredient in the matrix of our skin.</li>
            <li>for all skin types including sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>intense moisture to dry skin</li>
            <li>Slowly but surely, the thin wrinkles then the deeper ones began to smooth away.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing like any other skin serum I&#x27;ve tried before and after trying it for two days</li>
            <li>When it first dries, may faces feels quite tight</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When it first dries, may faces feels quite tight</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s completely dry, I put on a touch of my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think that is due to the numerous vitamins and aloe vera present in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin felt really soft after applying it a few times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic acid serums keep the skin soft, supple, firm, and moisturized, which help prevent breakouts and signs of aging on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was not clear to me.</li>
            <li> so the 1.69 oz bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is helpful if you have trouble with ineffective application of moisturizer, but if your skin is extremely dry or you have specific signs of aging you want to repair, you may need to update your moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased it based on other reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I like the product but was not aware that I would be mailed an addition bottle from the Charne Beauty company and billed $76.14.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Improve appearance of dark under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;Safe</li>
            <li> Plus, I noticed some of my acne scars were starting to disappear slowly.</li>
            <li> During the day, I add a small amount to the dry spots as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27; make my skin feel tacky or tight.</li>
            <li> but then it loosens up after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I started to notice a difference after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The texture of this was slimy as it went on and sticky as it dried.  </li>
            <li> However, the long-term effects of this product are slightly disappointing because I noticed that my face was still so dry that it was peeling after several days of use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately as we age over time, it begins to degrade and it becomes apparent in our face.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that we begin to lose some Hyaluronic Acid, we can replace it using products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing plenty of research into skin rejuvenation a friend of mine decided to pass this along to me as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this product works yet or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that some of the small lines around my lips started to disappear.</li>
            <li> Apply a small amout in the morning after washing your face to decrease wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a common ingredient found in skin care products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about any of this products.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to find out that this also fights acne and removes acne scars when I visited the wikipedia page when doing my research.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think I like it--just started using it, but the label on the outside of the bottle is sticky and I can&#x27;t wash the stickiness off.  Doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  Product arrived quickly.  I purchased it based on other reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this product works yet or not. It might be snake oil. Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This stuff is amazing. This is easily one of the best hyaluronic acid treatments I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of using. Will definitely be buying again.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this Serum. I have some dry spots on my face as well as those lovely lines we get as we mature. I have been using this serum for a week now and I am pleased to report that my drop spots are improving. As far as the lines and wrinkles? Well, I think it&#x27;s going to take a little more time which is just fine because it took awhile to earn them. I really like the way my skin feels. I have been applying the serum at night, after washing my face. When it first dries, may faces feels quite tight but then it loosens up after a few minutes. When it&#x27;s completely dry, I put on a touch of my regular moisturizer. During the day, I add a small amount to the dry spots as well. Overall I am very pleased with this serum and highly recommend it. I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> So I have had oily, sensitive and acne prone skin pretty much my entire life. I’ve tried just about every skin care product out there. I found out about this hyaluronic acid serum by accident and after trying it for the first time, I was very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt really soft after applying it a few times. After using it several times, my skin has never looked so vibrant! It even helped with my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not a miracle product though, and you should still use a good moisturizer with it, but it absolutely does wonders for your skin. It gives me that baby smooth skin that I’ve always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it two times a day, once in the morning and once at night. I also use a moisturizer with it as directed by the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this stuff. You have found another lifelong customer Angelizer, and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great serum!</li>
            <li> Product works well with my moisturizer making my skin smooth to the touch and improve skin tone smile lines are less visable will continue to use this product</li>

            <li> i love this serum. i use it every night and i&#x27;ve used several serum before and i&#x27;m pretty enjoying using this serum. keep my skin hydrated and firm.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend~!</li>
            <li> I was recommended Angelizer by a friend and the serum does exactly what it says. I started to notice a difference after a few weeks. My skin actually got brighter and looks more healthy!! I&#x27;ve also noticed that some of the small lines around my lips started to disappear. Amazing!!! I&#x27;m very happy with the product and I think I&#x27;ll buy one for my mom too.</li>
            <li> You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application. You don&#x27;t want to use this in lieu of a moisturizer (serums are meant to be applied underneath moisturizer). Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin. make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums. I did a comparison of the serum using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled in. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU. What more is there to say? The product is great. My skin loves it!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great value.  I am a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> I love this serum so much.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> This is a great serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week or so now and notice the difference already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the hyaluronic acid serum right after cleansing and apply a moisturizer after it dries. I started out using it once a day, but now I use it twice a day and have seen great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff, will buy again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed some fine lines on my forehead and have some slight crows feet around my eyes. I decided that it was time to do some preventative maintenance on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, off to google I went, looking for the right vitamin/chemical/etc to use. I then came across Hyaluronic acid. This acid is a naturally occurring acid in the body. However, while abundant when you&#x27;re younger, the amount produced decreases with age. It gives skin that supple, hydrated look (and is even used in fillers like juvaderm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product after searching through Amazon and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. So far it&#x27;s worked wonders. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the combo of the acid and vitamins A, C, and D3. The fine wrinkles I have are noticeably fading.</li>
            <li> Great product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> Bought the serum as a gift.  They love it.  She said her skin has never felt this good.</li>
            <li> The texture of this was slimy as it went on and sticky as it dried.  Absolutely nothing like any other skin serum I&#x27;ve tried before and after trying it for two days I just couldn&#x27;t make myself wear it again.</li>
            <li> If your unfamiliar with Hyaluronic Acid, basically it is a naturally occurring ingredient in the matrix of our skin. It provides elasticity and the youthful appearance in our skin. Unfortunately as we age over time, it begins to degrade and it becomes apparent in our face.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that we begin to lose some Hyaluronic Acid, we can replace it using products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing plenty of research into skin rejuvenation a friend of mine decided to pass this along to me as a gift. I was impressed immediately by the change in hydration of my skin, which only took a day. I think that is due to the numerous vitamins and aloe vera present in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week I noticed a change in the smoothness of my skin. Slowly but surely, the thin wrinkles then the deeper ones began to smooth away. Plus, I noticed some of my acne scars were starting to disappear slowly. I was shocked to find out that this also fights acne and removes acne scars when I visited the wikipedia page when doing my research.  This product really does do everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very impressed and when I run out of this I shall be purchasing more. I recommend it to all of my friends and to you to!</li>
            <li> The word &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; freaked me out at first, but after using it I loved it! It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue behind after you use it (which is great). I have noticed the area&#x27;s that needed moisture, are looking better only after about a week of use!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product without the expensive price.Apply a small amout in the morning after washing your face to decrease wrinkles. It is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  The packaging and size of this bottle is ideal for convenient and frequent use.  You only need two or three pumps of the serum per use so the 1.69 oz bottle lasts a very long time. The general formula of this product is similar to that of Estee Lauder&#x27;s Advanced Night Repair serum but is much cheaper in terms of price/Fl. Oz and has the added bonus of containing extra vitamins and Aloe Vera.  The formula is designed to lock in moisture when used under your favorite moisturizer. It is clear that once the serum and moisturizer have been applied, the skin is much more hydrated and the moisture isn&#x27;t going to evaporate or wipe off. However, the long-term effects of this product are slightly disappointing because I noticed that my face was still so dry that it was peeling after several days of use. It is also designed to be anti-aging and fill in lines and wrinkles and although I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with signs of aging, it hasn&#x27;t seemed to have made a drastic difference toward the lines under and around my eyes either.  Overall this product is helpful if you have trouble with ineffective application of moisturizer, but if your skin is extremely dry or you have specific signs of aging you want to repair, you may need to update your moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> I like it , but can&#x27;t say I see a difference yet.  My age and the fact I was a sun  worship in my youth I will need to use it for awhile to see a difference..</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth. I feel a difference as I&#x27;m smoothing on the lotion. It doesn&#x27; make my skin feel tacky or tight. Love it.</li>
            <li> This item is great!  I like that this product moisturizes my face without feeling greasy.  I tend to have oily skin.  I have also noticed that since I have been using the product the skin around my neck and jaw line has gotten firmer.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a common ingredient found in skin care products. Used mostly as a moisturizer, hyaluronic acid can hold up to 3,000 times its weight in water. As a result, hyaluronic acid serums help deliver powerful hydration to the skin in one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid serums keep the skin soft, supple, firm, and moisturized, which help prevent breakouts and signs of aging on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is safe for even the most sensitive of skin types, making it a popular ingredient for many skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instantly plump fine lines while reducing the appearance of wrinkles gradually&lt;br /&gt;Add intense moisture to dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Instant glowing complexion&lt;br /&gt;Improve appearance of dark under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;Safe for all skin types including sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is really good. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about any of this products. I washed my face and used this serum followed by a vitamin c sercum and then some rose water. I have seen the change in my skin since I have been using these products.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery. Thanks</li>
