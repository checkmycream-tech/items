            <li>Thanks for great on line ordering from Amazon, I can find it if I need it.</li>
            <li>It used to have a girl with a very beautiful red bob</li>
            <li>In fact, I wish Proctor &amp; Gamble would market the conditioner separately so that I can use it more often.</li>

            <li>I am very happy that I found I can buy Clairol Natural Instincts Golden Sienna over the internet!</li>
            <li>How can I get more of this beautiful Natural Instincts color?  </li>
            <li>I am very glad to be able to find it here and get it so fast.  </li>
            <li>Looking to refresh my color to that of my younger days - red-gold when hit by the sun, I began my quest for a great hair coloring product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gorgeous, natural, with tons of shine.</li>
            <li>Also love that Natural Instincts Hair Color #15...very nice shade...</li>
            <li>hairdresser admitted that Natural Instincts is as good as anything she does - and she is an expert colorist - at a significantly lower cost.</li>
            <li>week-very pleased with the whole order!</li>
            <li>I used L&#x27;Oreal Color Spa in the past and it looked wonderful, but they stopped making it</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend Natural Instincts Hair Color to anyone looking for a great product!.     </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend Natural Instincts Hair Color to anyone looking for a great product!</li>
            <li>Although it was a chore to have to formulate my own color - particularly when the two colors were rotated from stock periodically - it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used natural instincts before and have liked the colors</li>
            <li>Many thanks</li>
            <li>Amazon always comes through and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am a born red head, but fading and trying to cover gray that is coming in more and more these days.  </li>
            <li>I have just used Clairol &#x27;s Natural Instincts for the first time and I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>A couple years ago I found this color and tried it and loved it, but for the past year I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>After multiple washes and at least a week the color faded to a beautiful strawberry blond, but I was hesitant to try this color again, for fear of another week of embarrassing bright orange hair.</li>
            <li>The amazing thing was that I had it within 48 hours using standard shipping.</li>
            <li>Spiced Tea Light Auburn #16 that is really close to this.</li>
            <li>I am a natural dark blond with lighter blond highlights and the first time I tried the golden sienna the lighter parts of my hair turned bright orange!</li>
            <li>I live in primary Hispanic South Texas.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast and it was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Clairol for this sensational color that replicates exactly my natural red hair.</li>
            <li>The color I ordered is the exact color of red/auburn that I&#x27;ve grown up with.  </li>
            <li>This time I colored the roots first, waited 5 minutes, applied the color to the rest of my hair, and waited another 5 minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li>Clairol Natural Instincts Hair Color 16, Spiced Tea, Light Auburn 1 Kit]]</li>
            <li>Fading at forty - that was my hair-dilemma several years ago (okay, eighteen years ago)...</li>
            <li>However, I could never quite find the exact color I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>She also suggested I leave the color on as long as 20 minutes, if I had no reaction to the chemicals as it would through more shampooings.</li>
            <li>And previous reviewers were correct in mentioning the nice softness that it leaves.    </li>
            <li>Overall, I now like this color better than the saharan rose because it is more vibrant and seems to last at least a couple of weeks longer.</li>
            <li>but this one was very deceptive.  </li>
            <li>Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts in Golden Sienna has been my go-to haircolor for years.  </li>
            <li>It is very conveinent and with a 3-pack</li>
            <li>Many of the reds stocked by the retailers looked almost purple and the lighter reds were just not right for my skin</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon we were able to get her an ample supply-got my order in less than a</li>
            <li>It gives me the same shade Golden Sienna did.</li>
            <li>This Golden Sienna color does not turn out anything like the model picture or the colors on the back.  </li>
            <li>finally began mixing Natural Instincts Hot Cocoa and Natural Instincts Golden Sienna to achieve a color close to what I sought.</li>
            <li>Now the redheads of the world will have even more limited choices available from Clairol as they discontinued the strawberry blonde color a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>After using Clairol&#x27;s Natural instinct&#x27;s NUTMEG, I am transformed!  </li>
            <li>It does fade fairly quickly, but it&#x27;s much cheaper and less traumatic than trying a color in the salon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Clairol Natural Instincts, from its inception, hit the mark when it came to gentle processing which left my hair feeling like hair and not straw.</li>
            <li>Now I have to go to the hair salon to have it professionally fixed.  </li>
            <li>Paid too much for &amp;#34;the last one is stock&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The results look natural,  yet glorious.</li>
            <li>If you have light blond hair, the key is to start with the roots and do not apply the color to your entire head until the last 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>but when i used Golden Sienna it turned out pink (not an exaggeration).  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a new non permanent strawberry blond after it became difficult to find the Natural Instincts saharan rose color in stores.</li>
            <li>True golden reds (as opposed to auburns) are very hard to find, especially if you do not want to go the permanent color route.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this color and apparently it&#x27;s being discontinued as she can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I am a natural red head</li>
            <li>Natural Instincts makes another semi-permanent red color called</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead who&#x27;s red has faded a bit</li>
            <li>This color looks almost exactly like my original color and not too fake.    </li>
            <li>It is a bit less \\&quot;golden\\&quot; and a little more red.</li>
            <li>I am a natural red hair but as time passes by, my red tends to fade away.</li>
            <li>As I previously stated, because local retailers rotated their color selections, I took to stocking up a year in advance, just to keep my color consistent.  </li>
            <li>She did suggest that I wash my hair with a clear shampoo and dry it just before coloring.</li>

            <li> (Plus, they run buy 1 get 1 half off specials all of the time).</li>
            <li> The color was exactly what I had been seeking - it gave my dark brown hair the golden-red glow of my youth and didn&#x27;t look artificial or dyed.  </li>
            <li> but my hair has gotten a little darker with age</li>
            <li> I am so frustrated they discontinued Golden Sienna.</li>

            <li> My only problem was that this color had become impossible to find in any stores.   </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ridiculous and greedy.</li>
            <li> This color is very hard to get in stores.</li>
            <li> Bad decision, Clairol.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in Texas.</li>
            <li> Alas, Clairol has decided to discontinue the color!!!  </li>

            <li> I get tons of compliments on this gorgeous color, which I have used for years.  True golden reds (as opposed to auburns) are very hard to find, especially if you do not want to go the permanent color route. Hats off to Clairol for creating this great color.   My only problem was that this color had become impossible to find in any stores.   Amazon to the rescue!   Hooray!</li>

            <li> This color turned my hair bright orange!  I am a natural red head but my hair has gotten a little darker with age so I tried this color to brighten it up.  Now I look like a clown.  I used L&#x27;Oreal Color Spa in the past and it looked wonderful, but they stopped making it so I tried Clairol.  A big mistake on my part.  Now I have to go to the hair salon to have it professionally fixed.  I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This color is great must be why they discontinued it!  thank god for amazon, thats why I keep shopping!</li>

            <li> I have just used Clairol &#x27;s Natural Instincts for the first time and I am thrilled with the results. the color is phenomenal. Gorgeous, natural, with tons of shine.

After using Clairol&#x27;s Natural instinct&#x27;s NUTMEG, I am transformed!  The results look natural,  yet glorious. Thank you Clairol. I have been dying my hair for years, yet never felt compelled to thank the creators of the dyes. Thank you, thank you, thank you,Clairol.  Loulou</li>
            <li> Love Amazon.  Everything came on time and in good shape.  Also love that Natural Instincts Hair Color #15...very nice shade...lots of compliments.    Amazon always comes through and quickly.  Count on it.</li>
            <li> I am a natural red hair but as time passes by, my red tends to fade away. Thank you Clairol for this sensational color that replicates exactly my natural red hair.</li>
            <li> I avoided covering my gray because I was afraid I&#x27;d never be able to match the color. The color I ordered is the exact color of red/auburn that I&#x27;ve grown up with.  A couple years ago I found this color and tried it and loved it, but for the past year I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores. I&#x27;m so glad I found it online and I&#x27;ll continue to look for it here. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I live in primary Hispanic South Texas.  So, no carries any hair products for redheads living here.  Now I am also ordering my Mother&#x27;s face cream which we also were surpised to find on Amazon.  The shipping was super fast and it was exactly what I needed.  Thanks for great on line ordering from Amazon, I can find it if I need it.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a new non permanent strawberry blond after it became difficult to find the Natural Instincts saharan rose color in stores. I am a natural dark blond with lighter blond highlights and the first time I tried the golden sienna the lighter parts of my hair turned bright orange! After multiple washes and at least a week the color faded to a beautiful strawberry blond, but I was hesitant to try this color again, for fear of another week of embarrassing bright orange hair. Since I bought the three pack, I finally decided to try it again.  This time I colored the roots first, waited 5 minutes, applied the color to the rest of my hair, and waited another 5 minutes before rinsing. The color turned out perfectly, was not orange at all, but a rich, shiny strawberry blond.  If you have light blond hair, the key is to start with the roots and do not apply the color to your entire head until the last 5 minutes. Overall, I now like this color better than the saharan rose because it is more vibrant and seems to last at least a couple of weeks longer.</li>
            <li> Tje quality of the product is what you would expect from Clairol. The amazing thing was that I had it within 48 hours using standard shipping. This vendor is on top of things!</li>
            <li> For my ginger sisters. I am so frustrated they discontinued Golden Sienna. But don&#x27;t pay a fortune for this color. Natural Instincts makes another semi-permanent red color called Spiced Tea Light Auburn #16 that is really close to this. It is a bit less \\&quot;golden\\&quot; and a little more red. But after a few shampoos, it looks the same. I am a natural redhead who&#x27;s red has faded a bit and I use this to brighten up my hair. The box for the Spiced Tea has changed. It used to have a girl with a very beautiful red bob but now the lady on the cover looks like a brunette. It gives me the same shade Golden Sienna did. You can find it at any Walgreens for around $8-9. (Plus, they run buy 1 get 1 half off specials all of the time). Don&#x27;t pay $79 or whatever for this product. That&#x27;s ridiculous and greedy. Anything over $10 is overpriced. I saw that yesterday and it made me so upset I had to post for you ladies who are looking for a great semi-red :)[[ASIN:B0013NB6II Clairol Natural Instincts Hair Color 16, Spiced Tea, Light Auburn 1 Kit]]</li>
            <li> This Golden Sienna color does not turn out anything like the model picture or the colors on the back.  I&#x27;ve used natural instincts before and have liked the colors but this one was very deceptive.  My hair is naturally dark blond but when i used Golden Sienna it turned out pink (not an exaggeration).  Even after buying products that were geared to removed color from hair it still left pink streaks after weeks of washing.  In the end I had to have my hair cut to remove the color. T</li>
            <li> How can I get more of this beautiful Natural Instincts color?  It suits my coloring perfectly.  Women strangers stop me on the street to ask what shade it is!</li>
            <li> Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts in Golden Sienna has been my go-to haircolor for years.  Quick and easy to apply, great color.  Alas, Clairol has decided to discontinue the color!!!  Now the redheads of the world will have even more limited choices available from Clairol as they discontinued the strawberry blonde color a few years ago.  Bad decision, Clairol.  Say it ain&#x27;t so!  Disappointed in Texas.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I found I can buy Clairol Natural Instincts Golden Sienna over the internet! It is very conveinent and with a 3-pack I won&#x27;t have to order but a few times a year.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> This color is very difficult to find in local stores.  I am very glad to be able to find it here and get it so fast.  Price is very good as well.  Many thanks</li>
            <li> Fading at forty - that was my hair-dilemma several years ago (okay, eighteen years ago)... Looking to refresh my color to that of my younger days - red-gold when hit by the sun, I began my quest for a great hair coloring product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clairol Natural Instincts, from its inception, hit the mark when it came to gentle processing which left my hair feeling like hair and not straw. However, I could never quite find the exact color I was looking for. Many of the reds stocked by the retailers looked almost purple and the lighter reds were just not right for my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally began mixing Natural Instincts Hot Cocoa and Natural Instincts Golden Sienna to achieve a color close to what I sought. The color was exactly what I had been seeking - it gave my dark brown hair the golden-red glow of my youth and didn&#x27;t look artificial or dyed.  Although it was a chore to have to formulate my own color - particularly when the two colors were rotated from stock periodically - it was worth it. I&#x27;ve been stopped in airports and at malls by women who compliment the sheen of my hair and the color.  There&#x27;s nothing like a compliment from a stranger to lift one&#x27;s spirits.  As I previously stated, because local retailers rotated their color selections, I took to stocking up a year in advance, just to keep my color consistent.  Thank goodness I found this on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser admitted that Natural Instincts is as good as anything she does - and she is an expert colorist - at a significantly lower cost. She did suggest that I wash my hair with a clear shampoo and dry it just before coloring. She also suggested I leave the color on as long as 20 minutes, if I had no reaction to the chemicals as it would through more shampooings. As a result, my color lasts about four weeks, with daily shampooing that begins no sooner than 24 hours after coloring. I do use shampoo and conditioner formulated for color-processed hair. The color will gradually soften until it is time to color again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the ease with which this product can be applied, and the conditioner included with the box is absolutely wonderful. In fact, I wish Proctor &amp; Gamble would market the conditioner separately so that I can use it more often. This color is difficult to find - impossible in some areas of the country, so it was great to find it on Amazon. I definitely recommend Natural Instincts Hair Color to anyone looking for a great product!.

            <li> It has become almost impossible to find this particular color in Illinois and Indiana.  I am a born red head, but fading and trying to cover gray that is coming in more and more these days.  This color looks almost exactly like my original color and not too fake.    It does fade fairly quickly, but it&#x27;s much cheaper and less traumatic than trying a color in the salon.  And previous reviewers were correct in mentioning the nice softness that it leaves.    I will keep buying it as long as I can get it on Amazon.    Thanks!</li>
            <li> This color is very hard to get in stores.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my hair looked pink after doing it with this color. I looked like Ronald McDonald with pink/red hair.</li>
