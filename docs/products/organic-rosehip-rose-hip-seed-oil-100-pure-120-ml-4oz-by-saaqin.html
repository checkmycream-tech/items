            <li>I received it in a timely fashion and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>My face felt better after using it one time!</li>
            <li>This product contains vitamin A, absorbs into the skin quickly, and makes your skin look and feel good.</li>
            <li>when I came across this &amp;#34;Certified Organic Rosehip Seed Oil&amp;#34; on Amazon- I was glad.</li>
            <li>the oil smelled more like olive oil than anything, and also-</li>
            <li>One of the most noticeable distinctions of ROSEHIP SEED OIL is it&#x27;s orange-amber hue.</li>
            <li>Most products do.</li>
            <li>My skin seems more healthy and more even in color.</li>
            <li>I Love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite ingredient for diy hair treatments</li>
            <li>I love this products because it works so well on the skin.</li>
            <li>he admitted that the packaging of the product is wishing for better and that they are working on it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t waist my time arguing with him any more.</li>
            <li>how was i supposed to know if i am satisfied with this product or not without opening the bottle and trying the oil? ......</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>This is nothing like the real rose hip oil I bought in my natural food and vitamin store.</li>
            <li>Real rosehip oil is reddish/ amber in color and has a pleasant rosy scent.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I have been well pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin soft and nice</li>
            <li>i contacted the seller with these observations of mine asking for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>If you buy a product that you never used before make sure you do your homework and know how the real stuff should look like!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because I know that it can take time for skin to adjust to new products, I continued to use it sparingly and just got more pimples.  </li>
            <li>buyer be aware!</li>
            <li>I love that I was able to get it in such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>sorry this product didn&#x27;t work out because I&#x27;m always looking for good oils at good prices.</li>
            <li>I mix it with some&lt;br /&gt;hyloranic acid and zinc oxide for my own facial moisturizer and BB cream.</li>
            <li>I will keep try some other good</li>
            <li>Well, I was right.</li>
            <li>one can tell it was blurred digitally to make sure it couldn&#x27;t be read.</li>
            <li>Also, I used it on my face, and later on upon looking in the mirror i noticed a more wrinkled-appearance-</li>
            <li>work pretty goodÔºÅ</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s label are exactly like on the picture except...</li>
            <li>He said several times that the bottles had to be complete with none used, but they weren&#x27;t completely full to the top to begin with</li>
            <li>Works great as a skin care product when used with other facial oils.  </li>
            <li>It had the consistency and taste of a canola oil, and I have never seen rosehips oil that didn&#x27;t have a slight rose fragrance and taste.  </li>
            <li>It has the consistency and taste of a canola oil, and I have never seen rosehips oil that didn&#x27;t have a slight rose fragrance and taste.</li>
            <li>I am very glad to get this item at such a low price!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a pure, certified organic oil, and this was everything I was looking for as in ingredient in the body butter</li>
            <li>Pure</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s so soft on the face first thing in the morning or right before bed.</li>
            <li>really the oil is pure rosa mosqueta.</li>
            <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t the real deal when I saw the blurred &amp;#34;ingredient list&amp;#34; on the bottom of the label-</li>
            <li>they may not notice so much, because there isn&#x27;t anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying the store, but everyone that wants real organic food and products buy there.</li>
            <li>Very please with it.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast, non-oily.</li>
            <li>He told me that i should not translate my sceptisim to his very organic product, that they sell gallons of it a day.</li>
            <li>what authority certified this particular oil?</li>
            <li>Essential rosehip oil may be clear but it also has a very strong scent as all essential oils do.</li>
            <li>The bottle was also not completely full to the top on arrival, although this wasn&#x27;t an issue until I wanted to return</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>Also, I live in a VERY DRY climate in SE Iowa, I know the difference in my hands when I am using TRUE rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>It was CLEAR.</li>
            <li>This oil was clear and smelled like canola or olive oil.</li>
            <li>Feels soft like butter.  </li>
            <li>I can imagine though, if someone were never to have tried rosehip seed oil prior to buying this particular product-</li>
            <li>In general I recomend the seller.  </li>
            <li>I was not impressed by the rose hip oil as it made me break out.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> In my opinion, this oil is olive oil. If it smells like olive oil, tastes like olive oil, looks like olive oil, then it&#x27;s olive oil.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by the rose hip oil as it made me break out.  I am not acne prone, so did not think that warnings for those with oily acne prone skin would apply to me.  Well I broke out all over my face even though I used it sparingly.  Because I know that it can take time for skin to adjust to new products, I continued to use it sparingly and just got more pimples.  Not small ones either-- medium to large painful ones. I haven&#x27;t broke out like this since I was a teenager and on my neck too.  Anyway, buyer beware-- even if you don&#x27;t have oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold up to expectations. The oil became rancid before used up</li>
            <li> I use this with my body lotion, it works very good. I will keep try some other good stuffs.thank u for take care my orders.good luck!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pure, certified organic oil, and this was everything I was looking for as in ingredient in the body butter I was making.  It arrived quickly and I have been well pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> This rosehips oil was just off and smelled slightly rancid.  It had the consistency and taste of a canola oil, and I have never seen rosehips oil that didn&#x27;t have a slight rose fragrance and taste.  The bottle was also not completely full to the top on arrival, although this wasn&#x27;t an issue until I wanted to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted the seller about the problems/rancid odor, he accused me of insulting him and said I could return it only if none had been used and if I paid shipping. He said several times that the bottles had to be complete with none used, but they weren&#x27;t completely full to the top to begin with so I figured it was a way to avoid having to take a return. BTW, I did not insult him--I only described the problems with the oils I had bought (and I have the email to prove it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up not returning the items because of his attitude and insistence that none had been used--I would have wasted my money on the shipping (in addition to the wasted money on the bad product) because he would have used the \\&quot;not full\\&quot; bottle as an excuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry this product didn&#x27;t work out because I&#x27;m always looking for good oils at good prices.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and I have used this now for several years and it keeps my skin soft and nice</li>
            <li> I have been a dedicated rosehip seed oil user for the past half-year, and would consider myself one who would know the characteristics of this oil without any doubt. I was searching for a less-expensive option when my last supply ran out- when I came across this &amp;#34;Certified Organic Rosehip Seed Oil&amp;#34; on Amazon- I was glad. It was the price of my last bottle, except 4 times the size! I should have listened to my instinct that whispered that this deal is probably a hoax. Well, I was right. When it came, I noticed the packaging was extremely low-grade with a label that looked like it had been printed by a 2nd grader. I knew it wasn&#x27;t the real deal when I saw the blurred &amp;#34;ingredient list&amp;#34; on the bottom of the label- one can tell it was blurred digitally to make sure it couldn&#x27;t be read. I used it that day- the oil smelled more like olive oil than anything, and also- It was CLEAR. One of the most noticeable distinctions of ROSEHIP SEED OIL is it&#x27;s orange-amber hue. Also, I live in a VERY DRY climate in SE Iowa, I know the difference in my hands when I am using TRUE rosehip seed oil. My hands are still pretty dry and flaking after using the oil for a few days. Also, I used it on my face, and later on upon looking in the mirror i noticed a more wrinkled-appearance- like the oil is settling into the crows feet around my eyes. This tells me it can be any other oil out there. Unfortunately, this product is not what it is advertised to be- the information on the Amazon page is FALSE. THIS IS NOT ROSEHIP SEED OIL. I can imagine though, if someone were never to have tried rosehip seed oil prior to buying this particular product- they may not notice so much, because there isn&#x27;t anything to compare it to. Customer service was very unhelpful and rude, quite frankly.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It came well packaged and within the specified number of days. It came with instructions and description of the product. It is as described. Good product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great as a skin care product when used with other facial oils.  I used it to make a facial serum.</li>
            <li> This is nothing like the real rose hip oil I bought in my natural food and vitamin store. I&#x27;m not saying the store, but everyone that wants real organic food and products buy there. This I thought was a bargain, but now I know it isn&#x27;t. It has the consistency and taste of a canola oil, and I have never seen rosehips oil that didn&#x27;t have a slight rose fragrance and taste. I just received this in the mail and I&#x27;m not using this on my skin. Ripe off !!</li>
            <li> Excellent I am very glad to get this item at such a low price! Very please with it.I would reccomend this to all.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave my skin greasy. It also does not break me out . Most products do.My skin seems more healthy and more even in color.</li>
            <li> Just arrived.  Absorbs fast, non-oily. Feels soft like butter.  My skin is very dry and this gives me hydration without the sticky greasy feel.  I Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite ingredient for diy hair treatments</li>
            <li> I use. Every night it works for me</li>
            <li> Research Rosehip seed oil and how it benefits and promote skin health. This product contains vitamin A, absorbs into the skin quickly, and makes your skin look and feel good.</li>
            <li> I put other essential oils into it then I blend the mixed oil into my night cream. work pretty goodÔºÅ</li>
            <li> I received the produc on time and good presentation, on a glass bottle, like is convenient for manintenance of the quiality product. In general I recomend the seller.  really the oil is pure rosa mosqueta.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on and off, and i can see the changes on my skin. I would recommed it</li>
            <li> Why not?  If it is good for exfoliating your skin?  I mix it with some&lt;br /&gt;hyloranic acid and zinc oxide for my own facial moisturizer and BB cream. Pure and I know what is in it.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived intact and quality is superb!!! I love this products because it works so well on the skin. Have been using for a few weeks but am seeing results</li>

            <li> My face felt better after using it one time! It made my very dry skin feel softer and smoother and the wrinkles seemed softer.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a base for my facial cleanser and lotion.  I have noticed a difference in my skin tone and a decrease in acne scars.  Highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> This product is any cooking oil but definately NOT a ROSEHIP OIL as described by the seller.i have used rosehip oil from the different sellers in the past and know it&#x27;s characterisctics.  Real rosehip oil is reddish/ amber in color and has a pleasant rosy scent. Essential rosehip oil may be clear but it also has a very strong scent as all essential oils do. This oil was clear and smelled like canola or olive oil. Plus the packaging! The bottle and it&#x27;s label are exactly like on the picture except... The label is a very poorly made xeroxed copy, very hazy without any pertinent info about the product. The lid is sealed by hand with white tape. Another words, looks like it has been packaged in a garage.&lt;br /&gt;So i contacted the seller with these observations of mine asking for a full refund.  he admitted that the packaging of the product is wishing for better and that they are working on it. But that was it. He told me that i should not translate my sceptisim to his very organic product, that they sell gallons of it a day. And they will accept a return if i didn&#x27;t open and use the product. That was it for me. I didn&#x27;t waist my time arguing with him any more. I got my refund through filing a claim with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;So buyer be aware! If you buy a product that you never used before make sure you do your homework and know how the real stuff should look like!&lt;br /&gt; Few questions remain lingering in my head:&lt;br /&gt;1) what authority certified this particular oil? ( i suspect the seller himself)&lt;br /&gt;2) how was i supposed to know if i am satisfied with this product or not without opening the bottle and trying the oil? ......</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and It&#x27;s so soft on the face first thing in the morning or right before bed. I love that I was able to get it in such a large bottle. I saved all the little one I had been buying and refilled them so I could have it everywhere I go. It&#x27;s in my gym bag, over night bag and in my medicine cabinet.</li>
