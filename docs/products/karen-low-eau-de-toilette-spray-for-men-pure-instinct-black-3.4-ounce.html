            <li>;)</li>
            <li>He bought this same exact one for OVER $70 yet ipayed $13!!!</li>
            <li>this scent is very sexy and extremely dark without being bitter like drakkoir noir and many of the typical dark scents    its not fresh but its a very calming arousing aroma and perfect for clubbing, and this is not one of the scents that smells great and then dies down, it grows on you and smells like anything else but lasts longer and smells better as it drys down and is pure quality.     </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone on a budget but wants high quality cologne.</li>
            <li>Black is great for everyday and formal.</li>
            <li>and its so masculine no women will even think of wearing it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a clue how to describe the base scent, but it has strong hints of leatheryness that I love!</li>
            <li>Its a little mild as black but its not bad for the price you pay......</li>

            <li> Black Instinct is dark, dirty and masculine, but not 50yr old  masculine, more like mid 20&#x27;s to 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Really hard to find elsewhere, but thanks a lot for amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The other reviewer was spot on with his description of it.</li>
            <li> squirts out just a little and the scent lasts very long, so you won&#x27;t be finishing the bottle all that quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
