            <li>I loved this Vaseline product and they stopped making it.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite!</li>
            <li>this lotion is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice fragrant lotion, don&#x27;t go for this one</li>
            <li>Been using the old version for years and it was great!!!</li>
            <li>Great delivery time and exactly what i wanted..</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>also own the Aloe Fresh Hydrating version of this lotion which smells nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the product and will order again.</li>
            <li>This non-hydrox lotion is a perennial favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hunted for this version for more than a year.  </li>
            <li>I had to pay a bit more for it</li>
            <li>Glad I stocked up on it.</li>
            <li>It applies easy and moisturizes as expected.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I think Vaseline Intensive Care for dry skin is very good.  </li>
            <li>Great to see that now they have it described as such.</li>
            <li>I finally FOUND it in the CVS hand lotion and was happy.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe it, its not half as good.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great, it goes on smoothly, has a nice subtle scent and does the job keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>I know for a FACT that Vaseline brand dry skin lotion used to be more effective than this.  </li>
            <li>i am a huge fan of vaseline&#x27;s entire line of products, i now use their cocoa butter products, but when i bought this it was an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>It Works Amazingly Well as a Facial Moisturizer and does NOT break me out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit thinner and once absorbed, my skin doesn&#x27;t always feel like I had put anything on/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit thinner and once absorbed, my skin doesn&#x27;t always feel like I had put anything on/</li>
            <li>I find that I like the old stuff better.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>But this is the real deal original.</li>
            <li>There is slightly more scent to this than I expected, but its a clean scent and seems to dissipate quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the formula I am used to but seems to be just fine so far.</li>
            <li>It has been replaced by the Pure Oat Extract - which I feel is much heavier.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very greasy.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel very oily.</li>
            <li>I still shop around and try other brands now and then (cause Vaseline just isn&#x27;t sexy...)</li>
            <li>In the summer, I just use it at night as a highly moisturizing mask by dabbing it on until it sinks in :)  </li>
            <li>I have skin that isn&#x27;t easily aggravated but is sensitive enough in that I often develop a rash, allergy or breakout after prolonged use of most lotions, even those that claim to be for super sensitive skin (typically 4-5+ days out).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Very, very light smell goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 bottles of what I thought was the old version (which is what it says it is, and what the picture is of) but got the Pure Oat Extract.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s frustrating because sometimes I think I&#x27;ve &#x27;found the perfect moisturizer&#x27; only to find that I can&#x27;t use it a week later.  </li>
            <li>True to its name, It moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I dont see how i can rate this new product as ZERO, so i chose 1.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Ths product blends in very quickly and leaves no lotion to be absorped slowly, as my previous product did.  </li>
            <li>being that i have very dry skin, this lotion does keep true to what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted even though I earlier posted about the oat in it.</li>
            <li>Normally it&#x27;s supposed to clear up within days.  </li>
            <li>it is fragrance free and extremely moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I primarily use it in the evening because although it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t go on oily, I do have an oily T-Zone and the oil from my skin is more pronounced several hours later because it tends to &#x27;bead up&#x27; into tiny little dots along my forehead and nose when wearing this.  </li>
            <li>-Winter months mean more dry skin, so I like to pick up a fresh bottle each year.</li>
            <li>Bring back the older one!</li>
            <li>this just makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Who is sensitive to smells now has also a problem and it is \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; like those greasy products for sun.</li>
            <li>If the old version will be back on the market then ill be happy to get it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really smell good or bad.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t oily, and really sinks in whereas other products sometimes feel like they just sit on the surface of your skin.  </li>
            <li>If you anybody know where its still possible to get the old version, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and while I didn&#x27;t originally purchase this for use as a facial moisturizer, after too many failed attempts experimenting with expensive products, cheap cult following and/or drug store brands, and even natural products - I finally caved in one night and just dabbed a bit of this onto my face.  </li>
            <li>I found that the lotion seemed to be very watered down.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m constantly using lotion to keep them from cracking and getting dry (as I wash my hands very frequently)</li>
            <li>I have severe dry sensitive skin year-round.  </li>
            <li>I reached behind my neck and all sorts of dry skin flakes of many shapes and sizes peeled off.  </li>
            <li>new replacement of the product(total moisture conditioning) which we used for years is terrible, Vaseline tried to cut costs this way, your skin will get dry again very soon after using it, people with sensitive skin should be careful, they removed all those important vitamins, even panthenol (b5) which is important after sun exposure for the body.</li>

            <li> I saw an improvement in my dry, itchy, red skin in just under a week!</li>
            <li> Some other people who bought this felt the same as I did.</li>
            <li> In the dry winter months I do wear this in the morning under my makeup and a bit of powder/blotting papers helps keep the oily look at bay by mid-afternoon.  </li>
            <li> - Vaseline brand name, I have always used their products for dry skin and this is no exception.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone that has dry, itchy skin!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping my dry skin and rashes only after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> This is worse than New Coke.</li>
            <li> This is what I consider a serious case that I don&#x27;t get every single winter (normally every 3 or 4 years) but the point here is that I immediately reached for my usually trustworthy bottle of Vaseline dry skin moisture (exactly like the one in the picture) but was disappointed to find that even after two weeks of everyday use, the dry skin has remained.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it regularly for at least 2 years now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one or the other!</li>
            <li> , what is all over your back?\\&quot; and when he pulls my shirt away a serious outbreak of dry skin was revealed, unbeknownst to me.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago my dad said to me \\&quot;Um</li>
            <li> Makes dried skin feel flexible immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my dog when he gets dried or flaky skin.</li>
            <li> No strong perfume scent.</li>
            <li> Either the brand got worse or my dry skin has reached a point of spiraling out of control.  </li>
            <li> Now it is heavy and thick.  </li>
            <li> I have ignored Vaseline products in the past as I thought it would be just greasy</li>
            <li> New stuff is horrible, hands are still dry!  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the overall quality of the product for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to absorb and pills off over &#x27;thin skin&#x27; areas like knees and shins.  </li>
            <li> Something is wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> This product has some really bad ingredients, too bad I noticed after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So sad!!  </li>
            <li> --I was so wrong!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed client!</li>

            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Goes on evenly and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. I saw an improvement in my dry, itchy, red skin in just under a week! I work with my hands so I&#x27;m constantly using lotion to keep them from cracking and getting dry (as I wash my hands very frequently) this just makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. I recommend to anyone that has dry, itchy skin!</li>
            <li> this lotion is AMAZING. being that i have very dry skin, this lotion does keep true to what it is supposed to do. it is fragrance free and extremely moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Vaseline, it seems, no longer makes this version. It has been replaced by the Pure Oat Extract - which I feel is much heavier. I bought 2 bottles of what I thought was the old version (which is what it says it is, and what the picture is of) but got the Pure Oat Extract. Just so you know...</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful!  I have skin that isn&#x27;t easily aggravated but is sensitive enough in that I often develop a rash, allergy or breakout after prolonged use of most lotions, even those that claim to be for super sensitive skin (typically 4-5+ days out).  It&#x27;s frustrating because sometimes I think I&#x27;ve &#x27;found the perfect moisturizer&#x27; only to find that I can&#x27;t use it a week later.  Vaseline Intensive Care Total Moisture however has stood the test of time.  I&#x27;ve used it regularly for at least 2 years now and it has never caused me any skin irritation &#x27;and&#x27; it&#x27;s also a very nice moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t oily, and really sinks in whereas other products sometimes feel like they just sit on the surface of your skin.  I still shop around and try other brands now and then (cause Vaseline just isn&#x27;t sexy...) but this just works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a body lotion and while I didn&#x27;t originally purchase this for use as a facial moisturizer, after too many failed attempts experimenting with expensive products, cheap cult following and/or drug store brands, and even natural products - I finally caved in one night and just dabbed a bit of this onto my face.  It Works Amazingly Well as a Facial Moisturizer and does NOT break me out.  I primarily use it in the evening because although it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t go on oily, I do have an oily T-Zone and the oil from my skin is more pronounced several hours later because it tends to &#x27;bead up&#x27; into tiny little dots along my forehead and nose when wearing this.  In the dry winter months I do wear this in the morning under my makeup and a bit of powder/blotting papers helps keep the oily look at bay by mid-afternoon.  In the summer, I just use it at night as a highly moisturizing mask by dabbing it on until it sinks in :)  I always wake up with supple skin the morning after using this as a facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own the Aloe Fresh Hydrating version of this lotion which smells nice but IMO, has a slightly different texture.  It&#x27;s a bit thinner and once absorbed, my skin doesn&#x27;t always feel like I had put anything on/doesn&#x27;t feel fully moisturized unless I reapply a second or third time.  I keep it at my desk at work for use on my hands.htly different texture.

            <li> This lotion is very greasy. It made my skin feel very oily. It didn&#x27;t really smell good or bad. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> i am a huge fan of vaseline&#x27;s entire line of products, i now use their cocoa butter products, but when i bought this it was an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted even though I earlier posted about the oat in it. But this is the real deal original. Great to see that now they have it described as such.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, it goes on smoothly, has a nice subtle scent and does the job keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I read the pros and cons before I ordered this item. I decided to take a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did. It seems to be helping my dry skin and rashes only after a few days of use. It&#x27;s not the formula I am used to but seems to be just fine so far. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great delivery time and exactly what i wanted..</li>
            <li> - Vaseline brand name, I have always used their products for dry skin and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt; -Winter months mean more dry skin, so I like to pick up a fresh bottle each year. This comes with various vitamins that supposedly help to moisturize. From what I can tell it helps!&lt;br /&gt;- There is slightly more scent to this than I expected, but its a clean scent and seems to dissipate quickly. It applies easy and moisturizes as expected.&lt;br /&gt;- Pleased with the product and will order again.</li>
            <li> This non-hydrox lotion is a perennial favorite. True to its name, It moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hunted for this version for more than a year.  I finally FOUND it in the CVS hand lotion and was happy.  Now, even CVS&#x27;s version has changed; Vaseline must make the CVS lotion, too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so upset over this change.  I&#x27;ve used--and loved--Vaseline Intensive Care for decades, but now I can no longer use it with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BRING BACK THE &amp;#34;OLD&amp;#34; FORMULA OF VASELINE INTENSIVE CARE!!  I hope the company reads these reviews...</li>
            <li> great lotion but not the phenoxyethanol</li>
            <li> I found that the lotion seemed to be very watered down.  I was disappointed in the overall quality of the product for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This product has some really bad ingredients, too bad I noticed after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever...until they changed the formula.  Now it is heavy and thick.  Takes forever to absorb and pills off over &#x27;thin skin&#x27; areas like knees and shins.  So sad!!  This is worse than New Coke.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. Vaseline intensive care lotion is the good stuff. Put it on and it immediately goes to work. Last all day. You will not be disappointed. Very, very light smell goes away after a few minutes. This is a great product. Don&#x27;t need the fancy additives. Just good quality. This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> I dont see how i can rate this new product as ZERO, so i chose 1.&lt;br /&gt;This new replacement of the product(total moisture conditioning) which we used for years is terrible, Vaseline tried to cut costs this way, your skin will get dry again very soon after using it, people with sensitive skin should be careful, they removed all those important vitamins, even panthenol (b5) which is important after sun exposure for the body. Who is sensitive to smells now has also a problem and it is \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; like those greasy products for sun. Too bad. Switching to a different brand which still cares about clients and health. If the old version will be back on the market then ill be happy to get it. If you anybody know where its still possible to get the old version, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed client!</li>
            <li> Works well! Smells good and does what it&#x27;s supposed to..Recommended! Always loved this lotion because I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> I find that I like the old stuff better. Besides, I felt that this is too greasy for my liking. Not my favorite!</li>
            <li> I switched from the Vaseline with aloe to this one for the winter since I need extra moisture. It def does the job. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice fragrant lotion, don&#x27;t go for this one but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Both my husband and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Been using the old version for years and it was great!!! Why did it change?? New stuff is horrible, hands are still dry!  States now with micro droplets of vaseline jelly. Don&#x27;t believe it, its not half as good. Bring back the older one! Patty in Boston</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have severe dry sensitive skin year-round.  Ths product blends in very quickly and leaves no lotion to be absorped slowly, as my previous product did.  I a very happy with intensive care and will order again.  I have ignored Vaseline products in the past as I thought it would be just greasy--I was so wrong!!</li>
            <li> I think Vaseline Intensive Care for dry skin is very good.  When I think to use it, it is very effective!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this Vaseline product and they stopped making it. I checked Amazon and found it. I had to pay a bit more for it but it was worth the price to me. I wish they would make this formula again. Some other people who bought this felt the same as I did. Glad I stocked up on it.</li>
            <li> I know for a FACT that Vaseline brand dry skin lotion used to be more effective than this.  A few weeks ago my dad said to me \\&quot;Um, what is all over your back?\\&quot; and when he pulls my shirt away a serious outbreak of dry skin was revealed, unbeknownst to me.  Now I can&#x27;t actually SEE my back so I took his word for it.  I didn&#x27;t need to take his or anybody&#x27;s word in all actuality- I reached behind my neck and all sorts of dry skin flakes of many shapes and sizes peeled off.  Yikes!  This is what I consider a serious case that I don&#x27;t get every single winter (normally every 3 or 4 years) but the point here is that I immediately reached for my usually trustworthy bottle of Vaseline dry skin moisture (exactly like the one in the picture) but was disappointed to find that even after two weeks of everyday use, the dry skin has remained.  Normally it&#x27;s supposed to clear up within days.  Something is wrong with this product.  Either the brand got worse or my dry skin has reached a point of spiraling out of control.  It&#x27;s one or the other!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Goes on without a greasy after feel. Makes dried skin feel flexible immediately. No strong perfume scent. I&#x27;m a guy and like this product. I&#x27;ve also used it on my dog when he gets dried or flaky skin. Works great, inexpensive.</li>
