            <li>It was recommended to keep the cap on top of the canister when not in use to avoid this problem.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Really has great hold....</li>

            <li>My hair feels better.</li>
            <li>It stopped falling off, and it feels with more volume.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a hairspray that has great hold and still looks natural.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully with the other Bosley products I have been using now for one month and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li>most are still full.  </li>
            <li>but I do use it before styling to give my really fine hair some body.  </li>
            <li>great brand have used this product before very pleased with Amazon as usual</li>
            <li>The product description is accurate.</li>
            <li>A light weight non-sticky</li>
            <li>and I meet a great number of people on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This hairspray is by far my favorite hairspray, with its free flowing hold that doesn&#x27;t seem to wear out by the end of the day!</li>
            <li>Now my hair is full and beautiful, it shines and is managable, people actually comment on how pretty my hair is.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, it really works.</li>
            <li>The next day I start over and it still looks good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important for me to look professional.</li>
            <li>I have two cans right now that do not work correctly.  </li>
            <li>It brushes out easily and leaves hair looking natural.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair volume without using much of it and no flaking!</li>
            <li>I very been using the Bosley shampoo for years and it stopped the hair loss!  </li>
            <li>I had better results with their products, and I know a hairdresser who is switching herself and her clients back to Nioxin after all of them tried Bosley.  </li>
            <li>for that reason I really did not like it.</li>
            <li>Very acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>really care for the smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to do another order .</li>
            <li>I found the product to be very inferior to the product I normally use called Mane from ManeAmerica.com</li>
            <li>My beauty operator knew I was very sensitive to the problem</li>
            <li>WOW !  </li>
            <li>I have fine thinning hair and it is not too heavy yet holds my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>I use this before styling my hair, have fine hair, helps to set the curl without leaving my hair stiff, also use it as a finishing spray.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoos and other products but this hairspray is way too stiff / harsh for fine thinning hair!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and this hairspray</li>
            <li>Within a short time I began to see new growth and so did my beauty operator.  </li>
            <li>Is mild but not overwhelming.</li>

            <li> Is mild but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> they do make my hair fuller and hold the curl/style much longer (my hair is past shoulder length).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m on my second can of this hairspray only because it is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried that didn&#x27;t dull my hair and make it look like straw.  </li>

            <li> (I shampoo every other day usually).</li>
            <li> not happy because the 2nd time I used this the sprayer clogged (or something)</li>
            <li> spray.&lt;br /&gt;Holds for a few hours at a time.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair too stiff</li>

            <li> They both squirt a small amount, then die.  </li>
            <li> When I would go on vacation or on my boat it was impossible for me to go swimming because  my hair was so thin it simply dissappeared when it was wet.  </li>

            <li> and I just can&#x27;t afford the expensive cures, etc.  </li>

            <li> I use this before styling my hair, have fine hair, helps to set the curl without leaving my hair stiff, also use it as a finishing spray.  Does not leave residue when washing my hair.  Just wish it came in an industrial size can!.... lol...</li>
            <li> The hair spray is wonderful. It gives my hair volume without using much of it and no flaking!</li>
            <li> I found the product to be very inferior to the product I normally use called Mane from ManeAmerica.com I tried it because it was from Bosley but it didn&#x27;t give the results I expected.</li>
            <li> not happy because the 2nd time I used this the sprayer clogged (or something) and I could not get it to spray anymore.............for that reason I really did not like it.</li>
            <li> I am devastated losing my hair, I am trying the Bosley stuff, makes my hair look good, maybe slows hair loss.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Does not burn scalp and keeps hair in place without a lot of stickiness.  Everyone has their own views of products, but I recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> A light weight non-sticky spray.&lt;br /&gt;Holds for a few hours at a time. Very acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t really care for the smell. Is mild but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a hairspray that has great hold and still looks natural.  The Bosley Volumizing and Thickening&lt;br /&gt;Hairspray met that expectation. The only thing keep it from a five star is that I am still looking for a spray that doesn&#x27;t have a drying effect on my hair, but actually provides support with conditioning.  I will purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoos and other products but this hairspray is way too stiff / harsh for fine thinning hair! You cant brush it out without tearing out hair! It is no different that a STIFF hold spray from any store</li>
            <li> Love Bosley products.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray as it doesn&#x27;t get gummy or make my hair impossible to comb through the next day.  It works wonderfully with the other Bosley products I have been using now for one month and will continue to use.  they do make my hair fuller and hold the curl/style much longer (my hair is past shoulder length).</li>
            <li> It seems to hold my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and makes your hair, shiny, and has more volume.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it holds, it is not sticky and you can comb through it.</li>
            <li> Bosky has had good products and you had to go to a dr.  Now just order it.</li>
            <li> Do not care for this product....The device itself is inoperable.&lt;br /&gt;Does not spray well.&lt;br /&gt;No, I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hairsprays.  I have fine thinning hair and it is not too heavy yet holds my hair in place.  I have used it exclusively for 6 years or so.  I have one complaint.  About 3 out of 12 cans of spray I have purchased quit spraying and most are still full.  I have cleaned the tip and it still does not work.  I have returned these to my stylist for replacement.  It was recommended to keep the cap on top of the canister when not in use to avoid this problem.  I always do this and it didn&#x27;t seem to help in these cases.  Otherwise, a great spray.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair too stiff</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have very fine, thin hair and this hairspray makes my hair look thicker and keeps it in place.</li>
            <li> I started using Bosley products about a year ago.  I&#x27;m a business woman and I meet a great number of people on a regular basis. It&#x27;s very important for me to look professional. A large round area on the front of my head had developed where the hair was getting so thin. I was actually doing a comb over to cover the loss.  When I would go on vacation or on my boat it was impossible for me to go swimming because  my hair was so thin it simply dissappeared when it was wet.  My beauty operator knew I was very sensitive to the problem so one day she suggested the Bosley products.  I had seen the ads on TV and one woman they featured had simular problems with her thinning.  I ordered the vitamins, shampoo and conditioner.  Within a short time I began to see new growth and so did my beauty operator.  Now my hair is full and beautiful, it shines and is managable, people actually comment on how pretty my hair is.  WOW !  Bosley products made a difference in my confidence level  and so now I&#x27;m a customer for LIFE !!</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and as described.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used enough to see a difference. Smells nice I guess but still need time to determine wether it&#x27;s a yay or nay.</li>
            <li> I truly could tell a difference with these products</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and I just can&#x27;t afford the expensive cures, etc.  I very been using the Bosley shampoo for years and it stopped the hair loss!  So I thought I should use a good hairspray.  I saw that Bosley had this one and I could not be happier!</li>
            <li> Love this product, it really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second can of this hairspray only because it is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried that didn&#x27;t dull my hair and make it look like straw.  It doesn&#x27;t have a stiff hold but I do use it before styling to give my really fine hair some body.  It brushes out easily and leaves hair looking natural.  The next day I start over and it still looks good.  (I shampoo every other day usually).</li>
            <li> Thanks so much. Your sale arrived just as promised. A+</li>
            <li> I have two cans right now that do not work correctly.  They both squirt a small amount, then die.  Product dribbles down the sides of the can.  I&#x27;ve washed the nozzles/caps and have tried clearing out the aperture, with the same results.  Nothing works...and this is not the first time I&#x27;ve had trouble with their hairspray cans!  I did an online chat with Bosley, and the person gave me the number for customer service.  That person kept trying to schedule me for a consult.  When I finally got her to listen to me, she said that I would have to go to the person who sold me the cans.  Since this is a recurring problem, I (mistakenly) thought that the company itself would want to know.  Not.  Avoid this can!  Actually, I&#x27;m switching back to the Nioxin line.  I had better results with their products, and I know a hairdresser who is switching herself and her clients back to Nioxin after all of them tried Bosley.  Don&#x27;t lose time (and hair), just go with Nioxin.</li>
            <li> Really has great hold....</li>
            <li> This hairspray is by far my favorite hairspray, with its free flowing hold that doesn&#x27;t seem to wear out by the end of the day!</li>
            <li> Works great, makes my hair feel much fuller and thicker, I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
            <li> great brand have used this product before very pleased with Amazon as usual</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied with what I purchased.</li>
            <li> Recommend to friends....</li>
            <li> very happy with this product. .would say give it a try.</li>
            <li> My hair feels better. It stopped falling off, and it feels with more volume. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and I&#x27;m ready to do another order .</li>
            <li> No problems with product</li>
            <li> It does give volume to hair and its not flaky like other products. The product description is accurate.</li>
