            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to use so much</li>
            <li>So far I have to agree with the other reviewers, this product works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It helps hair to be less fly away and gives it shine.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream, it makes my hair considerably soft.</li>
            <li>Definetly worth the try</li>
            <li>I have resorted to giving same as a gift as I think it&#x27;s worthy for sure.</li>
            <li>It is not the deep rich color nor does it smell or work as good as the cream in the larger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it looks frizzed out and very dry, the styling cream has a mild scent and makes my hair feel so nice, I highly recommend</li>
            <li>consistently reorder,</li>
            <li>Depending on hair type you can use this has a complete moisturizer or just may need light oil as I use.</li>
            <li>I order from Amazon pretty much everything</li>

            <li>It makes my hair soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I love the effectiveness of this styling cream, especially when combined in equal portion with the regular Moroccan Oil on damp hair.  </li>
            <li>Silky soft hair</li>
            <li>In saying so, I have always purchased my products DIRECTLY from their website.  </li>

            <li> Works very well especially for longer cuts, thick hair where you don&#x27;t want obvious product.  </li>
            <li> I use it to blow dry my hair or before I flat iron it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s water based, NOT creamy and there is no scent, which I found strange because that&#x27;s what their products are known for- the richness and aroma.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Since I have been using moraccan oil - for about a year, I have not had the dry frizzy ends that I used to get</li>

            <li> so I can tame it.</li>
            <li> day, I decided to buy a few items from amazon and saw a few sellers were offering moroccan oil products, and at a cheaper price!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was such a waste of money!!!!  </li>
            <li> and lately I started doubt</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel fabulous and it has decreased the frizziness!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It simply would not unlock regardless of what was tried, making it impossible to dispense the product.  </li>

            <li> Excelent product and seller!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It saves me from humidity and allows me to style my thick coarse hair however I want.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with frizz and manage my hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help with either.</li>
            <li> very nice product.  great smelling and works very-very well - while pricey I have resorted to giving same as a gift as I think it&#x27;s worthy for sure.</li>
            <li> There is nothing not to like on this cream. (I know that sentence sounds kinda weird, but that&#x27;s what I can say about the product.</li>
            <li> Love it! Silky soft hair</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> Love this product. Been using for years as a heat protectant on wet hair prior to blow drying. Gives a very smooth finish. I have very thick &amp; course African American hair.</li>

            <li> I am a huge fan of Moroccan oil hydrating styling cream and have used it for years.  The smaller bottles I have ordered in my last two orders have not been the same cream as in the larger bottles no longer available via your site.  It is not the deep rich color nor does it smell or work as good as the cream in the larger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile and I have ordered previously with other dealer and came with the product which smells nothing like the original product I used before. I ordered this from Beautacious and It smells like a plastic doll. Morrocan oil hydrating cream has distinct fragrant and Im really not sure what this is. Im going to return this and order from their website. I order from Amazon pretty much everything and lately I started doubt every beauty product I order worrying about fake product. Amazon should verify sources before they allow these seller to list fake products.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who&#x27;d been using Moroccan oil up until now. She prefers this cream over the oil. So...I guess it&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
            <li> Morroccan Oil is my new most favorite thing. I have natural curly hair and between the hair color, the blow dryer and the straightener, my hair dries out pretty easily, the ends especially. Since I have been using moraccan oil - for about a year, I have not had the dry frizzy ends that I used to get and I have lots of shine! My hair is also pretty soft. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I put this on before i blow dry my hair and after I am done drying my hair feels silky, soft and appears frizz free, I have nat dark brown hair, but it is colored and highlited pretty heavily, and I have thin hair and somewhat wavy so without anything in my hair it looks frizzed out and very dry, the styling cream has a mild scent and makes my hair feel so nice, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Not too thick.&lt;br /&gt;Will consistently reorder,</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it makes my hair considerably soft. I have somewhat coarse hair with a kinkier tecture and this product makes my hair soft. I use it to blow dry my hair or before I flat iron it. Depending on hair type you can use this has a complete moisturizer or just may need light oil as I use. I think it&#x27;s perfect for all ethnicities and I would just experiment with how it can best serve your own hairtype. It not greasy, it squirts out fast and in a thick consistency but it&#x27;s surprisingly light and effective moisturizer, I&#x27;m still impressed. Definetly worth the try and all will be used after you experiment a bit.</li>
            <li> So far I have to agree with the other reviewers, this product works wonderfully.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is not only the best brand on the market if works for all hair types. If you like a &amp;#34;spicey&amp;#34; scent (like a male or a woman who prefers sandalwood) this is the greatest scent, if you have naturally curly hair as I do you have found your answer for control. I use the shampoo and conditioner, Oil, hydrating cream and glimmer spray. Enjoy</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the results of this product! It makes my hair feel fabulous and it has decreased the frizziness!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Everything was excellent!</li>
            <li> Great.  It makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I am black and my hair is very thick, curly and long. I like to style my hair without using too many products because it weighs my hair down so much. I heard lots of great things about Moroccan Oil and I figured I would give it a try. My hair is relaxed which helps take out a lot of the frizz from my hair so I can tame it. This styling cream is amazing. It smells great and is so light weight. After I wash my hair I place enough for the length and thickness of my hair and I don&#x27;t have to put in anything else. I just use a towel to scrunch my hair and shape the curl. I love that I don&#x27;t have to use so much but I also use a shampoo and conditioner with Moroccan oil which takes all the frizz out. The shipping was free and fast and the price was great. I will buy more of this product.</li>
            <li> Love Moroccanoil hair products</li>
            <li> I am a regular customer when it comes to all Moroccan Oil products.  In saying so, I have always purchased my products DIRECTLY from their website.  It is unfortunate, however, that buying more than one product (from their website) can become quite pricey!  I&#x27;m sure you all agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, I decided to buy a few items from amazon and saw a few sellers were offering moroccan oil products, and at a cheaper price!  I was so excited.... but only until I received the product :(&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied it to my hair, I knew instantly that it was a fake!  It&#x27;s water based, NOT creamy and there is no scent, which I found strange because that&#x27;s what their products are known for- the richness and aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was such a waste of money!!!!  More money now as I have to purchase another bottle :(&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned my lesson for sure. People say, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t pay retail?&amp;#34;  I say.... &amp;#34;beware if you DON&#x27;T!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is a great leave in conditioner.  It helps hair to be less fly away and gives it shine.  It also smells great too!</li>
            <li> I have the worst hair in the world. Soft fine thinning wavy curls with dry ends. I use this on the ends and it helps keep the curl. It&#x27;s not a sticky product which is a plus. The sticky products tangle my ends  This doesn&#x27;t. I put it on half dry hair. Bought one for the gym.</li>
            <li> Absolute best product on the market I use this every time I wash my hair, amazing.  Love it!!!! the best on the market</li>
            <li> This product is ideal for curly, frizzy hair. This is all I use every single ay. I&#x27;ve loved it for years.</li>
            <li> I love the effectiveness of this styling cream, especially when combined in equal portion with the regular Moroccan Oil on damp hair.  However, the product I received had a defective pump.  It simply would not unlock regardless of what was tried, making it impossible to dispense the product.  A hairstylist at a local salon shared with me that he has frequently encountered the problem and returned defective ones to the rep.  I am currently trying to return the one I received from Brilliant Beauty Supply.  In summary, love the styling cream but due to the problems with the pump I suggest considering buying this locally for ease of return if necessary.</li>
