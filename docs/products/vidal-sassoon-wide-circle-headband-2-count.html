            <li>These are great!</li>
            <li>Good price!</li>
            <li>However, I did find a great use for them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the headbands look very nice in the hair and will make for a great statement.</li>
            <li>they are good neutral colors and work for what i needed.</li>
            <li>and they are great earring trees for all my earrings :-)</li>
            <li>very cute, I just received them and I can&#x27;t wait to wear them out.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>So glad I found these!</li>
            <li>Superfast shipping and these head bands are just lovely!</li>
            <li>They were nice for the month we had them, though.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have any give to them, so they snap very easily.</li>
            <li>I love these handbands; they were also nicely priced.</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable and don&#x27;t cause headaches like some do.</li>
            <li>I liked them while they lasted - but the plastic seemed brittle and broke easily.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE these headbands.</li>
            <li>It fit nicely in my hair</li>
            <li>these are super cute and fit good.</li>
            <li>Love these, they fit great and actually grip my hair.</li>
            <li>Cute and looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>If you take good care of it like I do, you can make is last a year.</li>
            <li>These are cute and are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it would work for a child in elementary school.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice and the circular design is very simple.</li>
            <li>These are actually wider than I had expected, but they look great!</li>
            <li>When I readjusted the head band to try and get a comfortable fit and have my hair pushed back the way I wanted the head band broke.</li>
            <li>These are nice looking and wide.</li>
            <li>does not lay flat on top of head and one of them broke</li>
            <li>doesnt lay flat on top of head.</li>
            <li>Item as described fast shipping</li>
            <li>Love that it comes in brown and black as to pretty much match everything.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a small head, but these fit fine and don&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li>I maybe back though, because I do love the way they look while they last.</li>
            <li>My main issue is with the quality.</li>
            <li>My main concern is the quality.</li>
            <li>So I need a strong, durable headband that&#x27;ll have so much strength that it&#x27;ll cause me a headache, just so I can look presentable with my hair down.</li>
            <li>When you have the kind of thick naturally curly hair that I do, you need a hair band that is strong and wide enough to hold your hair without giving you a headache.</li>
            <li>have a lot of hair, not only that, but my hair is also quite thick and horrendously curly, the kind of curly where you can hide several tree sticks if you&#x27;d like and I&#x27;ll never become aware of their presence.</li>
            <li>I give it only 4 stars because they are really light and feel a little cheap, but they are loose</li>
            <li>If you plan on buying these, make sure your hair is both straight and incredibly thin and not by any means wavy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to return them because they really serve me no purpose now other than for me to shame them and tell them how much they have dishonored my family and my cows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These fit a little tight on my daughters head, but they are very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li>Just like one of the previous review said, it didn&#x27;t sit flat on top of my head, and so looked kind of awkward.  </li>
            <li>These are cute and all but after wearing them a few times I found that they slightly cracked leading them to break.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing the black one as we speak ;)</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that they could be longer and come down a little farther behind my ear, might be a little more comfortable that way, but I didn&#x27;t take off a star because I do have a larger head and someone more average wouldn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>

            <li> I am an adult and very careful with my hair wear.</li>
            <li> The plastic is a little on the thin side and will not last more then a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a TON of compliments on them, however, I only wear them rarely and the black one has 2 small cracks that will eventually snap the entire headband.</li>
            <li> If you give it to kids, it might not last as long as they are not as gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have worn headbands off and on for many years when in awkward hair growing stages.  </li>
            <li> If you are rough with it, it will not last as long.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty small head and these were t0o tight and gave me an excruciating headache by the end of the work day.</li>
            <li> No good for for natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> These did not fit properly.  </li>
            <li> They are tight, but not so tight that I end up with a headache 10 minutes later.  </li>
            <li> These are a little too tight at the ends above the ears.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how they would work if they had to hold hair back, though, and weren&#x27;t just for decoration.</li>
            <li> One black and the other brown.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get headaches wearing it like I have in the past with other headbands.</li>
            <li> and I did not find the teeth to be to harsh.</li>
            <li> However, it does not fit against the head as well as it should.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find Vidal Sasson headbands in local stores for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> I have natura,l thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I do not have wild hair, but I hate when the frizz gets in my face as I am trying to concentrate</li>
            <li> Hard to find!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair though but theynwould work for a medium texture too.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable with the head.</li>
            <li> These headbands were painful to wear and gave me headaches.  </li>

            <li> I love these handbands; they were also nicely priced.</li>
            <li> I got them and within of wearing them they broke.</li>
            <li> Just like one of the previous review said, it didn&#x27;t sit flat on top of my head, and so looked kind of awkward.  I haven&#x27;t worn them because of that...</li>
            <li> These did not fit properly.  These headbands were painful to wear and gave me headaches.  I got rid of them and would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty small head and these were t0o tight and gave me an excruciating headache by the end of the work day. Perhaps it would work for a child in elementary school. However, I did find a great use for them. I hang them off the side of a plant I have in my room and they are great earring trees for all my earrings :-)</li>
            <li> I liked them while they lasted - but the plastic seemed brittle and broke easily.</li>
            <li> These are cute and all but after wearing them a few times I found that they slightly cracked leading them to break..... I don&#x27;t know about these......</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE these headbands. I&#x27;ve gotten a TON of compliments on them, however, I only wear them rarely and the black one has 2 small cracks that will eventually snap the entire headband. I maybe back though, because I do love the way they look while they last.</li>
            <li> I have worn headbands off and on for many years when in awkward hair growing stages.  These are a little too tight at the ends above the ears.  I have tried submerging them in boiling water then placing them around a fat roll of paper towels to widen them but so far not much help.  I like this style and color however.</li>
            <li> These are just what I needed to add some flair to my super-short pixie cut. I don&#x27;t have a small head, but these fit fine and don&#x27;t pinch. I am not sure how they would work if they had to hold hair back, though, and weren&#x27;t just for decoration. My one complaint is that they could be longer and come down a little farther behind my ear, might be a little more comfortable that way, but I didn&#x27;t take off a star because I do have a larger head and someone more average wouldn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> These fit a little tight on my daughters head, but they are very pretty to look at. she wears them even though she gets a headache.</li>
            <li> Love these! Good price! Serves its purpose!</li>
            <li> When you have the kind of thick naturally curly hair that I do, you need a hair band that is strong and wide enough to hold your hair without giving you a headache. These are great!</li>
            <li> I got these headbands as I am not fond of having my hair in my face. I do not have wild hair, but I hate when the frizz gets in my face as I am trying to concentrate so I decided to give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set came with two headbands. One black and the other brown. The colors are nice and the circular design is very simple. It fit nicely in my hair and I did not find the teeth to be to harsh. My main issue is with the quality. The plastic is a little on the thin side and will not last more then a year. I am an adult and very careful with my hair wear. If you give it to kids, it might not last as long as they are not as gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the headbands look very nice in the hair and will make for a great statement. My main concern is the quality. If you take good care of it like I do, you can make is last a year. If you are rough with it, it will not last as long.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find Vidal Sasson headbands in local stores for a couple of years now. So glad I found these! They are very comfortable and don&#x27;t cause headaches like some do. These are actually wider than I had expected, but they look great!</li>
            <li> these are super cute and fit good. they are good neutral colors and work for what i needed. i will wear alot</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have any give to them, so they snap very easily. They were nice for the month we had them, though.</li>
            <li> Item as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> These are cute and are very sturdy.  They are tight, but not so tight that I end up with a headache 10 minutes later.  The teeth help to keep the headband in place all day.  Love that it comes in brown and black as to pretty much match everything.</li>
            <li> These are nice looking and wide. They will hold back your hair, however expect to break them in. They will pinch after awhile.</li>
            <li> If you plan on buying these, make sure your hair is both straight and incredibly thin and not by any means wavy.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair, not only that, but my hair is also quite thick and horrendously curly, the kind of curly where you can hide several tree sticks if you&#x27;d like and I&#x27;ll never become aware of their presence. So I need a strong, durable headband that&#x27;ll have so much strength that it&#x27;ll cause me a headache, just so I can look presentable with my hair down. Hella yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up having to return them because they really serve me no purpose now other than for me to shame them and tell them how much they have dishonored my family and my cows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Cute and looks exactly like the picture.  However, it does not fit against the head as well as it should.</li>
            <li> does not lay flat on top of head and one of them broke doesnt lay flat on top of head.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable with the head.</li>
            <li> Hard to find! Love these, they fit great and actually grip my hair. I have thin hair though but theynwould work for a medium texture too.</li>
            <li> Superfast shipping and these head bands are just lovely!</li>
            <li> I have natura,l thick, curly hair. I am 4b/c hair type. The head bands broke. Even with the teeth on these they couldn&#x27;t get a grip to push my hair off of my face. When I readjusted the head band to try and get a comfortable fit and have my hair pushed back the way I wanted the head band broke. No good for for natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> Grandma likes them so I like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing the black one as we speak ;) very cute, I just received them and I can&#x27;t wait to wear them out. I give it only 4 stars because they are really light and feel a little cheap, but they are loose so I don&#x27;t get headaches wearing it like I have in the past with other headbands. I&#x27;d buy again</li>
