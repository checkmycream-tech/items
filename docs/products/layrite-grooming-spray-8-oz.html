    <ol>
            <li>Product works great!</li>
            <li>Works great as a setting lotion!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Products work great together and my hair looks great!</li>
            <li>Works great with layrite pomade.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great product for my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Good hair product for men.</li>
            <li>Good smell too.  </li>
            <li>great thing is, it’s cruelty free and made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>but once you do you&#x27;ll use it every day like me :)</li>
            <li>I just wish it smelled more like the pomade.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had to buy more.</li>
            <li>but, wish it smelled better</li>
            <li>I thought it would help hold my pomp through a hot day better than a pomade alone, but can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s been the case.</li>
            <li>It smells like rubbing alcohol instead of the original formula.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a GREAT product and it take a little time to understand how it works</li>
            <li>Makes everything going smooth and very workable</li>
            <li>Received item quickly and as described, thanks!</li>
            <li>I use this product every day right after i take a shower, i style my wet hair, I spray my hair with this grooming spray and let it sit for an hour or two, after that I blow dry my hair and it looks almost perfect!!!</li>
            <li>My hair looks exactly the way i want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it especially for my hairstyle.</li>
            <li>Drys fast and holds the style even when I brush my hair out.</li>
            <li>Used this in combination with LayRite and Shiner Gold - doesn&#x27;t really do much besides make my hair crustier.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a must have when sculpting with layrite.</li>
            <li>Really helps the pomade spread evenly</li>
            <li>Add a little bit or lay right pomade and BAM!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>the hold is not strong, will be better if stronger ...</li>
            <li>I like a tough spray and my had is long, this product will work perfect for the more thin, shorter hair.</li>
            <li>If you drive a convertible, your hair will clearly get messed up, but if not, this should help keep your style all day.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a tad bit masculine, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>Two things I definitely look for when trying new products.</li>
            <li>There’s no dry brittle feeling and no alcohol-y scent like you get with hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy fairly coarse hair, but after using the spray, my hair styles naturally and easily without any other products, but I do use a harder hold pomade after spray dries.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great with layrite pomade.</li>
            <li> I use grooming spray after I use Upper Cut pomade to style my hair.  Grooming spray ensures that my hair won’t “puff” halfway through the day (yeah, I get a weird white dude fro if I have nothing in my hair..its scary and hideous)&lt;br /&gt;This gives your hair a lot of control.  If you drive a convertible, your hair will clearly get messed up, but if not, this should help keep your style all day.  There’s no dry brittle feeling and no alcohol-y scent like you get with hairspray.  It performs almost like a hair tonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing is, it’s cruelty free and made in the USA.  Two things I definitely look for when trying new products.</li>
            <li> the hold is not strong, will be better if stronger ...</li>
            <li> I use this with Motions Foaming Wrap Lotion to set my hair in pin curls. Drys fast and holds the style even when I brush my hair out.</li>
            <li> It feels like you just came from the barbershop after using this product.</li>
            <li> Received item quickly and as described, thanks!</li>
            <li> Good hair product for men.</li>
            <li> Product works great! Helps keep my hair in please</li>
            <li> Used this in combination with LayRite and Shiner Gold - doesn&#x27;t really do much besides make my hair crustier. I thought it would help hold my pomp through a hot day better than a pomade alone, but can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s been the case. Just end up with a crusty, crispy head when I use this.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day right after i take a shower, i style my wet hair, I spray my hair with this grooming spray and let it sit for an hour or two, after that I blow dry my hair and it looks almost perfect!!! Add a little bit or lay right pomade and BAM!!! My hair looks exactly the way i want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a GREAT product and it take a little time to understand how it works but once you do you&#x27;ll use it every day like me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Works great as a setting lotion! The scent is a tad bit masculine, but I don&#x27;t mind it. Great product!</li>
            <li> If you use Layrite pomade, use this too.  This is great stuff.  I just wish it smelled more like the pomade.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have when sculpting with layrite.</li>
            <li> This product was in a similar bottle labeled Hawleywoods Grooming Solution.  You will still find products misleading you.  This is not the same formulation as Hawleywoods.  It smells like rubbing alcohol instead of the original formula.  Do not buy this crap if you want the original.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it.  Hawleywood had a falling out with Layrite and although they say the formulation is the same, THEY ARE LYING!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other grooming or prepping spray.  Makes everything going smooth and very workable</li>
            <li> The local barber recommended this product to me. I love it especially for my hairstyle. My wife uses it now so I&#x27;ve had to buy more. Spray it on after the shower and blow dry it. After apply the layrite pomade. Products work great together and my hair looks great! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the one I would buy at the barbershop but cheaper cost.</li>
            <li> Really helps the pomade spread evenly</li>
            <li> I like a tough spray and my had is long, this product will work perfect for the more thin, shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Worked well, held my hair and puffed it up a but, wish it smelled better</li>
            <li> Great product for my son&#x27;s hair. Used with the layrite pomade it gets my sons hair to do the style he wants without leaving it stiff and flakey.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t found a larger size bottle.  I have thick, wavy fairly coarse hair, but after using the spray, my hair styles naturally and easily without any other products, but I do use a harder hold pomade after spray dries.  Good smell too.  Thank you Layrite.</li>
