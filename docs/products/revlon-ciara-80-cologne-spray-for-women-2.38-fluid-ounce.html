            <li>One of my favorite perfumes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;We discovered the 80% version and find it much more pleasant than the 100%.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell any vanilla in this perfume, but it smells nice</li>
            <li>This seller sent the perfume quickly and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to go on line and find it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it is a fragrance with some time on the market is the first time I use it and it has been very nice, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>WEARING FOR MANY YEARS, ALWAYS RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS OR &amp;#34;WHO IS THAT THAT SMELLS SO GOOD&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I receive many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite scent and the bottle or scent has not changed.</li>
            <li>I love it üëç..</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite cologne for about 15 years.  </li>
            <li>it get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Most of the people I know they refer to me as the &amp;#34; CIARA LADY&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>I love the scent and receive many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and love it.</li>
            <li>pretty good perfume for the price.</li>
            <li>shipped fast, good rpice</li>
            <li>you like something light not over powering fragrance I reccomend this.</li>
            <li>wonderful light scent last a long time and the company that packed it - packed it very well and secured.</li>
            <li>It keeps you smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to find this parfume again and such reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>My one an only perfume for the passed 34 years or more.....</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed this, It was very astringent and smelled like bug spray</li>
            <li>The bottle was new and smelled exactly like what it should have!</li>
            <li>only scent I use is not annoying to others</li>
            <li>I will keep buying, Might give for gifts also.. fast service.</li>
            <li>It was fast, accurate, and exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>I first came across Ciara in the early 1980s.</li>
            <li>The fragnance is long lasting for sure.</li>
            <li>But after a few seconds/minutes the astringent old lady smell went away and it was very sweet and powdery.</li>
            <li>I would recomemnd this to anyone who is looking for a long lasting cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ciara since 1980 or maybe earlier, and very often I get complimented on the scent and even get stopped from strangers for the name of the perfume.....</li>
            <li>Ciara for women is my favorite perfume I have wore this for a long time and since it&#x27;s getting hard to find</li>
