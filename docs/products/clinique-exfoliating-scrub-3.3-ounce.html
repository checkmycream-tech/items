            <li>Best scrub .  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and by mid-morning, my face still looks and feels so incredibly oily!  </li>
            <li>I swear, the best thing is the Exfoliating Scrub.</li>
            <li>This is the best exfoliater ever.</li>
            <li>This is the best exfoliating scrub I have found.  </li>
            <li>Great price too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really impressed.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve used around 1-2x/week, depending on the season.</li>
            <li>perfect texture, great product</li>
            <li>Fair price and great shipping!</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>However, I wanted to write the review because I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This scrub is great and does not encourage bacterial growth within the tube (and so there for no acne).</li>
            <li>Aside from that, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Clinique is a great brand, and there is no doubt</li>
            <li>This scrub is great.</li>
            <li>My face ALWAYS feels smooth and wonderfully radiant!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to realize that a lot of womens skincare products are just superior</li>
            <li>I have loved this product for years.</li>
            <li>Good substitute for Pernox.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon exist &amp; that the seller has this product I will buy again!</li>
            <li>but I really love this one!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a nice cooling effect on the skin from the menthol.</li>
            <li>Rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most effective products of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower, which makes it very easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 7+ years, and I consistently receive comments from people that my skin is \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;, or that i have \\&quot;great skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>So this is a better choice for oily skins, but I have to admit that I like using it more when my skin is more prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied and wish i had found it years ago.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and more even.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell it at all, and find it refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But some may find it refreshing.</li>
            <li>so basically try it and see if you like it :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for so many years.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Clinque scrub for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Fresh &amp; exhilarating.</li>
            <li>the best scrub, instant results</li>
            <li>I have used it for YEARS, and have never found anything better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell- and find it refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>great product, first time use, is better than some higher priced scrubs.</li>
            <li>Love this for my skin, but it&#x27;s not cruetly free...</li>
            <li>It does seems to clean my face OK.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling after using this product because it makes my skin feel really cool</li>
            <li>The fine beads make all the difference in leaving my face feeling truly scrubbed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great as a morning scrub, although I am only giving it 4 stars because I felt that it was drying.     </li>
            <li>&quot; according to Clinique, meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>Enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and is not needed daily.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the granules and my face glows and feels clean and fresh after using.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this item to others looking for a nice smooth skin with out the drying effect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to find exactly what I was looking for in one product as my skin tends to be pretty calm but since hitting thirty goes through these fits of oily/dry/blotchy patches of acne</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean without it.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It washes off clean, without leaving any residue or oil, at all-  </li>
            <li>So far, I love it!  </li>
            <li>It had the bits of sand or whatever in it, and it REALLY scrubbed my face clean, to the point of being able to feel/see the difference.</li>
            <li>Better for me than the gentle seven day scrub</li>
            <li>Finally I bought this stuff because I had heard good things about it, and</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure a lot of people will think that is way to much...</li>
            <li>I contribute it to good genes and this facial scrub!</li>
            <li>I really love the tingly feel of my skin after I rinse it off and how smooth and soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>This scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin.</li>
            <li>To date, my favorite exfoliating wash/scrub has been the older Proactiv face wash.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for your new favorite scrub, you gotta try this.</li>
            <li>But the main thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that waking up in the morning after using it prior to bed, my skin has never been so soft, polished, and perfect.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so fresh after I use it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night after using wipes to remove makeup and it leaves my face soft, fresh looking and blotchy free!</li>
            <li>It cleans so well that it is important to protect your face after the shower, so be sure and put on a bit of facial lotion afterwards</li>
            <li>It is really worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, the clean and fresh sensation that leaves in your face, but I understand that is not for everyone</li>
            <li>This exfoliator feels right if you like something with a bit of muscle.</li>
            <li>This scrub makes your face feel clean, soft and fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>This is not like scrub that will leave your skin soft and smooth temporarily for a day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I can say this is quite better than the Proactiv, however if it is not, it is definitely 2nd to it.</li>
            <li>(I use it more often than once a week), I got several comments about my complexion, saying that I looked radiant.  </li>
            <li>And I have pretty oily skin that gets blotchy, so</li>
            <li>It does a good job getting rid of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth for whole week.</li>
            <li>Since I had heard good things about this Clinique product in the past I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this scrub I used it when I was a teen in high school</li>
            <li>refreshing, makes skin radiant and doesn&#x27;t dry it</li>
            <li>I have combo skin (more dry)</li>
            <li>but I easily went back to the Clinique one.</li>
            <li>and it helped so much to keep acne at bay.</li>
            <li>I will gradually increase how much I use to see how much it controls the oil.</li>
            <li>I really like this scrub.</li>
            <li>With the exfoiliating scrub, they are very concentrated.  </li>
            <li>Too much?  </li>
            <li>It is one of the things I really like about it.  </li>
            <li>/clean and really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to find St. Ives Apricot Scrub in my shower one day and instead of the Clinique I tried to use that one instead.</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>So far this has been my favorite facial exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and not drying like the other item.  </li>
            <li>I actually found they are able to get into your skin better to really remove any dead skin and clean deeply.</li>
            <li>The grains are very condensed, more so than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>No drying, but leaves you with the same clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>The texture is rough, the grains are fine, and it feels like product really works.</li>
            <li>If you have normal/combination skin, I would highly recommend it for the T-Zone.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t care for (which some people might really love) is that when applying it and using it, it gives off a really minty icy feeling, kinda like when you use tea tree stuff.</li>
            <li>I chose Clinique due to it being fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>For my birthday my husband bought for me all new face care.</li>
            <li>I use a tiny bit of this in the shower a few times weekly and it seems to do a better job of exfoliating that many other products out there.  </li>
            <li>To use, massage onto clean, wet skin in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>It really clears my pores like no other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive complexions beware!</li>
            <li>This might be better used for exfoliation on other areas of the body, for example, the back, feet, or elbows.  </li>
            <li>I like Noxzema cleanser and the smell, so I don&#x27;t mind the natural menthol fragrance in this scrub.</li>
            <li>I really like this facial exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told I look 10-15 years younger than I really am.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some reviewers complaining about the \\&quot;menthol smell\\&quot;, it&#x27;s so not strong; it&#x27;s refreshing actually.</li>
            <li>It is a thick, white paste packed with medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than in Clinique&#x27;s \\&quot;7 Day Scrub\\&quot; for normal skin.</li>
            <li>The only scrub I use on my very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I never used to use an exfoliating cream on my face and had dry flaky skin under my eyes, no matter how much I moisturized.</li>
            <li>Some facial exfoliators use those gel beads that feel completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>The scrub also contains salicylic acid, so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types, especially if used frequently.</li>
            <li>but they have simply not worked nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I always use moisturizer, and you will need to use one after using this scrub if you have anything other than very oily skin.     </li>
            <li>it really is THAT good-it also has the minty feeling I didn&#x27;t expect that other reviews mention.</li>
            <li>This is the harshest, most caustic facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have Normal to Dry Skin but the pores around my nose are getting bigger.</li>

            <li> I actually found they are able to get into your skin better to really remove any dead skin and clean deeply.</li>
            <li> The grains are very condensed, more so than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> No drying, but leaves you with the same clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> The texture is rough, the grains are fine, and it feels like product really works.</li>
            <li> If you have normal/combination skin, I would highly recommend it for the T-Zone.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t care for (which some people might really love) is that when applying it and using it, it gives off a really minty icy feeling, kinda like when you use tea tree stuff.</li>
            <li> I chose Clinique due to it being fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> For my birthday my husband bought for me all new face care.</li>
            <li> I use a tiny bit of this in the shower a few times weekly and it seems to do a better job of exfoliating that many other products out there.  </li>
            <li> To use, massage onto clean, wet skin in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> It really clears my pores like no other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive complexions beware!</li>
            <li> This might be better used for exfoliation on other areas of the body, for example, the back, feet, or elbows.  </li>
            <li> I like Noxzema cleanser and the smell, so I don&#x27;t mind the natural menthol fragrance in this scrub.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told I look 10-15 years younger than I really am.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some reviewers complaining about the \\&quot;menthol smell\\&quot;, it&#x27;s so not strong; it&#x27;s refreshing actually.</li>
            <li> It is a thick, white paste packed with medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than in Clinique&#x27;s \\&quot;7 Day Scrub\\&quot; for normal skin.</li>
            <li> The only scrub I use on my very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I never used to use an exfoliating cream on my face and had dry flaky skin under my eyes, no matter how much I moisturized.</li>
            <li> Some facial exfoliators use those gel beads that feel completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> The scrub also contains salicylic acid, so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types, especially if used frequently.</li>
            <li> but they have simply not worked nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I always use moisturizer, and you will need to use one after using this scrub if you have anything other than very oily skin.     </li>
            <li> it really is THAT good-it also has the minty feeling I didn&#x27;t expect that other reviews mention.</li>
            <li> This is the harshest, most caustic facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have Normal to Dry Skin but the pores around my nose are getting bigger.</li>
            <li> Some facial exfoliating lotions have bigger grains that feel few and far between.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin, and my skin is slightly red after using, but that subsides in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This scrub helps clear away those dead skin cells as long as I use twice a week.</li>
            <li> The grains in the 7-day scrub are few and far between.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used Clinique for so long but</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bad product and I would give it several more tries</li>
            <li> Having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels softer afterwards and less flaky.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub every other day on my face and it is the ONLY thing that removes the flakes undery eyes as well as any other flaky area on my face.</li>
            <li> I mix a pea-sized dab of this with a tiny dab of St Ives Apricot Scrub for an extra little scrub-a-dub!!</li>
            <li> Spent a couple of hundred dollars at dermatologist to shrink them</li>
            <li> Careful not to get it in your eyes, as I did once while rinsing it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money, even though it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> It has also removed the white &amp;#34;cholesterol bumps&amp;#34; I had..give tbat about a few weeks for removal.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s unsuitable for sensitive skin, and it stinks to high heaven.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the old Clinique scrub.</li>
            <li> i might even dare try other clinique products based on the reveiws here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased all the other cheaper drug store brand scrubs and face wash</li>
            <li> and I shower every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of some of their other products</li>
            <li> the feeling of St. Ives&#x27; was a bit rough and the smell was less preferable to that of Clinique.</li>
            <li> I do agree that if you have sensitive skin, it might be irritating, but almost any scrub would be irritating to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to try other scrubs to see if any of them will match up to Clinique&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Skip that 7 day scrub mess.</li>
            <li> and then I try another product in hopes of finding something a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Just add a little water.</li>
            <li> The texture and smell remind me a little of mint toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, so if you&#x27;re a guy and afraid of buying something perfumey don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I use Tazaroc 1% everyday, so my skin cell shed lot faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few exfoliating products over the years and this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have bought a few lower price scrubs but threw them away before I used them up because they just did not work like this product does.</li>
            <li> Just need a small amount to work well, add a little water and scrub your face for a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> It scrubs away all the dead skin cells, smells minty, and wakes you up!</li>
            <li> I feel like this has been a hidden secret</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t rub too hard (well, that goes for any scrub).</li>
            <li> Use common sense.</li>
            <li> I have acne, oily and thick skin.</li>
            <li> I have not had problems with it irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> All others fail in comparison.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought it in years because it&#x27;s an expensive product at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The performance isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> The olfactory aesthetics are atrocious.</li>
            <li> Went two weeks without it and looked horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I always use this scrub. It is great.</li>
            <li> perfect texture, great product</li>
            <li> I like Noxzema cleanser and the smell, so I don&#x27;t mind the natural menthol fragrance in this scrub. It&#x27;s really great as a morning scrub, although I am only giving it 4 stars because I felt that it was drying.     So this is a better choice for oily skins, but I have to admit that I like using it more when my skin is more prone to breakouts. I always use moisturizer, and you will need to use one after using this scrub if you have anything other than very oily skin.     Recommended : For Oily Skin Types</li>
            <li> Best scrub .  All others fail in comparison.</li>
            <li> Better for me than the gentle seven day scrub</li>
            <li> I love this scrub I used it when I was a teen in high school and it helped so much to keep acne at bay. I haven&#x27;t bought it in years because it&#x27;s an expensive product at Macy&#x27;s. So glad Amazon exist &amp; that the seller has this product I will buy again! Clinique</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago.  Although the instructions say to use it 3-4 times a week, I wanted to start off using it 2 -3 times a week to see how my skin reacts to it.  So far, I love it!  I really love the tingly feel of my skin after I rinse it off and how smooth and soft my skin feels.  I have oily skin and by mid-morning, my face still looks and feels so incredibly oily!  I will gradually increase how much I use to see how much it controls the oil.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without this scrub, use about once/week</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub at Macy&#x27;s not at Amazon. However, I wanted to write the review because I think it is a great product. This is not like scrub that will leave your skin soft and smooth temporarily for a day. It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth for whole week. It does a good job getting rid of dead skin cells. I have acne, oily and thick skin. I use Tazaroc 1% everyday, so my skin cell shed lot faster. This scrub helps clear away those dead skin cells as long as I use twice a week. You can actually feel it working because of the physical friction it causes.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday! My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean without it. I mix a pea-sized dab of this with a tiny dab of St Ives Apricot Scrub for an extra little scrub-a-dub!! My face ALWAYS feels smooth and wonderfully radiant!</li>
            <li> I really like this facial exfoliating scrub. I&#x27;ve bought quite a few exfoliating products over the years and this one is a keeper. The lotion feels like liquid sandpaper, which I like. The texture is rough, the grains are fine, and it feels like product really works. Some facial exfoliating lotions have bigger grains that feel few and far between. Some facial exfoliators use those gel beads that feel completely ineffective. This exfoliator feels right if you like something with a bit of muscle. The grains are very condensed, more so than any other product I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s notsomething I would use daily and I believe the tube advises against that too. It&#x27;s something I use maybe 1-2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy and have tried a number of &#x27;mens&#x27; facial exfoliators. I&#x27;ve come to realize that a lot of womens skincare products are just superior, this being one of them. This product doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, so if you&#x27;re a guy and afraid of buying something perfumey don&#x27;t worry. There&#x27;s also a nice cooling effect on the skin from the menthol. It leaves you feeling refreshed and helps wake you up in the morning. So far this has been my favorite facial exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> I have Normal to Dry Skin but the pores around my nose are getting bigger. Yuck! Spent a couple of hundred dollars at dermatologist to shrink them but it didn&#x27;t help at all.  For my birthday my husband bought for me all new face care. I chose Clinique due to it being fragrance free.  I swear, the best thing is the Exfoliating Scrub. By the time you get through 1/2 the tube you will see a difference in the texture of your skin. I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 7+ years, and I consistently receive comments from people that my skin is \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;, or that i have \\&quot;great skin\\&quot;.  I use a tiny bit of this in the shower a few times weekly and it seems to do a better job of exfoliating that many other products out there.  My skin definitely feels softer afterwards and less flaky.  I have sensitive combination skin, and my skin is slightly red after using, but that subsides in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I really like this scrub. It makes my skin feel so fresh after I use it. I use it in the shower, which makes it very easy to rinse off. My skin feels tingley and refreshed!</li>
            <li> After using the St. Ives version of this product, i took the chance based on amazon customer reviews and i will never use another scrub. The fine beads make all the difference in leaving my face feeling truly scrubbed. I am totally satisfied and wish i had found it years ago. i might even dare try other clinique products based on the reveiws here.</li>
            <li> Clinique&#x27;s Exfoliating Scrub is a facial scrub for oily skin. It is a thick, white paste packed with medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than in Clinique&#x27;s \\&quot;7 Day Scrub\\&quot; for normal skin. To use, massage onto clean, wet skin in a circular motion. Rinse with warm water. Careful not to get it in your eyes, as I did once while rinsing it off in the shower. This scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin. But it&#x27;s unsuitable for sensitive skin, and it stinks to high heaven. It contains menthol, which burns skin and clears the sinuses at no extra charge. Having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing. Of course, it is \\&quot;100% Fragrance Free\\&quot; according to Clinique, meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes. The scrub also contains salicylic acid, so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types, especially if used frequently. The performance isn&#x27;t bad. The olfactory aesthetics are atrocious. This is the harshest, most caustic facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. Sensitive complexions beware!</li>
            <li> Great product. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Every now and then I try another product in hopes of finding something a little cheaper.  I have NEVER found anything that comes close to this one.   &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m over forty, but still have somewhat oily skin, and get breakouts on occasion.  IF I use this two to three times per week, I definitely notice that I have fewer breakouts.  My skin is smoother and more even. &lt;br /&gt;I like the menthol feel.  I don&#x27;t smell it at all, and find it refreshing.  I&#x27;ve also tried the 7-day scrub and don&#x27;t find it to come close to this product.  The grains in the 7-day scrub are few and far between.  With the exfoiliating scrub, they are very concentrated.  Too much?  Just add a little water. &lt;br /&gt;I only hope that Clinique doesn&#x27;t stop making this!</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliater ever. Once or twice a week and done!</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to find exactly what I was looking for in one product as my skin tends to be pretty calm but since hitting thirty goes through these fits of oily/dry/blotchy patches of acne I&#x27;ve never had before!&lt;br /&gt;This has taken care of all of that... I put it on at night after using wipes to remove makeup and it leaves my face soft, fresh looking and blotchy free! I feel like this has been a hidden secret it really is THAT good-it also has the minty feeling I didn&#x27;t expect that other reviews mention. If you like how tee tree products feel in your hair with that minty freshness then you will like this. I even got my husband using it....</li>
            <li> This scrub is great and does not encourage bacterial growth within the tube (and so there for no acne). It scrubs away all the dead skin cells, smells minty, and wakes you up! It&#x27;s very refreshing. It cleans so well that it is important to protect your face after the shower, so be sure and put on a bit of facial lotion afterwards so your skin is not open to dirt and nasties. Oh, and don&#x27;t use it ever day. It&#x27;s very effective and is not needed daily.</li>
            <li> Whatever I got it was not Clinique. It has a fragrance and leaves a tingling feeling on my face. The texture and smell remind me a little of mint toothpaste. I called Clinique and they assured me that their product has no fragrance and no tingle. It does seems to clean my face OK.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. To date, my favorite exfoliating wash/scrub has been the older Proactiv face wash. It had the bits of sand or whatever in it, and it REALLY scrubbed my face clean, to the point of being able to feel/see the difference. I&#x27;ve purchased all the other cheaper drug store brand scrubs and face wash but they have simply not worked nearly as well. Finally I bought this stuff because I had heard good things about it, and wow. I don&#x27;t know if I can say this is quite better than the Proactiv, however if it is not, it is definitely 2nd to it. This stuff has smaller bits of sand, which made me wonder if it would work as well. Well it does! I actually found they are able to get into your skin better to really remove any dead skin and clean deeply. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for (which some people might really love) is that when applying it and using it, it gives off a really minty icy feeling, kinda like when you use tea tree stuff. I don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable. But some may find it refreshing. Aside from that, this stuff is great. If you&#x27;re looking for your new favorite scrub, you gotta try this. It&#x27;s worth the money, even though it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Ouch!  My face immediately became red and felt a burning sensation upon using this product. This might be better used for exfoliation on other areas of the body, for example, the back, feet, or elbows.  But I will never put this on my face again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, the clean and fresh sensation that leaves in your face, but I understand that is not for everyone, I&#x27;m sure a lot of people will think that is way to much... so basically try it and see if you like it :)</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliating scrub I have found.  After using it for a few weeks (I use it more often than once a week), I got several comments about my complexion, saying that I looked radiant.  I saw a review from someone who did not like the menthol in this product.  It is one of the things I really like about it.  It is really worth the money.  I have bought a few lower price scrubs but threw them away before I used them up because they just did not work like this product does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for so many years.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It washes off clean, without leaving any residue or oil, at all-  that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li> refreshing, makes skin radiant and doesn&#x27;t dry it</li>
            <li> This is one of the most effective products of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinque scrub for years and absolutely love it. I don&#x27;t like going into stores so I prefer to order online. The Clinique website is a nightmare so I get the product from Amazon. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Fresh &amp; exhilarating. Just don&#x27;t rub too hard (well, that goes for any scrub). Use common sense.</li>
            <li> Good substitute for Pernox. I like the results.</li>
            <li> Clinique exfoliating scrub is my &#x27;go to&#x27; for a deep exfoliating.  It really clears my pores like no other product I&#x27;ve tried.  The granules are not miniscule like some products I&#x27;ve tried (which can get into your eyes while washing your face).  I love the size of the granules and my face glows and feels clean and fresh after using.  I have combo skin (more dry) and I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  I have not had problems with it irritating my skin.  I would definitely recommend trying this.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> A must-have- never go without!</li>
            <li> Enjoy using this product.  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a product that had a similar consistency to the Proactiv facial scrub, without the benzoyl peroxide.  Since I had heard good things about this Clinique product in the past I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really impressed.  No drying, but leaves you with the same clean feeling.  Very smooth and not drying like the other item.  Just need a small amount to work well, add a little water and scrub your face for a minute or two.  Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item to others looking for a nice smooth skin with out the drying effect.  Fair price and great shipping!</li>
            <li> Clinique is a great brand, and there is no doubt this is an exfoliating scrub</li>
            <li> the best scrub, instant results</li>
            <li> This is probably the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve used around 1-2x/week, depending on the season. Unlike some reviewers complaining about the \\&quot;menthol smell\\&quot;, it&#x27;s so not strong; it&#x27;s refreshing actually. But the main thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that waking up in the morning after using it prior to bed, my skin has never been so soft, polished, and perfect. And I have pretty oily skin that gets blotchy, so trust, this stuff does its job. Skip that 7 day scrub mess.</li>
            <li> This scrub is great. I have used it for YEARS, and have never found anything better. I love the smell- and find it refreshing. I mix it with Cetaphil milky cleanser and use it sparingly. I do agree that if you have sensitive skin, it might be irritating, but almost any scrub would be irritating to sensitive skin. If you have normal/combination skin, I would highly recommend it for the T-Zone. If you like menthol/mint smell then this is the scrub for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial scrub for years.  I&#x27;ve used others from the drugstore, but they do not compare to the quality of Clinique&#x27;s facial scrub.  This scrub makes your face feel clean, soft and fresh looking.  I&#x27;ve been told I look 10-15 years younger than I really am.  I contribute it to good genes and this facial scrub!</li>
            <li> The only scrub I use on my very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I use this scrub every time I shower and I shower every other day. I love the feeling after using this product because it makes my skin feel really cool/clean and really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to find St. Ives Apricot Scrub in my shower one day and instead of the Clinique I tried to use that one instead. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used Clinique for so long but the feeling of St. Ives&#x27; was a bit rough and the smell was less preferable to that of Clinique. It wasn&#x27;t a bad product and I would give it several more tries but I easily went back to the Clinique one. I&#x27;m not a fan of some of their other products but I really love this one! I&#x27;ll have to try other scrubs to see if any of them will match up to Clinique&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I never used to use an exfoliating cream on my face and had dry flaky skin under my eyes, no matter how much I moisturized. I have been using this scrub every other day on my face and it is the ONLY thing that removes the flakes undery eyes as well as any other flaky area on my face. It has also removed the white &amp;#34;cholesterol bumps&amp;#34; I had..give tbat about a few weeks for removal. Looove this stuff! Went two weeks without it and looked horrible.</li>
            <li> great product, first time use, is better than some higher priced scrubs.</li>
            <li> Love this for my skin, but it&#x27;s not cruetly free... search continues</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the old Clinique scrub.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Fast service</li>
    </ol>
