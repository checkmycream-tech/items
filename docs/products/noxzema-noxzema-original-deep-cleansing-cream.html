            <li>Amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>My face feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>I get a smooth shave with a great scent and nobody knows this man used Noxzema.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used noxzema all through my teens because I liked the minty  tingle.</li>
            <li>This face wash is effective, plentiful and affordable.  </li>
            <li>You kind of have to just glop it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Noxema for make-up removal.  </li>
            <li>It always has a good clean smell and is so good for your skin.  </li>

            <li>Sometimes the old stuff is the best stuff.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly on my skin and it really is a very good deep cleansing cream.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference within 1 day!  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for more that 50 years.</li>
            <li>More attention to the packaging of the product would help to preserve its contents.</li>
            <li>I am done trying different cleansers because I think I have found the best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>And that smell is just what I remember :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li>and I love the tingle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was sure about</li>
            <li>the thing I really love about this</li>
            <li>Refreshing.</li>
            <li>I use to love noxema.</li>
            <li>Was it to get longer shelf life and earn more money?</li>
            <li>Then I go to sleep, add a bit more in the morning to emulsify it and wash off.</li>
            <li>stuff is magic in a jar.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE the eucalyptus smell.</li>
            <li>I had not used Noxzema products for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for removing sweat, grease, and makeup (although beware of getting it in your eyes, because it definitely burns).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me a moist, glowing look that I love.  </li>
            <li>Glad they havent changed it</li>
            <li>Love how my skin feels and looks after using this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, okay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be wasting my money again on more pricey cleansers - and it also takes off eye make-up</li>
            <li>Always makes my face feel nice and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Noxema customer for decades, and I still love it!</li>
            <li>Original recipe--great!</li>
            <li>#34;I&#x27;ve just used a product with a lot of chemicals&amp;#34; kind of tingle but the &amp;#34;Mmmm, my face feels super clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed!  </li>
            <li>The menthol in it has the nice cooling effect while getting your face super clean.</li>
            <li>after many decades,  I recently bought some noxzema and have been using it -- and it is truly fabulous !!!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and the cool feeling</li>
            <li>recommend this product to anyone with blemishes and/or fine lines.</li>
            <li>I then rinse and my skin is cool, calm and baby smooth with a nice even color.</li>
            <li>I love the way this original Noxzema cleans the makeup off my face so easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps a nice, clear glow! :)</li>
            <li>Loved since elementary school when I first tried my Mom&#x27;s. :) Can&#x27;t beat the cool tingly clean of the original.</li>
            <li>everything else was smooth.</li>
            <li>Boy am I happy to have it back!</li>
            <li>; I will use it again; I enjoy having it on the subscribe and save program.</li>
            <li>It makes taking of makeup easy, super smooth as to not irritate while cleaning around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Especially in the warm months of the year!  </li>
            <li>I used for my first time and im in love with this cream</li>
            <li>How come companies are allowed to say original cleansing cream when its not?</li>
            <li>I bought this originally to put some sugar in and use as a scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original Noxzema cleansing cream since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy formula with that unique invigorating tingle when it hits your skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff gets you clean.</li>
            <li>For now I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because it does clean my face, which is what it was made to do.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it, it felt like a cool breeze on my face</li>
            <li>this facial wash works good</li>
            <li>Very well priced and works fabulous!</li>
            <li>and I always get compliments that I have nice and clear skin.</li>
            <li>The smell takes some getting used to, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Then I rinsed it off and my face felt so fresh and clean</li>
            <li>my skin feels clean and fresh and</li>
            <li>Much better than Noxema&#x27;s (or any) shaving cream where you have to wipe off most of it to see where you are shaving, especially for sideburns and beards!</li>
            <li>Although I really loved how soft it made my face, it really caused my face to become too oily on my T zone and made my face shine</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a medicinal smell, but it&#x27;s mild.</li>
            <li>Came as advertized, simply the best facial cleanser on the market IMHO!</li>
            <li>I also stay remarkably blemish-free, although I&#x27;m not particularly prone to acne, so it may be genetics rather than Noxzema that does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I love that Noxzema is an inexpensive, classic product that leaves my skin looking and feeling</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and clean, feels cool and refreshing, and smells great without giving me a headache or sinus congestion like a lot of other fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I love the clean and soft feeling this gives my face.</li>
            <li>When I contacted the company, they said that most customers like the new formulation.  </li>
            <li>I had pretty good skin as a teen.  </li>
            <li>New pimples come to a head the next day, and my skin is so nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m old school, but I really love this product.</li>
            <li>After just one day, her face is pain free, soft, smooth and moisturized.   </li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed Noxzema since I began a cleansing ritual as a young girl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Noxzema has a fresh, cooling feel (from the menthol and eucalyptus oil).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still usable, but may not be fresh.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure how to apply it because it&#x27;s really dry, and it lists so many ways of putting it on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Noxzema (the original deep cleansing cream) for over a month now, and I love the way it makes me skin feel.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean, soft, moisturized and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it will really start to work it&#x27;s magic that I&#x27;ve read so much about here pretty soon.</li>
            <li>I can recall having been in a doctor&#x27;s office with my Mom at an early age when I discovered the pleasant medical scent of this cream.  </li>
            <li>I use it to wash my face and for what my mom used to call \\&quot;spit baths\\&quot; to clean up after I&#x27;ve worked in the yard and just want to feel cool and clean without actually taking a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin super soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I love the refreshing smell of the eucalyptus and love that you can use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li>I am now wondering if I owe my good skin as a teen completely to Noxzema.  </li>
            <li>Also, very very affordable.</li>
            <li>B000AMBF5W Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil &amp; Vitamin E, 6.8 Ounces]] and these two products have done nothing but make my skin feel soft, fresh, and most importantly clearer than ever.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try because I remember my cousin used it when she was a teenager and had really pretty skin.  </li>
            <li>I love lathering over my face, back, shoulders &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>Do they even test to see if they are removing the ingredient combo that worked and allowed it to be marketed  in the first place?</li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I am able to find the face cream I have used since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Nox!</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin, but it&#x27;s also flaky.</li>
            <li>Noxema has always been a real bargain to me compared to all the other high dollar products that do nothing more than Noxema except cost you a lot more.</li>
            <li>This product is tried and true and while there are many (oh, so many) other makeup removing products, this one will always be the only one I use.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh, non dry feeling after using!</li>
            <li>Same original formula does wonders to the skin!</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out, and makes my skin smooth and completely blemish free.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and so soft.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and soft after using the product.</li>
            <li>Noxema has been an outstanding product for at least 60 years or more.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a refreshing mask, and to cool my skin down whenever I get redness or pimples.</li>
            <li>and it really works very very well.  </li>
            <li>People laugh at a 46-year-old woman using a \\&quot;high</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike many cleansers, Noxzema doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to use it as an adult to keep my face clean and free of possible acne.</li>
            <li>I just hope they keep making this old standby and don&#x27;t mess with a good thing.</li>
            <li>It is very versatile.</li>
            <li>I had so much hope it would work</li>
            <li>but it cleans very well</li>
            <li>Really helps on sunburns too.</li>
            <li>What I like, is that it&#x27;s really affordable.</li>
            <li>My aunt has used it her whole life</li>
            <li>AcneFree Cleaning System (from CVS) helps me much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think a Noxzema review is needed, it&#x27;s Noxzema.</li>
            <li>Been using it, my WHOLE life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only other product that works awesome on my skin is Cindy Crawfords meaningful beauty cleanser, but it is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li>I hope they never change the original formula because it simply  cannot be improved upon.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviews, I remember having this in the house awhile ago.</li>
            <li>Some people prefer the pump, but I don&#x27;t get the same tingly, clean feeling with the one in the pump.</li>
            <li>I have very nice, soft skin with very few, very fine lines that are hardly visible.</li>
            <li>I use this daily for the last 20 years and it is the real stuff to keep me clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like having to go through tube after tube of it and ruining my sleep shirts and sheets</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product or a knockoff since high school.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The price isn&#x27;t bad and the delivery to my front door is perfect!</li>
            <li>I always looked at Noxema products as crappy products that teens used to try and clear blemishes that didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>and I have not had any new breakouts</li>
            <li>I immediately new</li>
            <li>My skin has not been this clear in....ever!  </li>
            <li>I first encountered Noxzema when my family came to visit last summer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m willing to pay extra for it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>me acne started to clear up</li>
            <li>I can remember using Noxema when I was young.  </li>
            <li>and I notice much softer skins and my pores have gotten smaller.  </li>
            <li>Both my order and the 5/29/12 offers were Prime eligible so no shipping charges on either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although, the next morning I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference on my face...</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the old 60&#x27;s Noxema commercials &amp;#34;Take it off, take it ALL off!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I read that it&#x27;s beneficial for 40+ year old skin and ordered it.</li>
            <li>My pre-teen daughter now uses it and swears it makes her skin so silky soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>Next, it has two different oils; perfect for moisturizing the skin and letting the blade glide across the skin while cutting whiskers.</li>
            <li>I modified my 16 oz jar with a teaspoon of baking soda, mixed in really well.</li>
            <li>also have sensitive skin and Noxzema has always treated me well.</li>
            <li>Its the old Noxzema  </li>
            <li>I have been using Noxema skin cream ever since I was 10 years old</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week but don&#x27;t see any results so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since I was 12 years old and will not switch.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>When I saw this at my local Safeway for $5, I thought \\&quot;Huh, it&#x27;s cheaper than my usual Neutrogena stuff, so why not give it a try?\\&quot; The smell is just as I remember it, cool, fresh, minty.</li>
            <li>jar will last me a long time; not bad for $5.</li>
            <li>This pretty much got rid of my oily skin but at the same time didn&#x27;t leave it dry and flakey.</li>
            <li>The EXACT SAME SIZE AND PRODUCT is now, 5/29/12, selling by AMZN for $3.99, similar to grocery store prices!</li>
            <li>, looks like really big volume and works pretty well, i can see the dirt coming out from my nose, only thing is the smell makes me feel like some wried medicine</li>
            <li>so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, maybe my pores are a little smaller, but my mild acne is still apparent.</li>
            <li>The ingredients on the actual jar verses that listed in the description are quite different, with the actual ingredients pretty highly laden with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>other words, they made a conscious decision to use 45% more plastic for 4 years to cover up giving consumers nearly 15% less product than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like Noxzema, but this particular bottle arrived a little dried out on the top.</li>
            <li>It really does a decent job for very little money, especially when you compare it to much of the beauty/facial care products out there.</li>
            <li>Proactiv made me dry out, oxy made me dry out, salicylic products do nothing and other products would make me break out more.  </li>
            <li>Left a film on my face and did not remove my makeup completely even after washing twice.</li>
            <li>Apparently, a doctor invented noxzema as a sunburn remedy.  </li>
            <li>I love the cold feeling it does when washing my face, and my face has cleared up so much with this product.</li>
            <li>I started it 3 weeks ago and since then have not had a single new zit pop</li>
            <li>I use it to wash my face and then put a little bit on my face like a moisturizer (if your skin is not really bad dry).  </li>
            <li>For dry skin or very sensitive allergy prone skin&lt;</li>
            <li>That was UNTIL my great grandmother saw me without makeup on (and how badly my skin was broken out) and told me she had been using it for years and years and that it was the secret to her still beautiful skin at</li>
            <li>I am better off with a plain bar of african black soap which does remove everything thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It will dry your skin out a little with daily use, and for that reason I prefer the Noxema in a pump (for a clean, tingly feeling all over I occasionally use it as a bodywash).</li>
            <li>The rest of my body can dry out and get irritated easily with harsh chemicals from other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable, mild cleanser without salicylic acid or other harsh chemicals.  </li>

            <li> Amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> My face feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> I get a smooth shave with a great scent and nobody knows this man used Noxzema.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used noxzema all through my teens because I liked the minty  tingle.</li>
            <li> This face wash is effective, plentiful and affordable.  </li>
            <li> You kind of have to just glop it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Noxema for make-up removal.  </li>
            <li> It always has a good clean smell and is so good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Great way to clean your face in an affordable way.</li>
            <li> The price is awesome for the amount you get and it always leaves my face feeling fresh and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for combination and oily skin -- it removes excess oil while keeping your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the old stuff is the best stuff.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly on my skin and it really is a very good deep cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference within 1 day!  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for more that 50 years.</li>
            <li> More attention to the packaging of the product would help to preserve its contents.</li>
            <li> I am done trying different cleansers because I think I have found the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> And that smell is just what I remember :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li> and I love the tingle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was sure about</li>
            <li> the thing I really love about this</li>
            <li> Refreshing.</li>
            <li> I use to love noxema.</li>
            <li> Was it to get longer shelf life and earn more money?</li>
            <li> Then I go to sleep, add a bit more in the morning to emulsify it and wash off.</li>
            <li> stuff is magic in a jar.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE the eucalyptus smell.</li>
            <li> I had not used Noxzema products for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for removing sweat, grease, and makeup (although beware of getting it in your eyes, because it definitely burns).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives me a moist, glowing look that I love.  </li>
            <li> Glad they havent changed it</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels and looks after using this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, okay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be wasting my money again on more pricey cleansers - and it also takes off eye make-up</li>
            <li> Always makes my face feel nice and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Noxema customer for decades, and I still love it!</li>
            <li> Original recipe--great!</li>
            <li> #34;I&#x27;ve just used a product with a lot of chemicals&amp;#34; kind of tingle but the &amp;#34;Mmmm, my face feels super clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed!  </li>
            <li> The menthol in it has the nice cooling effect while getting your face super clean.</li>
            <li> after many decades,  I recently bought some noxzema and have been using it -- and it is truly fabulous !!!  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and the cool feeling</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone with blemishes and/or fine lines.</li>
            <li> I then rinse and my skin is cool, calm and baby smooth with a nice even color.</li>
            <li> I love the way this original Noxzema cleans the makeup off my face so easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps a nice, clear glow! :)</li>
            <li> Loved since elementary school when I first tried my Mom&#x27;s. :) Can&#x27;t beat the cool tingly clean of the original.</li>
            <li> everything else was smooth.</li>
            <li> Boy am I happy to have it back!</li>
            <li> ; I will use it again; I enjoy having it on the subscribe and save program.</li>
            <li> It makes taking of makeup easy, super smooth as to not irritate while cleaning around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Especially in the warm months of the year!  </li>
            <li> I used for my first time and im in love with this cream</li>
            <li> How come companies are allowed to say original cleansing cream when its not?</li>
            <li> I bought this originally to put some sugar in and use as a scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Noxzema cleansing cream since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> Non-greasy formula with that unique invigorating tingle when it hits your skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff gets you clean.</li>
            <li> For now I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because it does clean my face, which is what it was made to do.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it, it felt like a cool breeze on my face</li>
            <li> this facial wash works good</li>
            <li> Very well priced and works fabulous!</li>
            <li> and I always get compliments that I have nice and clear skin.</li>
            <li> The smell takes some getting used to, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Then I rinsed it off and my face felt so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> my skin feels clean and fresh and</li>
            <li> Much better than Noxema&#x27;s (or any) shaving cream where you have to wipe off most of it to see where you are shaving, especially for sideburns and beards!</li>
            <li> Although I really loved how soft it made my face, it really caused my face to become too oily on my T zone and made my face shine</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a medicinal smell, but it&#x27;s mild.</li>
            <li> Came as advertized, simply the best facial cleanser on the market IMHO!</li>
            <li> I also stay remarkably blemish-free, although I&#x27;m not particularly prone to acne, so it may be genetics rather than Noxzema that does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I love that Noxzema is an inexpensive, classic product that leaves my skin looking and feeling</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and clean, feels cool and refreshing, and smells great without giving me a headache or sinus congestion like a lot of other fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I love the clean and soft feeling this gives my face.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company, they said that most customers like the new formulation.  </li>
            <li> I had pretty good skin as a teen.  </li>
            <li> New pimples come to a head the next day, and my skin is so nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m old school, but I really love this product.</li>
            <li> After just one day, her face is pain free, soft, smooth and moisturized.   </li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed Noxzema since I began a cleansing ritual as a young girl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Noxzema has a fresh, cooling feel (from the menthol and eucalyptus oil).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still usable, but may not be fresh.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure how to apply it because it&#x27;s really dry, and it lists so many ways of putting it on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Noxzema (the original deep cleansing cream) for over a month now, and I love the way it makes me skin feel.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean, soft, moisturized and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will really start to work it&#x27;s magic that I&#x27;ve read so much about here pretty soon.</li>
            <li> I can recall having been in a doctor&#x27;s office with my Mom at an early age when I discovered the pleasant medical scent of this cream.  </li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face and for what my mom used to call \\&quot;spit baths\\&quot; to clean up after I&#x27;ve worked in the yard and just want to feel cool and clean without actually taking a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin super soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing smell of the eucalyptus and love that you can use it dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I am now wondering if I owe my good skin as a teen completely to Noxzema.  </li>
            <li> Also, very very affordable.</li>
            <li> B000AMBF5W Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil &amp; Vitamin E, 6.8 Ounces]] and these two products have done nothing but make my skin feel soft, fresh, and most importantly clearer than ever.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because I remember my cousin used it when she was a teenager and had really pretty skin.  </li>
            <li> I love lathering over my face, back, shoulders &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> Do they even test to see if they are removing the ingredient combo that worked and allowed it to be marketed  in the first place?</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I am able to find the face cream I have used since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Nox!</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin, but it&#x27;s also flaky.</li>
            <li> Noxema has always been a real bargain to me compared to all the other high dollar products that do nothing more than Noxema except cost you a lot more.</li>
            <li> This product is tried and true and while there are many (oh, so many) other makeup removing products, this one will always be the only one I use.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh, non dry feeling after using!</li>
            <li> Same original formula does wonders to the skin!</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out, and makes my skin smooth and completely blemish free.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and so soft.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and soft after using the product.</li>
            <li> Noxema has been an outstanding product for at least 60 years or more.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a refreshing mask, and to cool my skin down whenever I get redness or pimples.</li>
            <li> and it really works very very well.  </li>
            <li> People laugh at a 46-year-old woman using a \\&quot;high</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike many cleansers, Noxzema doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to use it as an adult to keep my face clean and free of possible acne.</li>
            <li> I just hope they keep making this old standby and don&#x27;t mess with a good thing.</li>
            <li> It is very versatile.</li>
            <li> I had so much hope it would work</li>
            <li> but it cleans very well</li>
            <li> Really helps on sunburns too.</li>
            <li> What I like, is that it&#x27;s really affordable.</li>
            <li> My aunt has used it her whole life</li>
            <li> AcneFree Cleaning System (from CVS) helps me much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think a Noxzema review is needed, it&#x27;s Noxzema.</li>
            <li> Been using it, my WHOLE life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only other product that works awesome on my skin is Cindy Crawfords meaningful beauty cleanser, but it is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I hope they never change the original formula because it simply  cannot be improved upon.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews, I remember having this in the house awhile ago.</li>
            <li> Some people prefer the pump, but I don&#x27;t get the same tingly, clean feeling with the one in the pump.</li>
            <li> I have very nice, soft skin with very few, very fine lines that are hardly visible.</li>
            <li> I use this daily for the last 20 years and it is the real stuff to keep me clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like having to go through tube after tube of it and ruining my sleep shirts and sheets</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product or a knockoff since high school.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad and the delivery to my front door is perfect!</li>
            <li> I always looked at Noxema products as crappy products that teens used to try and clear blemishes that didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> and I have not had any new breakouts</li>
            <li> I immediately new</li>
            <li> My skin has not been this clear in....ever!  </li>
            <li> I first encountered Noxzema when my family came to visit last summer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m willing to pay extra for it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> me acne started to clear up</li>
            <li> I can remember using Noxema when I was young.  </li>
            <li> and I notice much softer skins and my pores have gotten smaller.  </li>
            <li> Both my order and the 5/29/12 offers were Prime eligible so no shipping charges on either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although, the next morning I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference on my face...</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the old 60&#x27;s Noxema commercials &amp;#34;Take it off, take it ALL off!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I read that it&#x27;s beneficial for 40+ year old skin and ordered it.</li>
            <li> My pre-teen daughter now uses it and swears it makes her skin so silky soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> Next, it has two different oils; perfect for moisturizing the skin and letting the blade glide across the skin while cutting whiskers.</li>
            <li> I modified my 16 oz jar with a teaspoon of baking soda, mixed in really well.</li>
            <li> also have sensitive skin and Noxzema has always treated me well.</li>
            <li> Its the old Noxzema  </li>
            <li> I have been using Noxema skin cream ever since I was 10 years old</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week but don&#x27;t see any results so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was 12 years old and will not switch.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> When I saw this at my local Safeway for $5, I thought \\&quot;Huh, it&#x27;s cheaper than my usual Neutrogena stuff, so why not give it a try?\\&quot; The smell is just as I remember it, cool, fresh, minty.</li>
            <li> jar will last me a long time; not bad for $5.</li>
            <li> This pretty much got rid of my oily skin but at the same time didn&#x27;t leave it dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> The EXACT SAME SIZE AND PRODUCT is now, 5/29/12, selling by AMZN for $3.99, similar to grocery store prices!</li>
            <li> , looks like really big volume and works pretty well, i can see the dirt coming out from my nose, only thing is the smell makes me feel like some wried medicine</li>
            <li> so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, maybe my pores are a little smaller, but my mild acne is still apparent.</li>
            <li> The ingredients on the actual jar verses that listed in the description are quite different, with the actual ingredients pretty highly laden with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other words, they made a conscious decision to use 45% more plastic for 4 years to cover up giving consumers nearly 15% less product than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like Noxzema, but this particular bottle arrived a little dried out on the top.</li>
            <li> It really does a decent job for very little money, especially when you compare it to much of the beauty/facial care products out there.</li>
            <li> Proactiv made me dry out, oxy made me dry out, salicylic products do nothing and other products would make me break out more.  </li>
            <li> Left a film on my face and did not remove my makeup completely even after washing twice.</li>
            <li> Apparently, a doctor invented noxzema as a sunburn remedy.  </li>
            <li> I love the cold feeling it does when washing my face, and my face has cleared up so much with this product.</li>
            <li> I started it 3 weeks ago and since then have not had a single new zit pop</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face and then put a little bit on my face like a moisturizer (if your skin is not really bad dry).  </li>
            <li> For dry skin or very sensitive allergy prone skin&lt;</li>
            <li> That was UNTIL my great grandmother saw me without makeup on (and how badly my skin was broken out) and told me she had been using it for years and years and that it was the secret to her still beautiful skin at</li>
            <li> I am better off with a plain bar of african black soap which does remove everything thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It will dry your skin out a little with daily use, and for that reason I prefer the Noxema in a pump (for a clean, tingly feeling all over I occasionally use it as a bodywash).</li>
            <li> The rest of my body can dry out and get irritated easily with harsh chemicals from other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable, mild cleanser without salicylic acid or other harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> as an adult, I started using other fancy products.  </li>
            <li> at my place it doesn&#x27;t last long every person at home uses it</li>
            <li> My face is so soft after I use it, and I&#x27;ve noticed less acne/redness on my face since using it.</li>
            <li> Just started this new jar after finishing the last of a stock of small jars.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products and have always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft, clear and the few wrinkles I have forming around my eyes are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> usually try to avoid a lot of chemicals and only bought this because I used to like it and was pleasantly surprised at the ingredients list.  </li>
            <li> and this was packaged properly for shipping and arrived in the expected time.</li>
            <li> It is not as firm, and it doesn&#x27;t tingle like the old formula.  </li>
            <li> but there is a reason it has been around for so long.  </li>
            <li> Almost anything Noxema contains camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oil - all extremely bad/irritating for the skin; none of anti-acne or anti-blackhead products work, no topical disinfectant for acne-prone skin, no sunscreens; no moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;Hello!</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out lately due to a medication and the only thing that has abolished</li>
            <li> I have experimented with other cleansing creams, but I keep coming back to this</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> dosen&#x27;t dry out  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I&#x27;ve put on all my creams and anti aging potions, I slather a layer of this over my T zone and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Noxema should seal the sides of their jars so the average person can&#x27;t just open it.</li>
            <li> The only down side would be that you can&#x27;t wash off eye makeup with this</li>
            <li> The new formula sucks.  </li>
            <li> I can just slather some on, wet or dry, with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> The very next day almost half of my acne was cleared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what changed for me, but after the birth of my second daughter my skin started breaking out and NOTHING including a round of accutane worked to get and keep me clear.</li>
            <li> I had been unable to find a product that cleaned my oily adult skin sufficiently enough that I did not have breakouts but also would not completely dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a smooth, soft cream, it&#x27;s a chunky mess.</li>
            <li> You can use it as a face wash, a mask (leave  it on for about an hour), or even dap a little and leave it on (such as a moisturizing cream).&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> Women taught me about the use of hair conditioners, 10,000 unit vitamin A cream for face and other dry skin parts.</li>
            <li> The tub is a little annoying, wish it had a pump, but otherwise I can&#x27;t complain about this nice and simple product.</li>
            <li> but you cant keep it in the shower or it will get water in it and get all wet and than you cant use it.</li>
            <li> my skin has stopped breaking out completely and the hyper-pigmentation that I&#x27;ve had for years is slowly fading.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the contents was melted and not consistent with my other purchases at stores.</li>
            <li> , my skin has not started flaking and drying out and all the current pimples I had have dried up!  </li>
            <li> I received the product today and I gave it three stars due to the fact that when I opened it, it had a fingerprint pushed into it.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the heck I changed and starting using Purpose products</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to repurchasing and looking into their other products.</li>
            <li> Noxema has other uses:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown out ALL my other skin care things and just use this now.</li>
            <li> I CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these changes were due to continued use over a few days, or because I left the product on longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find Noxema in the larger sizes now.  </li>
            <li> I know it isn&#x27;t as thick as in the jar, so the ingredients must be different.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t stop all of my breakouts that&#x27;s the down side</li>
            <li> the makers of Noxema have gone to a right-sized container with a label that touts &amp;#34;45% less</li>
            <li> Been using half my life already.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd</li>
            <li> and I suffer from little blemishes and oily skin.</li>
            <li> It dried out my face a little bit (or it could have been the weather)</li>
            <li> I think that the seller should, at the very least, warn consumers that their product may degrade in shipping...  such as my shipment</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that our whole family suffers from acne.</li>
            <li> Soap is too heavy.</li>
            <li> I let the whiskers absorb it for a few minutes before shaving.</li>
            <li> (it bleaches them), and it&#x27;s quite harsh and drying.</li>
            <li> I have few problems with my skin but every time I&#x27;ve had a small irritated place</li>
            <li> The chunks make it a little hard to apply in an even layer.</li>
            <li> I usually use it at night before bed.</li>
            <li> Though I tried hard, I still cannot accept it...</li>
            <li> A little investigation revealed a false bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because when I received all(4) of them, the product had broken down and went from being a stable cream to a liquid.. to my trash can!  </li>
            <li> my skin loses its balance with oils and greaseness.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m reminded of every time I smell it.</li>
            <li> I just slather it on really thick, pop in a movie while I inhale the soothing vapors.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of layers (thick moisturizer, sunscreen, foundation, concealer, powder), but you would think something like this would remove the buildup on your face, and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My European girlfriend&#x27;s face was so dry from the winter weather that her face was painful!!!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed at the actual list.  </li>
            <li> Please join me in contacting Noxzema and telling them that it sucks!</li>
            <li> Why fix what isn&#x27;t broken (out).</li>
            <li> It cleans your skin, takes off makeup and it even took really nasty black dirt off my son&#x27;s hands that wouldn&#x27;t come off with soap and a skin brush.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t even bother with cold cream followed by cleaner --</li>
            <li> Difficult to guess which ones!  </li>
            <li> I hate when companies do this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Got this awhile ago at WalMart because I was getting terrible breakouts.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can remember using Noxema when I was young.  It always has a good clean smell and is so good for your skin.  I use it to wash my face and then put a little bit on my face like a moisturizer (if your skin is not really bad dry).  Noxema has always been a real bargain to me compared to all the other high dollar products that do nothing more than Noxema except cost you a lot more.</li>
            <li> I grew up using noxema, and still use it. It is very versatile. You can use it as a face wash, a mask (leave  it on for about an hour), or even dap a little and leave it on (such as a moisturizing cream).&lt;br /&gt;Some people dont like the smell, but to me it smells like summer (because we always used it during the summer).</li>
            <li> Noxzema user for 30 plus years.  Great way to clean your face in an affordable way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on since my teenage years. I like to wash my face Noxema. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I used Noxzema back in the 70s and 80s. It was awesome then and still awesome now. Same original formula does wonders to the skin!</li>
            <li> I love the way this original Noxzema cleans the makeup off my face so easily and quickly.  This product is tried and true and while there are many (oh, so many) other makeup removing products, this one will always be the only one I use. A little goes a long way. Some people prefer the pump, but I don&#x27;t get the same tingly, clean feeling with the one in the pump. I know it isn&#x27;t as thick as in the jar, so the ingredients must be different. I just hope they keep making this old standby and don&#x27;t mess with a good thing. Also, very very affordable.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for more that 50 years.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered Noxzema and started getting it from drugstores like Rite-Aid.  Prior to that I&#x27;ve always bought more expensive name brand makeup remover or face wash.  I would not say that this Noxzema cleansing cream is a miracle, for for its price it does an incredible job.  I smear it on like a face mask and leave it on for 15-20 minutes while watching TV.  Then I wash it off in the shower and I notice much softer skins and my pores have gotten smaller.  Noxzema, please please do not change the formula!</li>
            <li> Always #1, hope it stays around</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the contents was melted and not consistent with my other purchases at stores. More attention to the packaging of the product would help to preserve its contents.</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of cleansers over the years. I can&#x27;t use the \\&quot;acne\\&quot; cleansers with salicylic acid because they make me break out, and find that a lot of cleansers are too drying. No cleanser can compare to Noxzema though. It does not dry my skin out, and makes my skin smooth and completely blemish free. I am done trying different cleansers because I think I have found the best!</li>
            <li> I have to give this a \\&quot;ONE STAR RATING\\&quot; because when I received all(4) of them, the product had broken down and went from being a stable cream to a liquid.. to my trash can!  I suppose the increase in outside temperature affected the consistency of this product. Noteworthy fact was before I tossed them all into the trash can, I allowed the jars to sit at room temperature for over (3) weeks, yet their watery texture they became never reverted or changed!! Never ORDER this product! Especially in the warm months of the year!  Buy it in the grocery store or local pharmacy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also WAY OVERPAID the seller here, COREY W NATION for it, $7.79 for (1) (12)oz jar  when I ordered on 5/7/12!  The EXACT SAME SIZE AND PRODUCT is now, 5/29/12, selling by AMZN for $3.99, similar to grocery store prices! Both my order and the 5/29/12 offers were Prime eligible so no shipping charges on either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!  Perhaps one should consider that some products just should NOT BE SHIPPED!  Difficult to guess which ones!  I think that the seller should, at the very least, warn consumers that their product may degrade in shipping...  such as my shipment did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from all that is stated above, I have used this product, with my shaving brush, for 50+ years to SHAVE my face and trim my beard! The cream is translucent so you can see where you are about to shave and the cream cleanses my face.  Much better than Noxema&#x27;s (or any) shaving cream where you have to wipe off most of it to see where you are shaving, especially for sideburns and beards!</li>
            <li> To start off with I suffer from acne. I read the reviews on this product and good things were said about this product so I thought, &#x27;why not? I&#x27;ll give it a try.&#x27; I went to my local Walmart and used it that same night. At first I wasn&#x27;t too sure how to apply it because it&#x27;s really dry, and it lists so many ways of putting it on so I went with pouring water on my face then with my fingers I swept some of the cream and in a circular motion applied it on my face. Then I rinsed it off and my face felt so fresh and clean, it was awesome! Although, the next morning I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference on my face... I had so much hope it would work so I decided to give it a week. And after just one week, I noticed a big difference on my face; my acne was disappearing! And now my face is clearer than ever. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product. I use it in the morning and night. It dried out my face a little bit (or it could have been the weather) so I had to buy a moisturizer, I bought the [[ASIN:B000AMBF5W Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil &amp; Vitamin E, 6.8 Ounces]] and these two products have done nothing but make my skin feel soft, fresh, and most importantly clearer than ever.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne and have used every thing under the sun.  Proactiv made me dry out, oxy made me dry out, salicylic products do nothing and other products would make me break out more.  I decided to give this a try because I remember my cousin used it when she was a teenager and had really pretty skin.  I noticed a huge difference within 1 day!  I am on day 5 of using this product just at night time and I have not had any new breakouts, my skin has not started flaking and drying out and all the current pimples I had have dried up!  My skin has not been this clear in....ever!  The only other product that works awesome on my skin is Cindy Crawfords meaningful beauty cleanser, but it is pretty expensive. Noxzema is awesome for the price and it works awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I received the product today and I gave it three stars due to the fact that when I opened it, it had a fingerprint pushed into it. I immediately new it was a fingerprint...everything else was smooth. Noxema should seal the sides of their jars so the average person can&#x27;t just open it. I won&#x27;t be ordering this product online again...</li>
            <li> My HOLY GRAIL cleanser! I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and my combination skin loves it! It is such a pick-me-up in my mornings and everytime i run out of it my skin loses its balance with oils and greaseness. Perfecy for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man who uses this product to wash my face in the morning and evening. I started using it over a decade ago after reading a review by a woman on another site who compared the difference in her face to that of her sister after using it for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, I noticed when the product went from 14 ounces to 12 ounces in 2011 but the size of the package did not change. A little investigation revealed a false bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the makers of Noxema have gone to a right-sized container with a label that touts &amp;#34;45% less plastic.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, they made a conscious decision to use 45% more plastic for 4 years to cover up giving consumers nearly 15% less product than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because I like the product but dislike the company&#x27;s business practices.</li>
            <li> I grew up on this stuff. My mom grew up on this stuff. My mom&#x27;s mom possibly grew up on this stuff. But somehow I forgot all about it along the way. Boy am I happy to have it back! Noxema&#x27;s the shiz. Leaves my skin super soft and clean feeling. I like that I can just slather some on, wet or dry, with or without makeup. This stuff gets you clean. And that smell is just what I remember :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product or a knockoff since high school. I have very nice, soft skin with very few, very fine lines that are hardly visible. I LOVE this cleanser. People laugh at a 46-year-old woman using a \\&quot;high school\\&quot; cleanser but it cleans very well, isn&#x27;t drying at all and I love the tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does also work for sunburn.</li>
            <li> Ahhhh the smell brings back memories. I remember using this stuff as a younger girl. Not sure why the heck I changed and starting using Purpose products but I&#x27;m a now a returning customer. I love the fresh, non dry feeling after using! My face feels clean and so soft. I like it!  08/20/15 update: Although I really loved how soft it made my face, it really caused my face to become too oily on my T zone and made my face shine and my make up slide off &amp;#34;( Back to my Pro X and Purpose face soap.</li>
            <li> I shave with this stuff.  Cleans and refreshes with eucalyptus scent.  Reminds me of the old 60&#x27;s Noxema commercials &amp;#34;Take it off, take it ALL off!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> JUST love it, feels great on my skin and dont want to stop using it it gets rid of acne and good after shaving.</li>
            <li> I do not use this  cleansing cream but my brother always asks me to purchase this for him. It does a good job to keep his face out of acne and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was having acne problems and I was recommended this product a lot but I was sure about but I decided to get it anyway and when I got it, it made a big difference me acne started to clear up but it didn&#x27;t stop all of my breakouts that&#x27;s the down side the thing I really love about this is it helps my skin breathe and it feels amazing after you wash it off so this product is a must to get.</li>
            <li> It is well reviewed so I won&#x27;t get into details aside that it is a great product and this was packaged properly for shipping and arrived in the expected time. The price was the best I found at the time or purchase. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used for my first time and im in love with this cream my skin feels clean and fresh and my skin dosen&#x27;t dry out  u used for day and nite time i recomended it .</li>
            <li> Can I give 100 stars ? I have used this product since I&#x27;ve been washing my face and I&#x27;m now 40, substitutes won&#x27;t do the trick, this wonderful product is a must have</li>
            <li> Seems to be the same stuff I used as a child.  Refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love the clean and soft feeling this gives my face. I use it as my daily cleanser and it keeps a nice, clear glow! :)</li>
            <li> The ingredients on the actual jar verses that listed in the description are quite different, with the actual ingredients pretty highly laden with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listing Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Stearic Acid, Linseed Oil, Soybean Oil, Fragrance, Ammonium Hydroxide, Camphor, Menthol, Eucalyptus Oil, Propylene Glycol, Gelatin, Calcium Hydroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actual ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Stearic Acid, Linseed oil, Soybean Oil, Propylene Glycol, Gelatin, Camphor, Phenol, Ammonium Hydroxide, Eucalyptus Oil, Calcium Hydroxide, Menthol, Sodium Bicarbonate, Calcium Chloride, Magnesium Sulfate, Potassium Chloride, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually try to avoid a lot of chemicals and only bought this because I used to like it and was pleasantly surprised at the ingredients list.  Disappointed at the actual list.  Also there was zero protective packaging: No shrink-wrap lid, no under-lid seal.</li>
            <li> I have used Noxzema for over 20 years, and it WAS wonderful.  The new formula sucks.  It is not as firm, and it doesn&#x27;t tingle like the old formula.  When I contacted the company, they said that most customers like the new formulation.  Please join me in contacting Noxzema and telling them that it sucks!</li>
            <li> Smells SO good! I love lathering over my face, back, shoulders &amp; neck. It feels incredible. Been using half my life already. Love it! My husband &amp; I both use it. Really helps on sunburns too. Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Almost anything Noxema contains camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oil - all extremely bad/irritating for the skin; none of anti-acne or anti-blackhead products work, no topical disinfectant for acne-prone skin, no sunscreens; no moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;Hello! Can you say Noxema hates your skin? I can!</li>
            <li> I first encountered Noxzema when my family came to visit last summer. Keep in mind that our whole family suffers from acne. They told me how great it works so of course I tried some.. It was amazing! When I rinsed it, it felt like a cool breeze on my face and I could immediately feel it working. The very next day almost half of my acne was cleared. I use this daily and now have no acne. I am looking forward to repurchasing and looking into their other products.</li>
            <li> Loved since elementary school when I first tried my Mom&#x27;s. :) Can&#x27;t beat the cool tingly clean of the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Noxema customer for decades, and I still love it! I use it as a refreshing mask, and to cool my skin down whenever I get redness or pimples. I just slather it on really thick, pop in a movie while I inhale the soothing vapors. I then rinse and my skin is cool, calm and baby smooth with a nice even color. Noxema is a miracle in a jar!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I was a teen.  I like it; I will use it again; I enjoy having it on the subscribe and save program.</li>
            <li> I use this daily for the last 20 years and it is the real stuff to keep me clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I am a hetero male, supposed to use after-shave and no creams, wash face with water after shaving or just for cleaning. My family has sworn by Noxzema forever. After-shave lotion is upward to 80% alcohol which dries and eventually wrinkles the skin. Soap is too heavy. I am 63 with no wrinkles. So I&#x27;ll continue the family solution even though I am male -- why not? Women taught me about the use of hair conditioners, 10,000 unit vitamin A cream for face and other dry skin parts.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t this be purchased in stores anymore? Maybe I&#x27;m old school, but I really love this product. It gets the job done and I&#x27;m willing to pay extra for it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m reminded of every time I smell it. Still the only thing I&#x27;ll use on my face after 20 years.</li>
            <li> After using more expensive cleansers for years, I went back to this staple of my teenage years and have stuck with it ever since. It&#x27;s perfect for combination and oily skin -- it removes excess oil while keeping your skin soft and moisturized. It also takes make-up off so I don&#x27;t even bother with cold cream followed by cleaner -- Noxzema does both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a medicinal smell, but it&#x27;s mild.</li>
            <li> Got this awhile ago at WalMart because I was getting terrible breakouts. Stopped using it for some reason, but continued again a couple of nights ago. I LOVE it! New pimples come to a head the next day, and my skin is so nice and smooth! Lasts a good amount of time too. The smell takes some getting used to, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I am a male in my 30&#x27;s. I sweat A LOT!!! I have oily skin on my face!!! The rest of my body can dry out and get irritated easily with harsh chemicals from other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, if I do not use this regularly I break out. I did not have acne issues as a teenager, but have had it since being an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over 10 years and it works for me. Everyone is different, especially when it comes to skin!</li>
            <li> Amazing for the price. Always makes my face feel nice and clean afterwards. The tub is a little annoying, wish it had a pump, but otherwise I can&#x27;t complain about this nice and simple product.</li>
            <li> Left a film on my face and did not remove my makeup completely even after washing twice. I had to use a toner afterward to remove the rest of the makeup. I wear a lot of layers (thick moisturizer, sunscreen, foundation, concealer, powder), but you would think something like this would remove the buildup on your face, and it doesn&#x27;t. I am better off with a plain bar of african black soap which does remove everything thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Original recipe--great!</li>
            <li> Arrived melted, but still good to use.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product as a teenager and didn&#x27;t even realize they still made it. I read that it&#x27;s beneficial for 40+ year old skin and ordered it. I love the refreshing smell of the eucalyptus and love that you can use it dry or wet. My pre-teen daughter now uses it and swears it makes her skin so silky soft and glowy. The only down side would be that you can&#x27;t wash off eye makeup with this or else it will BURN!</li>
            <li> I had pretty good skin as a teen.  I used noxzema all through my teens because I liked the minty  tingle. as an adult, I started using other fancy products.  after many decades,  I recently bought some noxzema and have been using it -- and it is truly fabulous !!!  Leaves my skin clean, soft, moisturized and smooth.  It just feels so healing.  I use it as a cleanser and I use it as a mask and it really works very very well.  I just slather a bunch on and leave it on for 30 mins before I wash it off.  My face feels amazing.  I am now wondering if I owe my good skin as a teen completely to Noxzema.  My European girlfriend&#x27;s face was so dry from the winter weather that her face was painful!!!  I took her to the drugstore and made her buy Noxzema.  After just one day, her face is pain free, soft, smooth and moisturized.   Noxema has other uses: good for sunburn good for bug bites good for hand cream good for feet cream good for excema  Apparently, a doctor invented noxzema as a sunburn remedy.  Others found out it was good for excema  -- and that is how it got it&#x27;s name no exzema !  This stuff is all you need, it&#x27;s cheap, it works wonderfully and I still like the minty tingle !!!!</li>
            <li> face wash that gets rid of those zits</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd but I&#x27;ve been using this off and on since I was a teen.  It really does a decent job for very little money, especially when you compare it to much of the beauty/facial care products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Noxzema (the original deep cleansing cream) for over a month now, and I love the way it makes me skin feel. My face is so soft after I use it, and I&#x27;ve noticed less acne/redness on my face since using it. I recommend this product to everyone no matter what condition your skin is in. You will be happy you bought it.</li>
            <li> this facial wash works good but you cant keep it in the shower or it will get water in it and get all wet and than you cant use it. so you have to use it when your out of the shower but i love noxzema they have great products</li>
            <li> For years I have been trying lots of differnt products. My skin was breaking out alot last month and I had remembered that my mom used to use this when I was a kid. Read mostly good reviews and went to try it out. My face feels clean and soft after using the product. I love the cold feeling it does when washing my face, and my face has cleared up so much with this product. Very well priced and works fabulous! Very happy.</li>
            <li> Wow! I can&#x27;t believe how great this stuff works! What I like, is that it&#x27;s really affordable. If you go to walmart or target it&#x27;s probably like $3.50 but anyway, the product works great and I suffer from little blemishes and oily skin. This pretty much got rid of my oily skin but at the same time didn&#x27;t leave it dry and flakey. I don&#x27;t know what it is but I like it. I&#x27;ve thrown out ALL my other skin care things and just use this now. It&#x27;s a lot faster and it works!</li>
            <li> Came as advertized, simply the best facial cleanser on the market IMHO!</li>
            <li> Why is it great for shaving? I&#x27;ll cut to the chase. Whiskers can be softened with hydroxides, and this has one or two different ones. Next, it has two different oils; perfect for moisturizing the skin and letting the blade glide across the skin while cutting whiskers. Another reason is the cooling effect from the menthol; the same effect you get from overpriced shave creams for men. I modified my 16 oz jar with a teaspoon of baking soda, mixed in really well. I let the whiskers absorb it for a few minutes before shaving. A 16 oz. jar will last me a long time; not bad for $5. Your mileage may vary, of course. I get a smooth shave with a great scent and nobody knows this man used Noxzema.&lt;br /&gt;  Do you find your skin is oily before bed? You just found another good use for this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use to love noxema. When did they change the ingredients? Just started this new jar after finishing the last of a stock of small jars. This one is causing me to get blemishes all over my face. I hate when companies do this. Was it to get longer shelf life and earn more money? How come companies are allowed to say original cleansing cream when its not? Do they even test to see if they are removing the ingredient combo that worked and allowed it to be marketed  in the first place?</li>
            <li> I bought this originally to put some sugar in and use as a scrub. I have been breaking out lately due to a medication and the only thing that has abolished it is 10% benzoyl peroxide cream. I don&#x27;t particularly like having to go through tube after tube of it and ruining my sleep shirts and sheets (it bleaches them), and it&#x27;s quite harsh and drying. I had read someone mentioning this as a sleep mask of sorts and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I started it 3 weeks ago and since then have not had a single new zit pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I&#x27;ve put on all my creams and anti aging potions, I slather a layer of this over my T zone and let it dry. Then I go to sleep, add a bit more in the morning to emulsify it and wash off. It takes about 2 minutes total but my acne seems to have disappeared, AND my pores look smaller, AND my skin is a lot softer. Win win win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a great shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is magic in a jar. It&#x27;s been around for ages for a reason!</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed Noxzema since I began a cleansing ritual as a young girl. It makes taking of makeup easy, super smooth as to not irritate while cleaning around the eyes. I also LOVE the eucalyptus smell. So relaxing. This cleansing cream also leave a tingle - not the &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve just used a product with a lot of chemicals&amp;#34; kind of tingle but the &amp;#34;Mmmm, my face feels super clean&amp;#34; tingle.&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin and Noxzema has always treated me well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Noxema cleansing cream! The price is awesome for the amount you get and it always leaves my face feeling fresh and clean after using it. I usually use it at night before bed. The menthol in it has the nice cooling effect while getting your face super clean.</li>
            <li> Frankly speaking I realy don&#x27;t like the smell of it! Though I tried hard, I still cannot accept it... So I gave it to my friend.</li>
            <li> It will dry your skin out a little with daily use, and for that reason I prefer the Noxema in a pump (for a clean, tingly feeling all over I occasionally use it as a bodywash).</li>
            <li> This truly is the end all be all of face wash.  It may not be the newest product on the block but there is a reason it has been around for so long.  This face wash is effective, plentiful and affordable.  I have tried several other products and have always come back to this one.  Why fix what isn&#x27;t broken (out).</li>
            <li> I had not used Noxzema products for more than 30 years.  I had been unable to find a product that cleaned my oily adult skin sufficiently enough that I did not have breakouts but also would not completely dry out my skin.  When I came across this product, I thought, why not? My aunt has used it her whole life and she has beautiful skin.  It has met my every demand and I am happier than I have ever been with the way my skin looks and feels.  Sometimes the old stuff is the best stuff.</li>
            <li> Noxzema is a great product.  I love the smell and the cool feeling you get when applying it.  A well known, proven product.</li>
            <li> My sister n I use noxzema every day in the morning and night. We are done with one in like 2-3 months. These have about a year expiration date. Great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Noxzema cleansing cream since I was a teenager.  I can remember seeing a jar of it on my grandmother&#x27;s dresser, and my mom uses it religiously.  I have experimented with other cleansing creams, but I keep coming back to this classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noxzema has a fresh, cooling feel (from the menthol and eucalyptus oil).  I use it each morning and night to cleanse my face.  It&#x27;s perfect for removing sweat, grease, and makeup (although beware of getting it in your eyes, because it definitely burns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many cleansers, Noxzema doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  It gives me a moist, glowing look that I love.  I also stay remarkably blemish-free, although I&#x27;m not particularly prone to acne, so it may be genetics rather than Noxzema that does the trick.  I love that Noxzema is an inexpensive, classic product that leaves my skin looking and feeling amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable, mild cleanser without salicylic acid or other harsh chemicals.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Is and always has been a great product.</li>
            <li> Its the old Noxzema  but its the only thing I use on my face. Still good after all these years. Glad they havent changed it</li>
            <li> I have been using Noxema skin cream ever since I was 10 years old and it&#x27;s one beauty product that I can&#x27;t do without.  Leaves your skin soft and clean, feels cool and refreshing, and smells great without giving me a headache or sinus congestion like a lot of other fragrances.  Wish I could give it 100 stars!  I hope they never change the original formula because it simply  cannot be improved upon.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy it after I read good reviews... but this product just doesnt work for me. I don&#x27;t like the smell and although it gives a temporary feeling of freshness on my skin, it doesnt prevent me from breaking out. AcneFree Cleaning System (from CVS) helps me much better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week but don&#x27;t see any results so far.</li>
            <li> at my place it doesn&#x27;t last long every person at home uses it I personally use it for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Noxema has been an outstanding product for at least 60 years or more.  I can recall having been in a doctor&#x27;s office with my Mom at an early age when I discovered the pleasant medical scent of this cream.  It is an excellent moisturizing cream and so affordable.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I am able to find the face cream I have used since I was a teenager.  The price isn&#x27;t bad and the delivery to my front door is perfect!</li>
            <li> I like Noxzema, but this particular bottle arrived a little dried out on the top. It&#x27;s still usable, but may not be fresh.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> the benefit here is the price!!  this was an addon item - ideal when it is what you want anyway!! i use it for shaving and cleansing - the best!</li>
            <li> Best skin cleaning product ever!</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels and looks after using this. Ingredients are perfect. I don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer after washing... Thanks Nox!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It works amazingly on my skin and it really is a very good deep cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy formula with that unique invigorating tingle when it hits your skin.  I have used this product daily for 34 years and it prevents my excema outbreaks.  Inexpensive wonder product !</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews, I remember having this in the house awhile ago. I have pretty oily skin, but it&#x27;s also flaky. When I saw this at my local Safeway for $5, I thought \\&quot;Huh, it&#x27;s cheaper than my usual Neutrogena stuff, so why not give it a try?\\&quot; The smell is just as I remember it, cool, fresh, minty. I haven&#x27;t used it as just a cleanser yet, but I&#x27;ve been putting it on every night for 20 - 30 minutes before I get in the shower, and then I wash it off. It&#x27;s been 3 days, so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, maybe my pores are a little smaller, but my mild acne is still apparent. Hopefully it will really start to work it&#x27;s magic that I&#x27;ve read so much about here pretty soon. I will update in a week or so to report any differences. For now I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because it does clean my face, which is what it was made to do. And the smell and tingle is a big bonus &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT** 12/30/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, okay. So I had the Noxzema on when I was writing the above review. I left it on for about an hour because I was distracted by internet. Anyways, I took a shower, rinsed it off as always, and when I got out, the blackheads on my nose and chin were considerably smaller! And my face is noticeably smoother. I&#x27;m not sure if these changes were due to continued use over a few days, or because I left the product on longer. Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I don&#x27;t care for about the Noxzema cream is the consistency. It reminds me of cottage cheese. It&#x27;s not a smooth, soft cream, it&#x27;s a chunky mess. The chunks make it a little hard to apply in an even layer. You kind of have to just glop it on.</li>
            <li> For dry skin or very sensitive allergy prone skin&lt;br /&gt;like mine you can&#x27;t beat it.  Only use is on my face.</li>
            <li> I like to keep a big jar of Noxema in the kitchen and in my bathroom.  I use it to wash my face and for what my mom used to call \\&quot;spit baths\\&quot; to clean up after I&#x27;ve worked in the yard and just want to feel cool and clean without actually taking a bath or shower.  I have few problems with my skin but every time I&#x27;ve had a small irritated place I&#x27;ve just put a glob of Noxema on it and it heals.  Also, and this is a bit gross, if you have a rectal irritation trying to become a hemorrhoid, just put a glob of Noxema on a folded up Kleenix and put it there, replace as needed. The irritation will go away. I&#x27;ve ordered the Noxema Cream with Moisterizer and hope that I&#x27;ll like it too. It&#x27;s hard to find Noxema in the larger sizes now.  The stores only seem to carry something about 3.5 ounces and they charge the earth for it even if it is their store brand.  These prices are great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was 12 years old and will not switch. I am now in my mid 40s and I am constantly complimented on my skin. Bottom line is that this works to clean and moisturize perfectly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think a Noxzema review is needed, it&#x27;s Noxzema. It cleans your skin, takes off makeup and it even took really nasty black dirt off my son&#x27;s hands that wouldn&#x27;t come off with soap and a skin brush. Leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> Since I was a baby this has been in my family&#x27;s medicine cabinet.  Not only to cleanse my face after salt water sailing and being sprayed with drying salt water all day  but also as a facial prep prior to shaving.  Cleans my face and softens my beard at the same time.  Great product</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I always looked at Noxema products as crappy products that teens used to try and clear blemishes that didn&#x27;t really work. I have always purchased expense high-end products and up until a couple of years ago, they worked great! I&#x27;m not sure what changed for me, but after the birth of my second daughter my skin started breaking out and NOTHING including a round of accutane worked to get and keep me clear. That was UNTIL my great grandmother saw me without makeup on (and how badly my skin was broken out) and told me she had been using it for years and years and that it was the secret to her still beautiful skin at 92.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One month of washing my face with this in the morning and wearing a face mask of it to bed every night and my skin has stopped breaking out completely and the hyper-pigmentation that I&#x27;ve had for years is slowly fading. I actually went grocery shopping this past weekend without makeup on for the first time in FIVE years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone with blemishes and/or fine lines. My skin is soft, clear and the few wrinkles I have forming around my eyes are less noticeable. Two thumbs way up!</li>
            <li> This stuff is  GREAT, for healing cuts and skin irritations!!!  Been using it, my WHOLE life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to Germany 28 years ago, it wasn&#x27;t sold there, so I had my mom mail me some!!! I CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT!!!  I will buy 4 jars at a time, so I never run out!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE the smell....it even OPENS UP MY BREATHING PASSAGES!!!!</li>
            <li> Affordable, non-animal tested (to the best of my knowledge) and takes off make-up efficaciously. Oldie but goodie. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be wasting my money again on more pricey cleansers - and it also takes off eye make-up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v been using noxzema since the age of 12! I don&#x27;t use anything to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I like this, looks like really big volume and works pretty well, i can see the dirt coming out from my nose, only thing is the smell makes me feel like some wried medicine</li>
            <li> As a male I started using my moms and sister Noxzema years ago when going through puberty...lol I remember it has always worked well so I decided to use it as an adult to keep my face clean and free of possible acne. It works great and I always get compliments that I have nice and clear skin. Recommended buy that&#x27;s been around for years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Noxema for make-up removal.  Leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed!  I also have used this as a hand cream at night and it works great!</li>
