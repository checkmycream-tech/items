            <li>Great product and I will be buying again!</li>

            <li>Beautiful color</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll get an immediate beautiful color from the bronzer.</li>
            <li>However, the remaining color is beautiful, on the brown side.</li>
            <li>And best of all STREAK FREE!!</li>
            <li>This is a great sunless product.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>gives great color after 3 applications...</li>
            <li>With the Tanwise Mousse, the plastic bottle and pump work perfectly, and it dispenses a nice amount of foam each time, no surprises or messes at all.</li>
            <li>Tanwise Mousse for the win.</li>
            <li>it goes on great.</li>
            <li>I sleep in it then shower in the morning for great, streak-free color.</li>
            <li>all, great product</li>
            <li>great tanner.</li>
            <li>The spray was great but tended to leave stains on my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>I bought some gloves meant for hair coloring and they are great.</li>
            <li>After trying a couple and not being happy, I found this one.</li>
            <li>But it blends amazingly well and gives the perfect color that isn&#x27;t too orange.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have gotten 3 compliments this morning alone on how great it looks.</li>
            <li>This tanning mousse works great.  </li>
            <li>The color is great.  </li>
            <li>This product I think would be GREAT for people my skin tone and fairer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s a win in my book.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I used it before my winter wedding and it came out great.</li>
            <li>The color guide is great though</li>
            <li>Just keep rubbing it in and it will look great.</li>
            <li>and it blended great both times.</li>
            <li>This gives a great tan when applied well.</li>
            <li>a very nice brown color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gave me a very nice color</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I paired this with the bronzing cream and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>Like many others, I ordered this product after reading about it on MaskCara&#x27;s blog &#x27;The Perfect Tan&#x27; (http://www.maskcara.com/2014/03/18/the-perfect-tan/).</li>
            <li>Divinely pleased with Tanwise and lookin Good!!  </li>
            <li>Best that ive tried yet and believe me I have tried many.</li>
            <li>Too many people expect to slather on a self tanning product and have it turn out perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and the color</li>
            <li>Im fair to med skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also try to get some good before and after photos.</li>
            <li>and I have fair fair skin</li>
            <li>and you are good to go</li>
            <li>It really is as good as shes says.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about the mousse</li>
            <li>I used it two or three times but could not get it to give me a good color.</li>
            <li>so I didnt look as pastey and fair.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and goes on evenly.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>I have used twice on my legs, great stuff, gives a nice tan, lots of compliments</li>
            <li>Plus it smells really good, like coconut.</li>
            <li>All mousses&#x27; (even spendy reputable brands) look &#x27;muddy&#x27; but give you beautiful even coverage.</li>
            <li>It has a color in the foam which is great for seeing what it will look like once it develop, which makes it so easy to use!</li>
            <li>While I would not call it perfect, and do not think it is totally deserving of 5 stars, I would definitely say it is the best self tanner I have used.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no streaks, and gives you a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Follow the advice about application.&lt;br /&gt;Await spectacular color.  </li>
            <li>Used it years ago and liked it.</li>
            <li>The absolute Best Bronzy Brown Tan color Ever!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and burn more than tan.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this tanner, but you must buy an applicator glove to apply.</li>
            <li>fragrance is nice, coconut, then fades to nothing.</li>
            <li>The absolute best tanning solution I have ever used, and I have used a LOT of them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re already kind of tan</li>
            <li>I honestly believe some people don&#x27;t use it or apply it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you can read this whole thing, you can do some research and come out with a perfect.</li>
            <li>all the excess washed off leaving a nice glow of a tan.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product quite a bit.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice brown.</li>
            <li>Over all a great tanner with a beautiful, natural color!</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I got this mousse in the mail because I had read great reviews.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and one coat of this product was enough to give me a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, and it rubbed in easy.</li>
            <li>It was the best self tanner I had found including trying high end products.</li>
            <li>Smells good and even though it smells good while applying it quickly fades to no odor at all.</li>
            <li>It Is a good product, easy to apply, light pleasant fragrance, inexpensive and lasts for days.</li>
            <li>mousse is very easy to apply - use a mitt to make it easier and dries quicker.  </li>
            <li>Tanwise was pretty easy to apply and it worked great!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product I have ever used..</li>
            <li>So far I am still experimenting with what works best for my skin type, but I think my process is going to be 2 consecutive days of tanning, then 2 off.</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of sunless tanners and Tanwise Mousse is by FAR the BEST!!!</li>
            <li>and this one is by far the best in terms of color and staying power.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice now and it was so easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Tanning mitts do not spread the product easily since it is a mousse.&lt;br /&gt;Again, use gloves!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have tried many self tanning products, this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Which by the way, it will rub off on your clothes and sheets, but very lightly.</li>
            <li>an nice even tone and goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>but it DOES make you realistic brown beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>I am a very fair, woman who doesn&#x27;t tan naturally.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>I tend to use more of the product if I want a darker tan.</li>
            <li>The more often I use the brozer</li>
            <li>it gets more than a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>the most like a pro spray tan I&#x27;ve ever seen&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do it lightly, and go over it with my handy damp/dry wash cloth to make sure those areas don&#x27;t get dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&#x27;s a bit more on the times I have used it:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I would suggest maybe sleeping with the lotion on while laying on some towels, instead of doing what I did… I had to go around butt-naked in my house for 4 hours doing and touching nothing until I could shower off the tanner.</li>
            <li>So yeah, unless you feel like sitting around doing nothing for hours, try using it at night while you are sleeping! :)</li>
            <li>and there were marks where my tank top was.  </li>
            <li>It is a mouse which is not my favorite-</li>
            <li>and I have recommended it to many others and of the 3 that have tried it</li>
            <li>it will leave a mark!  :)</li>
            <li>I. Love.</li>
            <li>It is even better then salon tans.</li>
            <li>I used the applicator glove to apply and then rub everything in for a bit longer to make sure it is applied evenly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works best if I apply it only once per day, after showering.</li>
            <li>I can skip an application or two and still have a nice light brown color.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It dries REALLY fast, which is great.</li>
            <li>I love this self-tanner.</li>
            <li>It seems that by Day 3 or 4 most of it has washed off if I&#x27;m not reapplying</li>
            <li>You will probably need more product than you expect.</li>
            <li>That is definitely an appropriate price for this product.</li>
            <li>Works much better with gloves.</li>
            <li>Its ok, would not buy again</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments and will be using it again soon to gear up for the summer.</li>
            <li>and I know that the more I use it the better</li>
            <li>Try to face gel and shimmer cream too :)</li>
            <li>a most self tanning</li>
            <li>I love this product and look forward to making it my summer staple.</li>
            <li>and you have an instant perfect tan that lasts for 2-3 days!</li>
            <li>It actually smells great!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this</li>
            <li>im almost see through, i have tried many self tanning creams, lotions, mouse</li>
            <li>St. Topez tends to tun my skin yellowish but I continued to use because I could not find anything better.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with it.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m a pretty fair skinned gal, so I was worried about it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned, and this tanner gives me noticeable color without looking unnatural.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always impressed at how long those last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved this product the first two times I applied it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange and has a beautiful natural color.</li>
            <li>For the most even application it is best to apply this product after shaving and showering and moisturizing the rough areas (elbows, hands and feet) and make sure you apply with a tanning mitt.</li>
            <li>First off, I am a fair skinned redhead</li>
            <li>This went on easily and it was good to be able to see exactly where you were applying the product.</li>
            <li>You get best results when mixing it with lotion or else it goes on too dry.</li>
            <li>I love using this as a touch up when i spray tan, it makes it last longer and looks great over top :)</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is out of your face and if you are going to put the tanner on your face, make sure it is clean.</li>
            <li>Ok, I am a huge fan of the Tanwise lotion</li>
            <li>Great, natural looking color.</li>
            <li>This is the most important thing to me in a self tanner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most importantly I wanted it to be affordable.</li>
            <li>and so far i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Compared to others, I think this product lasts longer and goes on a lot more smoothly.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend it to anyone who is fair skinned.</li>
            <li>Tanwise is very easy to apply and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Price is ok but worth it if unavailable in your area!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful compared to other self tanners.</li>
            <li>It is easy to blend into the skin with a tan mitt and dries very quickly without streaking.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>so I can easily switch the mitt from hand to hand.</li>
            <li>but so far this really is the best self tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Product is easy to apply and does not leave an orange tint.  </li>
            <li>the mousse is an easy to apply vehicle.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really easy to see where your applying.</li>
            <li>Easily applied and blends well.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It dries very quick and is not streaky.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to see where you missed</li>
            <li>The color blended easily and did not look streaky or orange.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply</li>
            <li>It DOES transfer on to bedding, however it easily washes out in the washing machine.</li>
            <li>I have spots of red on my arms and stretch marks from two kids and this product covered beautifully.</li>
            <li>So far I definitely like this kind the best.</li>
            <li>This is hands down, the BEST self tanner out there.</li>
            <li>when on fine had no streaks I am NOT orange</li>
            <li>{It looks fine once it&#x27;s worked in}.  </li>
            <li>and it turned out fine.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine if you are used to sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the lotion because of how quickly it dries.</li>
            <li>I invite any self-tanning novice to start with a mousse like this for excellent results, where you can work with the product for a little bit before it sets.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a huge deal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it  lightly on my face.</li>
            <li>An important part about those orange prone areas: I go ahead and run the mitt over my ankles, elbows, tops of feet, and knees.</li>
            <li>I just make sure that I don&#x27;t do it with a fresh pump on the mitt.</li>
            <li>When you do shower, lightly scrub in circular motions all over your body.</li>
            <li>I used rubber gloves as well and then a cotton ball to coat the backs of my hands lightly.</li>
            <li>One thing I do like about this is it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>PLUS, it lasts for many uses and so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>A light exfoliation fixes that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The color will build over time, so its important to blend, blend, blend while you apply it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is light</li>
            <li>Actually, it worked great.</li>
            <li>that gives you great instant color while the product develops.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light neutral</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>I suggest using a glove or something to smooth it on</li>
            <li>This is an overall great product, and I don&#x27;t think the price should frighten you; it really is a great product for a low price!</li>
            <li>its fantastic</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and it lasts really long.</li>
            <li>My skin is fair to medium naturally,</li>
            <li>I had no idea whatsoever that I could look this good, this tan so fast, even though I am fair I have a lot of yellow in my skin</li>
            <li>This is my favorite drugstore tanner, the price is right and it goes on even and brown</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I&#x27;m naturally a Red Head with very Fair skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t have a super strong smell when you are applying it</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked it though!</li>
            <li>But after showering all the bronzer rinses off and I&#x27;m left with a nice medium brown tan!</li>
            <li>A small price to pay for a GREAT product!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate well, and if you follow up with a lotion with a hint of bronzer it will even out any spots with too much product!</li>
            <li>This is totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>So worth the money!</li>
            <li>I apply the Tanwise Mousse with a clean tanning mitt and a disposable glove underneath.</li>
            <li>I was truly shocked to find this tanner is easy to apply, smells great and gives a great believable color.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, the smell is quite pleasant, Rum Coconutty, whereas Saint Tropez&#x27;s stank.</li>
            <li>This is true for any self tanning product that gives you any amount of significant color.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>So far I love this sunless tanner!</li>
            <li>, I dont use any special moisturizer on them that I dont put on my knees and elbows, so</li>
            <li>The color that develops is amazing and natural.</li>
            <li>Left a good color.</li>
            <li>I hope you all love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I bought the same shade that I get in the lotion- fair to medium -</li>
            <li>Also a really good thing is use gloves when applying then do your hands last.</li>
            <li>This product is superlative for imparting a nice, natural brown color to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on brown/black and does have a sort of ash-green look to it</li>
            <li>Such a good value for the $$$$</li>
            <li>Plus it does NOT smell like DHA at all, and I love the mousse formula because it spreads on very evenly.</li>
            <li>I buy mine at my local Sally&#x27;s store, but thought I&#x27;d give a good review on here.</li>
            <li>I did my research on the product and it had really good reviews overall</li>
            <li>I waited the full 15 minutes to get dressed and have not had any transfer issues.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;ve been using it with my hands and making sure to wash them really well.</li>
            <li>So far i&#x27;ve been loving this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do have to be sure to massage the mousse in thoroughly so that you don&#x27;t see streaks, and resist the urge to spread the product out too much to make the streaks go away.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to see exactly how it&#x27;s coming out as you apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It dries quickly (although it will transfer until you shower)&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li>Use a mit or gloves when applying because the product dries quickly.</li>
            <li>What you see is (luckily) what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>luckily, I decided to give it another shot, and applied it at night before bed</li>
            <li>When I showered the next day and the bronzer came off, a PERFECT tan was left in its place.</li>
            <li>I did get some on my clothes when I dressed to quickly.</li>
            <li>Great immediate color (although super dark), and no splotches, no bad smell.</li>
            <li>mousse dries quickly but not too quickly.</li>
            <li>As the days went on, it faded rather quickly.</li>
            <li>This gives a great glow but to be real here, you need someone you don&#x27;t mind to see you naked to help you apply it.</li>
            <li>but it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone is slightly above fair, and sensitive but this color looks natural and great on me; like a real life from the sun tan!  </li>
            <li>it does have a greenish tint when very first applied but goes away with in a min</li>
            <li>I was left with a beautiful natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>mousse formula is easy to apply and gives you a nice marriage of blendability and quick dry time.</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t super duper dark but 2 coats and its amazing, so i would say its build able.</li>
            <li>Almost a week after my first application, I&#x27;ve still got some color!</li>
            <li>Smells great, best color I&#x27;ve seen, has an instant color and also gets darker over time, a little goes a long way, stays on longer than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and then it will look blotchy-- if I shower first, this doesn&#x27;t happen!</li>
            <li>so it looks more natural!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no weird smell and looks like a real tan!  </li>
            <li>This stuff gave me an amazing tan but wasn&#x27;t worth it 2 days later when this stuff came off in patches.</li>
            <li>The color is amazingly brown with no yellow tones.</li>
            <li>tanner has the most natural color of any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The tanner looked like it was rubbing off, but I woke up, showered, and was left with a nice glow afterward.</li>
            <li>It is the most natural looking (after showering, of course)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff looks so natural</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most natural looking self tanner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>You might get a work out, but it is so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Allow</li>
            <li>and I did not have any streaking problems (although I used a mitt and spent a fair amount of time smoothing it out).</li>
            <li>My favorite bronzer so far.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a much more natural color to it as well.</li>
            <li>I love fake tanner and this is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>I did miss some spots, but was able to even it out with a second application the next day and it looks really really good.</li>
            <li>I have used Jergen&#x27;s (both the 3 day and 7 day lotion, and face lotion which is all decent but doesn&#x27;t get very dark, plus takes a while to set), and L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze (both the glittery stuff in the tube and the towlettes which are OK with some good practice but prone to be orange and streaky).</li>
            <li>I can think of several self tanners I&#x27;ve tried where the product itself was wonderful, but there was no good way to apply it because the packaging designers botched the nozzle/cap (think Toma&#x27;s Airbrush tanning spray- lovely color, spitty nozzle).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and every other self tanner I&#x27;ve tried looked orangey or streaky.  </li>
            <li>When I first washed off the color guard after developing this tan overnight, I could tell immediately that I liked the bronze color: very natural, nice and dark.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going for body builder bronze, you&#x27;ve found the right product.</li>
            <li>but it washed right out.</li>
            <li>Tanwise dark bronzing sunless mousse provides a nice smooth color that is just the right shade.</li>
            <li>It took more effort on my part to blend it, compared to the St. Tropez, but I am very pleased with the dark color, the subtle (pleasant) smell, and the evenness.  </li>
            <li>The mousse dried almost instantly, the smell is awesome, the color is awesome and lasts longer than several of the other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>the bronzer is a really pretty golden brown color.</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; developed into a dark, beautiful golden brown within hours.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s left is a nice, natural lightly tanned look.  </li>
            <li>i got stuck on Fake Bake, really good stuff gave a great natural tan until i saw this on YouTube....</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t smell too bad at all, i apply it in the morning shower at night and within two days i have a great color used once a week keeps me looking healthy if i use it more often (during summer)</li>
            <li>I am a red head with fair skin that does tan in the sun, so this tan looks natural!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found that it lasts as long as some of the other reviews might suggest, but if you keep it up it looks great!</li>
            <li>When I first started to apply it I was nervous about the bronzer, which right out of the bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be awesome not to have to reapply every single day, or even every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It appears very dark but the color goes on very easily, does not turn orange and blends easily.  </li>
            <li>Goes on quickly and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I immediately searched for this online (because I am too lazy to search for it in-store, lol), and tried it out the first day I received it.</li>
            <li>You need to go easy near ankles &amp; not get too close to soles of feet.  </li>
            <li>I recommend putting some kind of moisturizer on before you apply this tanner because it dries really fast--almost not giving you enough time to rub it in.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how easy this was to apply.  </li>
            <li>I have ivory skin and it looks natural and easy to make even.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the light scent and chemicals</li>
            <li>I go over ankles, knees, toes and fingers very lightly and only once, blending as I</li>
            <li>I think this is a really close contender!</li>
            <li>can see exactly where the color is going as you apply, which makes it easier to not miss spots</li>
            <li>I was also able to get the tanner out of my sheets after a simple wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time I tried the product I didn&#x27;t have the mitt</li>
            <li>and I was first applying it</li>
            <li>have tried many different tanning lotions, before Tanwise, and after Tanwise.</li>
            <li>It has replaced my high-end tanner (the Fake Bake Flawless Liquid).</li>
            <li>first time I put this product on, I washed it off immediately-</li>
            <li>and so glad I gave it a second chance!!</li>
            <li>This is also the first time I have tried the mousse over just the lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First hand experience here, however, I just blended it with my hand where the rain had streaked it, washed my hands and it looked</li>
            <li>I am pasty white, and yet, this spring I have gotten more compliments than ever about how tan I look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty forgiving too.</li>
            <li>This was not expensive.</li>
            <li>It went pretty well, so I did it all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was at first reluctant to try this product because of the review below.</li>
            <li>When you first pump the mousse out into your hand, the color will horrify you.</li>
            <li>Great color, and the bottle lasts me at least two months.</li>
            <li>And the scent of this mousse is not nearly as bad as some other brands, even including more high-end ones.</li>
            <li>Let yourself dry for more than 20 minutes if you plan on getting dressed right after.</li>
            <li>and I slept in very light jammie pants and a long sleeve and there was no transfer.</li>
            <li>He told me he used this product, and I honestly didn&#x27;t believe it, because I assumed all self tanners left orange-tints, but his skin looked so naturally</li>
            <li>I read online that this Tanwise was a duplicate of the Sun Labs tanner that I have always loved, but being that I cannot get Sun Labs locally, I ran to my local Sallys to pickup some Tanwise.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the most natural color and goes on without ANY streaks.</li>
            <li>I find that this application is fading a bit more unevenly (but really not terrible at all, and I think it still looks natural), probably because it was darker in the first</li>
            <li>The tanner absorbs very quickly so I apply lotion over the entire area first.</li>
            <li>Works very well, first time user.</li>
            <li>The tanner gives a great natural color and because it does look so natural, I don&#x27;t have to be so careful about knees, elbows, fingers/toes, etc.</li>
            <li>Nice color but very streaky and fades extremely patchy.</li>
            <li>This resulted in a pretty dark color for my skin (I am really fair), kind of like a July or August tan like I had been outside all summer long.</li>
            <li>I really liked how the Tanwise Dark Bronzing Sunless tanner went on because you could see where you were putting it.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful for a subtle tan or you can apply another coat the next day for a deeper tan.</li>
            <li>Beautiful instant color with little to no streaking.</li>
            <li>But my back is not bad!</li>
            <li>It looks super natural, and I received a LOT of compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the smell that most self tanners do and once dry</li>
            <li>The guide color does kind of make you look green at first</li>
            <li>I fine the lotion looks a little more orange than the mousse, even though the lotion looks very natural as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>When using my hands, I wash with soap thoroughly after applying it to any one certain area so that my palms don&#x27;t look tan.</li>
            <li>but I have mastered that at this point, It is prob more costly then FB and on me does not last quite as long, I do however like the light fragrance, BUT,</li>
            <li>But using a moisturizer first allowed me enough time to rub it in really well and get a smooth tan.</li>
            <li>I do sweats and a loose tank top.</li>
            <li>The color looked very good, not orange or fake.</li>
            <li>A Huge Merci to all the sisters that left encouraging reviews.</li>
            <li>but in spring/summer I want a glow or light tan especially on my legs.</li>
            <li>The tanner will go straight through the mitt</li>
            <li>really evenly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well...</li>
            <li>white or light colored until you wash the bronzer off</li>
            <li>it begins to wear off, it&#x27;s worth the time to exfoliate the remainder completely off, and then start over.</li>
            <li>Yes, I care about this, because it really matters.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>I feel like you have to work really fast</li>
            <li>really really well before use (as with any self tanner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>And the foam is great for applying a thin layer with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to rub it in like a lotion as it dries much</li>
            <li>I buy mine from Sally&#x27;s for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have washed after 4 hrs but it give me much of color.</li>
            <li>It is much Eisner then having to scrub your hands after.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to reapply after about a week.</li>
            <li>I applied the product to my whole body, including my face.</li>
            <li>This will save me so much money compared to the aerosol</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not even close to a real tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a glove to apply this and my hands, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make too much of a difference in the look.  </li>
            <li>I really like this- not streaky or blotchy whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparable in quality to my St. Tropez Bronzing Mousse, but at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I use and would recommend The Ultimate Tanning Applicator Mitt by Thermalabs (also available on Amazon).</li>
            <li>but it is a whole lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re still reading this, you must really want to try it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and nobody wants a tan there.</li>
            <li>I rub it all over, then give an extra pat to my cheeks, nose, chin, and top of forehead to create a natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different self-tanners and this is by far one of my lease favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that after application I got fabulously dark - but that was primarily because of the bronzer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What is true about the comments: It will look super dark when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>I have such a hard time finding a self tanner that works well with my fair skin and doesn&#x27;t turn out orange and blotchy!</li>
            <li>And I just bought a new bottle the first week of June.</li>
            <li>Far right photo is after a shower.</li>
            <li>But that washes right off and has a natural tone.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for other customers I do plan on buying some more ..great products</li>
            <li>and I think the bottle is going to go a really long way, which is nice since the price on this stuff has really increased since I was looking at it last summer!</li>
            <li>Perfect substitute for expensive spray tanning!</li>
            <li>It does work better than any other I have tried...</li>
            <li>It does not rub off when first applied and drys fast ( about 5-10 mins ) and that&#x27;s full dry time, meaning no stickiness.</li>
            <li>Long story short : Tanwise will give you a nice, non orange tan, but you should go for the lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other self tanners for years, mainly sticking with Banana Boat spray.</li>
            <li>The bronzer can be hard to work into your skin and look kind of streaky initially, keep working it into your skin until it is smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go out at night to a dark bar like this, but if you splash any water on yourself, the bronzer will come off and it will look bizarre!</li>
            <li>I was nervous about how dark it was, but just rub it in and make sure it&#x27;s even</li>
            <li>it does get quite dark, which I personally love.</li>
            <li>Tanwise is probably more like Ultra Dark instead which is a step down(lighter).  </li>
            <li>I have a medium complexion with dark hair, so the darker tans just look better on me.  </li>
            <li>I thought my back for sure was going to be splotchy since I saw several mistakes in the mirror and went over them again, which just caused me to overlap some places I had already gone, and the guide color was very splotchy, but I gave up.</li>
            <li>I made sure to apply moisturizer on my knees, elbows, and ankles to keep these areas from getting dark with the tanning product.</li>
            <li>I use at night, and when I shower in the morning, most of the self-tanner scent goes down the drain</li>
            <li>I use this primarily on my chest and arms 3-4 times per week and the bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and evenly, allow it to dry before dressing, there will be some residue on your clothes until you shower 4-6 hours later, so don&#x27;t wear your favorite white dress!</li>
            <li>I like this so much better than I do the Sun Labs product I had previously thought</li>
            <li>Get it nice and thick and rub it in really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Also, I do highly recommend you using an application glove or mitt because it will stain your hands when applying.</li>
            <li>It looks more natural than other tanners I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>It looks totally natural!!</li>
            <li>It does seem to dry quickly though so you have to apply and then rub it in fast.</li>
            <li>No orangy color, not too dark, no unpleasant smell, color right away...</li>
            <li>It is honestly pretty hard to screw up the application with this stuff, just make sure you blend well and check for any streaks after you put it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered 3 more for summer and don&#x27;t know i&#x27;ll last that long.</li>
            <li>it looks great, but I don&#x27;t have the patience to lie still on the beach long enough to blush much less tan...</li>
            <li>It does rub off a tiny bit on my sheets, but it washes right out.</li>
            <li>Yes, I had to buy a new foundation to match my tan because I got that</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I use self tanner often and am always on the look out for a new product.</li>
            <li>but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>Hope this review helps someone who is new to tanning like me.</li>
            <li>but it is very easily disturbed if you brush against something too hard.</li>
            <li>Not quite as easy to apply and a spray, but so worth the extra trouble of a mousse.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that is has a not so good smell to it, but then again,</li>
            <li>looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Required another person to apply the places I couldn&#x27;t reach but it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>It is a very natural looking color</li>
            <li>This product went on evenly and looked very natural.  </li>
            <li>I find that most lotion formulas give you plenty of time to blend, but they take too long to dry-</li>
            <li>I am brown not too dark ..dryed very well and quickly</li>
            <li>Otherwise if you are just looking for a slight tint of color then this would work fine</li>
            <li>This consistency actually helped me rub it in my skin evenly allowing me to see where exactly I was applying it.</li>
            <li>This is going to replace my Jergans Natural Glow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used by far!</li>
            <li>I paid it because it&#x27;s a step up from the cheapest stuff at the drug store, and had reviews similar to some high end brands but for MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li>The product comes out a scary dark olive color but quickly dries to a beautiful chocolate color, so you&#x27;d think you&#x27;d be getting super dark.</li>
            <li>It does come out VERY dark, so the color guide makes it easy to apply but just know that is not the color you are going to be, the color guide comes off in the shower.</li>
            <li>I use one full pump per section and start with my calves, doing one leg at a time, then working up to my thighs, stomach, chest, lower back, shoulders, upper arms, then lower arms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pale and did not suffer many issues with orange spots.</li>
            <li>So next time I will rinse off before I get into a bed with super white sheets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; When I stick my face right down into my skin, I actually can&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li>You will see if you get it on your white towels, it&#x27;s made up of reds, browns, blacks, so it really looks like you have been in the sun, even giving you a pinky sort of tan (though maybe I think that is the most natural for me because I am usually have my tan with a sunburn...</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t very dark, and did make me look more orange- especially after re-applying.</li>
            <li>I have never had a professional spray tan or gotten a Mystic tan or anything, but judging by how I&#x27;ve seen those turn out on my friends</li>
            <li>Wear old clothes, use old towels, etc.</li>
            <li>But what tanning product, even a natural tan, isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li>It also happened on my chest after 2 consecutive nights of application but once again only I can really see it.</li>
            <li>It pretty much washed all the way off because I didn&#x27;t let the DHA sit long enough on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tan came out completely even and now I realize it was just the bronzer rubbing off.</li>
            <li>I first heard of this stuff from my hairdresser, when I asked him how the heck he didn&#x27;t look pasty-white all winter long.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have not had any problems with the bronzer staining my clothes; it has come off completely after washing the clothes.  </li>
            <li>But you will still retain a natural tan underneath.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product for the price!</li>
            <li>The color comes off natural and isn&#x27;t orange.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to order it from Amazon instead of going to Sally because there isnt one near me.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a tan that looks natural on me.  </li>
            <li>Tanwise was better in that a small amount really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised by how tan I was after just one session.</li>
            <li>so people will think that I am a professional sun bather.</li>
            <li>it comes to self tanners, you MUST do the work in order to obtain a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>It never blended naturally</li>
            <li>So far I like the color-</li>
            <li>He thinks the tanwise color looks natural on me.</li>
            <li>far as the smell... there is one.</li>
            <li>for how long the tan lasts, I&#x27;m still on my first application</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t see how much I have left in the bottle</li>
            <li>The tan looks natural, I use plenty of lotion around ankle &amp; knees to avoid orange bruise look.</li>
            <li>Natural color.</li>
            <li>I have a light/medium natural skin color, but am concerned with tanning at this point.</li>
            <li>It looks 100% natural.</li>
            <li>Gives a natural color and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>It once again turned out super dark</li>
            <li>skinned- not the very fairest in most foundations, but usually the second or third from the fairest in a neutral shade.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend using a glove and/or mitt with this as it does dry quickly and can stain hands (although there are ways to get that off)</li>
            <li>Seems Theres no mess up.</li>
            <li>I do this so the tan is still dark enough, but the shower will rinse off anything that could potentially get on your clothes, especially if it&#x27;s a hot day</li>
            <li>I used a fine sized amount on the edge of my tanning mitt and worked it into my face starting with my forehead and cheeks and blending down my neck.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that wouldn&#x27;t make me orange, wouldn&#x27;t streak, wouldn&#x27;t smell, and would last a decent amount of time (5-7 days would be optimal).</li>
            <li>put this on at about 2pm for my first application, and left it on until 10am the next morning when I showered, exfoliated again and reapplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put on two layers right after each other, watch some TV standing up while it dries, then sleep, and shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this sunless tanning mousse, since it was recommended on maskcara&#x27;s blog recently.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for a good fake and bake!</li>
            <li>With the mitt and all it made such a huge mess</li>
            <li>On my skin, the color lasts for about 5 or 6 days total before my legs revert to their normal untanned color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the instant color, the evenness (it was a big surprise since like I said I was worried when I saw a few lines it had made overnight)</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s lasting pretty long!</li>
            <li>It is very dark while it is developing, but after you wash the top layer off it gives you a very nice base tan.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even put a new pump on the mitt, I just use what is left over in the mitt.</li>
            <li>you only need to apply enough to absorb.. too much &amp; it can be a bit sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m medium/fair skin with blonde hair and this gave me a very natural tan, no orange at all.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for beginners - if you&#x27;re using it as your first lotion, read directions carefully, or have someone help you!</li>
            <li>For a more subtle color/glow, try a gradual, buildable lotion (such as Jergens) or just a washable body bronzer.</li>
            <li>If you rub too hard you&#x27;ll have a product free spot with which you need to reapply.  </li>
            <li>so I applied it to my legs with my bare hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde</li>
            <li>I bought my last bottle towards the end of April early may.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use your bare hands to apply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dark at first , but then all the color washes off in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten several people tell me my tan looks natural after using this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many self tanners and was never happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li>ALso: my dog likes to lick my legs after this stuff is dried, and his saliva will lick the tan right off</li>
            <li>I really like the mousse consistency compared to other products I have used.</li>
            <li>Now that summer is approaching and there are random 75 degree days, I am so excited to finally be able to get away with a little tan.</li>
            <li>As mentioned I have used Fake Bake for years, it is easy to apply, lasts a long time, is inexpensive and has a great coconut smell, but the one thing I was not fond of with Fake Bake was the red/pink tone.</li>
            <li>in all, for a tanner with a natural color that&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts a few days, I think $16 is a little pricey.</li>
            <li>Also the dark color washes away after the first shower and the tan left</li>
            <li>, it leaves behind a light brown, natural color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you use surgical gloves you only need to apply sparingly &amp; spend a few minutes massaging it in circular motions until absorbed &amp; no</li>
            <li>although, I did be sure to wear dark clothing so not sure if that made a difference.</li>
            <li>I love the foam it is dark on my skin almost instantly and even appears to darken a little over the first few hours!  </li>
            <li>I tried applying with a mitt and also with my bare hand, and the result was the same.</li>
            <li>(we are all super pale!), and I even swam a LOT last summer!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I expected this to be a high-maintenance or short-livedtan due to the low price tag, but its lasting power is something special (however, if you have dry/problem skin, take extra care during maintenance).</li>
            <li>However, once you wash off the bronzer you are left with a regular DHA tan, that is to say somewhat orange, and despite DHA being listed as the second ingredient the tan is not particularly dark.</li>
            <li>the tan to dry completely before dressing.</li>
            <li>Tanwise Mousse darkened my skin by at least 3 shades with only 1 application (for reference, I went from L&#x27;Oreal True Match foundation in W3 Nude Beige to W6 Sun Beige.</li>
            <li>I did have a few issues with the way it looked around my hands, but that was total first time user error.</li>
            <li>Also, to help it dry faster, I cheated and quickly turned my blow dryer on low heat for a few seconds all over my body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but not good enough, and the mousse is harder for me to control than the Banana Boat lotion.</li>
            <li>Then put on loose, old clothes you don&#x27;t care about dirtying.</li>
            <li>I can use as little or as much as I want.</li>
            <li>This goes on very easily, and it dries quickly enough that you&#x27;re not standing around naked and afraid to touch anything, but not so quickly that it&#x27;s hard to spread evenly.</li>

            <li> great tanner.</li>
            <li> The spray was great but tended to leave stains on my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> I bought some gloves meant for hair coloring and they are great.</li>
            <li> After trying a couple and not being happy, I found this one.</li>
            <li> But it blends amazingly well and gives the perfect color that isn&#x27;t too orange.</li>

            <li> This product I think would be GREAT for people my skin tone and fairer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s a win in my book.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> I used it before my winter wedding and it came out great.</li>
            <li> The color guide is great though</li>
            <li> Just keep rubbing it in and it will look great.</li>
            <li> and it blended great both times.</li>
            <li> This gives a great tan when applied well.</li>
            <li> a very nice brown color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gave me a very nice color</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I paired this with the bronzing cream and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> Like many others, I ordered this product after reading about it on MaskCara&#x27;s blog &#x27;The Perfect Tan&#x27; (http://www.maskcara.com/2014/03/18/the-perfect-tan/).</li>
            <li> Divinely pleased with Tanwise and lookin Good!!  </li>
            <li> Best that ive tried yet and believe me I have tried many.</li>
            <li> Too many people expect to slather on a self tanning product and have it turn out perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and the color</li>
            <li> Im fair to med skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also try to get some good before and after photos.</li>
            <li> and I have fair fair skin</li>
            <li> and you are good to go</li>
            <li> It really is as good as shes says.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about the mousse</li>
            <li> I used it two or three times but could not get it to give me a good color.</li>
            <li> so I didnt look as pastey and fair.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and goes on evenly.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> I have used twice on my legs, great stuff, gives a nice tan, lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Plus it smells really good, like coconut.</li>
            <li> All mousses&#x27; (even spendy reputable brands) look &#x27;muddy&#x27; but give you beautiful even coverage.</li>
            <li> It has a color in the foam which is great for seeing what it will look like once it develop, which makes it so easy to use!</li>
            <li> While I would not call it perfect, and do not think it is totally deserving of 5 stars, I would definitely say it is the best self tanner I have used.</li>

            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> This tanner is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Follow the advice about application.&lt;br /&gt;Await spectacular color.  </li>
            <li> Used it years ago and liked it.</li>
            <li> The absolute Best Bronzy Brown Tan color Ever!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and burn more than tan.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this tanner, but you must buy an applicator glove to apply.</li>
            <li> fragrance is nice, coconut, then fades to nothing.</li>
            <li> The absolute best tanning solution I have ever used, and I have used a LOT of them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re already kind of tan</li>
            <li> I honestly believe some people don&#x27;t use it or apply it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you can read this whole thing, you can do some research and come out with a perfect.</li>
            <li> all the excess washed off leaving a nice glow of a tan.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product quite a bit.</li>
            <li> The color is a nice brown.</li>
            <li> Over all a great tanner with a beautiful, natural color!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this mousse in the mail because I had read great reviews.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and one coat of this product was enough to give me a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, and it rubbed in easy.</li>
            <li> It was the best self tanner I had found including trying high end products.</li>
            <li> Smells good and even though it smells good while applying it quickly fades to no odor at all.</li>
            <li> It Is a good product, easy to apply, light pleasant fragrance, inexpensive and lasts for days.</li>
            <li> mousse is very easy to apply - use a mitt to make it easier and dries quicker.  </li>
            <li> Tanwise was pretty easy to apply and it worked great!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever used..</li>
            <li> So far I am still experimenting with what works best for my skin type, but I think my process is going to be 2 consecutive days of tanning, then 2 off.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of sunless tanners and Tanwise Mousse is by FAR the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> and this one is by far the best in terms of color and staying power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice now and it was so easy to use!  </li>
            <li> Tanning mitts do not spread the product easily since it is a mousse.&lt;br /&gt;Again, use gloves!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanning products, this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Which by the way, it will rub off on your clothes and sheets, but very lightly.</li>
            <li> an nice even tone and goes on easy.  </li>
            <li> but it DOES make you realistic brown beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> I am a very fair, woman who doesn&#x27;t tan naturally.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> I tend to use more of the product if I want a darker tan.</li>
            <li> The more often I use the brozer</li>
            <li> it gets more than a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> the most like a pro spray tan I&#x27;ve ever seen&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do it lightly, and go over it with my handy damp/dry wash cloth to make sure those areas don&#x27;t get dark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a bit more on the times I have used it:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I would suggest maybe sleeping with the lotion on while laying on some towels, instead of doing what I did… I had to go around butt-naked in my house for 4 hours doing and touching nothing until I could shower off the tanner.</li>
            <li> So yeah, unless you feel like sitting around doing nothing for hours, try using it at night while you are sleeping! :)</li>
            <li> and there were marks where my tank top was.  </li>
            <li> It is a mouse which is not my favorite-</li>
            <li> and I have recommended it to many others and of the 3 that have tried it</li>
            <li> it will leave a mark!  :)</li>
            <li> I. Love.</li>
            <li> It is even better then salon tans.</li>
            <li> I used the applicator glove to apply and then rub everything in for a bit longer to make sure it is applied evenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works best if I apply it only once per day, after showering.</li>
            <li> I can skip an application or two and still have a nice light brown color.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It dries REALLY fast, which is great.</li>
            <li> I love this self-tanner.</li>
            <li> It seems that by Day 3 or 4 most of it has washed off if I&#x27;m not reapplying</li>
            <li> You will probably need more product than you expect.</li>
            <li> That is definitely an appropriate price for this product.</li>
            <li> Works much better with gloves.</li>
            <li> Its ok, would not buy again</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments and will be using it again soon to gear up for the summer.</li>
            <li> and I know that the more I use it the better</li>
            <li> Try to face gel and shimmer cream too :)</li>
            <li> a most self tanning</li>
            <li> I love this product and look forward to making it my summer staple.</li>
            <li> and you have an instant perfect tan that lasts for 2-3 days!</li>
            <li> It actually smells great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this</li>
            <li> im almost see through, i have tried many self tanning creams, lotions, mouse</li>
            <li> St. Topez tends to tun my skin yellowish but I continued to use because I could not find anything better.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m a pretty fair skinned gal, so I was worried about it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned, and this tanner gives me noticeable color without looking unnatural.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always impressed at how long those last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved this product the first two times I applied it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange and has a beautiful natural color.</li>
            <li> For the most even application it is best to apply this product after shaving and showering and moisturizing the rough areas (elbows, hands and feet) and make sure you apply with a tanning mitt.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a fair skinned redhead</li>
            <li> This went on easily and it was good to be able to see exactly where you were applying the product.</li>
            <li> You get best results when mixing it with lotion or else it goes on too dry.</li>
            <li> I love using this as a touch up when i spray tan, it makes it last longer and looks great over top :)</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is out of your face and if you are going to put the tanner on your face, make sure it is clean.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am a huge fan of the Tanwise lotion</li>
            <li> Great, natural looking color.</li>
            <li> This is the most important thing to me in a self tanner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most importantly I wanted it to be affordable.</li>
            <li> and so far i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Compared to others, I think this product lasts longer and goes on a lot more smoothly.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend it to anyone who is fair skinned.</li>
            <li> Tanwise is very easy to apply and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Price is ok but worth it if unavailable in your area!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful compared to other self tanners.</li>
            <li> It is easy to blend into the skin with a tan mitt and dries very quickly without streaking.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> so I can easily switch the mitt from hand to hand.</li>
            <li> but so far this really is the best self tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to apply and does not leave an orange tint.  </li>
            <li> the mousse is an easy to apply vehicle.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really easy to see where your applying.</li>
            <li> Easily applied and blends well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It dries very quick and is not streaky.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really easy to see where you missed</li>
            <li> The color blended easily and did not look streaky or orange.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply</li>
            <li> It DOES transfer on to bedding, however it easily washes out in the washing machine.</li>
            <li> I have spots of red on my arms and stretch marks from two kids and this product covered beautifully.</li>
            <li> So far I definitely like this kind the best.</li>
            <li> This is hands down, the BEST self tanner out there.</li>
            <li> when on fine had no streaks I am NOT orange</li>
            <li> {It looks fine once it&#x27;s worked in}.  </li>
            <li> and it turned out fine.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine if you are used to sunless tanning products.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than the lotion because of how quickly it dries.</li>
            <li> I invite any self-tanning novice to start with a mousse like this for excellent results, where you can work with the product for a little bit before it sets.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a huge deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it  lightly on my face.</li>
            <li> An important part about those orange prone areas: I go ahead and run the mitt over my ankles, elbows, tops of feet, and knees.</li>
            <li> I just make sure that I don&#x27;t do it with a fresh pump on the mitt.</li>
            <li> When you do shower, lightly scrub in circular motions all over your body.</li>
            <li> I used rubber gloves as well and then a cotton ball to coat the backs of my hands lightly.</li>
            <li> One thing I do like about this is it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> PLUS, it lasts for many uses and so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> A light exfoliation fixes that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The color will build over time, so its important to blend, blend, blend while you apply it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is light</li>
            <li> Actually, it worked great.</li>
            <li> that gives you great instant color while the product develops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light neutral</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> I suggest using a glove or something to smooth it on</li>
            <li> This is an overall great product, and I don&#x27;t think the price should frighten you; it really is a great product for a low price!</li>
            <li> its fantastic</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and it lasts really long.</li>
            <li> My skin is fair to medium naturally,</li>
            <li> I had no idea whatsoever that I could look this good, this tan so fast, even though I am fair I have a lot of yellow in my skin</li>
            <li> This is my favorite drugstore tanner, the price is right and it goes on even and brown</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I&#x27;m naturally a Red Head with very Fair skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t have a super strong smell when you are applying it</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked it though!</li>
            <li> But after showering all the bronzer rinses off and I&#x27;m left with a nice medium brown tan!</li>
            <li> A small price to pay for a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate well, and if you follow up with a lotion with a hint of bronzer it will even out any spots with too much product!</li>
            <li> This is totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> So worth the money!</li>
            <li> I apply the Tanwise Mousse with a clean tanning mitt and a disposable glove underneath.</li>
            <li> I was truly shocked to find this tanner is easy to apply, smells great and gives a great believable color.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, the smell is quite pleasant, Rum Coconutty, whereas Saint Tropez&#x27;s stank.</li>
            <li> This is true for any self tanning product that gives you any amount of significant color.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> So far I love this sunless tanner!</li>
            <li> , I dont use any special moisturizer on them that I dont put on my knees and elbows, so</li>
            <li> The color that develops is amazing and natural.</li>
            <li> Left a good color.</li>
            <li> I hope you all love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I bought the same shade that I get in the lotion- fair to medium -</li>
            <li> Also a really good thing is use gloves when applying then do your hands last.</li>
            <li> This product is superlative for imparting a nice, natural brown color to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on brown/black and does have a sort of ash-green look to it</li>
            <li> Such a good value for the $$$$</li>
            <li> Plus it does NOT smell like DHA at all, and I love the mousse formula because it spreads on very evenly.</li>
            <li> I buy mine at my local Sally&#x27;s store, but thought I&#x27;d give a good review on here.</li>
            <li> I did my research on the product and it had really good reviews overall</li>
            <li> I waited the full 15 minutes to get dressed and have not had any transfer issues.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve been using it with my hands and making sure to wash them really well.</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;ve been loving this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do have to be sure to massage the mousse in thoroughly so that you don&#x27;t see streaks, and resist the urge to spread the product out too much to make the streaks go away.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to see exactly how it&#x27;s coming out as you apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It dries quickly (although it will transfer until you shower)&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> Use a mit or gloves when applying because the product dries quickly.</li>
            <li> What you see is (luckily) what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> luckily, I decided to give it another shot, and applied it at night before bed</li>
            <li> When I showered the next day and the bronzer came off, a PERFECT tan was left in its place.</li>
            <li> I did get some on my clothes when I dressed to quickly.</li>
            <li> Great immediate color (although super dark), and no splotches, no bad smell.</li>
            <li> mousse dries quickly but not too quickly.</li>
            <li> As the days went on, it faded rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This gives a great glow but to be real here, you need someone you don&#x27;t mind to see you naked to help you apply it.</li>
            <li> but it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone is slightly above fair, and sensitive but this color looks natural and great on me; like a real life from the sun tan!  </li>
            <li> it does have a greenish tint when very first applied but goes away with in a min</li>
            <li> I was left with a beautiful natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> mousse formula is easy to apply and gives you a nice marriage of blendability and quick dry time.</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t super duper dark but 2 coats and its amazing, so i would say its build able.</li>
            <li> Almost a week after my first application, I&#x27;ve still got some color!</li>
            <li> Smells great, best color I&#x27;ve seen, has an instant color and also gets darker over time, a little goes a long way, stays on longer than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and then it will look blotchy-- if I shower first, this doesn&#x27;t happen!</li>
            <li> so it looks more natural!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no weird smell and looks like a real tan!  </li>
            <li> This stuff gave me an amazing tan but wasn&#x27;t worth it 2 days later when this stuff came off in patches.</li>
            <li> The color is amazingly brown with no yellow tones.</li>
            <li> tanner has the most natural color of any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The tanner looked like it was rubbing off, but I woke up, showered, and was left with a nice glow afterward.</li>
            <li> It is the most natural looking (after showering, of course)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff looks so natural</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most natural looking self tanner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> You might get a work out, but it is so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Allow</li>
            <li> and I did not have any streaking problems (although I used a mitt and spent a fair amount of time smoothing it out).</li>
            <li> My favorite bronzer so far.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a much more natural color to it as well.</li>
            <li> I love fake tanner and this is the absolute best!</li>
            <li> I did miss some spots, but was able to even it out with a second application the next day and it looks really really good.</li>
            <li> I have used Jergen&#x27;s (both the 3 day and 7 day lotion, and face lotion which is all decent but doesn&#x27;t get very dark, plus takes a while to set), and L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze (both the glittery stuff in the tube and the towlettes which are OK with some good practice but prone to be orange and streaky).</li>
            <li> I can think of several self tanners I&#x27;ve tried where the product itself was wonderful, but there was no good way to apply it because the packaging designers botched the nozzle/cap (think Toma&#x27;s Airbrush tanning spray- lovely color, spitty nozzle).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and every other self tanner I&#x27;ve tried looked orangey or streaky.  </li>
            <li> When I first washed off the color guard after developing this tan overnight, I could tell immediately that I liked the bronze color: very natural, nice and dark.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for body builder bronze, you&#x27;ve found the right product.</li>
            <li> but it washed right out.</li>
            <li> Tanwise dark bronzing sunless mousse provides a nice smooth color that is just the right shade.</li>
            <li> It took more effort on my part to blend it, compared to the St. Tropez, but I am very pleased with the dark color, the subtle (pleasant) smell, and the evenness.  </li>
            <li> The mousse dried almost instantly, the smell is awesome, the color is awesome and lasts longer than several of the other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> the bronzer is a really pretty golden brown color.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; developed into a dark, beautiful golden brown within hours.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s left is a nice, natural lightly tanned look.  </li>
            <li> i got stuck on Fake Bake, really good stuff gave a great natural tan until i saw this on YouTube....</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t smell too bad at all, i apply it in the morning shower at night and within two days i have a great color used once a week keeps me looking healthy if i use it more often (during summer)</li>
            <li> I am a red head with fair skin that does tan in the sun, so this tan looks natural!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found that it lasts as long as some of the other reviews might suggest, but if you keep it up it looks great!</li>
            <li> When I first started to apply it I was nervous about the bronzer, which right out of the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be awesome not to have to reapply every single day, or even every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It appears very dark but the color goes on very easily, does not turn orange and blends easily.  </li>
            <li> Goes on quickly and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I immediately searched for this online (because I am too lazy to search for it in-store, lol), and tried it out the first day I received it.</li>
            <li> You need to go easy near ankles &amp; not get too close to soles of feet.  </li>
            <li> I recommend putting some kind of moisturizer on before you apply this tanner because it dries really fast--almost not giving you enough time to rub it in.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how easy this was to apply.  </li>
            <li> I have ivory skin and it looks natural and easy to make even.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the light scent and chemicals</li>
            <li> I go over ankles, knees, toes and fingers very lightly and only once, blending as I</li>
            <li> I think this is a really close contender!</li>
            <li> can see exactly where the color is going as you apply, which makes it easier to not miss spots</li>
            <li> I was also able to get the tanner out of my sheets after a simple wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time I tried the product I didn&#x27;t have the mitt</li>
            <li> and I was first applying it</li>
            <li> have tried many different tanning lotions, before Tanwise, and after Tanwise.</li>
            <li> It has replaced my high-end tanner (the Fake Bake Flawless Liquid).</li>
            <li> first time I put this product on, I washed it off immediately-</li>
            <li> and so glad I gave it a second chance!!</li>
            <li> This is also the first time I have tried the mousse over just the lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First hand experience here, however, I just blended it with my hand where the rain had streaked it, washed my hands and it looked</li>
            <li> I am pasty white, and yet, this spring I have gotten more compliments than ever about how tan I look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty forgiving too.</li>
            <li> This was not expensive.</li>
            <li> It went pretty well, so I did it all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was at first reluctant to try this product because of the review below.</li>
            <li> When you first pump the mousse out into your hand, the color will horrify you.</li>
            <li> Great color, and the bottle lasts me at least two months.</li>
            <li> And the scent of this mousse is not nearly as bad as some other brands, even including more high-end ones.</li>
            <li> Let yourself dry for more than 20 minutes if you plan on getting dressed right after.</li>
            <li> and I slept in very light jammie pants and a long sleeve and there was no transfer.</li>
            <li> He told me he used this product, and I honestly didn&#x27;t believe it, because I assumed all self tanners left orange-tints, but his skin looked so naturally</li>
            <li> I read online that this Tanwise was a duplicate of the Sun Labs tanner that I have always loved, but being that I cannot get Sun Labs locally, I ran to my local Sallys to pickup some Tanwise.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the most natural color and goes on without ANY streaks.</li>
            <li> I find that this application is fading a bit more unevenly (but really not terrible at all, and I think it still looks natural), probably because it was darker in the first</li>
            <li> The tanner absorbs very quickly so I apply lotion over the entire area first.</li>
            <li> Works very well, first time user.</li>
            <li> The tanner gives a great natural color and because it does look so natural, I don&#x27;t have to be so careful about knees, elbows, fingers/toes, etc.</li>
            <li> Nice color but very streaky and fades extremely patchy.</li>
            <li> This resulted in a pretty dark color for my skin (I am really fair), kind of like a July or August tan like I had been outside all summer long.</li>
            <li> I really liked how the Tanwise Dark Bronzing Sunless tanner went on because you could see where you were putting it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for a subtle tan or you can apply another coat the next day for a deeper tan.</li>
            <li> Beautiful instant color with little to no streaking.</li>
            <li> But my back is not bad!</li>
            <li> It looks super natural, and I received a LOT of compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the smell that most self tanners do and once dry</li>
            <li> The guide color does kind of make you look green at first</li>
            <li> I fine the lotion looks a little more orange than the mousse, even though the lotion looks very natural as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> When using my hands, I wash with soap thoroughly after applying it to any one certain area so that my palms don&#x27;t look tan.</li>
            <li> but I have mastered that at this point, It is prob more costly then FB and on me does not last quite as long, I do however like the light fragrance, BUT,</li>
            <li> But using a moisturizer first allowed me enough time to rub it in really well and get a smooth tan.</li>
            <li> I do sweats and a loose tank top.</li>
            <li> The color looked very good, not orange or fake.</li>
            <li> A Huge Merci to all the sisters that left encouraging reviews.</li>
            <li> but in spring/summer I want a glow or light tan especially on my legs.</li>
            <li> The tanner will go straight through the mitt</li>
            <li> really evenly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well...</li>
            <li> white or light colored until you wash the bronzer off</li>
            <li> it begins to wear off, it&#x27;s worth the time to exfoliate the remainder completely off, and then start over.</li>
            <li> Yes, I care about this, because it really matters.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> I feel like you have to work really fast</li>
            <li> really really well before use (as with any self tanner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> And the foam is great for applying a thin layer with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to rub it in like a lotion as it dries much</li>
            <li> I buy mine from Sally&#x27;s for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have washed after 4 hrs but it give me much of color.</li>
            <li> It is much Eisner then having to scrub your hands after.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to reapply after about a week.</li>
            <li> I applied the product to my whole body, including my face.</li>
            <li> This will save me so much money compared to the aerosol</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not even close to a real tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a glove to apply this and my hands, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make too much of a difference in the look.  </li>
            <li> I really like this- not streaky or blotchy whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable in quality to my St. Tropez Bronzing Mousse, but at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I use and would recommend The Ultimate Tanning Applicator Mitt by Thermalabs (also available on Amazon).</li>
            <li> but it is a whole lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re still reading this, you must really want to try it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and nobody wants a tan there.</li>
            <li> I rub it all over, then give an extra pat to my cheeks, nose, chin, and top of forehead to create a natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different self-tanners and this is by far one of my lease favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that after application I got fabulously dark - but that was primarily because of the bronzer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What is true about the comments: It will look super dark when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time finding a self tanner that works well with my fair skin and doesn&#x27;t turn out orange and blotchy!</li>
            <li> And I just bought a new bottle the first week of June.</li>
            <li> Far right photo is after a shower.</li>
            <li> But that washes right off and has a natural tone.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for other customers I do plan on buying some more ..great products</li>
            <li> and I think the bottle is going to go a really long way, which is nice since the price on this stuff has really increased since I was looking at it last summer!</li>
            <li> Perfect substitute for expensive spray tanning!</li>
            <li> It does work better than any other I have tried...</li>
            <li> It does not rub off when first applied and drys fast ( about 5-10 mins ) and that&#x27;s full dry time, meaning no stickiness.</li>
            <li> Long story short : Tanwise will give you a nice, non orange tan, but you should go for the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other self tanners for years, mainly sticking with Banana Boat spray.</li>
            <li> The bronzer can be hard to work into your skin and look kind of streaky initially, keep working it into your skin until it is smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go out at night to a dark bar like this, but if you splash any water on yourself, the bronzer will come off and it will look bizarre!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about how dark it was, but just rub it in and make sure it&#x27;s even</li>
            <li> it does get quite dark, which I personally love.</li>
            <li> Tanwise is probably more like Ultra Dark instead which is a step down(lighter).  </li>
            <li> I have a medium complexion with dark hair, so the darker tans just look better on me.  </li>
            <li> I thought my back for sure was going to be splotchy since I saw several mistakes in the mirror and went over them again, which just caused me to overlap some places I had already gone, and the guide color was very splotchy, but I gave up.</li>
            <li> I made sure to apply moisturizer on my knees, elbows, and ankles to keep these areas from getting dark with the tanning product.</li>
            <li> I use at night, and when I shower in the morning, most of the self-tanner scent goes down the drain</li>
            <li> I use this primarily on my chest and arms 3-4 times per week and the bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and evenly, allow it to dry before dressing, there will be some residue on your clothes until you shower 4-6 hours later, so don&#x27;t wear your favorite white dress!</li>
            <li> I like this so much better than I do the Sun Labs product I had previously thought</li>
            <li> Get it nice and thick and rub it in really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Also, I do highly recommend you using an application glove or mitt because it will stain your hands when applying.</li>
            <li> It looks more natural than other tanners I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> It looks totally natural!!</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry quickly though so you have to apply and then rub it in fast.</li>
            <li> No orangy color, not too dark, no unpleasant smell, color right away...</li>
            <li> It is honestly pretty hard to screw up the application with this stuff, just make sure you blend well and check for any streaks after you put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 3 more for summer and don&#x27;t know i&#x27;ll last that long.</li>
            <li> it looks great, but I don&#x27;t have the patience to lie still on the beach long enough to blush much less tan...</li>
            <li> It does rub off a tiny bit on my sheets, but it washes right out.</li>
            <li> Yes, I had to buy a new foundation to match my tan because I got that</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I use self tanner often and am always on the look out for a new product.</li>
            <li> but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> Hope this review helps someone who is new to tanning like me.</li>
            <li> but it is very easily disturbed if you brush against something too hard.</li>
            <li> Not quite as easy to apply and a spray, but so worth the extra trouble of a mousse.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that is has a not so good smell to it, but then again,</li>
            <li> looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Required another person to apply the places I couldn&#x27;t reach but it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> It is a very natural looking color</li>
            <li> This product went on evenly and looked very natural.  </li>
            <li> I find that most lotion formulas give you plenty of time to blend, but they take too long to dry-</li>
            <li> I am brown not too dark ..dryed very well and quickly</li>
            <li> Otherwise if you are just looking for a slight tint of color then this would work fine</li>
            <li> This consistency actually helped me rub it in my skin evenly allowing me to see where exactly I was applying it.</li>
            <li> This is going to replace my Jergans Natural Glow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used by far!</li>
            <li> I paid it because it&#x27;s a step up from the cheapest stuff at the drug store, and had reviews similar to some high end brands but for MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li> The product comes out a scary dark olive color but quickly dries to a beautiful chocolate color, so you&#x27;d think you&#x27;d be getting super dark.</li>
            <li> It does come out VERY dark, so the color guide makes it easy to apply but just know that is not the color you are going to be, the color guide comes off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use one full pump per section and start with my calves, doing one leg at a time, then working up to my thighs, stomach, chest, lower back, shoulders, upper arms, then lower arms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pale and did not suffer many issues with orange spots.</li>
            <li> So next time I will rinse off before I get into a bed with super white sheets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; When I stick my face right down into my skin, I actually can&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li> You will see if you get it on your white towels, it&#x27;s made up of reds, browns, blacks, so it really looks like you have been in the sun, even giving you a pinky sort of tan (though maybe I think that is the most natural for me because I am usually have my tan with a sunburn...</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t very dark, and did make me look more orange- especially after re-applying.</li>
            <li> I have never had a professional spray tan or gotten a Mystic tan or anything, but judging by how I&#x27;ve seen those turn out on my friends</li>
            <li> Wear old clothes, use old towels, etc.</li>
            <li> But what tanning product, even a natural tan, isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> It also happened on my chest after 2 consecutive nights of application but once again only I can really see it.</li>
            <li> It pretty much washed all the way off because I didn&#x27;t let the DHA sit long enough on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tan came out completely even and now I realize it was just the bronzer rubbing off.</li>
            <li> I first heard of this stuff from my hairdresser, when I asked him how the heck he didn&#x27;t look pasty-white all winter long.</li>
            <li> That being said, I have not had any problems with the bronzer staining my clothes; it has come off completely after washing the clothes.  </li>
            <li> But you will still retain a natural tan underneath.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product for the price!</li>
            <li> The color comes off natural and isn&#x27;t orange.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to order it from Amazon instead of going to Sally because there isnt one near me.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a tan that looks natural on me.  </li>
            <li> Tanwise was better in that a small amount really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised by how tan I was after just one session.</li>
            <li> so people will think that I am a professional sun bather.</li>
            <li> it comes to self tanners, you MUST do the work in order to obtain a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> It never blended naturally</li>
            <li> So far I like the color-</li>
            <li> He thinks the tanwise color looks natural on me.</li>
            <li> far as the smell... there is one.</li>
            <li> for how long the tan lasts, I&#x27;m still on my first application</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t see how much I have left in the bottle</li>
            <li> The tan looks natural, I use plenty of lotion around ankle &amp; knees to avoid orange bruise look.</li>
            <li> Natural color.</li>
            <li> I have a light/medium natural skin color, but am concerned with tanning at this point.</li>
            <li> It looks 100% natural.</li>
            <li> Gives a natural color and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> It once again turned out super dark</li>
            <li> skinned- not the very fairest in most foundations, but usually the second or third from the fairest in a neutral shade.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend using a glove and/or mitt with this as it does dry quickly and can stain hands (although there are ways to get that off)</li>
            <li> Seems Theres no mess up.</li>
            <li> I do this so the tan is still dark enough, but the shower will rinse off anything that could potentially get on your clothes, especially if it&#x27;s a hot day</li>
            <li> I used a fine sized amount on the edge of my tanning mitt and worked it into my face starting with my forehead and cheeks and blending down my neck.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that wouldn&#x27;t make me orange, wouldn&#x27;t streak, wouldn&#x27;t smell, and would last a decent amount of time (5-7 days would be optimal).</li>
            <li> put this on at about 2pm for my first application, and left it on until 10am the next morning when I showered, exfoliated again and reapplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put on two layers right after each other, watch some TV standing up while it dries, then sleep, and shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this sunless tanning mousse, since it was recommended on maskcara&#x27;s blog recently.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for a good fake and bake!</li>
            <li> With the mitt and all it made such a huge mess</li>
            <li> On my skin, the color lasts for about 5 or 6 days total before my legs revert to their normal untanned color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love the instant color, the evenness (it was a big surprise since like I said I was worried when I saw a few lines it had made overnight)</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s lasting pretty long!</li>
            <li> It is very dark while it is developing, but after you wash the top layer off it gives you a very nice base tan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even put a new pump on the mitt, I just use what is left over in the mitt.</li>
            <li> you only need to apply enough to absorb.. too much &amp; it can be a bit sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m medium/fair skin with blonde hair and this gave me a very natural tan, no orange at all.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for beginners - if you&#x27;re using it as your first lotion, read directions carefully, or have someone help you!</li>
            <li> For a more subtle color/glow, try a gradual, buildable lotion (such as Jergens) or just a washable body bronzer.</li>
            <li> If you rub too hard you&#x27;ll have a product free spot with which you need to reapply.  </li>
            <li> so I applied it to my legs with my bare hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde</li>
            <li> I bought my last bottle towards the end of April early may.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use your bare hands to apply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark at first , but then all the color washes off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several people tell me my tan looks natural after using this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many self tanners and was never happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> ALso: my dog likes to lick my legs after this stuff is dried, and his saliva will lick the tan right off</li>
            <li> I really like the mousse consistency compared to other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Now that summer is approaching and there are random 75 degree days, I am so excited to finally be able to get away with a little tan.</li>
            <li> As mentioned I have used Fake Bake for years, it is easy to apply, lasts a long time, is inexpensive and has a great coconut smell, but the one thing I was not fond of with Fake Bake was the red/pink tone.</li>
            <li> in all, for a tanner with a natural color that&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts a few days, I think $16 is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Also the dark color washes away after the first shower and the tan left</li>
            <li> , it leaves behind a light brown, natural color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you use surgical gloves you only need to apply sparingly &amp; spend a few minutes massaging it in circular motions until absorbed &amp; no</li>
            <li> although, I did be sure to wear dark clothing so not sure if that made a difference.</li>
            <li> I love the foam it is dark on my skin almost instantly and even appears to darken a little over the first few hours!  </li>
            <li> I tried applying with a mitt and also with my bare hand, and the result was the same.</li>
            <li> (we are all super pale!), and I even swam a LOT last summer!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I expected this to be a high-maintenance or short-livedtan due to the low price tag, but its lasting power is something special (however, if you have dry/problem skin, take extra care during maintenance).</li>
            <li> However, once you wash off the bronzer you are left with a regular DHA tan, that is to say somewhat orange, and despite DHA being listed as the second ingredient the tan is not particularly dark.</li>
            <li> the tan to dry completely before dressing.</li>
            <li> Tanwise Mousse darkened my skin by at least 3 shades with only 1 application (for reference, I went from L&#x27;Oreal True Match foundation in W3 Nude Beige to W6 Sun Beige.</li>
            <li> I did have a few issues with the way it looked around my hands, but that was total first time user error.</li>
            <li> Also, to help it dry faster, I cheated and quickly turned my blow dryer on low heat for a few seconds all over my body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but not good enough, and the mousse is harder for me to control than the Banana Boat lotion.</li>
            <li> Then put on loose, old clothes you don&#x27;t care about dirtying.</li>
            <li> I can use as little or as much as I want.</li>
            <li> This goes on very easily, and it dries quickly enough that you&#x27;re not standing around naked and afraid to touch anything, but not so quickly that it&#x27;s hard to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> At first when you apply it&#x27;s very dark, but I waited four hours, showered and pat dry.</li>
            <li> I do HIGHLY recommend waiting 20-30 minutes before dressing, because I was impatient and only waited about 12</li>
            <li> I could still smell a slight scent the first day after I showered but other than that</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it does not last very long (about 2 days on legs with daily workouts, showers/shaving).</li>
            <li> Saint Tropez Dark Tanning Mousse and this Tanwise product is half the price and does exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> It is no where near dark enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Since I am so fair the dark bronzer makes me look a bit dirty.</li>
            <li> It dries down quickly,  be careful to not use too much or</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until SEVERAL HOURS later that I felt 100% completely dry.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those with pale skin.</li>
            <li> lot of this is going to be personal preference, but just as an FYI for anyone that may have a similar complexion as me that needs the darker, longer lasting color, spend the extra $$ and get Dark Sunsation instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like lotion where you can really smear it around, it&#x27;s definitely a gel mousse, which is hard to describe if you&#x27;ve never used it.</li>
            <li> Totally even, non-streaky coverage, and very forgiving on the places that are notoriously hard to get like feet and elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is easy to apply (I use the Fake Bake</li>
            <li> One thing I like about Tanwise is that it doesn&#x27;t dry immediately so there is some room for error, but you still need to work relatively quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for liquids and sprays, those soak in and dry almost instantly, but that limits blending time and can lead to streaking.</li>
            <li> I applied one coat, let it dry, and then applied a second coat.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural with slight reddish undertones and no streaks.</li>
            <li> so I am always searching for a new tanning product to not make me look like a carrot or streaky just plain orange.  </li>
            <li> It was a little intimidating at first because it comes out very, very dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only self-tanner that gets me dark enough.</li>
            <li> With that said I am a long user of tanwise.</li>
            <li> But since it was a weekend and I could cover it up with long pants.</li>
            <li> But the scent from having it all over my body wafts up to my nose all day long just doing day-to-day activities.</li>
            <li> I still have a full container left of the Fake Bake to finish, but I don&#x27;t even want to use it anymore because the Tanwise Mousse is just so,</li>
            <li> , it turned my pale skin into not so pale skin, but after several applications, it didn&#x27;t seem to get much darker.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There wasn&#x27;t that weird, typical cat pee smell that most self-tanners give off.  </li>
            <li> Let the tan dry for as long as you can before dressing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other tanners as well.  </li>
            <li> I used an applicator mitt as to not stain my hands, and I applied 4 pumps per leg, 2 pumps per arm, and 1 pump per every other area (chest, back, butt, stomach).  </li>
            <li> Favorite fake tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I recommend using a glove to avoid hands staining but that is the only con that is always to be expected when using a self tanner!</li>
            <li> Only con is hard to remove from hands, I have to use lemon soap to remove completely.</li>
            <li> I also have gloves, my mitt, a washcloth with a damp part and dry part available.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> so I let it dry for about an hour before dressing.</li>
            <li> Waited for it to dry before dressing and</li>
            <li> I tried this on my showered, totally dry, shaven leg and it looked like I had rubbed mud on myself.</li>
            <li> After it is dry, it will leave burgandy color on your pillow case if you have a night sweat.</li>
            <li> And even then, I got into bed around 10 and woke up the next morning with the slightest trace of it on my stark white sheets.</li>
            <li> I get darker with Banana Boat Deep Dark sunless tanner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have VERY light skin and this color is not overwhelming or fake looking.</li>
            <li> However, On me the color had a slight red tone which I was never fond of.</li>
            <li> It may be slightly streaky in spots when putting it on, but after showering off the instant bronzer, the streaks disappear&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I still have about half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead so very pale.</li>
            <li> At first I was shocked when the \\&quot;mouse\\&quot; came out watery and super dark, almost black.</li>
            <li> I have to be ridiculously tan to compete in ballroom competitions, and I had high hopes for this product after reading the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> And on me, it didn&#x27;t last very long unless you did it everyday.</li>
            <li> Dried off and applied lotion to dry areas such as ankles, knees, and elbows.</li>
            <li> It did get on my socks just a little bit when I did not wait long enough to put them on the other night</li>
            <li> It seems to fade naturally, as opposed to flaking off like other sunless tanners I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Just wish it would last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I put a little blend on around my soles of feet and a tiny bit on finger on knuckles between toes and fingers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never applied self tanner before you should only do a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-This means it&#x27;s not really an apply and go product.</li>
            <li> I then remove my gloves and carefully blot the tanner on the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li> I dont know why, but only my hands ever turn green, nothing else</li>
            <li> But be careful, because that will wash off.</li>
            <li> I have to apply every 2 days or so to keep my tan, whereas with something like Dark Sunsation I could go twice as long before having to reapply</li>
            <li> and I had absolutely no streaks or spots.</li>
            <li> color looks weird going on,  but it&#x27;s a useful color &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> After having it on a few hours I put some scented lotionon my forearms and noticed that I could actually smell the lotion and not the DHA smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Florida girl who recently moved to Boston and I cannot stand how pale I am all the time.</li>
            <li> I used it for three days in a row with middle of winter pale skin before going to the beach in February</li>
            <li> applied this product around 3 pm, let it dry for about a half an hour afterwards, then got dressed but still felt a little tacky around my neck, back of my knees, etc.</li>
            <li> As with other tanning mousse&#x27;s it is very dark brown and goes on several shades darker than what the tan results will be after showering.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The smell doesn&#x27;t linger on you for days like some other tanners I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed this happening on my legs a bit (but I have also had this with other tanners).</li>
            <li> I bought this Tanwise Mousse due to a beauty blogger recommendation (Cara Brook of Maskcara), and ever since I first tried it, I&#x27;ve been obsessed.</li>
            <li> It also had a strange green tint to it.</li>
            <li> like I do with other brands.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than other Sun Labs products</li>
            <li> Plus, then I can get off all the excess from my elbows and knees and other creases</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reading other reviews that say that should come out though.</li>
            <li> So after I bought it, I did a small spot on my upper thigh to see how it would work.</li>
            <li> Apply small generous amounts to a section of your skin, start in the middle and work your way out using CIRCULAR MOTIONS.This</li>
            <li> but when I took a shower, all the lines I thought I would have were washed away and left an almost unbelievably even tan, but the color did fade.</li>
            <li> I usually use Jergens and even that left me streaky sometimes, but not this.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s an unbeatable price compared to other self tanners that are this dark.</li>
            <li> , also a little on rough knee areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It produces an even, dark color.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t go on as dark as I had hoped either</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t that dark.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s dark</li>
            <li> I swear I could glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about going out with my skin looking so dark.</li>
            <li> I am used to Dark Sunsation by Sun Labs</li>
            <li> So if you are like me and need a darker tan, stick with Dark Sunsation.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff for fake tanning.  </li>
            <li> I tried to apply it twice a day, hoping to hurry the process along, it seemed to look too dark and splotchy in areas on my face and feet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it IS DARK</li>
            <li> Yes the charcoal color is dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s this dark greenish blackish brown, and it will leave you looking like a swamp creature.</li>
            <li> The product is probably better when applying it over a base tan.</li>
            <li> The product is a foam,  so no strong aerosols &amp; a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> The color is not super dark</li>
            <li> Other reviewers washed this off before giving it a chance and let me say, you&#x27;re missing out.</li>
            <li> I think this makes it come out less</li>
            <li> I previously purchased</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent to the mousse</li>
            <li> but I dress in a black sundress after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s not true about the comments: it leaves you streaky.</li>
            <li> It does make a bit of a mess when applying</li>
            <li> This product gives you a build-able tan, although it says &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; on the bottle I think it takes a few applications to get a dark tan.</li>
            <li> In the morning I look a little scary before I take a shower - the tan has developed and the bronzer hasn&#x27;t been washed off, making me a bit dark.</li>
            <li> So many people complimented me on my tan, and they were shocked when I told them it&#x27;s from a bottle!</li>
            <li> When I got up in the morning I did look a little orange and was a little worried.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find one that doesn&#x27;t have some sort of odor after a little while, but it is not offensive like some of them are.</li>
            <li> and I still got a little product on the inside of my blouse.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a super dark tan immediately, you will be disappointed after you shower the bronzer off.</li>
            <li> or else your hand may be very dark after.</li>
            <li> Ive tried everything at my age and those made me kinda orange and uneven.</li>
            <li> , it gets me tan and doesnt turn my hands green.</li>
            <li> OK,Tanwise Compared to FB: It took a few applications to get the feel of how to use the mousse with a mitt</li>
            <li> I put on a few layers and followed the instructions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked in a few tanning salons.</li>
            <li> A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li> I can usually get that with 1-2 applications of Dark Sunsation.  </li>
            <li> With Tanwise, I would have to apply 3-4 applications which is a waste of product and time.  </li>
            <li> but the green goes away immediately on me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also dried within 15 minutes</li>
            <li> Yes it does have that self-tanner smell after a few hours.</li>
            <li> (I think it&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> I stand in front of a fan for a few minutes longer than suggested.  </li>
            <li> It dried for me in 20 minutes</li>
            <li> My hands were literally black!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m talking like see my veines pale.</li>
            <li> It looks like a natural tan it doesn&#x27;t look excessive or fake.</li>
            <li> I had been using St. Tropez and LoReal Sublime spray before and thought I would try Tanwise since St. Tropez is too expensive and LoReal isn&#x27;t dark enough</li>
            <li> I would buy the mit though, or wash your hands between leg/arm/body applications, as my hand turned SO DARK, and was really hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this is made for Fake Bake products</li>
            <li> the initial bronzer that comes out of the bottle is sooo dark; it almost makes you look dirty.</li>
            <li> It will stain your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Use small circular motions to get the tanner to absorb.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this tanner before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I have found the key to making it not look fake is to put it on before going to bed and when I wake up I shower, letting a small amount wash off.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount and worked it into where the line was from wearing gloves</li>
            <li> I have tried several self tanners anywhere from expensive to drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> Im pale, too, so it&#x27;s not that hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m naturally pale, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get it to blend on my skin.</li>
            <li> Let me just start out by saying I am very, very pale.</li>
            <li> I was appalled at the first squirt out of the bottle--darkest brown.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a single thing wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> My husband did notice a slight tanning solution odor several hours after I put it on but said it wasn&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> The solution is hard to get off your hands otherwise.  </li>
            <li> For me, at least.</li>
            <li> but I wait til at least 6 hours after applying the Tanwise mousse.</li>
            <li> I self-tan from May through Sept and have for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still not sure, just give it a try!</li>
            <li> But after having used the product I will say that I see what people mean by calling it &amp;#34;not bad.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> my husband is pretty picky about fake tans and calls girls orange who I would say aren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> use very small amounts of product and apply it in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> If you just want a subtle glow, I would not recommend this product-</li>
            <li> When it comes out of the container it is almost black, which is scary if you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
            <li> Looked ridiculous on my elbows, hands, and feet.</li>
            <li> After one application, I saw a subtle tan that even my husband noticed.</li>
            <li> This may be a big deal to somepeople, but I don&#x27;t think it is that bad if you are prepared for it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell horrible either, which is a rare find.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, very streaky!</li>
            <li> This product is a bit tough to get off your palms</li>
            <li> I have not have terrible issues with the bronzer coming off, but it definitely will get on your clothes a little bit.</li>
            <li> It was blotchy and uneven, and just looked like I was dirty.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before saying it isn&#x27;t too bad compared to other ones and that didn&#x27;t make sense to me.. that DHA smell is either there or it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the ugly way that it comes off.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst tanning product at have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> The Fake Bake Mitt recommends using the buffing side about 20 minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase Fake Bake.</li>
            <li> I have used Fake Bake for years.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the lotion - it just takes me awhile to apply.</li>
            <li> Too expensive not to have results.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight odor comparable to tanning bed lotions, which wasn&#x27;t awful for someone like me who use to tan often.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t which was slightly disappointing</li>
            <li> Recommend to always apply Vaseline on the knees and elbows before and after application to keep them from looking dirty.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t, and it was difficult to get off my palms!</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with her recommendations!</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of expensive sunless tanners and this tops them all!</li>
            <li> But this is so bad, I just had to let prospective buyers know.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad whatsoever, if rubbed in well (as with all tanners)</li>
            <li> For the person that said they got streaky and looked really bad.</li>
            <li> I have a word of advice for the people who are giving bad reviews because of it being &amp;#34;splotchy,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;uneven,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;orange,&amp;#34; etc.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any bad smell.</li>
            <li> I turned from a pasty-white sickly looking person, into a beach goddess in a matter of hours.</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you prep well before applying you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does smell bad after applying it though!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t streaky and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all!  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t apply it correctly, it WILL look terrible.</li>

            <li> Best. Sunless. Tanner. Ever! I read about this tanner on a blog, and I decided to give it a whirl before a friend&#x27;s wedding. I am SO glad I did. This goes on very easily, and it dries quickly enough that you&#x27;re not standing around naked and afraid to touch anything, but not so quickly that it&#x27;s hard to spread evenly. I did two applications pre-wedding, and I looked like a bronzed beach babe. It looks super natural, and I received a LOT of compliments on my tan. Almost a week after my first application, I&#x27;ve still got some color! It seems to fade naturally, as opposed to flaking off like other sunless tanners I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I even used this on my face without any problems. I&#x27;m sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution - remember to buy gloves to wear when applying this. I didn&#x27;t, and it was difficult to get off my palms!</li>
            <li> when on fine had no streaks I am NOT orange I am brown not too dark ..dryed very well and quickly .. I would recommend this for other customers I do plan on buying some more ..great products</li>
            <li> This is a great sunless product. Read the other reviews. Follow the advice about application.&lt;br /&gt;Await spectacular color.  I would purchase this again !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have fair skin and the color looks very natural. It is easy to blend into the skin with a tan mitt and dries very quickly without streaking. It is honestly pretty hard to screw up the application with this stuff, just make sure you blend well and check for any streaks after you put it on. The color is not super dark but it is build-able, I tend to use more of the product if I want a darker tan. Just wish it would last a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I am 57 and stopped tanning beds years ago. Im fair to med skin but in spring/summer I want a glow or light tan especially on my legs. Ive tried everything at my age and those made me kinda orange and uneven. This is the most amazing product I have ever used..I put a little blend on around my soles of feet and a tiny bit on finger on knuckles between toes and fingers., also a little on rough knee areas. Beautiful. LOVE IT!!! I&#x27;ve used it  lightly on my face. Seems Theres no mess up. I&#x27;ve ordered 3 more for summer and don&#x27;t know i&#x27;ll last that long. I don&#x27;t wear gloves, put it on in circular motion and wash hands immediately. I can use as little or as much as I want. The more often I use the brozer I get--- it gets more than a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. Love this stuff !!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome, natural-looking, even color.  Easy to apply.  I would recommend using a mitt to keep the color off your hands.</li>
            <li> Great, natural looking color. I thought it came with a glove to apply and it didn&#x27;t which was slightly disappointing but I just used my hands.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Saves me a ton of money not having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I ordered this product after reading about it on MaskCara&#x27;s blog &#x27;The Perfect Tan&#x27; (http://www.maskcara.com/2014/03/18/the-perfect-tan/). While I would not call it perfect, and do not think it is totally deserving of 5 stars, I would definitely say it is the best self tanner I have used. I have used Jergen&#x27;s (both the 3 day and 7 day lotion, and face lotion which is all decent but doesn&#x27;t get very dark, plus takes a while to set), and L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze (both the glittery stuff in the tube and the towlettes which are OK with some good practice but prone to be orange and streaky). I have never had a professional spray tan or gotten a Mystic tan or anything, but judging by how I&#x27;ve seen those turn out on my friends I think this is a really close contender! The bottom line is that I would definitely recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK Here comes the longest review ever:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It produces an even, dark color. This is the most important thing to me in a self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;-This tanner has the most natural color of any I&#x27;ve used. You will see if you get it on your white towels, it&#x27;s made up of reds, browns, blacks, so it really looks like you have been in the sun, even giving you a pinky sort of tan (though maybe I think that is the most natural for me because I am usually have my tan with a sunburn...)&lt;br /&gt;-Looks the most like a pro spray tan I&#x27;ve ever seen&lt;br /&gt;-It is easy to apply (I use the Fake Bake mitt)&lt;br /&gt;-It dries quickly (although it will transfer until you shower)&lt;br /&gt;-You can see exactly where the color is going as you apply, which makes it easier to not miss spots (although the bronzer will get on your clothes)&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t have a super strong smell when you are applying it&lt;br /&gt;-The smell doesn&#x27;t linger on you for days like some other tanners I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The bronzer in the product will transfer onto clothes, sheets, blankets etc. This may be a big deal to somepeople, but I don&#x27;t think it is that bad if you are prepared for it. Wear old clothes, use old towels, etc. I was also able to get the tanner out of my sheets after a simple wash.&lt;br /&gt;-This means it&#x27;s not really an apply and go product. For me, at least. Since I am so fair the dark bronzer makes me look a bit dirty. I&#x27;d go out at night to a dark bar like this, but if you splash any water on yourself, the bronzer will come off and it will look bizarre! Again, Not a big deal if you are prepared for this.&lt;br /&gt;-If you are looking for a super dark tan immediately, you will be disappointed after you shower the bronzer off. I don&#x27;t think this is a huge deal but it may be a con to some people. You need to build the tan over a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;-I am foreseeing that maintenance may be some work because the tan starts to fade after 2 days for me. But what tanning product, even a natural tan, isn&#x27;t? So far I am still experimenting with what works best for my skin type, but I think my process is going to be 2 consecutive days of tanning, then 2 off. I&#x27;ll try to update the review as I try more!&lt;br /&gt;-As another reviewer mentioned, it may stick in your pores. I noticed this happening on my legs a bit (but I have also had this with other tanners). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal because you can&#x27;t even tell unless you are way up close. It also happened on my chest after 2 consecutive nights of application but once again only I can really see it. Sidenote: I have big pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my process, in case you are curious:&lt;br /&gt;1. As with any tanner, exfoliate and moisturize in the days leading up to your application. I use a loofah and am currently using Softsoap Body Butter Coconut Body Scrub. I shave the morning of (I apply my tanner in the evening with plenty of time before going to bed). Some say to put lotion on your knees, elbows, ankles, etc before applying. I personally don&#x27;t but I do wipe the tanner off of those areas so it doesn&#x27;t get too dark.&lt;br /&gt;2. Prep yourtanning station. You will want to be in a well-lit area with a box or chair to put your foot up on to make getting the legs a bit easier. I also have gloves, my mitt, a washcloth with a damp part and dry part available.&lt;br /&gt;3. Make sure your hair is out of your face and if you are going to put the tanner on your face, make sure it is clean. I do wash my face, apply lotion, and then put the tanner on my face. I think this makes it come out less dark.&lt;br /&gt;4. Put on your gloves! I wear both so I can easily switch the mitt from hand to hand. One thing I like about Tanwise is that it doesn&#x27;t dry immediately so there is some room for error, but you still need to work relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;5. Start your tan! I use one full pump per section and start with my calves, doing one leg at a time, then working up to my thighs, stomach, chest, lower back, shoulders, upper arms, then lower arms.&lt;br /&gt;6. Do your face if you plan to use it on your face. I don&#x27;t even put a new pump on the mitt, I just use what is left over in the mitt. I rub it all over, then give an extra pat to my cheeks, nose, chin, and top of forehead to create a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;7. I then remove my gloves and carefully blot the tanner on the backs of my hands. Just a TINY bit - what is left over in the mitt works. I then have my boyfriend do my upper back and any areas I&#x27;ve missed. This way, I don&#x27;t even get the tanner on my palms at all. This means you don&#x27;t have to wash your hands, and you won&#x27;t be left with what looks like white gloves the next day!&lt;br /&gt;8. An important part about those orange prone areas: I go ahead and run the mitt over my ankles, elbows, tops of feet, and knees. I just make sure that I don&#x27;t do it with a fresh pump on the mitt. I do it lightly, and go over it with my handy damp/dry wash cloth to make sure those areas don&#x27;t get dark.&lt;br /&gt;9. The Fake Bake Mitt recommends using the buffing side about 20 minutes after applying. Obviously, this is made for Fake Bake products however I didthis once and I do think it is a helpful (but not necessary) step.&lt;br /&gt;10. Let the tan dry for as long as you can before dressing. The bottle says 15-20 minutes, but the shortest amount of time I have ever done is about 45 minutes. Then put on loose, old clothes you don&#x27;t care about dirtying. I do sweats and a loose tank top. I don&#x27;t put a bra on because I am worried the tightness will rub off in places, but it&#x27;s possible it would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;11. Go to bed! Or, if you do it in the morning, occupy yourself for 4-6 hours before showering.&lt;br /&gt;12. When you do shower, lightly scrub in circular motions all over your body. For this I just use my loofah and regular bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;13. Moisturize! Remembering to keep your skin hydrated will help you retain your tan.&lt;br /&gt;14. Repeat as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a bit more on the times I have used it:&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried the product I didn&#x27;t have the mitt yet so I applied it to my legs with my bare hands. I was initially terrified because of the bronzers. My hands were literally black! So I only did my legs that night and actually ended up showering it off after an hour because I thought it wasn&#x27;t drying properly. It pretty much washed all the way off because I didn&#x27;t let the DHA sit long enough on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, I had the mitt. The tanner will go straight through the mitt so I would recommend using gloves underneath. I just use regular dish gloves. It once again turned out super dark but I was determined to test it so I let it dry for about an hour before dressing. The tanner looked like it was rubbing off, but I woke up, showered, and was left with a nice glow afterward. I thought the spots where I could see it rubbing off the night before would be blotchy, but they weren&#x27;t. The tan came out completely even and now I realize it was just the bronzer rubbing off. This one application lasted for about 3 days and since I only did the one application, it faded (IMO) really evenly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most recently, I followed the same process described earlier but applied the mousse two nights in a row (slept in it, then showered in the morning). This resulted in a pretty dark color for my skin (I am really fair), kind of like a July or August tan like I had been outside all summer long. I find that this application is fading a bit more unevenly (but really not terrible at all, and I think it still looks natural), probably because it was darker in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue to experiment and will report back but so far this really is the best self tanner I have ever used. It is the most natural looking (after showering, of course) and I think the bottle is going to go a really long way, which is nice since the price on this stuff has really increased since I was looking at it last summer! I&#x27;ll also try to get some good before and after photos. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely awesome. I&#x27;m a natural blonde and I have fair fair skin, I&#x27;m talking like see my veines pale. I have spots of red on my arms and stretch marks from two kids and this product covered beautifully. At first when you apply it&#x27;s very dark, but I waited four hours, showered and pat dry. It looks like a natural tan it doesn&#x27;t look excessive or fake. Use a mit or gloves when applying because the product dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase Fake Bake. Used it years ago and liked it. After reading reviews I decided to try Tanwise instead and so glad I did! Love this product. Works great. Goes on quickly and dries fast. Smells good and even though it smells good while applying it quickly fades to no odor at all. Doesn&#x27;t rub off on cloclothes or sheets. Definitely recommend and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by a friend. I am a natural redhead so very pale. I wanted to find a product that wouldn&#x27;t leave me orange and streaky. This stuff works amazing!!! Results in the photo are just hours after application. Far right photo is after a shower.</li>
            <li> I first heard of this stuff from my hairdresser, when I asked him how the heck he didn&#x27;t look pasty-white all winter long. He told me he used this product, and I honestly didn&#x27;t believe it, because I assumed all self tanners left orange-tints, but his skin looked so naturally sun-kissed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I immediately searched for this online (because I am too lazy to search for it in-store, lol), and tried it out the first day I received it. I turned from a pasty-white sickly looking person, into a beach goddess in a matter of hours. It was amazing. The only complaint is that is has a not so good smell to it, but then again, what tanner doesn&#x27;t?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I would suggest maybe sleeping with the lotion on while laying on some towels, instead of doing what I did… I had to go around butt-naked in my house for 4 hours doing and touching nothing until I could shower off the tanner. So yeah, unless you feel like sitting around doing nothing for hours, try using it at night while you are sleeping! :)</li>
            <li> I previously purchased Saint Tropez Dark Tanning Mousse and this Tanwise product is half the price and does exactly the same thing. Goes on smoothly and evenly, allow it to dry before dressing, there will be some residue on your clothes until you shower 4-6 hours later, so don&#x27;t wear your favorite white dress! Not only that, the smell is quite pleasant, Rum Coconutty, whereas Saint Tropez&#x27;s stank. As with other tanning mousse&#x27;s it is very dark brown and goes on several shades darker than what the tan results will be after showering. Using a mitt to apply is a must.  My days of frying in the sun are over with, so this product is great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It makes me look tan and not orange. Perfect substitute for expensive spray tanning!</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well...gives great color after 3 applications...and I have very fair skin.  Recommend to always apply Vaseline on the knees and elbows before and after application to keep them from looking dirty.  I used rubber gloves as well and then a cotton ball to coat the backs of my hands lightly.</li>
            <li> Works very well, first time user. Did leak in shipment.</li>
            <li> Smells great and looks great!</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst tanning product at have ever purchased. I never have time/take time to review. But this is so bad, I just had to let prospective buyers know. With the mitt and all it made such a huge mess I just tossed everything away. Don&#x27;t even care if I don&#x27;t get money back. Just wanted to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to apply and does not leave an orange tint.  It does smell bad after applying it though!</li>
            <li> Left a good color. Waited for it to dry before dressing and some still came off on my clothes. I put I on before work after my shower, mind you I work in an air conditioned doctors office, a non sweating work environment. Took a shower after work and it all washed off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert at sunless tanners, but I didn&#x27;t like this one at all. It gave my face an orangey hue and made my hands greenish. I dont know why, but only my hands ever turn green, nothing else, I dont use any special moisturizer on them that I dont put on my knees and elbows, so no clue why that would even happen. It didn&#x27;t go on as dark as I had hoped either, it turned my pale skin into not so pale skin, but after several applications, it didn&#x27;t seem to get much darker. I like Fake Bake much better, it gets me tan and doesnt turn my hands green. Also I feel like I use a lot more of this product to cover my body than I do with Fake Bake.  One thing I do like about this is it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! My skin tone is slightly above fair, and sensitive but this color looks natural and great on me; like a real life from the sun tan!  When the tanner comes out of the bottle and I was first applying it I was nervous about how dark it was, but just rub it in and make sure it&#x27;s even and you are good to go Also, I would recommend not wearing anything white or light colored until you wash the bronzer off (4-6 hours after you apply). I have not have terrible issues with the bronzer coming off, but it definitely will get on your clothes a little bit. That being said, I have not had any problems with the bronzer staining my clothes; it has come off completely after washing the clothes.  Highly recommend this for a good fake and bake!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but it is very easily disturbed if you brush against something too hard. Also the dark color washes away after the first shower and the tan left isn&#x27;t that dark.</li>
            <li> Beautiful instant color with little to no streaking.</li>
            <li> does not work at all. color fades in a day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff looks so natural</li>
            <li> I have been using sunless tanners since I was about 16, and am now close to 30. So I have an idea about all of the quirks, looks, and aspects that go into sunless tanning.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different tanning lotions, before Tanwise, and after Tanwise. This is by far my favorite. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for beginners - if you&#x27;re using it as your first lotion, read directions carefully, or have someone help you! Get it nice and thick and rub it in really well.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll get an immediate beautiful color from the bronzer. But be careful, because that will wash off. But you will still retain a natural tan underneath. My sisters and mom asked me constantly last summer what I was using, they said I had a tan the entire summer (we are all super pale!), and I even swam a LOT last summer!&lt;br /&gt;When it begins to wear off, it&#x27;s worth the time to exfoliate the remainder completely off, and then start over. Over all a great tanner with a beautiful, natural color!</li>
            <li> I have been a hardcore lover of the St. Tropez mousse and was hesitant to switch, but decided to give this a try because $10 is easier on the wallet than St. Tropez&#x27;s $47.  I LOVE IT! It took more effort on my part to blend it, compared to the St. Tropez, but I am very pleased with the dark color, the subtle (pleasant) smell, and the evenness.  I used an applicator mitt as to not stain my hands, and I applied 4 pumps per leg, 2 pumps per arm, and 1 pump per every other area (chest, back, butt, stomach).  I do HIGHLY recommend waiting 20-30 minutes before dressing, because I was impatient and only waited about 12 and there were marks where my tank top was.  Overall, I highly recommend this product for the price!</li>
            <li> Favorite fake tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I read about this on the Masckara blog. It really is as good as shes says. It&#x27;s the most natural looking self tanner I&#x27;ve tried. Since it&#x27;s dark it&#x27;s easy to see exactly how it&#x27;s coming out as you apply.</li>
            <li> IN LOVE!!! I have used Fake Bake for years. It Is a good product, easy to apply, light pleasant fragrance, inexpensive and lasts for days. It was the best self tanner I had found including trying high end products. However, On me the color had a slight red tone which I was never fond of. I am a beach bunny from forever, growing up in Southern California, I Need a Tan!! I found reviews of Tanwise on a blog and immediately ordered it from Amazon. As mentioned I have used Fake Bake for years, it is easy to apply, lasts a long time, is inexpensive and has a great coconut smell, but the one thing I was not fond of with Fake Bake was the red/pink tone. OK,Tanwise Compared to FB: It took a few applications to get the feel of how to use the mousse with a mitt but I have mastered that at this point, It is prob more costly then FB and on me does not last quite as long, I do however like the light fragrance, BUT, It Is the Color!! The Color is Awesome!!! The absolute Best Bronzy Brown Tan color Ever!! It looks totally natural!! I even use it to contour my face!! Divinely pleased with Tanwise and lookin Good!!  A Huge Merci to all the sisters that left encouraging reviews. Namaste,  Zoe</li>
            <li> I bought this Tanwise Mousse due to a beauty blogger recommendation (Cara Brook of Maskcara), and ever since I first tried it, I&#x27;ve been obsessed. I can&#x27;t find a single thing wrong with this product. It has replaced my high-end tanner (the Fake Bake Flawless Liquid). I still have a full container left of the Fake Bake to finish, but I don&#x27;t even want to use it anymore because the Tanwise Mousse is just so, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things To Love:&lt;br /&gt;-The mousse formula is easy to apply and gives you a nice marriage of blendability and quick dry time. I find that most lotion formulas give you plenty of time to blend, but they take too long to dry- ain&#x27;t nobody got time fo dat. As for liquids and sprays, those soak in and dry almost instantly, but that limits blending time and can lead to streaking. I invite any self-tanning novice to start with a mousse like this for excellent results, where you can work with the product for a little bit before it sets. I apply the Tanwise Mousse with a clean tanning mitt and a disposable glove underneath. I have not had any issues with this product staining my clothes or bedding.&lt;br /&gt;-Dark, natural-looking color. When I first washed off the color guard after developing this tan overnight, I could tell immediately that I liked the bronze color: very natural, nice and dark. If you just want a subtle glow, I would not recommend this product- it does get quite dark, which I personally love. For a more subtle color/glow, try a gradual, buildable lotion (such as Jergens) or just a washable body bronzer. Tanwise Mousse darkened my skin by at least 3 shades with only 1 application (for reference, I went from L&#x27;Oreal True Match foundation in W3 Nude Beige to W6 Sun Beige. Yes, I had to buy a new foundation to match my tan because I got that dark).&lt;br /&gt;-Astonishingly long-lasting. What I truly did not expect was for this tan to last days and days and days, and then fade evenly altogether. I expected this to be a high-maintenance or short-livedtan due to the low price tag, but its lasting power is something special (however, if you have dry/problem skin, take extra care during maintenance). On me, the Tanwise Mousse lasted almost a week with 0 touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;-Effective packaging. Yes, I care about this, because it really matters. I can think of several self tanners I&#x27;ve tried where the product itself was wonderful, but there was no good way to apply it because the packaging designers botched the nozzle/cap (think Toma&#x27;s Airbrush tanning spray- lovely color, spitty nozzle). With the Tanwise Mousse, the plastic bottle and pump work perfectly, and it dispenses a nice amount of foam each time, no surprises or messes at all. What you see is (luckily) what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this mousse does have a bit of a self tanner scent during development (when I wake up in the morning, I can definitely smell it on my clothes and blanket), but I don&#x27;t dock any stars for this because I am used to all self tanners having a bit of a scent. And the scent of this mousse is not nearly as bad as some other brands, even including more high-end ones. What can I say? You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I hope you all love it as much as I do. Tanwise Mousse for the win.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am a huge fan of the Tanwise lotion so I thought I&#x27;d give the mousse a try. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the lotion - it just takes me awhile to apply. I heard good things about the mousse but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I used it two or three times but could not get it to give me a good color. Im pale, too, so it&#x27;s not that hard. I bought the same shade that I get in the lotion- fair to medium - but this didn&#x27;t do it for me. It also had a strange green tint to it. I put on a few layers and followed the instructions but I could not get it to work for me. Long story short : Tanwise will give you a nice, non orange tan, but you should go for the lotion.</li>
            <li> I use self tanner often and am always on the look out for a new product. I really like this one. The color is beautiful and it lasts really long. It doesn&#x27;t have the smell that most self tanners do and once dry the color doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes. It is a mouse which is not my favorite- I feel like you have to work really fast and your skin needs to be perfectly moisturized for it to go on evenly - but I can live with it. Don&#x27;t use it on your face- you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice now and it was so easy to use!  It isn&#x27;t streaky and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all!  The color comes off natural and isn&#x27;t orange.  And I&#x27;m a pretty fair skinned gal, so I was worried about it.  I got several compliments on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I found this through a reccomendation on Pinterest so I decided to order it from Amazon instead of going to Sally because there isnt one near me.  This tanner is amazing.  I love the foam it is dark on my skin almost instantly and even appears to darken a little over the first few hours!  It doesnt smell, it is not orange at all and I have recommended it to many others and of the 3 that have tried it, they love it as well! Note:  use gloves when applying or immediately scrub palms...it will leave a mark!  :)</li>
            <li> Required another person to apply the places I couldn&#x27;t reach but it looks very natural.  No smudges.  Would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have such a hard time finding a self tanner that works well with my fair skin and doesn&#x27;t turn out orange and blotchy! The color of this is perfect and best of all no streaks!</li>
            <li> This is hands down, the BEST self tanner out there. I&#x27;ve worked in a few tanning salons.I know all the tricks. I&#x27;ve tried them all. This is the best.</li>
            <li> Incredible product. Smell isn&#x27;t bad whatsoever, if rubbed in well (as with all tanners) it goes on great. I sleep in it then shower in the morning for great, streak-free color. If I want it to be darker, I do it again the next night. PLUS, it lasts for many uses and so you get your money&#x27;s worth. I would buy this product if it only lasted 1-2 tans so that is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and burn more than tan.  I got this to apply for a wedding so I didnt look as pastey and fair. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of color.  It didnt look unnatural or orange.  I&#x27;ve been reccommending it to everyone i know.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, very streaky!</li>
            <li> Let me just start out by saying I am very, very pale. I swear I could glow in the dark. This product is the only product I have used that has not left me orange and streaky!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I put this product on, I washed it off immediately- the initial bronzer that comes out of the bottle is sooo dark; it almost makes you look dirty. luckily, I decided to give it another shot, and applied it at night before bed so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about going out with my skin looking so dark. When I showered the next day and the bronzer came off, a PERFECT tan was left in its place. The color is tan- not orange at all. And best of all STREAK FREE!! The color lasted about 7 days, so I just exfoliate and reapply friday night and I have a perfect tan for the week ahead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;use nitrile gloves for application. Tanning mitts do not spread the product easily since it is a mousse.&lt;br /&gt;Again, use gloves! It will stain your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Use small circular motions to get the tanner to absorb. The bronzer can be hard to work into your skin and look kind of streaky initially, keep working it into your skin until it is smooth. You might get a work out, but it is so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Allow the tan to dry completely before dressing. I did get some on my clothes when I dressed to quickly. It washed out, but you never know with different fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;exfoliate really really well before use (as with any self tanner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, great product and so glad I gave it a second chance!! I will be a forever customer.</li>
            <li> I. Love. This. Tanner!!! I feel no need to try another brand anymore. Smells great, best color I&#x27;ve seen, has an instant color and also gets darker over time, a little goes a long way, stays on longer than others I&#x27;ve tried. And great price! I found out about it by Maskcara.com</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used! No orange look! Defiantly will buy more of this product! Love it!</li>
            <li> I really liked how the Tanwise Dark Bronzing Sunless tanner went on because you could see where you were putting it. Did not do well around feet and I used leftover on mitt to do them. And on me, it didn&#x27;t last very long unless you did it everyday. Overall, I liked it though!</li>
            <li> I am obsesssed with this tanner! It doesn&#x27;t clog pores (maybe a little on the face, but so much better than ones I have tried in the past) and is so asy to apply without streaks! Plus it has instant color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use gloves and rub it in well. It has a color in the foam which is great for seeing what it will look like once it develop, which makes it so easy to use! And the foam is great for applying a thin layer with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY light skin and this color is not overwhelming or fake looking.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tan solution. For the person that said they got streaky and looked really bad. You get best results when mixing it with lotion or else it goes on too dry.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this mousse in the mail because I had read great reviews. However, when I put it on I immediately regretted it. It&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m naturally pale, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get it to blend on my skin. It was blotchy and uneven, and just looked like I was dirty. The product is probably better when applying it over a base tan.</li>
            <li> I read online that this Tanwise was a duplicate of the Sun Labs tanner that I have always loved, but being that I cannot get Sun Labs locally, I ran to my local Sallys to pickup some Tanwise.  This is also the first time I have tried the mousse over just the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the positives:&lt;br /&gt;-The mousse is very easy to apply - use a mitt to make it easier and dries quicker.  You don&#x27;t have to rub it in like a lotion as it dries much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;- The tanner gives a great natural color and because it does look so natural, I don&#x27;t have to be so careful about knees, elbows, fingers/toes, etc. like I do with other brands.  It may be slightly streaky in spots when putting it on, but after showering off the instant bronzer, the streaks disappear&lt;br /&gt;- Cheaper than other Sun Labs products&lt;br /&gt;- Can buy locally at Sallys instead of ordering online and waiting for delivery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives (for me):&lt;br /&gt;- It is no where near dark enough for me.  I am used to Dark Sunsation by Sun Labs and I would say this Tanwise is probably more like Ultra Dark instead which is a step down(lighter).  I am used to having a final tan (after shower) that looks closer to what Tanwise looks like pre-shower.  I have a medium complexion with dark hair, so the darker tans just look better on me.  I can usually get that with 1-2 applications of Dark Sunsation.  With Tanwise, I would have to apply 3-4 applications which is a waste of product and time.  So if you are like me and need a darker tan, stick with Dark Sunsation.  Otherwise if you are just looking for a slight tint of color then this would work fine&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other tanners as well.  I have to apply every 2 days or so to keep my tan, whereas with something like Dark Sunsation I could go twice as long before having to reapply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of this is going to be personal preference, but just as an FYI for anyone that may have a similar complexion as me that needs the darker, longer lasting color, spend the extra $$ and get Dark Sunsation instead.</li>
            <li> Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because it settled into my pores &amp; looked kiiinda gross. A light exfoliation fixes that. Would buy again</li>
            <li> great tanner. Best that ive tried yet and believe me I have tried many.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read a blog in which about 20 products were tested and this one won. It does work better than any other I have tried...the mousse is an easy to apply vehicle. Leaves a tan that looks natural on me.  Lasts a day or so. I apply with latex gloves.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff for fake tanning.  an nice even tone and goes on easy.  I did use a sponge to apply however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many self tanners and was never happy with the outcome. This is by far the most natural color and goes on without ANY streaks. This is my 4th bottle. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I will start out by saying I have never bought this from this seller or on amazon. I buy mine from Sally&#x27;s for much cheaper. About 11 something a bottle but they will often have sales for two for 16. I was hoping that I could find it cheaper or in balk.  With that said I am a long user of tanwise. In my opinion the moose is the best. I have use the spray and lotion also. They all have instant color so it&#x27;s really easy to see where your applying. The reason I like the moose the best is because it not oily and I feel you get the best for your money. I bought my last bottle towards the end of April early may. And I just bought a new bottle the first week of June. The tan last about 4 days but I apply mine every 2-3 days to avoid splotchiness. It does not rub off when first applied and drys fast ( about 5-10 mins ) and that&#x27;s full dry time, meaning no stickiness. I leave mine on all day I have washed after 4 hrs but it give me much of color. The next morning after applying and having on all day and night, it does have an orange tint. But that washes right off and has a natural tone.  One thing to note it does have a greenish tint when very first applied but goes away with in a min so don&#x27;t let that scare you. Also a really good thing is use gloves when applying then do your hands last. It took me awhile to figure this out. It is much Eisner then having to scrub your hands after.  I have tried many products and this is by far the best. It is even better then salon tans.</li>
            <li> I really liked this tanner, but you must buy an applicator glove to apply. The tanner absorbs very quickly so I apply lotion over the entire area first. It is a very natural looking color and I had absolutely no streaks or spots. I used the applicator glove to apply and then rub everything in for a bit longer to make sure it is applied evenly. I would recommend this product and would buy again. I bought it off of a recommendation from blogger Maskara.</li>
            <li> My skin is fair to medium naturally, I tan but will burn. This product is superlative for imparting a nice, natural brown color to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on brown/black and does have a sort of ash-green look to it but the green goes away immediately on me.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it using a cloth. It will stain your hands brown.&lt;br /&gt;I use very small amounts of product and apply it in a circular motion. I go over ankles, knees, toes and fingers very lightly and only once, blending as I go.&lt;br /&gt;It does not turn me orange at all, it gives my skin a very nice brown color.&lt;br /&gt;After a shower some of the initial color is washed off, it leaves behind a light brown, natural color.&lt;br /&gt;It works best if I exfoliate before I use it, every time.&lt;br /&gt;The color will build over time, so its important to blend, blend, blend while you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;It works best if I apply it only once per day, after showering. I can skip an application or two and still have a nice light brown color.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to apply it twice a day, hoping to hurry the process along, it seemed to look too dark and splotchy in areas on my face and feet.&lt;br /&gt;I do moisturize but I wait til at least 6 hours after applying the Tanwise mousse. I use a hemp moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Because it has bronzers, and after you apply it but before you shower, it will streak and rinse off in the rain. First hand experience here, however, I just blended it with my hand where the rain had streaked it, washed my hands and it looked fine.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right!&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice, coconut, then fades to nothing.</li>
            <li> I also tried this tanning foam after reading about it in the Maskcara blog. I&#x27;ve used many other self tanners for years, mainly sticking with Banana Boat spray. The spray was great but tended to leave stains on my bathroom floor. Tanwise was better in that a small amount really goes a long way. My skin is light and I was surprised by how tan I was after just one session. It also dried within 15 minutes and I did not have any streaking problems (although I used a mitt and spent a fair amount of time smoothing it out). Also worked well on my face. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of self tanners over the years, and this is the only one that I&#x27;ve wanted to use over and over. I read about it on Maskcara.com and I think I went out to buy it the next day (I went to my local Sally Beauty because I didn&#x27;t want to wait! And it&#x27;s cheaper there.). When I first started to apply it I was nervous about the bronzer, which right out of the bottle almost looks grayish/green. Thankfully, after you rub it in and it dries for a minute the bronzer is a really pretty golden brown color. I usually apply this tanner before I go to bed. It dries REALLY fast, which is great. It does rub off a tiny bit on my sheets, but it washes right out. In the morning I look a little scary before I take a shower - the tan has developed and the bronzer hasn&#x27;t been washed off, making me a bit dark. But after showering all the bronzer rinses off and I&#x27;m left with a nice medium brown tan! I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned, and this tanner gives me noticeable color without looking unnatural. I have probably used it about 5 or 6 times now. I&#x27;m ready to reapply after about a week. I still have about half a bottle left. One tip - WEAR GLOVES! I bought some gloves meant for hair coloring and they are great. If you&#x27;re still not sure, just give it a try! I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! So many people complimented me on my tan, and they were shocked when I told them it&#x27;s from a bottle! I am a red head with fair skin that does tan in the sun, so this tan looks natural! My tan lasted for 3-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips on application: I put vinyl gloves (from the dollar store) on my hands and then cover them with socks-- the socks help spread the mousse around and the gloves keep my hands from getting yucky!! I put on two layers right after each other, watch some TV standing up while it dries, then sleep, and shower in the morning. I do this so the tan is still dark enough, but the shower will rinse off anything that could potentially get on your clothes, especially if it&#x27;s a hot day and you are sweating. ALso: my dog likes to lick my legs after this stuff is dried, and his saliva will lick the tan right off and then it will look blotchy-- if I shower first, this doesn&#x27;t happen! Plus, then I can get off all the excess from my elbows and knees and other creases so it looks more natural! Happy tanning!!</li>
            <li> My favorite bronzer so far. Easy to apply, no streaks, and gives you a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li> The absolute best tanning solution I have ever used, and I have used a LOT of them.  One caution, you should definitely wear disposable gloves when applying it.  The solution is hard to get off your hands otherwise.  A small price to pay for a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> I use self tanning products as often as I can. I had been using St. Tropez and LoReal Sublime spray before and thought I would try Tanwise since St. Tropez is too expensive and LoReal isn&#x27;t dark enough (plus it&#x27;s a spray so you cannot see where you are applying it). This stuff gave me an amazing tan but wasn&#x27;t worth it 2 days later when this stuff came off in patches. By day 4 I had patches of tan that I was SCRUBBING off with a mix of lemon and sugar. It&#x27;s not worth the ugly way that it comes off. It took 2 weeks to fully come off of my skin.</li>
            <li> Stop what you are doing if you want a believable tan and order this product! Goes on even and has great color! No streaking! I recommend using a glove to avoid hands staining but that is the only con that is always to be expected when using a self tanner! Price is ok but worth it if unavailable in your area!</li>
            <li> I had no idea whatsoever that I could look this good, this tan so fast, even though I am fair I have a lot of yellow in my skin and when I do tan it looks great, but I don&#x27;t have the patience to lie still on the beach long enough to blush much less tan...so I tried this and it IS DARK, I am going to order the lighter version so people will think that I am a professional sun bather.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! You will definitely want to use a tanning glove/mitt. Great immediate color (although super dark), and no splotches, no bad smell.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  I have tried many self tanning products, this one is by far the best.  Mousse has a color to see where you are applying the product.  Use gloves similar to what you get inside hair color products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Smells good and goes on evenly.  Easily applied and blends well.  No streaks.</li>
            <li> Saw a recommendation on Pinterest and thought it might cure my pasty winter leg pallor. (I&#x27;m a blue-eyed blonde.) I was appalled at the first squirt out of the bottle--darkest brown. But since it was a weekend and I could cover it up with long pants. Actually, it worked great. No orangy color, not too dark, no unpleasant smell, color right away...I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it! I bought it after seeing it all over pinterest and I was not disappointed. I&#x27;m a Florida girl who recently moved to Boston and I cannot stand how pale I am all the time. I finally decided I had to start trying sunless tanners. After trying a couple and not being happy, I found this one. When it comes out of the container it is almost black, which is scary if you&#x27;re a beginner. But it blends amazingly well and gives the perfect color that isn&#x27;t too orange. I haven&#x27;t found that it lasts as long as some of the other reviews might suggest, but if you keep it up it looks great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I have a word of advice for the people who are giving bad reviews because of it being &amp;#34;splotchy,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;uneven,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;orange,&amp;#34; etc.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to self tanners, you MUST do the work in order to obtain a natural looking tan. Too many people expect to slather on a self tanning product and have it turn out perfectly. You have to exfoliate, shave, use the correct tools (I.e. Tanning mitt, gloves, lotion, etc.) and apply correctly. If you don&#x27;t apply it correctly, it WILL look terrible. This is true for any self tanning product that gives you any amount of significant color.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I cannot get enough of this product!!! I&#x27;ve tried the Tanwise self tanning lotion so I decided to give the mousse a try. And I&#x27;m so glad I did! I like it much better than the lotion because of how quickly it dries. It seems to have a much more natural color to it as well. I fine the lotion looks a little more orange than the mousse, even though the lotion looks very natural as well.&lt;br /&gt;This mousse dries quickly but not too quickly. If you&#x27;ve never applied self tanner before you should only do a little bit at a time. But for people who know what they&#x27;re doing, the drying time is the perfect amount of time to rub it in and not feel like you&#x27;re walking around in a coat of sludge. The smell is wonderful compared to other self tanners. I could still smell a slight scent the first day after I showered but other than that I couldn&#x27;t smell it.&lt;br /&gt;I applied this at night. I showered, exfoliates, shaved. Dried off and applied lotion to dry areas such as ankles, knees, and elbows. I applied one coat, let it dry, and then applied a second coat. I applied the product to my whole body, including my face. I used a fine sized amount on the edge of my tanning mitt and worked it into my face starting with my forehead and cheeks and blending down my neck. When I got up in the morning I did look a little orange and was a little worried. But assoon as I got in the shower and washed the bronzer off I was left with a beautiful natural looking tan! I would recommend this product to anybody who doesn&#x27;t want to bake their body in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Works great! Make sure you exfoliate well, and if you follow up with a lotion with a hint of bronzer it will even out any spots with too much product! Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use your bare hands to apply.  Buy a box of disposable surgical gloves.  Gloves make it fool proof to apply &amp; no stained hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use surgical gloves you only need to apply sparingly &amp; spend a few minutes massaging it in circular motions until absorbed &amp; no streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color looks weird going on,  but it&#x27;s a useful color &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; that gives you great instant color while the product develops. {It looks fine once it&#x27;s worked in}.  You need to go easy near ankles &amp; not get too close to soles of feet.  My &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; developed into a dark, beautiful golden brown within hours.  I only did my legs but they made heads turn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There wasn&#x27;t that weird, typical cat pee smell that most self-tanners give off.  The product is a foam,  so no strong aerosols &amp; a little goes a long way...you only need to apply enough to absorb.. too much &amp; it can be a bit sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it has a bronzer &amp; gives instant color as it develops, avoid white/light clothing. I exfoliate &amp; moisturize at night, apply tanner in morning &amp; wash off in evening to keep it off my bedding  I had no issues with flaking, blotches.  I reaaply every 4 days.  This will save me so much money compared to the aerosol tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this sunless tanning mousse, since it was recommended on maskcara&#x27;s blog recently. I tried this on my showered, totally dry, shaven leg and it looked like I had rubbed mud on myself. I tried applying with a mitt and also with my bare hand, and the result was the same. It never blended naturally so I scrubbed it off immediately.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have gotten 3 compliments this morning alone on how great it looks. The smell is pleasant, and it rubbed in easy. I would buy the mit though, or wash your hands between leg/arm/body applications, as my hand turned SO DARK, and was really hard to wash off. I would def buy again.</li>
            <li> I am pasty white, and yet, this spring I have gotten more compliments than ever about how tan I look. I alternate between this and Jergen&#x27;s tanning lotion and it seems to be working!</li>
            <li> I am a very fair, woman who doesn&#x27;t tan naturally. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different self-tanners and this is by far one of my lease favorite. The color isn&#x27;t very dark, and did make me look more orange- especially after re-applying. It&#x27;s dark at first , but then all the color washes off in the shower. Such a waste. I also got the shimmer cream and it&#x27;s a purple tone rather than a brown. What are these people thinking? That&#x27;s not even close to a real tan.</li>
            <li> I love this self-tanner. It does come out VERY dark, so the color guide makes it easy to apply but just know that is not the color you are going to be, the color guide comes off in the shower. However, the remaining color is beautiful, on the brown side. Wears away evenly. Yes it does have that self-tanner smell after a few hours. It dries down quickly,  be careful to not use too much or it will be tacky. I use at night, and when I shower in the morning, most of the self-tanner scent goes down the drain and I&#x27;m good to go.  It is fragranced with a tropical scent but you will still get the self tanner smell after 4 or 5 hours. I self-tan from May through Sept and have for at least 10 years. This is one of my faves especially for the price. Use a mitt to apply, it&#x27;s a dream!</li>
            <li> I have used twice on my legs, great stuff, gives a nice tan, lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Best tanning mousse I have ever used. The color is perfect for my olive skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave me looking orange or splotchy.  If you prep well before applying you will not be disappointed. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner I have used yet. I bought it after reading about it on the Mascara blog. You cant go wrong with her recommendations! It is the perfect color and lasts for about four days. Easy to apply. I always apply at night before bed then shower in the morning to rinse of any excess. Love it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t streak. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a life longer user of self tanner. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different kinds. So far I definitely like this kind the best. I recommend putting some kind of moisturizer on before you apply this tanner because it dries really fast--almost not giving you enough time to rub it in. But using a moisturizer first allowed me enough time to rub it in really well and get a smooth tan. It looks more natural than other tanners I&#x27;ve used and I didn&#x27;t notice any bad smell.</li>
            <li> This tanning mousse works great.  I&#x27;ve gotten several people tell me my tan looks natural after using this.  I have found the key to making it not look fake is to put it on before going to bed and when I wake up I shower, letting a small amount wash off. What&#x27;s left is a nice, natural lightly tanned look.  If I want to go darker, I apply it every couple days.  It seems that by Day 3 or 4 most of it has washed off if I&#x27;m not reapplying it.&lt;br /&gt;It does rub off on my sheets when I sleep but not terribly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a glove to apply this and my hands, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make too much of a difference in the look.  When using my hands, I wash with soap thoroughly after applying it to any one certain area so that my palms don&#x27;t look tan.</li>
            <li> Such a good value for the $$$$</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how easy this was to apply.  It dries very quick and is not streaky.  (I used an applicator mit).  The color is great.  Only downside is that it does not last very long (about 2 days on legs with daily workouts, showers/shaving).</li>
            <li> Alright here we go. Hope this review helps someone who is new to tanning like me. I am a tanning novice so I did a LOT of research before buying this product. I&#x27;m light neutral skinned- not the very fairest in most foundations, but usually the second or third from the fairest in a neutral shade. I wanted a product that wouldn&#x27;t make me orange, wouldn&#x27;t streak, wouldn&#x27;t smell, and would last a decent amount of time (5-7 days would be optimal). Most importantly I wanted it to be affordable. So far I like the color- my husband is pretty picky about fake tans and calls girls orange who I would say aren&#x27;t too bad. He thinks the tanwise color looks natural on me. I applied it with a 6 dollar mitt from ulta after reading lots of recommendations to do so. It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t streak. The guide color does kind of make you look green at first but it works for finding places you errored. It&#x27;s pretty forgiving too. I thought my back for sure was going to be splotchy since I saw several mistakes in the mirror and went over them again, which just caused me to overlap some places I had already gone, and the guide color was very splotchy, but I gave up. But my back is not bad! I&#x27;m really pretty impressed with how forgiving it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re already kind of tan then you might not notice a big change in overall color from this product. This product I think would be GREAT for people my skin tone and fairer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell... there is one. I read reviews before saying it isn&#x27;t too bad compared to other ones and that didn&#x27;t make sense to me.. that DHA smell is either there or it isn&#x27;t. But after having used the product I will say that I see what people mean by calling it &amp;#34;not bad.&amp;#34; When I stick my face right down into my skin, I actually can&#x27;t really smell it. But the scent from having it all over my body wafts up to my nose all day long just doing day-to-day activities. After having it on a few hours I put some scented lotionon my forearms and noticed that I could actually smell the lotion and not the DHA smell. So that&#x27;s a win in my book. The scent does go away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how long the tan lasts, I&#x27;m still on my first application but I don&#x27;t see this lasting 5 days. I knew that was a stretch of a goal but I was hoping for only needing to apply once a week. If I wanted to maintain a tan my guess would be that I&#x27;d have to apply again on the 4th day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product around 3 pm, let it dry for about a half an hour afterwards, then got dressed but still felt a little tacky around my neck, back of my knees, etc. It wasn&#x27;t until SEVERAL HOURS later that I felt 100% completely dry. And even then, I got into bed around 10 and woke up the next morning with the slightest trace of it on my stark white sheets. I&#x27;m reading other reviews that say that should come out though. I had tanned in the middle of the afternoon on purpose so that had no chance of happening. It does say on the bottle to allow 4-6 hours for the color to develop before showering. So next time I will rinse off before I get into a bed with super white sheets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, price. This bottle is 7 oz and I bought it here on amazon for about $16 (I think it&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper at Sally&#x27;s which is where I will buy it next time). As I was using it I felt like I needed a lot of product to cover my body. It&#x27;s not like lotion where you can really smear it around, it&#x27;s definitely a gel mousse, which is hard to describe if you&#x27;ve never used it. You will probably need more product than you expect. I also can&#x27;t see how much I have left in the bottle so I&#x27;m going off of weight entirely. But the mousse pump is the same as those bath and body works foaming hand soaps (you know the ones) and I&#x27;m always impressed at how long those last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for a tanner with a natural color that&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts a few days, I think $16 is a little pricey. I paid it because it&#x27;s a step up from the cheapest stuff at the drug store, and had reviews similar to some high end brands but for MUCH cheaper. If you can find it at sally&#x27;s for like $12, snatch that up! That is definitely an appropriate price for this product.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Must use gloves vs a tanning mitt. Works much better with gloves. Great color!</li>
            <li> I really like this- not streaky or blotchy whatsoever. Lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> Its ok, would not buy again</li>
            <li> I loved this product the first two times I applied it. It looked great and was not orange at all! Then as I kept trying to build the tan, it became splotchy and streaked. I did use a glove. As the days went on, it faded rather quickly. Looked ridiculous on my elbows, hands, and feet. Will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only self-tanner that gets me dark enough. Plus it does NOT smell like DHA at all, and I love the mousse formula because it spreads on very evenly. Plus it&#x27;s an unbeatable price compared to other self tanners that are this dark. Plus, this is the longest lasting self tanner I&#x27;ve used! And I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of self tanners. Have purchased multiple times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. The tan looks natural, I use plenty of lotion around ankle &amp; knees to avoid orange bruise look. I bought at Sally&#x27;s for under $10 but I would pay $18 if necessary! Only con is hard to remove from hands, I have to use lemon soap to remove completely.</li>
            <li> After trying several self tanners, I decided to give this brand a try. I must say, I am VERY impressed. I buy mine at my local Sally&#x27;s store, but thought I&#x27;d give a good review on here. The mousse dried almost instantly, the smell is awesome, the color is awesome and lasts longer than several of the other products I&#x27;ve used. This is totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> It was a little intimidating at first because it comes out very, very dark. I did my research on the product and it had really good reviews overall and so far i&#x27;m happy with it. It does have a slight odor comparable to tanning bed lotions, which wasn&#x27;t awful for someone like me who use to tan often. It gave me a very nice color and I haven&#x27;t found any streaks. I suggest using a glove or something to smooth it on or else your hand may be very dark after.</li>
            <li> It appears very dark but the color goes on very easily, does not turn orange and blends easily.  If you apply properly it does not show creases  on hands elbows or knees.  I have very sensitive skin and the light scent and chemicals do not cause any reaction.  I recommend this for all skin tones.</li>
            <li> Applied as directed, exfoliated before hand, used tanning mit, ect. Nice color but very streaky and fades extremely patchy. I looked like I had vitiligo. Rubs off on clothing/sheets. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I love fake tanner and this is the absolute best!</li>
            <li> I love this self tanner! It&#x27;s comparable in quality to my St. Tropez Bronzing Mousse, but at a much cheaper price. Definitely need a mitt to evenly apply, otherwise it may be streaky and leave your hands orange. Natural color.</li>
            <li> This gives a great glow but to be real here, you need someone you don&#x27;t mind to see you naked to help you apply it. Otherwise a great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I used it before my winter wedding and it came out great. I did have a few issues with the way it looked around my hands, but that was total first time user error. I got so many compliments and will be using it again soon to gear up for the summer. I didn&#x27;t have any staining issues either, although, I did be sure to wear dark clothing so not sure if that made a difference. I paired this with the bronzing cream and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanned I have ever used! Smells like coconut. Goes on without streaks. I&#x27;ve used lot of sunless tanner products. This was not expensive. Yes the charcoal color is dark. But this never bothers me. I don&#x27;t leave this on as a bronzer. I use the color to see where I applied it. Then I shower a couple hours later. The color that develops is amazing and natural. I didn&#x27;t even realize people leave the bronzer on with clothes</li>
            <li> This is my favorite drugstore tanner, the price is right and it goes on even and brown, it isn&#x27;t super duper dark but 2 coats and its amazing, so i would say its build able. I love using this as a touch up when i spray tan, it makes it last longer and looks great over top :)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for body builder bronze, you&#x27;ve found the right product. If you want a &amp;#34;weekend in Santa Barbara&amp;#34; glow, STAY AWAY. This stuff will make you brown, not orange. It also seeps into your pores (ew), which shows up even when you&#x27;ve washed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be returning this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning mousse! It doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange and has a beautiful natural color. I&#x27;ve applied it with gloves and a tanning mitt and have found the mitt to be the best applicator.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this because the Maskcara beauty blog recommended this specific tanner. After using it, I too recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tanwise dark bronzing sunless mousse provides a nice smooth color that is just the right shade. On my skin, the color lasts for about 5 or 6 days total before my legs revert to their normal untanned color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read the directions for this tanner, it recommends leaving this product on for about 6 hours before washing it off so that the color has time to develop. Therefore, I apply it the night before and then wash it off in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend just applying this tanner with just your hands because it will stain them orange - you need a mitt, IMO. I use and would recommend The Ultimate Tanning Applicator Mitt by Thermalabs (also available on Amazon).</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading about it on Maskcara&#x27;s blog and I have to say it works great! I would compare it to St. Tropez Bronzing Mousse and works just as well but it is a whole lot cheaper. Tanwise is very easy to apply and absorbs quickly into the skin. There is a slight scent to the mousse but it is not overpowering. I am very fair skinned and one coat of this product was enough to give me a beautiful tan. For the most even application it is best to apply this product after shaving and showering and moisturizing the rough areas (elbows, hands and feet) and make sure you apply with a tanning mitt. Great product and I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> So far I love this sunless tanner! I have only used it 3 times so I am still getting the hang of how to apply it to problem areas (elbows, knees, feet), but I definitely see results and I know that the more I use it the better I will be at applying it. Definitely recommend using a glove and/or mitt with this as it does dry quickly and can stain hands (although there are ways to get that off) Also can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I&#x27;m naturally a Red Head with very Fair skin. I bought this product from Sallys for 12.99. I read all kids of reviews before I decided to buy it. So after I bought it, I did a small spot on my upper thigh to see how it would work. It went pretty well, so I did it all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: 1. it is absolutely necessary that you exfoliate before applying this tanner. Why? Because it opens your pores and allows the color to set in and it will last longer. 2. Wear gloves!! Any latex type glove will work. 3. Apply small generous amounts to a section of your skin, start in the middle and work your way out using CIRCULAR MOTIONS.This will help blend any spots. 4. Let yourself dry for more than 20 minutes if you plan on getting dressed right after. Give your tan time to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on at about 2pm for my first application, and left it on until 10am the next morning when I showered, exfoliated again and reapplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is true about the comments: It will look super dark when you first put it on. The color guide is great though and it&#x27;s really easy to see where you missed or if you messed up. Just keep rubbing it in and it will look great. If you get a drop of water on you, it will show. I had it happen and I blended it in one spot and had to add some extra in another spot and it turned out fine. I was worried but when I took a shower, all the lines I thought I would have were washed away and left an almost unbelievably even tan, but the color did fade. Even the lines it made when I was sleeping washed away. Which by the way, it will rub off on your clothes and sheets, but very lightly. I rinsed my night shirt out in the sink with regular hand soap to see if it would come out and it did. The cotton ball trick for your hands and feet worked the best with this. I put a small amount and worked it into where the line was from wearing gloves and it blended great both times. The sponge sucked... Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not true about the comments: it leaves you streaky. No it doesn&#x27;t. I have tried a lot of different self tanning products and this is so even. I usually use Jergens and even that left me streaky sometimes, but not this. Some people said it doesn&#x27;t work or last-  I could see how some people would say that since the color you have when you put it on isn&#x27;t the same color you have when it washes off. You will be a lighter color but if you reapply, it gets and stays darker and longer. I honestly believe some people don&#x27;t use it or apply it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use as directed, read some articles or watch some YouTube videos before applying and always do a test spot until you get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the instant color, the evenness (it was a big surprise since like I said I was worried when I saw a few lines it had made overnight) and so far it&#x27;s lasting pretty long! It&#x27;ll be awesome not to have to reapply every single day, or even every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still reading this, you must really want to try it and I say go for it! If you can read this whole thing, you can do some research and come out with a perfect. Summer tan! Try to face gel and shimmer cream too :)</li>
            <li> First off, I am a fair skinned redhead so I am always searching for a new tanning product to not make me look like a carrot or streaky just plain orange.  This one works for me.  I didn&#x27;t buy the mitt but may go back and order it.  I followed the instructions and it works.  It does make a bit of a mess when applying but it dries quickly.  I stand in front of a fan for a few minutes longer than suggested.  If you make a mistake you can dampen a towel and wipe off or rub in the excess product.  If you rub too hard you&#x27;ll have a product free spot with which you need to reapply.  I haven&#x27;t had it come off onto my clothes but I dress in a black sundress after I put it on.  The day after application I took a shower and all the excess washed off leaving a nice glow of a tan.  My husband did notice a slight tanning solution odor several hours after I put it on but said it wasn&#x27;t as bad a most self tanning products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend it to anyone who is fair skinned.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no weird smell and looks like a real tan!  Not orange or streaky at all, I love it!</li>
            <li> I too heard of this product through the Maskcara blog. I like this product, I used one pump for each part of each leg (1 pump for lower leg, 1 pump for thigh area, etc.) and one pump for each arm area (upper and lower). The color blended easily and did not look streaky or orange. I waited the full 15 minutes to get dressed and have not had any transfer issues. This product gives you a build-able tan, although it says &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; on the bottle I think it takes a few applications to get a dark tan.</li>
            <li> I was at first reluctant to try this product because of the review below. I also saw this product recommended on maskcara.com and since it only costs $10 I thought I would give it a try. At first I was shocked when the \\&quot;mouse\\&quot; came out watery and super dark, almost black. This consistency actually helped me rub it in my skin evenly allowing me to see where exactly I was applying it. Also, I do highly recommend you using an application glove or mitt because it will stain your hands when applying. I made sure to apply moisturizer on my knees, elbows, and ankles to keep these areas from getting dark with the tanning product. Tanwise was pretty easy to apply and it worked great! After one application, I saw a subtle tan that even my husband noticed. This product is wonderful for a subtle tan or you can apply another coat the next day for a deeper tan. This is going to replace my Jergans Natural Glow! Also, to help it dry faster, I cheated and quickly turned my blow dryer on low heat for a few seconds all over my body. It did get on my socks just a little bit when I did not wait long enough to put them on the other night but it washed right out.</li>
            <li> I am a fake-tan-aholic. Now that summer is approaching and there are random 75 degree days, I am so excited to finally be able to get away with a little tan. I saw this recommendation on a blog and I can&#x27;t keep saying how impressed I am. It DOES go on blackish brown and looks streaky as-F. It DOES totally stain your hands if you don&#x27;t use a mitt. It DOES smell like a self-tanner. but it DOES make you realistic brown beautiful tan. It dried for me in 20 minutes and I slept in very light jammie pants and a long sleeve and there was no transfer. Other reviewers washed this off before giving it a chance and let me say, you&#x27;re missing out. All mousses&#x27; (even spendy reputable brands) look &#x27;muddy&#x27; but give you beautiful even coverage. I love this product and look forward to making it my summer staple.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful my new tan product!! It doesn&#x27;t streak, isn&#x27;t orange and gives a wonderful color I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product in the future. It goes on great! I really like the mousse consistency compared to other products I have used. Compared to others, I think this product lasts longer and goes on a lot more smoothly. I am very pale and did not suffer many issues with orange spots. I prefer to apply with a mitt. This is an overall great product, and I don&#x27;t think the price should frighten you; it really is a great product for a low price! I even bought the face gel to go with it.</li>
            <li> I bought a mitt to apply this with and the mitt actually makes it go on a bit streaky so i&#x27;ve been using it with my hands and making sure to wash them really well. So far i&#x27;ve been loving this product. It does seem to dry quickly though so you have to apply and then rub it in fast.</li>
            <li> Works great! Awesome color. I have ivory skin and it looks natural and easy to make even. No streaks! Use gloves!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It is not orange and gives instant color! I LOVE this product! Try it out, you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and you have an instant perfect tan that lasts for 2-3 days! I have tried tons of sunless tanners and Tanwise Mousse is by FAR the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> This gives a great tan when applied well. Its a natural looking color with absolutely NO smell.  It actually smells great! I applied this about once a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! It actually makes you tan and not orange! Plus it smells really good, like coconut. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I liked this product quite a bit. I have a light/medium natural skin color, but am concerned with tanning at this point. This went on easily and it was good to be able to see exactly where you were applying the product. The color looked very good, not orange or fake. The smell is fine if you are used to sunless tanning products. I have yet to find one that doesn&#x27;t have some sort of odor after a little while, but it is not offensive like some of them are. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because I put it on and waited 35 minutes before getting dressed and I still got a little product on the inside of my blouse. It did however wash out, so there was no permanent staining.</li>
            <li> When you first pump the mousse out into your hand, the color will horrify you. It&#x27;s this dark greenish blackish brown, and it will leave you looking like a swamp creature. That being said, once it dries, it&#x27;s so beautiful! I&#x27;m medium/fair skin with blonde hair and this gave me a very natural tan, no orange at all. Totally even, non-streaky coverage, and very forgiving on the places that are notoriously hard to get like feet and elbows, etc. I did miss some spots, but was able to even it out with a second application the next day and it looks really really good. Doesn&#x27;t smell horrible either, which is a rare find. I&#x27;m totally sold on this stuff, practically fool proof!</li>
            <li> I have tried several self tanners anywhere from expensive to drug store brands.  I have ended up with streaks and orange.  I was truly shocked to find this tanner is easy to apply, smells great and gives a great believable color.  I will purchase again.  I even use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this, i am very white, i&#x27;m so white im almost see through, i have tried many self tanning creams, lotions, mouse......i got stuck on Fake Bake, really good stuff gave a great natural tan until i saw this on YouTube....its fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t smell too bad at all, i apply it in the morning shower at night and within two days i have a great color used once a week keeps me looking healthy if i use it more often (during summer) i look like i have been away.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried almost every product out there and this one is by far the best in terms of color and staying power. Not quite as easy to apply and a spray, but so worth the extra trouble of a mousse. I like this so much better than I do the Sun Labs product I had previously thought was da bomb. It looks 100% natural. One thing I recommend though is washing your hands in baking soda after you apply (if you like to use your hands instead of a glove). This product is a bit tough to get off your palms and nobody wants a tan there.</li>
            <li> Gives a natural color and doesn&#x27;t streak. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Wow! I was a big fan of St. Tropez untili bought this! St. Topez tends to tun my skin yellowish but I continued to use because I could not find anything better. I read the reviews on this and decided to pick it up at Sally. The color is amazingly brown with no yellow tones. It looks so natural with slight reddish undertones and no streaks. I used my St Tropez mitt to apply and left on over night. So worth the money! I have tried tons of expensive sunless tanners and this tops them all!</li>
            <li> I have to be ridiculously tan to compete in ballroom competitions, and I had high hopes for this product after reading the glowing reviews. It&#x27;s true that after application I got fabulously dark - but that was primarily because of the bronzer. The product comes out a scary dark olive color but quickly dries to a beautiful chocolate color, so you&#x27;d think you&#x27;d be getting super dark. However, once you wash off the bronzer you are left with a regular DHA tan, that is to say somewhat orange, and despite DHA being listed as the second ingredient the tan is not particularly dark. I get darker with Banana Boat Deep Dark sunless tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be sure to massage the mousse in thoroughly so that you don&#x27;t see streaks, and resist the urge to spread the product out too much to make the streaks go away. It&#x27;s not terrible, but not good enough, and the mousse is harder for me to control than the Banana Boat lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful. Kinda like coconuts. It is very dark while it is developing, but after you wash the top layer off it gives you a very nice base tan. Highly recommended for those with pale skin.</li>
            <li> Does not produce a bronze look. I could not even tell any color change. Too expensive not to have results. After it is dry, it will leave burgandy color on your pillow case if you have a night sweat. Only plus side was that it did not have that tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Great color, and the bottle lasts me at least two months. I use this primarily on my chest and arms 3-4 times per week and the bottle lasts a very long time. The color is a nice brown. It is not orange-y or red at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My critiques: Be forewarned- It DOES transfer on to bedding, however it easily washes out in the washing machine. I wish they made this in a spray version, but I will continue to use this product. Overall, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;m fair skinned and every other self tanner I&#x27;ve tried looked orangey or streaky.  This product went on evenly and looked very natural.  I used it for three days in a row with middle of winter pale skin before going to the beach in February and I looked tan even out in the sun.  Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used by far!</li>
