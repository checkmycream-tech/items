            <li> Feels good on lips and the color is fantastic has so many colors when light hits it light lavender tint with many hues. Fast service and very good price.</li>
            <li> Nice lipgloss neutral color</li>
            <li> I ordered The Mystic&#x27;s Shine and got 653-Short Shorts. Which is is a lavender purple. Not iridescent or sparkly at all.</li>
            <li> Love colour riche legloss, own several shades. These are creamy, smooth rich glosses that last fairly long on lips. Non drying and as a bonus they smell and taste yummy, almost a caramel vanilla scent, at least to me.

            <li> Used them in the past Great Product cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> I really like this gloss. It&#x27;s not sticky and has a yummy smell (vanilla? Some sort of baked goody!). It&#x27;s priced better on amazon than stores. And this shade is really unique! It looks purple/silver in the tube but goes on as clear with a pink iridescence in light. I&#x27;m definitely satisfied and plan on trying other shades of these glosses.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of loreal le gloss lip gloss. They smell like vanilla and are not sticky but are long wearing glosses. The mystics shine in particular is pretty on the lips with a pinky purple duo chrome color. This shade is more of a finishing gloss on top of lipsticks because it i really clear with some sparkles but it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> I love this color and it really shines. The name is perfect,Mystic it is. I bought two and gave one to my daughter and she loves it. I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> The exact color I wanted. Goes on easily, stays on for hours and tastes good too. What more could I want?</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me. I have only used the product once. I don&#x27;t think the product is bad it just did not work for me. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Ur typical gloss, but I must agree the color is unusual....it&#x27;s nothing like what u first see in the tube. Bright shiny, adds a splash of color, wears off by the time u get to work. Reapply, reapply... But I don&#x27;t want to look like ur stepping out for the night.</li>
            <li> Really shiny, pearl-like glisten.</li>
            <li> I love this! On my lips there&#x27;s definitely a lavender pearl that have a very pleasant glow! I wear it alone or over a nude lipstick</li>
            <li> I love this lipgloss! It goes with the L&#x27;Oreal Project Runway Limited Edition Lipstick The Mystic&#x27;s Kiss. The lipstick alone is pretty, but when you add the Mystic Shine...it&#x27;s a gorgeous color! I have medium brown skin and the color pops on me. I just ordered another tube!</li>
            <li> WHAT A BEAUTIFUL COLOR! the smell is great and its not to sticky i think im gonna buy myself another one! :D</li>
            <li> I love this color .... Just a little different and can be worn alone or over my regular lipstick to give it a little sparkle !</li>
            <li> This gloss is the bomb! So pretty on my lips! It looks nice over lipstick also. Very sexy!!</li>
            <li> I love this so much. I dropped mine in the street and had to throw away. It is a limited edition color I believe from the holiday last year I got at Rite Aid. When I saw this on Amazon I bought it again and I wasn&#x27;t charged for shipping so I bought 2. I love this lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to be sent to a friend and it arrived already opened and tampered with. My money was refunded but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lip gloss, but it makes my lips feel very dry after it was off.</li>
            <li> The color of this is great! I love the way it looks on...it&#x27;s very bright. If you don&#x27;t like showy color this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> UNDESCRIBABLE BEAUTIFUL LIPGLOSS. A HARD TO FIND ITEM.I AM GLAD I WAS ABLE TO FIND THIS ITEM.THIS IS GREAT STUFF!</li>
