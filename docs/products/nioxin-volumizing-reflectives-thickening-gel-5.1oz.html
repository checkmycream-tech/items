            <li>This stuff is the best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This stuff was the best for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>it kept your hair in perfect shape</li>
            <li>The Thickening Creme is really good as well!</li>
            <li>This is a great product that does what it says on the label, and I have used it for about 8 years.  </li>
            <li>Supposedly this stuff is good for your hair</li>
            <li>This worked really great on my fine hair along with a john Freda thickening mousse I look like I have hair.!</li>
            <li>I have found that styling my hair with a hot hair brush when it is just damp, works best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice because it stays in my hair all day</li>
            <li>Really like this product, have been using it for some time, will continue to use this product, it is great in helping to make your hair appear thicker!</li>
            <li>Good price and easy to buy.</li>
            <li>Love this thickening gel.</li>
            <li>Better than the national brands carried in stores.</li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>I love this thickening gel.</li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Thickening Gel for years and love it.</li>
            <li>This hair gel was ok.</li>
            <li>but I am not so sure about that.</li>
            <li>I like the original formula better</li>
            <li>so my experience was consistent with previous use of the product which was excellent.</li>
            <li>Great when using with dry hair!</li>
            <li>Price was right, too!</li>
            <li>It had a decent smell and was easy to style hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really gives volumen.  </li>
            <li>She says it works very well and continues to order on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Works great - washes out easily with next shampoo - can&#x27;t go wrong with a Nioxin product!  </li>
            <li>I used this product for years, but the new fragrance is intolerable for my asthma and skin allergies.</li>
            <li>Then, use a very wide-toothed comb to gently comb your wet hair after the thickening gel is applied.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found that really makes it appear fuller.</li>
            <li>it was like touching solid stiff glue.</li>
            <li>Then, let it air dry almost completely before trying to style your hair.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not a problem and it works wonders for thin, fine hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have baby-fine hair, and I can not live without this Nioxin thickening gel.  </li>
            <li> Just use a small amount immediately after taking a shower when the hair is wet, and completely rub it through your wet hair.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have that wet hair look that lots of gels have for me.</li>
            <li> As it dries it makes your hair hard to comb through, but once you blow dry and comb it out or set your hair</li>
            <li> This is the new and much worse product with &#x27;Pro Thick&#x27;.</li>
            <li> When I do not use Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Thickening Gel, my hair looks limp.  </li>
            <li> I have used the &#x27;old&#x27; product for a couple of years and unfortunately it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it, it&#x27;s crap compared to the original.</li>
            <li> I hope it works, Been using for past 3 years.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so thick with lots of body.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and after using this gel my hair gets 100% thicker.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to any guys out there with thin hair, but probably not for those with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the company was bought by Proctor and Gamble and production is now in Mexico.</li>
            <li> My wife says that her hair dresser recommended this gel to help thicken her very thin hair.  </li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning terribly for a couple of years.</li>

            <li> This worked really great on my fine hair along with a john Freda thickening mousse I look like I have hair.!</li>
            <li> Love this thickening gel. Helps give my hair extra body. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Better than the national brands carried in stores.</li>
            <li> Great when using with dry hair!</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash my hair. It gives me the body my hair lacks. As it dries it makes your hair hard to comb through, but once you blow dry and comb it out or set your hair that&#x27;s not a problem and it works wonders for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> it is a bit sticky...but it does thicken your hair. Use it sparingly its not like regular hair gel products</li>
            <li> It was not Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Gel.  It was Nioxin Thickening&lt;br /&gt;Gel.  It did not look or perform as the same thing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really gives volumen.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. My hair has been thinning terribly for a couple of years. This is the only product I have found that really makes it appear fuller.</li>
            <li> I used this product for years, but the new fragrance is intolerable for my asthma and skin allergies. :( I had to return my order to Amazon, and scratch Nioxin off my list of tolerable hair products.</li>
            <li> Works great - washes out easily with next shampoo - can&#x27;t go wrong with a Nioxin product!  Price was right, too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thin hair and after using this gel my hair gets 100% thicker. It&#x27;s also nice because it stays in my hair all day and it doesn&#x27;t have that wet hair look that lots of gels have for me. I would recommend to any guys out there with thin hair, but probably not for those with thicker hair. The Thickening Creme is really good as well!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does what it says on the label, and I have used it for about 8 years.  I have baby-fine hair, and I can not live without this Nioxin thickening gel.  Just use a small amount immediately after taking a shower when the hair is wet, and completely rub it through your wet hair.  Then, use a very wide-toothed comb to gently comb your wet hair after the thickening gel is applied.  Then, let it air dry almost completely before trying to style your hair.  I have found that styling my hair with a hot hair brush when it is just damp, works best.  When I do not use Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Thickening Gel, my hair looks limp.  So, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this thickening gel. My hair feels so thick with lots of body. I would definately recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have used the &#x27;old&#x27; product for a couple of years and unfortunately it has been discontinued.This is the new and much worse product with &#x27;Pro Thick&#x27;. I do not recommend it, it&#x27;s crap compared to the original.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Thickening Gel for years and love it. Unfortunately, the company was bought by Proctor and Gamble and production is now in Mexico. And with that change came a change to the formula for the product. It is now Nioxin Thickening Gel with Pro-Thick and it does not work the same way as this thickening gel works. The product that you see here is being discontinued. I will have to find another product with another company that does what Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Thickening Gel does for my hair. This stuff was the best for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> My wife says that her hair dresser recommended this gel to help thicken her very thin hair.  She says it works very well and continues to order on Amazon.  Good price and easy to buy.</li>
            <li> This purchase was to replace current stock...so my experience was consistent with previous use of the product which was excellent.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, have been using it for some time, will continue to use this product, it is great in helping to make your hair appear thicker!</li>
            <li> I like the original formula better</li>
            <li> This hair gel was ok. It had a decent smell and was easy to style hair. My big issue was even thoug it kept your hair in perfect shape it was like touching solid stiff glue. Supposedly this stuff is good for your hair but I am not so sure about that.</li>
