            <li>This stuff smells SOOOO GOOD and makes my hair so soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li>Great product, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>and it keeps them tangle free but not oily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my twist out looks so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazon wins again!</li>
            <li>I originally got this product from my beauty parlor.  </li>
            <li>My original one was Spray</li>
            <li>it is chalk full of silicones which is no bother to me</li>
            <li>Great product, just what I expected!</li>
            <li>I thought it was kind of pricey at first, but I learned that a little goes a LONG way, so I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Greatly reduces friz without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li>Fast deliver!!</li>
            <li>Many people swore by this product but it cause parts of my hair to completely fry off.</li>
            <li>I love the scent but honestly this is no better than the brands that are one quarter of the price.  </li>
            <li>Use it after I dry my hair - smooths fly aways and the hair in general.  </li>
            <li>It has a funny smell though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount, as instructed, for best results.</li>
            <li>It helps keep the healthy look after using a flat iron to straighten hair.</li>
            <li>makes my hair looks healthy without blow dry.</li>
            <li>I love this oil because it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, while I have dry air when it is straight, I can&#x27;t put too much oil because it doesn&#x27;t absorb it and</li>
            <li>I end up using more and more trying to get some shine, and although my hair feels soft and silky, it&#x27;s still dull.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put too much in my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out and wanted something that would really condition the ends and</li>
            <li>try this product it really works</li>
            <li>Would have liked a few directions on product.</li>
            <li>Great product oils and moisturizers dry hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I have the original Brazilian Blowout and was advised to purchase their entire product line to maintain my treatment.</li>
            <li>I have course, super curly hair that needs to be moisturized especially when chemically processed.</li>
            <li>Product protects hair from heat, specially if you use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>have normal to oily hair and do wash my hair every night.</li>
            <li>I notice when I use this product my hair is not oily and it also helps my hair to dry quickly.</li>
            <li>This offers extra protection and makes your hair super soft and reduces fly-aways and increases shine.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair very soft and manageable without that greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and worried this would bother me.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and silky and looks shimmery!</li>
            <li>The oil is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all.</li>
            <li>I went to a salon where they applied this to my hair and my hair felt very soft, silky, and very shiny but for some reason I can&#x27;t get the same results at home</li>
            <li>my second day hair gets very oily when i use conditioner so based on the review i got this as a substitute for conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy-to-curly hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>I do not use a blow dryer because I want to retain the natural look, but my hair puffs out and frizzes after brushing it.</li>
            <li>Made my naturally curly hair feel like straw and frizzy.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have tried the dry oil</li>
            <li>Brazilian Blowout Acai Brazilian Dry Oil worked really well.  </li>
            <li>First time trying the product it left me hair soft for two days.. even when using dry shampoo after.. definitely recomend this product</li>
            <li>not heavy on your hair, definitely does the job.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have to worry about quality since amazon is directly selling it, not a third party.</li>
            <li>not only does my hair feel silky and soft.</li>

            <li> Also protects your hair from curling and flat irons.</li>
            <li> The shine spray and dry oil actually make my hair shiny without any droop.  </li>
            <li> Use after blowdrying b/f flat ironing~hair is like silk!!!</li>
            <li> i have medium long treated hair)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way but makes my hair so soft and silky after I blow dry!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a long time no frizz and silky hair!</li>
            <li> This hair oil is really dry.</li>
            <li> However the lid was loose and some of it drained out in transit.</li>
            <li> I have sections of my hair that are now a couple inches shorter than other parts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This could have just been a fluke thing that happened to my hair as I haven&#x27;t seen other complaints about this, but just be mindful when using their products.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but one or two pumps goes a long way on my two-inches-past-shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair or make them oily.</li>
            <li> These products never let me down!</li>
            <li> You use small amount.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is that I don&#x27;t get the shine and sheen from this one, that I get with other, cheaper brands, but the texture of it is thicker.</li>
            <li> same product and much less expensive than at the salon!</li>
            <li> My hair was in the worst condition I have ever seen it when using these products, constantly losing length on the ends and having it feel like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I find it to be too expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> Stupid me - I thought this was a spray</li>

            <li> I love all Brazilian products!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Much better priced on Amazon than in Salons.</li>
            <li> You use small amount. Great for shine after blowout.</li>
            <li> Bought it to control frizz and maintain my Brazilian Blowout. It&#x27;s excellent, it leaves hair weightless.</li>
            <li> Love the silky feeling</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! It makes your hair very soft and manageable without that greasy feel. It is one of the best oils I have used.</li>
            <li> Great product, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect make your hair silky and elegant</li>
            <li> not heavy on your hair, definitely does the job. I don&#x27;t mind the smell.  Will purchase more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Loved! Fast deliver!!</li>
            <li> Is not oily, just enough to work on ends of hair.</li>
            <li> This dry oil is great! I bought this to add some &amp;#34;silkiness&amp;#34; and shine to my hair between blowout treatments and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try. The bottle is small, but one or two pumps goes a long way on my two-inches-past-shoulder-length hair. The smell is somewhat fruity, but not overpoweringly so. The oil is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all. After I&#x27;ve applied it to my hair, I rub the leftovers on my arms or legs! An added bonus is the price: I paid $17.50 for this on Amazon.com, but it&#x27;s $26.00 on BrazilianBlowout.com! Amazon wins again!</li>
            <li> Leave hair with a good shine. Not oily.  Would have liked a few directions on product. Directions on all products came in without box and a sticky label was stuck to bottle covering directions</li>
            <li> Product is good. However the lid was loose and some of it drained out in transit. Package was oil soaked when it arrived. Good product for humid states (Kentucky  Maryland etc). Greatly reduces friz without weighing hair down. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Many people swore by this product but it cause parts of my hair to completely fry off. I have sections of my hair that are now a couple inches shorter than other parts. I will never get another brazilian blowout or use their products again. My hair was in the worst condition I have ever seen it when using these products, constantly losing length on the ends and having it feel like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could have just been a fluke thing that happened to my hair as I haven&#x27;t seen other complaints about this, but just be mindful when using their products.</li>
            <li> I originally got this product from my beauty parlor.  I loved, but the one I received from Amazon was not the same kind.  My original one was Spray this is it is not.  It seems very different from the one I know.</li>
            <li> same product and much less expensive than at the salon!</li>
            <li> This is perfect. 2 pumps before blow drying or even when I don&#x27;t feel like blow drying and it keeps them tangle free but not oily.&lt;br /&gt;I have normal to oily hair and do wash my hair every night. I can&#x27;t put too much in my hair. This doesn&#x27;t weight down your hair or make them oily. I apply 2 pumps to the ends and work my hands up through the entire hair concentrating on the bottom 2/3s. (reference: i have medium long treated hair)</li>
            <li> Stupid me - I thought this was a spray so imagine my surprise when it arrived and was a pump bottle of serum.  I actually prefer a serum to a spray, so my lack of paying attention worked out well. I love the scent but honestly this is no better than the brands that are one quarter of the price.  What&#x27;s worse is that I don&#x27;t get the shine and sheen from this one, that I get with other, cheaper brands, but the texture of it is thicker. I end up using more and more trying to get some shine, and although my hair feels soft and silky, it&#x27;s still dull.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with all other products</li>
            <li> Best dry oil ever! :)</li>
            <li> It helped with some pf the frizz but I find it to be too expensive for what it does. I went to a salon where they applied this to my hair and my hair felt very soft, silky, and very shiny but for some reason I can&#x27;t get the same results at home</li>
            <li> Great product. Use after blowdrying b/f flat ironing~hair is like silk!!!</li>
            <li> I have the original Brazilian Blowout and was advised to purchase their entire product line to maintain my treatment. I am really impressed with this product line. I have course, super curly hair that needs to be moisturized especially when chemically processed. I have the shampoo, conditioner, masque, anti-frizz leave-in, straightening balm, and dry-oil. This by far is the best line I have found, it was a bit pricey to purchase all of the items, but it was worth it. I love this oil because it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, while I have dry air when it is straight, I can&#x27;t put too much oil because it doesn&#x27;t absorb it and this is a great product as it doesn&#x27;t come out oily and is absorbed well. I LOVE IT! Best I have found.</li>
            <li> I love the BB product line. This was the first time I have tried the dry oil and it is wonderful. Pleasant smell without being overpowering and not greasy. Adds extra shine and manageability.</li>
            <li> It awesome to use will buy it again</li>
            <li> Love this product! It doesn&#x27;t make the hair look greasy. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Brazilian Blowout Acai Brazilian Dry Oil worked really well.  I notice when I use this product my hair is not oily and it also helps my hair to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Great smell and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME...!</li>
            <li> The very best dry oil ever</li>
            <li> Love it. First time trying the product it left me hair soft for two days.. even when using dry shampoo after.. definitely recomend this product</li>
            <li> This hair oil is really dry. my second day hair gets very oily when i use conditioner so based on the review i got this as a substitute for conditioner. it works amazingly. but u need to give it a minute to do its magic. definitely buying again. i don&#x27;t have to worry about quality since amazon is directly selling it, not a third party.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells SOOOO GOOD and makes my hair so soft and shiny!! I thought it was kind of pricey at first, but I learned that a little goes a LONG way, so I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product line.  I use it after I have already put several drops of Argan oil in my damp hair.  This offers extra protection and makes your hair super soft and reduces fly-aways and increases shine.</li>
            <li> Product protects hair from heat, specially if you use a flat iron. It has a funny smell though.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> These products never let me down! Any one I try I like</li>
            <li> This arrived in my curlbox and to my surprise of all the products I received this is at the top of the list! I have 4a and b hair scattered through my head and this stuff is what I need! it is chalk full of silicones which is no bother to me but it makes my hair feel so silky!! its like butter! I luuahhhhhhveeeeeeeee it!!!! my hair literally feels like silk. I used it to seal with some leave in conditioner and my hair is thanking me for it. not only does my hair feel silky and soft. it has a nice luster to it. my twist out looks so silky and smooth. the smell is amazing and I definitely recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I don&#x27;t do any Brazilian blowouts or keretain treatments this product was sent to me by a subscription service</li>
            <li> Love it! It helps keep the healthy look after using a flat iron to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> This  Product Helps the frizzies. I don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! A little goes a long way but makes my hair so soft and silky after I blow dry!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair oil ðŸ’—</li>
            <li> Great product oils and moisturizers dry hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes my hair feel soft and silky and looks shimmery!</li>
            <li> I LOVE The product,  but....the cap was not secured and it leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this product, smells great</li>
            <li> This keeps the frizzy out of my hair without making it too oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Brazilian Blowout shampoo, conditioner and serum for the last 2 1/2 years (I get my hair straightened twice a year).  I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out and wanted something that would really condition the ends and the dry oil was perfect. I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and worried this would bother me. The smell is pleasant but vanishes quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference using this. No shine to my hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for taming frizzy naturally curly hair.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am now a Brazilian Blowout product fan.  I have naturally wavy-to-curly hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length.  I do not use a blow dryer because I want to retain the natural look, but my hair puffs out and frizzes after brushing it. After spending a LOT on many brands of styling, glossing, de-frizzing, conditioning, etc., products, I found this and it works!  My hair stylist applied the Protective Gel and I was impressed -- my hair had more body and the curls were well defined. The shine spray and dry oil actually make my hair shiny without any droop.  You only need a small amount, as instructed, for best results.</li>
            <li> so easy to use.... Love how it looks...and feels and SMELLS....</li>
            <li> Works wonderful! Ive been using this product for a long time no frizz and silky hair!</li>
            <li> Great product, just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It helps a lot when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> 5 star love it! love it! love it! makes my hair looks healthy without blow dry. try this product it really works</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Use it after I dry my hair - smooths fly aways and the hair in general.  Does not make your hair oily or anything like that.  Also protects your hair from curling and flat irons.</li>
            <li> Made my naturally curly hair feel like straw and frizzy.</li>
