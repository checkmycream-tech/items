            <li>That said, good product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like they do a good job of cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job of exfoliating over time as well.</li>
            <li>and she loved it too and ran out and bought them.</li>
            <li>these are good face wipes and dont leave a lot of residue.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin, but not all wipes do this to me.  </li>
            <li>They are also a good size wipe and not flimsy to where they fall apart with a bit of pressure.  </li>
            <li>They do have a nice fragrance and do contain some very nice ingredients.</li>

            <li>just love those!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>The carrot variety is pretty wonderful as well.</li>
            <li>They smell lovely (a mix of blueberries &amp; lemon), cleanse my face well, and leave my skin glowy and moisturized (but not oily!).</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love them too!</li>
            <li>First off they smell wonderful (not overpowering floral or blueberry scent).  </li>
            <li>I just love these towelettes!  </li>
            <li>Smells great, so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, just wish more came in the package.</li>
            <li>They moisturize nicely, too.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and leaves your skin with a glow, doesn&#x27;t clean all that great</li>
            <li>towlettes are great when you aren&#x27;t in the bath but want to clean up a bit&lt;br /&gt;evens</li>
            <li>they smell great and clean well without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>These wipes have a delightful smell and leave my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>But this -- so easy!     </li>
            <li>They smell good, and leave your face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>These are okay -- nothing amazing and not all that refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bright, kinda fruity, kinda candy-y smell, without being too sweet or cloying.</li>
            <li>These are great to use for traveling or when  you need something quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell which is kind of citrusy, and while strong it dissipates after about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The YES company quickly sent me an email to see if I liked the product so that was nice.</li>
            <li>these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure they \\&quot;refresh\\</li>
            <li>will buy some again for sure, and I recommend these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love to use these when I don&#x27;t have time (</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no need to rinse afterwards, and it makes your skin glow with its naturally refreshing ingredients.  </li>
            <li>also love using this product because I&#x27;m always on the go.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>love this brand-</li>
            <li>is glowing:)</li>
            <li>tried the grapefruit and also love:)</li>
            <li>I bought these because I ran out of my yes to cucumbers ones which I love.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, and love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>They are very convenient and do a great job removing the dirt, grime, and make-up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it&#x27;d take eye make up off better.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried many, many products)</li>
            <li>I was just so upset about this because I had brought the 60% more package</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s refreshing after working out.</li>
            <li>They have a delicious fragrance, like lemon blueberry muffin batter (nom nom), which is a definite selling point for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This was just ok.</li>
            <li>I will not purchase any more or recommend these.</li>
            <li>If you are not removing makeup, the towlettes would be okay.</li>
            <li>I just wished they performed better.</li>
            <li>They smell more like cleaner than like a refreshing face wipe.</li>
            <li>These wipes smell wonderful, but they also leave my face blotchy red.  </li>
            <li>love these cleansing towlettes.  </li>
            <li>suggest, if you use lots of waterproof makeup like me, to focus a bit more time on your eyes with these.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand of products.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way my skin feels after I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>My face is softer and seems to have more of a glow to is</li>
            <li>I also love the autoship feature</li>
            <li>I found that my skin looks more radiant when I use these.</li>
            <li>They have a pleasant smell (though not what I would label &amp;#34;blueberry&amp;#34;) and seem to work as well as the Olay.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face clean and it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Which makes it a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>good thing i decided to try the travel size first.</li>
            <li>They are cool and refreshing, I love how they feel on my skin and they amke my skin look bright and fresh</li>
            <li>This towelette managed to get his face clean in about a minute!</li>
            <li>It smells more like lemon poppyseed muffins, not blueberries (not that important).</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheaper and I enjoy the smell a lot more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the claims that they make about refreshing your age but convenience-wise, they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Skin is noticeably clearer and softer after use and most importantly the effect lasts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quick, easy, and actually very refreshing to use these--</li>
            <li>Wipes off makeup easily and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like a lot of others do.</li>
            <li>Easy to rinse off</li>
            <li>The toilette allows you to easily do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried one on my face and it sure didn&#x27;t even give my face the fresh feeling most towlettes leaves.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so easy to use them before bedtime.  </li>
            <li>So if you like natural products, a refreshing feel, and the fact that these do a good job removing makeup then give these a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong</li>
            <li>They feel VERY refreshing, day or night and take makeup off very well.</li>
            <li>What I liked best is, because I have oily skin, sometimes I want to wash my face in the middle of the day and either not mess up my hair, or leave on my eye make-up.  </li>
            <li>but when I smell my clothes they smell fine.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job removing make-up and eye make-up.  </li>
            <li>skin tone and keeps your face smooth and fresh&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the ease of having a quick towlette at night to clean my face and then to be able to pitch it.</li>
            <li>So for people who do not wear much makeup, these would be wonderful and I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li>These towlettes are very convenient, clean well, remove most of the make-up, and smell yummy!</li>
            <li>Apparently, they got rated very highly on make-up removal but what I found was that it wasn&#x27;t very good at removing make-up at all.  </li>
            <li>&quot; but they clean my face really nicely at the end of the day, without drying things out too much, like a lot of this sort of wipes.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try these out after hearing all the buzz.</li>
            <li>In that case, use a cleaning product for make-up, and finish with these things, it will let your skin clean with a yummy smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If it can clean his face it can clean almost anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Skin feels supple and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>i like the smell a lot and feel clean after using.</li>
            <li>the cloth is a nice sized face cloth, its very soft.</li>
            <li>I wear quite a bit of eye make up usually, and this does a great job of getting it all off (better than washing my face does).</li>
            <li>keep these next to my bed to use every night and now have an Amazon auto purchase set for these because I think these are that amazing and such a great addition to my life.</li>
            <li>I use 2 wipes each night to make sure all my make-up is off, and when I wake up in the morning I really do notice an improvement in my skin each day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They remove makeup (even mascara) easily and gently, and they leave my face feeling smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>i would like but other than that they are great.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little too strong for me, but they&#x27;re the best option I&#x27;ve found for natural towlettes.</li>
            <li>This product has such a nice, light fragrance and the cloths hold up well.  </li>
            <li>If you just do a quick wipe you may look like a racoon in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Love them, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for using on the go, or if you are feeling lazy about washing your face - I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have used these for many years and not only do I love this brand but these towlettes clean your face and make it feel very refreshed every time.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature of this product is the plastic cap closure, which keeps the product from drying out and is easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>Very good for african american skin.</li>
            <li>They really leave my skin tingly and smooth</li>
            <li>They smell fresh and do not irritate my ultra-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about it</li>
            <li>recommend these for anyone who is short on time but still wants to take good care of their face.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Oil of Olay wipes and those are far better at conditioning my skin and improving the look and feel of it.</li>
            <li>This set has both the package seal and a plastic &amp;#34;box-type&amp;#34; seal and that keeps them fresh.  </li>
            <li>I wake up with a nice clean face and no new pimples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>they take off makeup effectively (even waterproof mascara and eyeliner), and it leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth with no soapy residue or that too tight feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about these facial wipes because they were featured in the Self Top Beauty Product Awards.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product so much because it is cruelty-free and natural.  </li>
            <li>Overall, good product but not if you&#x27;re too sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to really do anything for my skin, other than make it smell good for about two minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is better to remove the make-up on the eyes with a specific product for the eyes, and then finish the rest of the face with these.</li>
            <li>I bought these in a travel-sized package (8 wipes) to try, and I really, really like them!</li>
            <li>So much so that I&#x27;m writing a review, in hopes that you&#x27;ll buy and like them too!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for traveling, keeping in your car to use after the gym, or just to keep in your nightstand for those lazy nights when you don&#x27;t feel like going through the whole face-washing-routine.</li>
            <li>It does remove makeup pretty well though it is pretty drying.</li>
            <li>First product I&#x27;ve ever used and my skin has reacted this way.</li>
            <li>I would have rated this product higher except that it is deceptively advertised.</li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>One towlette does the whole body!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of these.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend saw these in Target one day and thought they were funny, so I tried them out.</li>
            <li>Awesome cloth with faint fruity smell that prevents breakout.</li>
            <li>so the first couple of days I&#x27;m thinking to myself, WHY?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin gets really clean and not dried out.</li>
            <li>face feels clean and soft- removes my eye make-up and skin</li>
            <li>Good enough that they do not need to use deceptive practices like showing you two products when you are only purchasing one.</li>
            <li>They actually smell like Fruit Loops to me, which is a rather nice scent to have right up next to your nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even wipe my hair down with them at night before bed and it gives me such a refreshing feeling!!</li>
            <li>I bet some people won&#x27;t like the scent, but I really dig it.     </li>
            <li>I really like these towelettes.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m rabid about really cleaning the makeup off my skin at night and in the morning.  </li>
            <li>They also take off makeup really well.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend them!</li>
            <li>It burned and I was very blotchy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They do, however, deliver in terms of being very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that they cleanse very well</li>
            <li>i much prefer the $3 e.l.f.</li>
            <li>These really seem to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe it very well because it&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve smelled before, but it&#x27;s a chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found they don&#x27;t remove my mascara very well though.</li>
            <li>There is no way I am going to get up and do a bazillion-step routine when I am about ready to drop off to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>, they are gentle but remove makeup well.  </li>
            <li>Looking at everything in Walmart, this seemed like the only product that was mostly natural, and seemed safe for pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are quite pleasant to use and they don&#x27;t leave a thick film on your face like I have experienced with other wipes.</li>
            <li>I am usually hesitant about using new products and these do seem to be great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great at taking off my makeup without leaving my face feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li>With the \\&quot;blueberries and lemon peel\\&quot; you would think the towelettes smell wonderful, but instead, the mixture of the 2 fruits provides a very weird fragrance to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; your face with.</li>
            <li>but its too sweet smelling, and left on the bathroom counter, it attacted ants!</li>
            <li>I mainly use  them to remove mascara</li>
            <li>but it cleans good enough, besides I think its because it doesnt have harsh ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a dozen different facial wipes, and these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I did give the product 3 stars because I felt they would do a decent job cleansing if you weren&#x27;t wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>wish I could get them locally, but amazon always delivers quickly.</li>
            <li>They leave my skin clean and soft, not dry at all.  </li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re made with gentle and natural ingredients, and aren&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li>They are very moisturizing and have helped clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised to see that my skin tolerated these very well.  </li>
            <li>First off, the towlettes are barely saturated.</li>
            <li>However, this no longer occurs, and I figure my skin just needed time to adjust to a new routine.</li>
            <li>but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>Oh well, , live and learn</li>
            <li>I have been much happier with Boots No. 7 wipes - so much that I didn&#x27;t finish this package - just went back to my Boots wipes after 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m tired after a long day or when I&#x27;m running late for work, this wonderful product saves me time and allows me to clean and moisturize my face in a few refreshing swipes.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My nose is very sensitive so these are not going to work.</li>
            <li>WOW the price!</li>
            <li>I have used other products also and love them just the same.</li>
            <li>Most places carry them at $8 for a 30-count pkg., so I&#x27;m going to do the subscribe and save option through Amazon to save a few dollars!</li>
            <li>First off, I am sending these back because the smell is aweful.</li>
            <li>But my face turned a hot, red color.</li>
            <li>They keep my sensitive and oily face from breakouts!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a little too strong</li>
            <li>cloths are wide enough to cover your face like a cotton face towel and with a bit of rubbing, you walk away with refreshed clean skin!  </li>
            <li>Not terrible, but I&#x27;ll opt for a different brand of refresh towlettes on my next long trip.</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea, my skin is clear, and it doesn&#x27;t feel over-stripped or sticky.  </li>
            <li>They make my skin feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I like to use natural skin products and this one works and fills the bill.</li>
            <li>however, these are 99% natural, paraben-free, biodegradable, and SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>and it was 99% natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know why they got an award only because one of the categories they have to be rated on is how well it removes make-up.  </li>
            <li>Skin felt plump and moisturized, soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I have slightly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And I have sensitive, oily skin</li>
            <li>The package is lovely because it has both a solid flap AND a sticky tab, so that the towlettes don&#x27;t get dried out before you can use them.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.</li>
            <li>I saw this product in so many magazines and decided to try them as you receive a larger package for the same price as other wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are great but too expensive!</li>
            <li>Generally, I do try to drag myself to the washroom and wash my face with a \\&quot;proper\\&quot; cleanser even after using any kind of wipes, but I&#x27;ve gone to bed without on quite a few nights and these seem to do the job well of getting rid of makeup on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but, I encourage you to give it a try, and you may be pleasantly surprised that the right product does not need to be super-thick or dripping wet to get the job done!</li>
            <li>They clean without being heavy or feel in like you cleaned with oil.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product knowing the Yes product line.</li>
            <li>but, that is not really why I bought them in the first place.</li>
            <li>Really now when it is the only one of their products of facial clensing wipes that portrays two packages one may be lead to believe that they are in fact purchasing 2 packages.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and recently learned that I have rosacea.  </li>
            <li>and no other product has come close to comparing to it.</li>
            <li>I think it has some good-for-skin ingredients (and a higher price) compared to some other towelettes.</li>
            <li>First off, they&#x27;re pricier than what I&#x27;d normally pay for a cleansing towelette - I usually buy Ponds or</li>
            <li>The towlettes barely removed my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>These wipes are the complete opposite.  </li>
            <li>These are the only ones I have found that are completely biodegradeable</li>
            <li>The first couple of nights after using the towlettes, the skin around my eyes burned ever so slightly.</li>
            <li>I can just pull out one of these less harmful wipes and clean my face in a minute without having to pull my hair back and get my face all wet and soapy.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my face feels softer, tighter and I haven&#x27;t had anywhere near as much acne as I would usually get during that time of the month.</li>
            <li>These cost half as much at Target.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as wet, thick, or big as other brands I used, but they work quite nicely anyway.</li>
            <li>These little wipes work really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the little plastic door on the bag -- I&#x27;ve found that ones that just use a sticker to close never work.</li>

            <li> The carrot variety is pretty wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> They smell lovely (a mix of blueberries &amp; lemon), cleanse my face well, and leave my skin glowy and moisturized (but not oily!).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love them too!</li>

            <li> towlettes are great when you aren&#x27;t in the bath but want to clean up a bit&lt;br /&gt;evens</li>
            <li> they smell great and clean well without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> These wipes have a delightful smell and leave my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> But this -- so easy!     </li>
            <li> They smell good, and leave your face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> These are okay -- nothing amazing and not all that refreshing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bright, kinda fruity, kinda candy-y smell, without being too sweet or cloying.</li>
            <li> These are great to use for traveling or when  you need something quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell which is kind of citrusy, and while strong it dissipates after about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The YES company quickly sent me an email to see if I liked the product so that was nice.</li>
            <li> these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure they \\&quot;refresh\\</li>
            <li> will buy some again for sure, and I recommend these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love to use these when I don&#x27;t have time (</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no need to rinse afterwards, and it makes your skin glow with its naturally refreshing ingredients.  </li>
            <li> also love using this product because I&#x27;m always on the go.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> love this brand-</li>
            <li> is glowing:)</li>
            <li> tried the grapefruit and also love:)</li>
            <li> I bought these because I ran out of my yes to cucumbers ones which I love.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, and love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> They are very convenient and do a great job removing the dirt, grime, and make-up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it&#x27;d take eye make up off better.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried many, many products)</li>
            <li> I was just so upset about this because I had brought the 60% more package</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s refreshing after working out.</li>
            <li> They have a delicious fragrance, like lemon blueberry muffin batter (nom nom), which is a definite selling point for me.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This was just ok.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase any more or recommend these.</li>
            <li> If you are not removing makeup, the towlettes would be okay.</li>
            <li> I just wished they performed better.</li>
            <li> They smell more like cleaner than like a refreshing face wipe.</li>
            <li> These wipes smell wonderful, but they also leave my face blotchy red.  </li>
            <li> love these cleansing towlettes.  </li>
            <li> suggest, if you use lots of waterproof makeup like me, to focus a bit more time on your eyes with these.  </li>
            <li> I love this brand of products.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way my skin feels after I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> My face is softer and seems to have more of a glow to is</li>
            <li> I also love the autoship feature</li>
            <li> I found that my skin looks more radiant when I use these.</li>
            <li> They have a pleasant smell (though not what I would label &amp;#34;blueberry&amp;#34;) and seem to work as well as the Olay.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face clean and it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Which makes it a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> good thing i decided to try the travel size first.</li>
            <li> They are cool and refreshing, I love how they feel on my skin and they amke my skin look bright and fresh</li>
            <li> This towelette managed to get his face clean in about a minute!</li>
            <li> It smells more like lemon poppyseed muffins, not blueberries (not that important).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheaper and I enjoy the smell a lot more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the claims that they make about refreshing your age but convenience-wise, they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Skin is noticeably clearer and softer after use and most importantly the effect lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quick, easy, and actually very refreshing to use these--</li>
            <li> Wipes off makeup easily and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like a lot of others do.</li>
            <li> Easy to rinse off</li>
            <li> The toilette allows you to easily do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried one on my face and it sure didn&#x27;t even give my face the fresh feeling most towlettes leaves.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so easy to use them before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> So if you like natural products, a refreshing feel, and the fact that these do a good job removing makeup then give these a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong</li>
            <li> They feel VERY refreshing, day or night and take makeup off very well.</li>
            <li> What I liked best is, because I have oily skin, sometimes I want to wash my face in the middle of the day and either not mess up my hair, or leave on my eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> but when I smell my clothes they smell fine.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job removing make-up and eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> skin tone and keeps your face smooth and fresh&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the ease of having a quick towlette at night to clean my face and then to be able to pitch it.</li>
            <li> So for people who do not wear much makeup, these would be wonderful and I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> These towlettes are very convenient, clean well, remove most of the make-up, and smell yummy!</li>
            <li> Apparently, they got rated very highly on make-up removal but what I found was that it wasn&#x27;t very good at removing make-up at all.  </li>
            <li> &quot; but they clean my face really nicely at the end of the day, without drying things out too much, like a lot of this sort of wipes.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these out after hearing all the buzz.</li>
            <li> In that case, use a cleaning product for make-up, and finish with these things, it will let your skin clean with a yummy smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If it can clean his face it can clean almost anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Skin feels supple and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> i like the smell a lot and feel clean after using.</li>
            <li> the cloth is a nice sized face cloth, its very soft.</li>
            <li> I wear quite a bit of eye make up usually, and this does a great job of getting it all off (better than washing my face does).</li>
            <li> keep these next to my bed to use every night and now have an Amazon auto purchase set for these because I think these are that amazing and such a great addition to my life.</li>
            <li> I use 2 wipes each night to make sure all my make-up is off, and when I wake up in the morning I really do notice an improvement in my skin each day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They remove makeup (even mascara) easily and gently, and they leave my face feeling smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li> i would like but other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little too strong for me, but they&#x27;re the best option I&#x27;ve found for natural towlettes.</li>
            <li> This product has such a nice, light fragrance and the cloths hold up well.  </li>
            <li> If you just do a quick wipe you may look like a racoon in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Love them, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for using on the go, or if you are feeling lazy about washing your face - I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used these for many years and not only do I love this brand but these towlettes clean your face and make it feel very refreshed every time.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature of this product is the plastic cap closure, which keeps the product from drying out and is easy to open and close.</li>
            <li> Very good for african american skin.</li>
            <li> They really leave my skin tingly and smooth</li>
            <li> They smell fresh and do not irritate my ultra-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about it</li>
            <li> recommend these for anyone who is short on time but still wants to take good care of their face.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oil of Olay wipes and those are far better at conditioning my skin and improving the look and feel of it.</li>
            <li> This set has both the package seal and a plastic &amp;#34;box-type&amp;#34; seal and that keeps them fresh.  </li>
            <li> I wake up with a nice clean face and no new pimples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they take off makeup effectively (even waterproof mascara and eyeliner), and it leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth with no soapy residue or that too tight feeling.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited about these facial wipes because they were featured in the Self Top Beauty Product Awards.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product so much because it is cruelty-free and natural.  </li>
            <li> Overall, good product but not if you&#x27;re too sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to really do anything for my skin, other than make it smell good for about two minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is better to remove the make-up on the eyes with a specific product for the eyes, and then finish the rest of the face with these.</li>
            <li> I bought these in a travel-sized package (8 wipes) to try, and I really, really like them!</li>
            <li> So much so that I&#x27;m writing a review, in hopes that you&#x27;ll buy and like them too!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for traveling, keeping in your car to use after the gym, or just to keep in your nightstand for those lazy nights when you don&#x27;t feel like going through the whole face-washing-routine.</li>
            <li> It does remove makeup pretty well though it is pretty drying.</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve ever used and my skin has reacted this way.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this product higher except that it is deceptively advertised.</li>
            <li> They leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> One towlette does the whole body!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of these.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend saw these in Target one day and thought they were funny, so I tried them out.</li>
            <li> Awesome cloth with faint fruity smell that prevents breakout.</li>
            <li> so the first couple of days I&#x27;m thinking to myself, WHY?</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin gets really clean and not dried out.</li>
            <li> face feels clean and soft- removes my eye make-up and skin</li>
            <li> Good enough that they do not need to use deceptive practices like showing you two products when you are only purchasing one.</li>
            <li> They actually smell like Fruit Loops to me, which is a rather nice scent to have right up next to your nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even wipe my hair down with them at night before bed and it gives me such a refreshing feeling!!</li>
            <li> I bet some people won&#x27;t like the scent, but I really dig it.     </li>
            <li> I really like these towelettes.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m rabid about really cleaning the makeup off my skin at night and in the morning.  </li>
            <li> They also take off makeup really well.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend them!</li>
            <li> It burned and I was very blotchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They do, however, deliver in terms of being very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that they cleanse very well</li>
            <li> i much prefer the $3 e.l.f.</li>
            <li> These really seem to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe it very well because it&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve smelled before, but it&#x27;s a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found they don&#x27;t remove my mascara very well though.</li>
            <li> There is no way I am going to get up and do a bazillion-step routine when I am about ready to drop off to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> , they are gentle but remove makeup well.  </li>
            <li> Looking at everything in Walmart, this seemed like the only product that was mostly natural, and seemed safe for pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are quite pleasant to use and they don&#x27;t leave a thick film on your face like I have experienced with other wipes.</li>
            <li> I am usually hesitant about using new products and these do seem to be great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great at taking off my makeup without leaving my face feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> With the \\&quot;blueberries and lemon peel\\&quot; you would think the towelettes smell wonderful, but instead, the mixture of the 2 fruits provides a very weird fragrance to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; your face with.</li>
            <li> but its too sweet smelling, and left on the bathroom counter, it attacted ants!</li>
            <li> I mainly use  them to remove mascara</li>
            <li> but it cleans good enough, besides I think its because it doesnt have harsh ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a dozen different facial wipes, and these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I did give the product 3 stars because I felt they would do a decent job cleansing if you weren&#x27;t wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> wish I could get them locally, but amazon always delivers quickly.</li>
            <li> They leave my skin clean and soft, not dry at all.  </li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re made with gentle and natural ingredients, and aren&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li> They are very moisturizing and have helped clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised to see that my skin tolerated these very well.  </li>
            <li> First off, the towlettes are barely saturated.</li>
            <li> However, this no longer occurs, and I figure my skin just needed time to adjust to a new routine.</li>
            <li> but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> Oh well, , live and learn</li>
            <li> I have been much happier with Boots No. 7 wipes - so much that I didn&#x27;t finish this package - just went back to my Boots wipes after 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m tired after a long day or when I&#x27;m running late for work, this wonderful product saves me time and allows me to clean and moisturize my face in a few refreshing swipes.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My nose is very sensitive so these are not going to work.</li>
            <li> WOW the price!</li>
            <li> I have used other products also and love them just the same.</li>
            <li> Most places carry them at $8 for a 30-count pkg., so I&#x27;m going to do the subscribe and save option through Amazon to save a few dollars!</li>
            <li> First off, I am sending these back because the smell is aweful.</li>
            <li> But my face turned a hot, red color.</li>
            <li> They keep my sensitive and oily face from breakouts!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little too strong</li>
            <li> cloths are wide enough to cover your face like a cotton face towel and with a bit of rubbing, you walk away with refreshed clean skin!  </li>
            <li> Not terrible, but I&#x27;ll opt for a different brand of refresh towlettes on my next long trip.</li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea, my skin is clear, and it doesn&#x27;t feel over-stripped or sticky.  </li>
            <li> They make my skin feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I like to use natural skin products and this one works and fills the bill.</li>
            <li> however, these are 99% natural, paraben-free, biodegradable, and SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> and it was 99% natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know why they got an award only because one of the categories they have to be rated on is how well it removes make-up.  </li>
            <li> Skin felt plump and moisturized, soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And I have sensitive, oily skin</li>
            <li> The package is lovely because it has both a solid flap AND a sticky tab, so that the towlettes don&#x27;t get dried out before you can use them.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in so many magazines and decided to try them as you receive a larger package for the same price as other wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are great but too expensive!</li>
            <li> Generally, I do try to drag myself to the washroom and wash my face with a \\&quot;proper\\&quot; cleanser even after using any kind of wipes, but I&#x27;ve gone to bed without on quite a few nights and these seem to do the job well of getting rid of makeup on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, I encourage you to give it a try, and you may be pleasantly surprised that the right product does not need to be super-thick or dripping wet to get the job done!</li>
            <li> They clean without being heavy or feel in like you cleaned with oil.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product knowing the Yes product line.</li>
            <li> but, that is not really why I bought them in the first place.</li>
            <li> Really now when it is the only one of their products of facial clensing wipes that portrays two packages one may be lead to believe that they are in fact purchasing 2 packages.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and recently learned that I have rosacea.  </li>
            <li> and no other product has come close to comparing to it.</li>
            <li> I think it has some good-for-skin ingredients (and a higher price) compared to some other towelettes.</li>
            <li> First off, they&#x27;re pricier than what I&#x27;d normally pay for a cleansing towelette - I usually buy Ponds or</li>
            <li> The towlettes barely removed my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> These wipes are the complete opposite.  </li>
            <li> These are the only ones I have found that are completely biodegradeable</li>
            <li> The first couple of nights after using the towlettes, the skin around my eyes burned ever so slightly.</li>
            <li> I can just pull out one of these less harmful wipes and clean my face in a minute without having to pull my hair back and get my face all wet and soapy.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my face feels softer, tighter and I haven&#x27;t had anywhere near as much acne as I would usually get during that time of the month.</li>
            <li> These cost half as much at Target.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as wet, thick, or big as other brands I used, but they work quite nicely anyway.</li>
            <li> These little wipes work really well.</li>
            <li> I really like the little plastic door on the bag -- I&#x27;ve found that ones that just use a sticker to close never work.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry skin, but after using one of these I don&#x27;t even require extra</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so convenient when you&#x27;re in a rush, or you&#x27;re just too tired at the end of a long day for a full</li>
            <li> Most towlettes have that annoying \\&quot;restickable\\&quot; adhesive lid that never really resticks after the first use.</li>
            <li> They fail in terms of make-up removal but they highly deliver in moisturizing your skin and also not irritating your skin.  </li>
            <li> My acne has been really severe lately because of my pregnancy and all the products the dermatologist gave me just aren&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> So I have been using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order something else other than try these products again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too worried to try any of the other Say Yes products because I don&#x27;t want the same reaction.</li>
            <li> This works similar to other towelettes.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects!</li>
            <li> My skin was moist after using but they were a bit dry.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry out my skin, leave a film, or cause breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using these.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> The smell is not my favorite, sort of a mix of blueberry and lemon, however it is not at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My dry areas are no longer dry and my oily areas are no longer oily!</li>
            <li> They stay moist down to the very last cloth</li>
            <li> I personally can&#x27;t stand the smell of these and when combined with my face lotion it stung a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have bought these a few times and may repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I did not really like the smell of this.</li>
            <li> Also, this seemed to leave a clingy feeling on my skin like a thin film of something on my face (not visible) afterward which I did not like too much.</li>
            <li> These towlettes easily remove my foundation and my mascara, without that awful soapy feeling that most other brands of towlettes leave behind.</li>
            <li> I guess these just are not good for my sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any problems with any other face wipes except for these.</li>
            <li> Aside from the weird smell, it does wipe off end of day make up pretty well with one or 2 towelettes.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t make removing making any easier than just water and any other cloth.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Olay facial cloths but decided to try these because I like the smell of blueberry.  </li>
            <li> I was interested in buying makeup removing wipes because sometimes I&#x27;m too tired and lazy to wash my face before bed.</li>
            <li> In fact, they have an advantage in that the packaging keeps them sealed and moist -- with the Olay ones after using a few of the cloths, the seal won&#x27;t stay on and the rest of them quickly dry out.  </li>
            <li> I recently started working a late night shift, and let my face-washing routine go out the window on those nights</li>
            <li> I found these towlettes at Wal-Mart and decided that at least I could use these, if I could not muster the energy to go through a proper wash.</li>
            <li> I will warn those that prefer towlettes soaked in fluid, or really thick wipes, that this may not be the product for you...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for over a year and refuse to use any other cleansing wipes now!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to people with sensitive skin because I could see them being a little irritating.</li>
            <li> If you use other skincare that contain those things however, I&#x27;d save a few dollars and get a cheaper product.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t keep a towlette a whole night, because the smell turns really badly after several hours.</li>
            <li> Plus they cost less than that in the store.</li>
            <li> And my towels have a plastic lid to keep in moisture and these were so dry, it rub way to hard on my face.</li>
            <li> Because they are pre-moistened, you get what you get on the wipes and each one seemed a little dryer than it should have been (in terms of a pre-moistened cloth).</li>
            <li> His pale skin is almost black when he comes home.</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin, with a few acne blemishes that spring up from time to time.</li>
            <li> Speaking of oil I don&#x27;t get that oily stuff a few hour afterwards.</li>
            <li> I got these completely dried out and they don&#x27;t remove my makeup like the yes to cucumber ones</li>
            <li> I want to try the cucumber or the carrots, but I wish I could smell them before I waste the money.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s almond oil in the ingredients and that could easily give some with bad allergies a rash!</li>
            <li> Little pricy, I always look for a sale!</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m too lazy) to thoroughly wash my face.</li>
            <li> They do remove makeup, but I usually use an eye makeup remover in addition to this.</li>
            <li> I use towelettes because I am lazy</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would get rid of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if you can just use wipes and then walk away without rinsing</li>
            <li> I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a defective package, not sure.</li>
            <li> Should have read the small print.  </li>
            <li> I use one wipe to remove everything and the issue I usually have with wipes</li>
            <li> I use cloths when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time for my usual cleansing routine.  </li>
            <li> But now that I have used them for about a week everyday I understand!</li>
            <li> These are very soft and left my face feeling moisturized, but the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> I got home from work so late.</li>
            <li> So, I only use these wipes at the end of day, and cold rinse my face afterwards.</li>
            <li> I can not attest to the brightening effect of the towlettes as the manufacturer claims, so the results may be so subtle I did not notice...</li>
            <li> vaguely like blueberries, but oddly chemical-like.  </li>
            <li> They smell just like blueberries and do seem to have a subtle brightening effect.</li>
            <li> Unless you want to scrub your face and cause unnecessary damage and inflammation, these wipes are NOT good at removing make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Non irritating, takes off makeup (except eye makeup).</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than when THAT happens!&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the towelettes are really thin and smell weird....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a secret beauty care gem!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel guilty throwing them in the trash.</li>
            <li> disappointing that they don&#x27;t remove make-up up</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about these.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> My face stinks!</li>
            <li> i actually hate them.</li>
            <li> The smell is very, very terrible like spoiled berries with chemicals.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My face never breaks out, but when using these wipes, I immediately had red bumps all over my face. After using the wipe, my face started to burn, as well. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with any other face wipes except for these.</li>
            <li> these are my favorite.  I buy them over and over.  They really leave my skin tingly and smooth</li>
            <li> These little wipes work really well. They&#x27;re not as wet, thick, or big as other brands I used, but they work quite nicely anyway. I really like the little plastic door on the bag -- I&#x27;ve found that ones that just use a sticker to close never work. But this -- so easy!     They smell great, too. I can&#x27;t quite place it. It&#x27;s a bright, kinda fruity, kinda candy-y smell, without being too sweet or cloying. I bet some people won&#x27;t like the scent, but I really dig it.     I&#x27;m not quite sure they \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; my \\&quot;age,\\&quot; but they clean my face really nicely at the end of the day, without drying things out too much, like a lot of this sort of wipes. I feel wasteful throwing them out every day, though.     Love them, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product on a celebrity&#x27;s skin care blog, and having amazon points to use, I decided to try it out. With the \\&quot;blueberries and lemon peel\\&quot; you would think the towelettes smell wonderful, but instead, the mixture of the 2 fruits provides a very weird fragrance to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; your face with. Aside from the weird smell, it does wipe off end of day make up pretty well with one or 2 towelettes. It is very gentle on the skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either. I bought 2 packs, and I will continue to use them until they&#x27;re gone, but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are perfect for my skin. They are cool and refreshing, I love how they feel on my skin and they amke my skin look bright and fresh</li>
            <li> The towlettes are just great.  I use them each morning and every night.  They make my skin feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I really like these towelettes. They smell fresh and do not irritate my ultra-sensitive skin. I mainly use  them to remove mascara and they do that well. Little pricy, I always look for a sale!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say on the page here but there&#x27;s almond oil in the ingredients and that could easily give some with bad allergies a rash! I feel like I wasted a few dollars. The smell is medicine like and not blueberry like. I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Wipes off makeup easily and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like a lot of others do. I&#x27;m hooked on these! Plus they&#x27;re made with gentle and natural ingredients, and aren&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I recently started working a late night shift, and let my face-washing routine go out the window on those nights I got home from work so late. I found these towlettes at Wal-Mart and decided that at least I could use these, if I could not muster the energy to go through a proper wash. I have to say, this is one of my all-time favorite beauty finds! I have combo skin, with a few acne blemishes that spring up from time to time. These towlettes easily remove my foundation and my mascara, without that awful soapy feeling that most other brands of towlettes leave behind. The smell is not my favorite, sort of a mix of blueberry and lemon, however it is not at all unpleasant. The first couple of nights after using the towlettes, the skin around my eyes burned ever so slightly. However, this no longer occurs, and I figure my skin just needed time to adjust to a new routine. I will warn those that prefer towlettes soaked in fluid, or really thick wipes, that this may not be the product for you...but, I encourage you to give it a try, and you may be pleasantly surprised that the right product does not need to be super-thick or dripping wet to get the job done! As I mentioned before, I have combo skin and after I use this product I do not have to use moisturizer. My dry areas are no longer dry and my oily areas are no longer oily! My favorite feature of this product is the plastic cap closure, which keeps the product from drying out and is easy to open and close. Most towlettes have that annoying \\&quot;restickable\\&quot; adhesive lid that never really resticks after the first use. I can not attest to the brightening effect of the towlettes as the manufacturer claims, so the results may be so subtle I did not notice...but, that is not really why I bought them in the first place. I encourage anyone looking for a simple, no fuss, no frills skin routine to try this product!</li>
            <li> It shows two....I thought I was getting two but got one packet.  My skin was moist after using but they were a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I like this product;does what it says. It moisturizes and leaves your skin with a glow, doesn&#x27;t clean all that great but it cleans good enough, besides I think its because it doesnt have harsh ingredients in it. I let my kids use them in the morning when they are in a rush for school . Very good for african american skin.</li>
            <li> These towlettes are very convenient, clean well, remove most of the make-up, and smell yummy! It smells like a lemon cake, maybe a cheese cake with lemon, it smells so good. But don&#x27;t keep a towlette a whole night, because the smell turns really badly after several hours. So use it, and throw it.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy some again for sure, and I recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;It is better to remove the make-up on the eyes with a specific product for the eyes, and then finish the rest of the face with these. Unless you wear a lot of foundation cream. In that case, use a cleaning product for make-up, and finish with these things, it will let your skin clean with a yummy smell.&lt;br /&gt;I just love those!</li>
            <li> WOW the price! I paid $10-15 for ONE! They are wonderful. They clean without being heavy or feel in like you cleaned with oil. Speaking of oil I don&#x27;t get that oily stuff a few hour afterwards. I am a big MAC &amp; Philosophy girl and now say Yes. I have used other products also and love them just the same.</li>
            <li> These smell like blueberry muffins with a hint of lemon. They feel VERY refreshing, day or night and take makeup off very well. I love to use these when I don&#x27;t have time (or I&#x27;m too lazy) to thoroughly wash my face. I have also noticed that my face feels softer, tighter and I haven&#x27;t had anywhere near as much acne as I would usually get during that time of the month. I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> These cost half as much at Target. That said, good product. Non irritating, takes off makeup (except eye makeup). I&#x27;d buy these again...somewhere else.</li>
            <li> OMG.  I have very sensitive skin and recently learned that I have rosacea.  I&#x27;m acne prone too.  I tried this product as part of my birchbox (check it out - birchbox.com) and I love it!  Say yes to blueberries!  Haven&#x27;t tried the others, but I like this one.  Oh, and the wipes smell delicious!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product so much because it is cruelty-free and natural.  However, the towelettes are really thin and smell weird....vaguely like blueberries, but oddly chemical-like.  I don&#x27;t feel like they do a good job of cleaning my face.  I have been much happier with Boots No. 7 wipes - so much that I didn&#x27;t finish this package - just went back to my Boots wipes after 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> Ever since I discovered these 6 months ago from an article in Allure magazine, they&#x27;re the only facewash product I use daily and my skin looks amazing!  It&#x27;s super quick, easy, and actually very refreshing to use these-- they take off makeup effectively (even waterproof mascara and eyeliner), and it leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth with no soapy residue or that too tight feeling.  They&#x27;re so convenient when you&#x27;re in a rush, or you&#x27;re just too tired at the end of a long day for a full routine-- there&#x27;s no need to rinse afterwards, and it makes your skin glow with its naturally refreshing ingredients.  I stockpile these-- it&#x27;s a secret beauty care gem!</li>
            <li> Yes I should have triple checked the wording but #@!*&amp;^ Really now when it is the only one of their products of facial clensing wipes that portrays two packages one may be lead to believe that they are in fact purchasing 2 packages. Other than that they are quite pleasant to use and they don&#x27;t leave a thick film on your face like I have experienced with other wipes. Which makes it a pretty good product. Good enough that they do not need to use deceptive practices like showing you two products when you are only purchasing one. Tsk tsk. The carrot variety is pretty wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> I bought these out of desperation. My acne has been really severe lately because of my pregnancy and all the products the dermatologist gave me just aren&#x27;t working. Looking at everything in Walmart, this seemed like the only product that was mostly natural, and seemed safe for pregnancy. So I gave it a try, and I&#x27;ve had these for about a week. I use 2 wipes each night to make sure all my make-up is off, and when I wake up in the morning I really do notice an improvement in my skin each day. My acne is diminishing from these blueberry wipes, I believe. You should buy some. My husband has noticed a great improvement in my skin. Maybe they&#x27;ll help you too.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend works on cars all day and comes home with a lot of dirt on his face. His pale skin is almost black when he comes home. This towelette managed to get his face clean in about a minute! If it can clean his face it can clean almost anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love using this product because I&#x27;m always on the go.</li>
            <li> I like to use natural skin products and this one works and fills the bill. I&#x27;m on my third pack and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin gets really clean and not dried out. I have a oily T Zone and I&#x27;m rabid about really cleaning the makeup off my skin at night and in the morning.  Easy to rinse off and I think the lemon peel helps keep my skin tone even.</li>
            <li> These wipes have a delightful smell and leave my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> These cleansing wipes instantly make my skin look tighter and younger. They also take off makeup really well. They are very moisturizing and have helped clear up my acne. I can&#x27;t say anything bad about these. I&#x27;ve been using them for over a year and refuse to use any other cleansing wipes now!</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim on clearance at Target, thinking they would be helpful at the beach. They are AWESOME!! They smell good, and leave your face feeling clean and refreshed. They do remove makeup, but I usually use an eye makeup remover in addition to this. They are perfect for using on the go, or if you are feeling lazy about washing your face - I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to face cleaner now. I swear my pores have gotten smaller.</li>
            <li> I bought these in a travel-sized package (8 wipes) to try, and I really, really like them! So much so that I&#x27;m writing a review, in hopes that you&#x27;ll buy and like them too! :) First off, they&#x27;re pricier than what I&#x27;d normally pay for a cleansing towelette - I usually buy Ponds or whatever&#x27;s on sale - however, these are 99% natural, paraben-free, biodegradable, and SO SOFT. The texture is perfect! They smell lovely (a mix of blueberries &amp; lemon), cleanse my face well, and leave my skin glowy and moisturized (but not oily!). They&#x27;re great for traveling, keeping in your car to use after the gym, or just to keep in your nightstand for those lazy nights when you don&#x27;t feel like going through the whole face-washing-routine. Most places carry them at $8 for a 30-count pkg., so I&#x27;m going to do the subscribe and save option through Amazon to save a few dollars!</li>
            <li> I personally can&#x27;t stand the smell of these and when combined with my face lotion it stung a little bit. It does remove makeup pretty well though it is pretty drying. For my skin I prefer the cucumber wipes.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased a toilette style face product before.  It is great for vacation as you could take in in a travel on.  It does a fantastic job removing make-up and eye make-up.  What I liked best is, because I have oily skin, sometimes I want to wash my face in the middle of the day and either not mess up my hair, or leave on my eye make-up.  The toilette allows you to easily do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about it the scent, it&#x27;s a little too strong but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> The YES company quickly sent me an email to see if I liked the product so that was nice. the cloth is a nice sized face cloth, its very soft. but its too sweet smelling, and left on the bathroom counter, it attacted ants! after I wash my face, I can continue to smell the blueberry cleanser. I like the way my skin feels after I use it, but I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> Since I had to give it a rating if I am to comment soo given that one is close to zero. First off, I am sending these back because the smell is aweful. It smells like a product that is close to Pledge or another chemical smell. Nothing like I thought it would be. I tried one on my face and it sure didn&#x27;t even give my face the fresh feeling most towlettes leaves. Made me feel like I just washed my face with furniture polisher. I order the Yes to Blueberries Age Refresh Towlettes. I would definitely order something else other than try these products again.</li>
            <li> love this brand- face feels clean and soft- removes my eye make-up and skin is glowing:) tried the grapefruit and also love:)</li>
            <li> I bought these because I ran out of my yes to cucumbers ones which I love. I got these completely dried out and they don&#x27;t remove my makeup like the yes to cucumber ones do. They smell like rocks</li>
            <li> These towlettes are great.  They do a great job of cleansing the face and removing makeup.  I also notice that my eyelashes grow longer and thicker when I use this product to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a dozen different facial wipes, and these are my favorite. Love the scent, and love the way my skin feels afterwards. They&#x27;re great at taking off my makeup without leaving my face feeling tight and dry. Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> This product has such a nice, light fragrance and the cloths hold up well.  I even wipe my hair down with them at night before bed and it gives me such a refreshing feeling!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  They are very convenient and do a great job removing the dirt, grime, and make-up.  I use them at night and morning.  My skin feels and looks great.  They don&#x27;t dry out my skin, leave a film, or cause breakouts.  I HIGHLY recommend them!</li>
            <li> I want to like these but they make my face burn and break out into bumps. The bumps are all over my face and are the same color as my skin. I can feel them and see them close up. I waited for the bumps to go away and tried the wipes again....same problem. My face was burning and I have the bumps again. I guess these just are not good for my sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up! Skin feels supple and clean after using it. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it&#x27;d take eye make up off better.</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve ever used and my skin has reacted this way. (I&#x27;ve tried many, many products) I&#x27;m not allegeric to any of the listed ingredients. But my face turned a hot, red color. It burned and I was very blotchy. I was just so upset about this because I had brought the 60% more package and it was 99% natural. The smell is very, very terrible like spoiled berries with chemicals. And my towels have a plastic lid to keep in moisture and these were so dry, it rub way to hard on my face. I&#x27;m too worried to try any of the other Say Yes products because I don&#x27;t want the same reaction.</li>
            <li> I use these when I&#x27;m in a rush or heading out for a run or yoga class. The scent is a little too strong for me, but they&#x27;re the best option I&#x27;ve found for natural towlettes. They moisturize nicely, too. My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using these. I only wish this product was organic. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase these until I find a well-priced, organic equivalent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell which is kind of citrusy, and while strong it dissipates after about 2 minutes.  However, after almost 2 months, I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement in my skin, and it can take 2 to get all my makeup (and I don&#x27;t wear foundation) off.</li>
            <li> I use towelettes because I am lazy and I don&#x27;t feel like washing my face at night. These take off my sunscreen (zinc based) and any make up (non waterproof) I might wear that day.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this product higher except that it is deceptively advertised. I thought I would be getting two packets, based on all the product photos, but I only received one. Thus, it is more expensive than I anticipated. I think Amazon should cease this deceptive advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I appreciate that Amazon changed the product photo to show only one box instead of two. Also, I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I really really like these towlettes. They leave my skin feeling soft and smooth. One towlette does the whole body! I will definitely buy more of these.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting two packages not one. I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this. I would of bought two if I would have known. Plus they cost less than that in the store.</li>
            <li> The picture is deceiving. You only get one. I like the smell, but I haven&#x27;t used them just yet. I&#x27;ve used the cucumber one before and it was great. I will update my review after I&#x27;ve used this product for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It&#x27;s refreshing after working out. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It smells more like lemon poppyseed muffins, not blueberries (not that important). I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would get rid of it. I will be switching back to the cucumber wipes. They&#x27;re cheaper and I enjoy the smell a lot more.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about these facial wipes because they were featured in the Self Top Beauty Product Awards.  I don&#x27;t really know why they got an award only because one of the categories they have to be rated on is how well it removes make-up.  Apparently, they got rated very highly on make-up removal but what I found was that it wasn&#x27;t very good at removing make-up at all.  Unless you want to scrub your face and cause unnecessary damage and inflammation, these wipes are NOT good at removing make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do, however, deliver in terms of being very moisturizing.  Which is why I give them 3 stars.  They fail in terms of make-up removal but they highly deliver in moisturizing your skin and also not irritating your skin.  I have very sensitive skin so I was surprised to see that my skin tolerated these very well.  I am usually hesitant about using new products and these do seem to be great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if you can just use wipes and then walk away without rinsing but because they moisturize, this might be the case which would be an AWESOME feature of these wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s disappointing that they don&#x27;t remove make-up up but they are great for taking off sweat post gym and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> They have a delicious fragrance, like lemon blueberry muffin batter (nom nom), which is a definite selling point for me.  I adore products that entice my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloths are wide enough to cover your face like a cotton face towel and with a bit of rubbing, you walk away with refreshed clean skin!  The package is lovely because it has both a solid flap AND a sticky tab, so that the towlettes don&#x27;t get dried out before you can use them.  Nothing worse than when THAT happens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that they cleanse very well and I have gone to bed some nights without washing my face afterwards.  Skin felt plump and moisturized, soft to the touch.  It says that it will cleanse and moisturize all in one and I back up that claim.  Generally, I do try to drag myself to the washroom and wash my face with a \\&quot;proper\\&quot; cleanser even after using any kind of wipes, but I&#x27;ve gone to bed without on quite a few nights and these seem to do the job well of getting rid of makeup on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I don&#x27;t know about the claims that they make about refreshing your age but convenience-wise, they are fantastic.  A lot of companies make facial wipes but they use harmful chemicals in them.  I can just pull out one of these less harmful wipes and clean my face in a minute without having to pull my hair back and get my face all wet and soapy.  They do a good job of exfoliating over time as well.</li>
            <li> I was interested in buying makeup removing wipes because sometimes I&#x27;m too tired and lazy to wash my face before bed. My boyfriend saw these in Target one day and thought they were funny, so I tried them out. One of the greatest additions to my life. These are gentle on my skin so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after I use one. I wear quite a bit of eye make up usually, and this does a great job of getting it all off (better than washing my face does). Also, they smell nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep these next to my bed to use every night and now have an Amazon auto purchase set for these because I think these are that amazing and such a great addition to my life. You&#x27;ll love them too!</li>
            <li> I never travel any where with out these. They are perfect for wiping your make up off at night. There is no oily or greasy feeling after you use them. It leaves your face clean and it smells really nice. I let my cousin use one and she loved it too and ran out and bought them. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These are perfect I use them everyday! They keep my sensitive and oily face from breakouts! Smells great, so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these out after hearing all the buzz. i actually hate them. they don&#x27;t remove all my mascara, and my face feels dewey afterwards. i much prefer the $3 e.l.f. makeup remover wipes over these pricey ones! good thing i decided to try the travel size first.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m tired after a long day or when I&#x27;m running late for work, this wonderful product saves me time and allows me to clean and moisturize my face in a few refreshing swipes.  They stay moist down to the very last cloth yet they never get that moldy odor that similar products can develop after a while.  They actually smell like Fruit Loops to me, which is a rather nice scent to have right up next to your nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They remove makeup (even mascara) easily and gently, and they leave my face feeling smooth and supple.  I have somewhat dry skin, but after using one of these I don&#x27;t even require extra moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these for anyone who is short on time but still wants to take good care of their face.</li>
            <li> This was just ok. I have slightly sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t do anything to help. It doesn&#x27;t seem to really do anything for my skin, other than make it smell good for about two minutes. I have been using the Oil of Olay wipes and those are far better at conditioning my skin and improving the look and feel of it. It also didn&#x27;t make removing making any easier than just water and any other cloth. Because they are pre-moistened, you get what you get on the wipes and each one seemed a little dryer than it should have been (in terms of a pre-moistened cloth). I don&#x27;t think the pack was drying up. I will not purchase any more or recommend these.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product knowing the Yes product line. But, this just didn&#x27;t perform as I had hoped. If you are not removing makeup, the towlettes would be okay. First off, the towlettes are barely saturated. Maybe I received a defective package, not sure. The towlettes barely removed my eye makeup. And, I don&#x27;t use waterproof mascara or pulletproof eyeliner/shadow. They do have a nice fragrance and do contain some very nice ingredients. I just wished they performed better. I did give the product 3 stars because I felt they would do a decent job cleansing if you weren&#x27;t wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> these are good face wipes and dont leave a lot of residue.  i like the smell a lot and feel clean after using. doesnt get all the make off i would like but other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> These are okay -- nothing amazing and not all that refreshing. They smell more like cleaner than like a refreshing face wipe. Not terrible, but I&#x27;ll opt for a different brand of refresh towlettes on my next long trip.</li>
            <li> These wipes smell wonderful, but they also leave my face blotchy red.  I have fair skin, but not all wipes do this to me.  So, I only use these wipes at the end of day, and cold rinse my face afterwards.</li>
            <li> I must admit I don&#x27;t like washing my face unless I&#x27;m bathing.&lt;br /&gt;these towlettes are great when you aren&#x27;t in the bath but want to clean up a bit&lt;br /&gt;evens skin tone and keeps your face smooth and fresh&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li> They did not irritate but soothed and cleansed - removed eyemakeup (not waterproof mascara obviously) and all my face makeup - i am ordering these once a month instead of my more expensive face wash</li>
            <li> love these cleansing towlettes.  they smell great and clean well without drying out my skin.  wish I could get them locally, but amazon always delivers quickly.</li>
            <li> Because the picture showed 2 of the item I thought I was getting 2.  Should have read the small print.  I just thought it was a great price .  Oh well, , live and learn</li>
            <li> Awesome cloth with faint fruity smell that prevents breakout. Skin is noticeably clearer and softer after use and most importantly the effect lasts. Great for post workout, before sleep, or after hours under the sun.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in so many magazines and decided to try them as you receive a larger package for the same price as other wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are amazing!  First off they smell wonderful (not overpowering floral or blueberry scent).  They are also a good size wipe and not flimsy to where they fall apart with a bit of pressure.  I use one wipe to remove everything and the issue I usually have with wipes is that I feel my makeup in the crevices of my nose and chin or I break out the next day.  These wipes are the complete opposite.  I wake up with a nice clean face and no new pimples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest, if you use lots of waterproof makeup like me, to focus a bit more time on your eyes with these.  If you just do a quick wipe you may look like a racoon in the morning.  I am intrigued to try the rest of the \\&quot;Yes To\\&quot; line!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of products. I use the &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; version for my daughter. I like the ease of having a quick towlette at night to clean my face and then to be able to pitch it. These are the only ones I have found that are completely biodegradeable so I don&#x27;t feel guilty throwing them in the trash.</li>
            <li> I like these. They smell just like blueberries and do seem to have a subtle brightening effect. I have bought these a few times and may repurchase in the future. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to people with sensitive skin because I could see them being a little irritating. Overall, good product but not if you&#x27;re too sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite cleansing wipes. I love the smell and the way my skin feels after I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> I have used these for many years and not only do I love this brand but these towlettes clean your face and make it feel very refreshed every time. I love these and I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 years now and no other product has come close to comparing to it. So if you like natural products, a refreshing feel, and the fact that these do a good job removing makeup then give these a try.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Olay facial cloths but decided to try these because I like the smell of blueberry.  I use cloths when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time for my usual cleansing routine.  These really seem to do the trick.  They have a pleasant smell (though not what I would label &amp;#34;blueberry&amp;#34;) and seem to work as well as the Olay.  In fact, they have an advantage in that the packaging keeps them sealed and moist -- with the Olay ones after using a few of the cloths, the seal won&#x27;t stay on and the rest of them quickly dry out.  This set has both the package seal and a plastic &amp;#34;box-type&amp;#34; seal and that keeps them fresh.  Will continue to buy these.....</li>
            <li> This works similar to other towelettes. I think it has some good-for-skin ingredients (and a higher price) compared to some other towelettes. If you use other skincare that contain those things however, I&#x27;d save a few dollars and get a cheaper product. I did not really like the smell of this. It&#x27;s not too strong but I didn&#x27;t like it. Also, this seemed to leave a clingy feeling on my skin like a thin film of something on my face (not visible) afterward which I did not like too much. I did not repurchase and now am using a different brand.</li>
            <li> These are very soft and left my face feeling moisturized, but the smell is horrible. I can&#x27;t describe it very well because it&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve smelled before, but it&#x27;s a chemical smell. I&#x27;m at work and I keep thinking that I stink, but when I smell my clothes they smell fine. I finally realized it&#x27;s my face! My face stinks! My nose is very sensitive so these are not going to work. I want to try the cucumber or the carrots, but I wish I could smell them before I waste the money.</li>
            <li> These are great to use for traveling or when  you need something quick and easy.  I&#x27;ve found they don&#x27;t remove my mascara very well though.</li>
            <li> They are great but too expensive!</li>
            <li> There is no way I am going to get up and do a bazillion-step routine when I am about ready to drop off to sleep.  These towelettes are great - they remove makeup well, they don&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea, my skin is clear, and it doesn&#x27;t feel over-stripped or sticky.  Afterwards I put on my Paula&#x27;s Choice moisturizer, and read until I sleep - BAM.  That&#x27;s the routine.  And I get compliments all the time on my skin, so maybe I don&#x27;t need that Clarisonic after all...</li>
            <li> I really like these, they are gentle but remove makeup well.  My skin feels refreshed after using them, not too drying.  Pleasant smell, just wish more came in the package.</li>
            <li> Okay so the first couple of days I&#x27;m thinking to myself, WHY? But now that I have used them for about a week everyday I understand! My face is softer and seems to have more of a glow to is and I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects!</li>
            <li> I just love these towelettes!  They leave my skin clean and soft, not dry at all.  And it&#x27;s so easy to use them before bedtime.  I also love the autoship feature so I don&#x27;t have to worry about ever running out.</li>
            <li> I found that my skin looks more radiant when I use these. So I have been using them for a long time. However, they do not remove makeup all that well. I have to use facial cleanser after I use these wipes. And they do not do well at all with mascara. On the plus side, they smell awesome. And I have sensitive, oily skin and I never had any sort of reaction or issue with these. So for people who do not wear much makeup, these would be wonderful and I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Every yes product labeled with all the different headings blueberries, cucumber, on and on, all have the SAME INGREDIENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! see for yourself!</li>
