            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>

            <li>Losing eyebrow hairs and turning gray, so needed fill in, and this is perfect and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The pomade is best used with an angled brush and applying it with a light hand.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I used brush #12 which is also amazing for applying the pomade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I think this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product otherwise tho</li>
            <li>but it takes a deft hand</li>
            <li>love how full they make my brows look!!!</li>
            <li>The color i chose was perfect and really matched my eyeybrows and made them look natural and flawless.</li>
            <li>this stuff is super waterproof and keeps your eyebrows looking great all day.</li>
            <li>is great and the Anastasia brow pencils are totally worth the money, but to me this product is a skip.</li>
            <li>Looooooove it the most amazing thing ever</li>
            <li>but if you are a medium brown ... nice smooth dispensing product!</li>
            <li>The sellers are amazing, my Dipbrow was lost in the mail and they sent a new one, I absolutely loved the product!</li>
            <li>nice product, goes on easily but it does not have the staying power that is suggested.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found this color.</li>
            <li>so GLAD I did.</li>
            <li>Even with my oily skin it lasts all day and looks authentic.  </li>
            <li>Love this color</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find my eyebrows to stay any more prim.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This color is a bit more darker but I must admit it does layer well</li>
            <li>so go light if you don&#x27;t want to brush your eyebrow for five minutes after to remove the harshness!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>still love it</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love Anastacia products.</li>
            <li>My brows are darker than my hair with no gold or red undertones and this color matches them perfectly, a medium neutral brown.  </li>
            <li>I then use a spoolie brush to make sure everything is blended.</li>
            <li>It is an ingenious invention.  </li>
            <li>Love love this dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m kind of light</li>
            <li>cause I honostly wasn&#x27;t  sure Wich color to chose</li>
            <li>hope this will help someone  :)</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>I think this is much better because it looks more flawless/natural</li>
            <li>it will look better with ladies with fuller eyebrows</li>
            <li>Hope this review helps some of you. : )</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>From the very first use I could tell that this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Darker  than expected but awesome product</li>
            <li>Fast shipping good product</li>
            <li>It stays on no matter what but is easily removed with waterproof makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>I love this because it is not only basically 90% waterproof/smudgeproof, but it&#x27;s also easy to apply and great for its price.</li>
            <li>Water proof, easily blendable, set with powder.</li>
            <li>The color I purchased based upon the info on the Anastasia website should have been a perfect match, but it was WAY too dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my slightly oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Since her make-up is always flawless and she keeps pretty current on what is available</li>
            <li>THE REAL DEALduct go for it and try it because I promise you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>so yes, that&#x27;s all it needs to look fantastic on you, all day &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>If I use lightly works well for me ...</li>
            <li>yet he seems to compliment me on how I look when I&#x27;ve filled my eyebrows in.</li>
            <li>Love that you can lighten/darken this up pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I looked on line at a video to make sure I was using it right</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product after reading so many positive reviews on it online and seeing so many makeup bloggers recommend it, but it just wasn&#x27;t my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>Considering the price and amount it was well worth it !</li>
            <li>My daughter recommended it to me and she was so right!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll still use this for special occasions when I have more time to get ready.</li>
            <li>It takes considerable practice to use this product, but once you get the hang of it, it looks really nice.  </li>
            <li>Then precisely trace the bottom of the brow, then do the same thing to the top but don&#x27;t pick up any more product.  </li>
            <li>The first week it took me about 10-15 min to apply and it looked like strongly painted on brows.</li>
            <li>She told me how much she loved the stuff and that it lasts all day not to mention how natural it looked.  </li>
            <li>The dip brow is really great however the medium brown is too dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super smooth, easily blended and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It does take a little while to get use to using but after that it is great.</li>
            <li>When it arrived the product was very silky smooth</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply (although) I ordered the Anastasia brush to use it with and it looks amazingly realistic.  </li>
            <li>Love this product if your natural brows have a brown greyish look to them</li>
            <li>My brows have never looked more natural</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought the taupe and that color was just right.</li>
            <li>It takes time finding the right shade for your brows</li>
            <li>and I thought medium brown would be the right choice</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, but you will need an angled makeup brush for use only with this product.</li>
            <li>and now it is kind of dry.</li>
            <li>It was super fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ashy color is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been mostly satisfied with powder, but wanted something that can last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dipbrow</li>
            <li>The medium brown while it looks darker from the photo, is actually lighter in color and has more ash tones.</li>
            <li>Have more then 75% left.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time i have ever used a brow powder and said &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; after the first swipe.</li>
            <li>This product is a great price and will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li>or I simply haven&#x27;t been able to apply it well consistently.</li>
            <li>I loved it until it dried up.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited for medium brown for when my natural hair grows out.</li>
            <li>I have already ordered this in Soft Brown too as this one is darker than expected which actually is a good thing I just figured in case</li>
            <li>and I was super surprised!</li>
            <li>Love how it&#x27;s easy to apply and last all day long.</li>
            <li>so I was certain this would not be for me since it was a gel.  </li>
            <li>I can use just a little for a very natural groomed look or I can add a bit and get a more precisely defined look, it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li>I do admit I have not wore it with a hat or touch my face very often</li>
            <li>never going back to the cheap stuff</li>
            <li>It stays on much longer than the powder one.</li>
            <li>but i REALLY wish I had gone with a lighter color.</li>
            <li>It gives my brows a very polished and youthful look.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product (texture, color, stay-with-it-ness)</li>
            <li>(spoolie brush FTW) or really glam it up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have for Make-up artists like myself, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I am rather light with yellow undertones to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve penciled in my brows for years and more recently have used a brush w/ just the right shade of eyeshadow for a softer effect, but it doesn&#x27;t last well on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Love it lighter then the other one I bought</li>
            <li>I got more of a dark chocolate brown instead of a medium brown.</li>
            <li>Love anastasia dipbrow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have dark brown</li>
            <li>is more of a dark brown</li>
            <li>I was currently switching between Make Up For Ever Aqua Brow in ash and Clinque Ultra Fine Brow Pencil in soft brown.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nearly black on my eyebrows when I was hoping for more of a brown.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This was doubling or tripling the time I normally spend doing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>so I am not 100% certain how this would work or last during intense workouts, if you were a hat, etc.  </li>
            <li>I will have another option to use as well.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to be my new</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look like they were done professionally!</li>
            <li>but I need to place a new order --- ( light brown and black)</li>
            <li>But therein lies the rub: the whole concept of a &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34; is that it is supposed to provide color and control, acting as a brow tint or powder and a control wax.</li>
            <li>and once it is gone, I will probably go with a soft brown instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an ashy tone in my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>--perhaps it&#x27;s just not as sheer as I really want it to be</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Can make it look as natural as one would like</li>
            <li>I wanted to be wow&#x27;d by this product but was not.  </li>
            <li>it has already begun drying out considerably.  </li>
            <li>Good product, just not impressed.</li>
            <li>Taking a minor amount of product and swishing/blending it on the inside cap REALLY helped a lot.</li>
            <li>I then ordered the medium brown thinking perhaps the dark brown was simply too dark for me but honestly, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two colors--either in the pot or on my skin.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered the dark brown color (I have very dark brows but greying brown hair) and tried several different applicators and about half the time I love how my brows look</li>
            <li>It looks natural but still gives you totally defined statement eyebrows.</li>
            <li>But in order to get the color right with this product I have to use so little that it provides no control</li>
            <li>After having some trouble finding the right color, I&#x27;ve finally settled on Medium Brown.  </li>
            <li>Not sure that the color I got is the right color for me either.  </li>
            <li>As long as you know how much product to apply and how to apply, there should be absolutely no problem.</li>

            <li> Love love this dipbrow pomade.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m kind of light</li>
            <li> cause I honostly wasn&#x27;t  sure Wich color to chose</li>
            <li> hope this will help someone  :)</li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> I think this is much better because it looks more flawless/natural</li>
            <li> it will look better with ladies with fuller eyebrows</li>
            <li> Hope this review helps some of you. : )</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> From the very first use I could tell that this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Darker  than expected but awesome product</li>
            <li> Fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> It stays on no matter what but is easily removed with waterproof makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> I love this because it is not only basically 90% waterproof/smudgeproof, but it&#x27;s also easy to apply and great for its price.</li>
            <li> Water proof, easily blendable, set with powder.</li>
            <li> The color I purchased based upon the info on the Anastasia website should have been a perfect match, but it was WAY too dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my slightly oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Since her make-up is always flawless and she keeps pretty current on what is available</li>
            <li> THE REAL DEALduct go for it and try it because I promise you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> so yes, that&#x27;s all it needs to look fantastic on you, all day &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> If I use lightly works well for me ...</li>
            <li> yet he seems to compliment me on how I look when I&#x27;ve filled my eyebrows in.</li>
            <li> Love that you can lighten/darken this up pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I looked on line at a video to make sure I was using it right</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product after reading so many positive reviews on it online and seeing so many makeup bloggers recommend it, but it just wasn&#x27;t my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> Considering the price and amount it was well worth it !</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended it to me and she was so right!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use this for special occasions when I have more time to get ready.</li>
            <li> It takes considerable practice to use this product, but once you get the hang of it, it looks really nice.  </li>
            <li> Then precisely trace the bottom of the brow, then do the same thing to the top but don&#x27;t pick up any more product.  </li>
            <li> The first week it took me about 10-15 min to apply and it looked like strongly painted on brows.</li>
            <li> She told me how much she loved the stuff and that it lasts all day not to mention how natural it looked.  </li>
            <li> The dip brow is really great however the medium brown is too dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super smooth, easily blended and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to get use to using but after that it is great.</li>
            <li> When it arrived the product was very silky smooth</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply (although) I ordered the Anastasia brush to use it with and it looks amazingly realistic.  </li>
            <li> Love this product if your natural brows have a brown greyish look to them</li>
            <li> My brows have never looked more natural</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought the taupe and that color was just right.</li>
            <li> It takes time finding the right shade for your brows</li>
            <li> and I thought medium brown would be the right choice</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, but you will need an angled makeup brush for use only with this product.</li>
            <li> and now it is kind of dry.</li>
            <li> It was super fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ashy color is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been mostly satisfied with powder, but wanted something that can last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dipbrow</li>
            <li> The medium brown while it looks darker from the photo, is actually lighter in color and has more ash tones.</li>
            <li> Have more then 75% left.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time i have ever used a brow powder and said &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; after the first swipe.</li>
            <li> This product is a great price and will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> or I simply haven&#x27;t been able to apply it well consistently.</li>
            <li> I loved it until it dried up.  </li>
            <li> so I was excited for medium brown for when my natural hair grows out.</li>
            <li> I have already ordered this in Soft Brown too as this one is darker than expected which actually is a good thing I just figured in case</li>
            <li> and I was super surprised!</li>
            <li> Love how it&#x27;s easy to apply and last all day long.</li>
            <li> so I was certain this would not be for me since it was a gel.  </li>
            <li> I can use just a little for a very natural groomed look or I can add a bit and get a more precisely defined look, it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li> I do admit I have not wore it with a hat or touch my face very often</li>
            <li> never going back to the cheap stuff</li>
            <li> It stays on much longer than the powder one.</li>
            <li> but i REALLY wish I had gone with a lighter color.</li>
            <li> It gives my brows a very polished and youthful look.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product (texture, color, stay-with-it-ness)</li>
            <li> (spoolie brush FTW) or really glam it up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have for Make-up artists like myself, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I am rather light with yellow undertones to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve penciled in my brows for years and more recently have used a brush w/ just the right shade of eyeshadow for a softer effect, but it doesn&#x27;t last well on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love it lighter then the other one I bought</li>
            <li> I got more of a dark chocolate brown instead of a medium brown.</li>
            <li> Love anastasia dipbrow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have dark brown</li>
            <li> is more of a dark brown</li>
            <li> I was currently switching between Make Up For Ever Aqua Brow in ash and Clinque Ultra Fine Brow Pencil in soft brown.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nearly black on my eyebrows when I was hoping for more of a brown.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was doubling or tripling the time I normally spend doing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> so I am not 100% certain how this would work or last during intense workouts, if you were a hat, etc.  </li>
            <li> I will have another option to use as well.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to be my new</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look like they were done professionally!</li>
            <li> but I need to place a new order --- ( light brown and black)</li>
            <li> But therein lies the rub: the whole concept of a &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34; is that it is supposed to provide color and control, acting as a brow tint or powder and a control wax.</li>
            <li> and once it is gone, I will probably go with a soft brown instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an ashy tone in my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> --perhaps it&#x27;s just not as sheer as I really want it to be</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Can make it look as natural as one would like</li>
            <li> I wanted to be wow&#x27;d by this product but was not.  </li>
            <li> it has already begun drying out considerably.  </li>
            <li> Good product, just not impressed.</li>
            <li> Taking a minor amount of product and swishing/blending it on the inside cap REALLY helped a lot.</li>
            <li> I then ordered the medium brown thinking perhaps the dark brown was simply too dark for me but honestly, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two colors--either in the pot or on my skin.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the dark brown color (I have very dark brows but greying brown hair) and tried several different applicators and about half the time I love how my brows look</li>
            <li> It looks natural but still gives you totally defined statement eyebrows.</li>
            <li> But in order to get the color right with this product I have to use so little that it provides no control</li>
            <li> After having some trouble finding the right color, I&#x27;ve finally settled on Medium Brown.  </li>
            <li> Not sure that the color I got is the right color for me either.  </li>
            <li> As long as you know how much product to apply and how to apply, there should be absolutely no problem.</li>
            <li> the container is not large, but a little bit goes a super long way!</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the price because it only takes a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Normally, the need to use such a small amount and having the product last so long would be a major selling point</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow makeup that requires me to dab face powder over application in order to make it lighter and also mimick a natural eyebrow color that typically is a tint of ash.</li>
            <li> Also, it never seems to dry or &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and several times has rubbed off on chothing when I pull it over my head.</li>
            <li> You have to use a very light hand with this product to keep it from getting too dark and too fake looking.</li>
            <li> Previously I had bought this product in soft brown, it was very dark and very red pigmented.</li>
            <li> and although I have barely used any of the product (maybe 1/10the of what is in the little jar)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it will definitely take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> So if you use this pomade as just a flat application it may look too harsh as it is very pigmented and thick.</li>
            <li> I would go a shade lighter if you don&#x27;t have hair that is next to black.</li>
            <li> I use so little product that this one container will last me years.  </li>
            <li> I only use a small amount and the product has started to dry out.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After watching a billion make-up reviews and every other artist using this product, I attempted to see what all the fuss was about.</li>
            <li> but the other times they look too dark/painted on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than other eyebrow fill ins</li>
            <li> I prefer to wet my brow brush slightly before application.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to use a very narrow stiff small angled brush (I use the Anastasia brow brush) and barely touch the product, wiping the excess off on the back of your hand.  </li>
            <li> i got too dark of a color for myself though</li>
            <li> Though it says medium brown it is too dark.</li>
            <li> That much product should last you at least 1 year, no joke; even if used every day.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a pencil on my eyebrows, but found that it looks too fake.</li>
            <li> Looks like a dark brown not a medium brown.</li>
            <li> Way too dark .</li>
            <li> Some of the browns colors come out &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; on dark skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been suggested to store the product upside down so the moisture stays at the surface.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have it down yet.</li>
            <li> i thought i finallly found a solution that could save me the pain of having to be careful not to touch my eyebrows all day!!</li>
            <li> and my hair is dark almost black</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are naturally a dark brown/light black</li>
            <li> I also bought the slightly darker color when i want a slightly differnent look.</li>
            <li> The longer I have the product, the less</li>
            <li> I will repurchase but it will take forever as I have to use so little product.</li>
            <li> It is a little darker than I was hoping for9</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for my brows.</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes for the pomade to set, but once it does, it doesn&#x27;t budge.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but I think I should go one shade lighter as it seems a bit harsh when I apply it on thicker.</li>
            <li> It does take me some time to apply it as I use the brush to create small upward hair like strokes.  </li>
            <li> A+.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend a small angled brush, though.</li>
            <li> difficult to apply, it is a dark brownish grey color (very weird and hard to explain).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as soon as she showed the little container to me and mentioned that it was a pomade/gel.  </li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> so maybe this is why I find it difficult to use</li>
            <li> and I can leave it on all day and not worry that they might look fake, or smudge, or anything like that.</li>
            <li> FAKE NOT</li>
            <li> but if the product dries out then it is useless.  </li>
            <li> My husband thinks it&#x27;s weird women care about their eyebrows</li>
            <li> it comes off as soon as you touch it with your fingers, which was really disappointing</li>
            <li> And very heavy , I was very disappointed .</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed and will not repurchase.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to try and revive it which is annoying.  </li>
            <li> but I have tried and tried and just cannot work with this and even if I could the color is just awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the perfect brow makeup.  It&#x27;s ashy color is exactly what I needed.  I had mistakenly bought the chocolate before and I&#x27;m so glad I found this color.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law recommended this to me as I have always used Maybeline eyebrow pencils for my brows.  She told me how much she loved the stuff and that it lasts all day not to mention how natural it looked.  I was skeptical as soon as she showed the little container to me and mentioned that it was a pomade/gel.  I am in my mid-forties and have oily skin so I was certain this would not be for me since it was a gel.  Boy, was I wrong. Since her make-up is always flawless and she keeps pretty current on what is available I thought oh what the heck, and so GLAD I did. It is easy to apply (although) I ordered the Anastasia brush to use it with and it looks amazingly realistic.  Even with my oily skin it lasts all day and looks authentic.  I do admit I have not wore it with a hat or touch my face very often so I am not 100% certain how this would work or last during intense workouts, if you were a hat, etc.  I have already ordered this in Soft Brown too as this one is darker than expected which actually is a good thing I just figured in case I lighten my hair for the summer I will have another option to use as well.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to be my new go.&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I literally have no brow hair left from years of waxing and tweezing.  It does take me some time to apply it as I use the brush to create small upward hair like strokes.  So if you use this pomade as just a flat application it may look too harsh as it is very pigmented and thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using brow powder for 8 years and wanted to try this out because everyone was raving about. It takes me about 1-2 min to apply brow powder and I&#x27;ve been mostly satisfied with powder, but wanted something that can last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dipbrow definitely lasts all day. The first week it took me about 10-15 min to apply and it looked like strongly painted on brows. The 2nd to 3rd week I got the hang of it and it would take 5 min and my brows were perfect. The 4th week it started drying up and I would have to spend an extra 5 min warming it up on my hand or the lid and cleaning up afterwards, making it take 10 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It became such a hassle I returned to using brow powder. I need something that allows me to have a short morning routine. This was doubling or tripling the time I normally spend doing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use this for special occasions when I have more time to get ready. It&#x27;s great when going out because it stays on all day/night.</li>
            <li> worth the extra cost. this stuff is super waterproof and keeps your eyebrows looking great all day. Love that you can lighten/darken this up pretty easily. the container is not large, but a little bit goes a super long way! never going back to the cheap stuff</li>
            <li> works great. i got too dark of a color for myself though</li>
            <li> Love this color but I need to place a new order --- ( light brown and black)</li>
            <li> Very good, perfect for sculpting brow</li>
            <li> I needed this product in my life. Such a difference on my brows. It stays on much longer than the powder one. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> The dip brow is really great however the medium brown is too dark. I couldn&#x27;t use it. I bought the taupe and that color was just right.</li>
            <li> difficult to apply, it is a dark brownish grey color (very weird and hard to explain). I am used to pencils so maybe this is why I find it difficult to use but I have tried and tried and just cannot work with this and even if I could the color is just awful.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t purchased this sooner! love how full they make my brows look!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. I only use a small amount and the product has started to dry out. It&#x27;s been suggested to store the product upside down so the moisture stays at the surface. The color does not skew red. Previously I had bought this product in soft brown, it was very dark and very red pigmented. The medium brown while it looks darker from the photo, is actually lighter in color and has more ash tones.</li>
            <li> Though it says medium brown it is too dark. I don&#x27;t find my eyebrows to stay any more prim.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product after reading so many positive reviews on it online and seeing so many makeup bloggers recommend it, but it just wasn&#x27;t my cup of tea. The color I purchased based upon the info on the Anastasia website should have been a perfect match, but it was WAY too dark. You have to use a very light hand with this product to keep it from getting too dark and too fake looking. But therein lies the rub: the whole concept of a &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34; is that it is supposed to provide color and control, acting as a brow tint or powder and a control wax. But in order to get the color right with this product I have to use so little that it provides no control and I end up reaching for my trusty NYX wax pencil anyway. Also, it never seems to dry or &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and several times has rubbed off on chothing when I pull it over my head. The Anastasia double ended brow brush and spoolie is great and the Anastasia brow pencils are totally worth the money, but to me this product is a skip.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for my brows. It takes time finding the right shade for your brows so I recommend stopping by ulta or sephora to get a swatch of what color is best suited for you. Or if you don&#x27;t have any of these places, look up the swatches on youtube or google images. The pomade is best used with an angled brush and applying it with a light hand. A little goes a long way and it will definitely take some getting used to. Great product that lasts me all day.</li>
            <li> Pros: The color i chose was perfect and really matched my eyeybrows and made them look natural and flawless. I used brush #12 which is also amazing for applying the pomade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it is NOT smudge-free at all, if u have oily skin! it comes off as soon as you touch it with your fingers, which was really disappointing cause i thought i finallly found a solution that could save me the pain of having to be careful not to touch my eyebrows all day!!</li>
            <li> Love it. As long as you know how much product to apply and how to apply, there should be absolutely no problem. ABH brow products are simply great.</li>
            <li> Very nice and helps your brown stay put.</li>
            <li> I love the dip brow but was not impressed with the color. I got more of a dark chocolate brown instead of a medium brown. But I will make it work.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I prefer to wet my brow brush slightly before application.  It does not come off all day.</li>
            <li> I love it! It is totally worth the price because it only takes a very small amount. At this rate it will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> After watching a billion make-up reviews and every other artist using this product, I attempted to see what all the fuss was about. I was currently switching between Make Up For Ever Aqua Brow in ash and Clinque Ultra Fine Brow Pencil in soft brown. This color is a bit more darker but I must admit it does layer well so go light if you don&#x27;t want to brush your eyebrow for five minutes after to remove the harshness! This is the only eyebrow makeup that requires me to dab face powder over application in order to make it lighter and also mimick a natural eyebrow color that typically is a tint of ash. Use with an angled eyebrow brush (I use makeup for ever paired with the Aqua Brow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great product but I will stick to Make Up For Ever/Clinque.</li>
            <li> I loved it until it dried up.  Have more then 75% left.  Now I have to try and revive it which is annoying.  Nice product otherwise tho</li>
            <li> I love it but i REALLY wish I had gone with a lighter color. This will last me FOREVER but it&#x27;s nearly black on my eyebrows when I was hoping for more of a brown. :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love it and once it is gone, I will probably go with a soft brown instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch some youtube tutorials on how to apply. Taking a minor amount of product and swishing/blending it on the inside cap REALLY helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Losing eyebrow hairs and turning gray, so needed fill in, and this is perfect and easy to use.  If I can do it anyone can.  I looked on line at a video to make sure I was using it right and it showed me that you just fill in your eyebrows with it - it&#x27;s that simple!  Joila!  And it stays on all day.  However, I have not been in the rain or snow yet so I don&#x27;t know about that.  But, it&#x27;s still great for now!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love Anastacia products. This is the first time i have ever used a brow powder and said &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; after the first swipe. Great quality and easy to use. I reccomend watching all the youtube videos on this product. I also bought the slightly darker color when i want a slightly differnent look. This product is a great price and will last a LONG time. a little goes a long way. I want to buy one for my mother. Great buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Dipbrow fan.  After having some trouble finding the right color, I&#x27;ve finally settled on Medium Brown.  My brows are darker than my hair with no gold or red undertones and this color matches them perfectly, a medium neutral brown.  It takes considerable practice to use this product, but once you get the hang of it, it looks really nice.  It gives my brows a very polished and youthful look.  The trick is to use a very narrow stiff small angled brush (I use the Anastasia brow brush) and barely touch the product, wiping the excess off on the back of your hand.  Then precisely trace the bottom of the brow, then do the same thing to the top but don&#x27;t pick up any more product.  Then with what product remains on the brush fill in the rest of the brow. I then use a spoolie brush to make sure everything is blended. There are tutorials on YouTube you can consult.  This method works for me.  It takes a few minutes for the pomade to set, but once it does, it doesn&#x27;t budge.  It&#x27;s perfect for my slightly oily skin.  I also have a running battle with the Florida humidity and Dipbrow doesn&#x27;t even flinch.  It stays on no matter what but is easily removed with waterproof makeup remover.  It is an ingenious invention.  I use so little product that this one container will last me years.  Now that I&#x27;ve found the perfect shade, I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I can use just a little for a very natural groomed look or I can add a bit and get a more precisely defined look, it&#x27;s very versatile. It just takes some practice and the perfect brow brush. This is a fantastic product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love anastasia dipbrow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have dark brown so I was excited for medium brown for when my natural hair grows out. I have an ashy tone in my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I swatched the colors on my arm and they look identical. I have not tried the medium brown on my eyebrows yet, so there may still be a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors in the pot are slightly different, but swatched on the arm they look the same.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but if you rub your eyebrows unknowingly during the day, it will smudge. I loved the color, matched perfectly. Very easy to apply, but you will need an angled makeup brush for use only with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! This is defiantly for bold eyebrow make sure u buy the #12 brush to go along with this!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve penciled in my brows for years and more recently have used a brush w/ just the right shade of eyeshadow for a softer effect, but it doesn&#x27;t last well on my oily skin. I really like this product (texture, color, stay-with-it-ness) but it takes a deft hand and I don&#x27;t have it down yet. I originally ordered the dark brown color (I have very dark brows but greying brown hair) and tried several different applicators and about half the time I love how my brows look but the other times they look too dark/painted on. I then ordered the medium brown thinking perhaps the dark brown was simply too dark for me but honestly, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two colors--either in the pot or on my skin. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering the next lighter color, but I don&#x27;t know--perhaps it&#x27;s just not as sheer as I really want it to be or I simply haven&#x27;t been able to apply it well consistently.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Works great and looks great! I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use. My eyebrows look like they were done professionally!</li>
            <li> Love love this dipbrow pomade. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Looooooove it the most amazing thing ever and I&#x27;m kind of light and my hair is dark almost black and I got the medium  brown and it&#x27;s just perfect for me ..cause I honostly wasn&#x27;t  sure Wich color to chose but I&#x27;m so happy that I got the medium  brown  hope this will help someone  :)</li>
            <li> Its okay. I was looking for a lighter brown</li>
            <li> When it arrived the product was very silky smooth and now it is kind of dry.</li>
            <li> This was perfect! It was my shade, and I feel like it looks great on my eyebrows. I love this because it is not only basically 90% waterproof/smudgeproof, but it&#x27;s also easy to apply and great for its price. That much product should last you at least 1 year, no joke; even if used every day.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a pencil on my eyebrows, but found that it looks too fake. I think this is much better because it looks more flawless/natural and I can leave it on all day and not worry that they might look fake, or smudge, or anything like that. A+.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend a small angled brush, though. I got mine at Target (ELF) and it cost me $3 and works, so yes, that&#x27;s all it needs to look fantastic on you, all day &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love it lighter then the other one I bought</li>
            <li> This is the best!!! My daughter recommended it to me and she was so right!</li>
            <li> From the very first use I could tell that this is an amazing product. Considering the price and amount it was well worth it !</li>
            <li> Great product just think I should have gone lighter.  My eyebrows are naturally a dark brown/light black and I thought medium brown would be the right choice but I think I should go one shade lighter as it seems a bit harsh when I apply it on thicker.</li>
            <li> Darker  than expected but awesome product</li>
            <li> it will look better with ladies with fuller eyebrows</li>
            <li> Love this product if your natural brows have a brown greyish look to them then you&#x27;ll love this! It dries perfectly, stays in place, and matches my brows perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love this pomade! It lasts all day and looks natural. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Water proof, easily blendable, set with powder. I will repurchase but it will take forever as I have to use so little product. Can make it look as natural as one would like (spoolie brush FTW) or really glam it up.</li>
            <li> My wife said it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Looks like a dark brown not a medium brown. I would go a shade lighter if you don&#x27;t have hair that is next to black.</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing. It looks natural but still gives you totally defined statement eyebrows. I am in loveeee. I had 3 friends buy it since I showed them!!!</li>
            <li> FAKE NOT THE REAL DEALduct go for it and try it because I promise you&#x27;ll love it! Hope this review helps some of you. : )</li>
            <li> If I use lightly works well for me ... likely should&#x27;ve gotten the lighter shade for me ... but if you are a medium brown ... nice smooth dispensing product!</li>
            <li> MadeIn P.R.C which is a sneaky way to avoid stating MADE IN CHINA</li>
            <li> I loved it! The sellers are amazing, my Dipbrow was lost in the mail and they sent a new one, I absolutely loved the product! It&#x27;s a must have for Make-up artists like myself, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does take a little while to get use to using but after that it is great. Stays on all day. It is a little darker than I was hoping for9 I got the med. Brown). I have med brown hair and it to me is more of a dark brown so I bought the caramel and use them together and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it. My brows have never looked more natural</li>
            <li> Amazing I like the good services&lt;br /&gt;Thank u</li>
            <li> I wanted to be wow&#x27;d by this product but was not.  Not sure that the color I got is the right color for me either.  I am rather light with yellow undertones to my skin.  &amp;#34;don&#x27;t call me olive&amp;#34; lol.  Good product, just not impressed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it came the next day! It was super fast and I was super surprised! I love this product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product . Love how it&#x27;s easy to apply and last all day long.</li>
            <li> The longer I have the product, the less I like it.  I bought it 7 months ago and although I have barely used any of the product (maybe 1/10the of what is in the little jar) it has already begun drying out considerably.  Normally, the need to use such a small amount and having the product last so long would be a major selling point but if the product dries out then it is useless.  I am really disappointed and will not repurchase.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> Love love love that&#x27;s all I can say</li>
            <li> Way too dark . And very heavy , I was very disappointed . I needed to fill in brows. I would recommend MAC powder instead.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff. I personally use an eyeliner brush to put this on. It&#x27;s super smooth, easily blended and looks very natural. My husband thinks it&#x27;s weird women care about their eyebrows yet he seems to compliment me on how I look when I&#x27;ve filled my eyebrows in. It&#x27;s pricier than other eyebrow fill ins but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> nice product, goes on easily but it does not have the staying power that is suggested. Some of the browns colors come out &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; on dark skin.  i just purchased the &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34; and it appears to be best for brown skinned women.</li>
