            <li>I love any product from the Moroccanoil line.</li>
            <li>Would make it more even and not as oily in the areas sprayed.</li>
            <li>Magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many bottles I have bought.  </li>
            <li>Hello, again, my lovely Glamazons.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better to brush your hair lightly after a spraying.</li>
            <li>I have think, wavy hair, and their products tame the frizz, and condition my hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>First time i tried it, I was sold, that was 4 yrs ago.</li>
            <li>which is exactly why I looked for it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly, out of control hair.</li>
            <li>And it really does help.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier for me to get it applied evenly.</li>
            <li>Rub your hand gentle together and then apply to hair.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It can also make your hair look greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t panic if you put too much in, just spray the hairspray over it and it will take that greasy look away.</li>
            <li>I found it is better to spray a little on your hands.  </li>
            <li>Pretty smell.&lt;br /&gt;However, one using is not enough for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All I will ever use on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I spray some in my hand and apply to hair or spray from far enough away that there is a mist instead of directly spraying any area.  </li>
            <li>Be careful, this can weigh your hair down my fine haired babes.</li>
            <li>For me,  spraying directly to hair was too much and made my hair feel weighted down and oily.</li>

            <li> unfortunately one butylёk crashed entirety as long as has been delivered to the address((((</li>
            <li> i purchase this from my hairdresser before so I have used the product.  It really shines your hair, the smell of it is wonderful.  Would love a perfume in this scent.  Of course the price on Amazon is cheaper which is exactly why I looked for it on Amazon.  Will buy from here from now on</li>
            <li> Love this glimmer!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is absolutely beautiful from this product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to have perfect hair!!</li>
            <li> I have very curly, out of control hair. My hair salon introduced me to Moroccan Oil several years ago. And it really does help. But I wasn&#x27;t able to get it spread around effectively. Once I saw there was a spray option I was delighted. It is so much easier for me to get it applied evenly. LOVE IT!</li>

            <li> Very good effect. Pretty smell.&lt;br /&gt;However, one using is not enough for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better to brush your hair lightly after a spraying.</li>
            <li> Great product. Like the way it makes my hair shine!</li>

            <li> This product is great! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I wish it would spray wider areas. Would make it more even and not as oily in the areas sprayed.</li>
            <li> WORDS AD ADVERTISED  WOULD ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair shine and smells great.</li>
            <li> Magic in a bottle. The smell is to die for. Yummy.</li>
            <li> I love this spray!!!  I don&#x27;t know how many bottles I have bought.  It adds shine to my hair and smells great!</li>
            <li> Hello, again, my lovely Glamazons. As you all know, I am not a fan of Moroccan Oil. I am, however, a fan of the glimmer shine spray. This is an amazing detangler!! yes, I said detangler. Spritz in damp hair and use a wide tooth comb to detangle. I also like it (in moderation) as a finishing shine spray post blow out. Be careful, this can weigh your hair down my fine haired babes. It can also make your hair look greasy if you use too much. Don&#x27;t panic if you put too much in, just spray the hairspray over it and it will take that greasy look away. Till next time, smoochie smooch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro/ Owner of Glamour Couture PA, NJ, NY</li>
