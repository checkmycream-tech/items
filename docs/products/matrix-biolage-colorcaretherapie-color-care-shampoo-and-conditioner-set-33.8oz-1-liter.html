            <li>I love the aroma of the shampoo and my hair looks healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li>Amazon by far had the best price even with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers this set at a great price!</li>
            <li>and I was immediately happy with my good, old biolage.  </li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is good, nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>Now I have two huge bottles of crappy shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;m not even sure I want to put on my dogs!</li>
            <li>Biolage&#x27;s fragrance is still one of my favorite smells in the world, but I can&#x27;t deal with the side effects.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>It seems more like a clarifier.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It not only smelled wonderful, it made my hair feel like silk.</li>
            <li>clear smooth and smells great!</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I have been using this for many years&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>Biolage is simply the best shampoo and conditioner for your hair.</li>
            <li>I had been using Biolage Color Care for the better part of a decade, and nothing would have convinced me to switch to something else.  </li>
            <li>and I was unsure of what to try next because I haven&#x27;t been impressed with any of</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love both shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The water here contains too many minerals which damage the hair.  </li>
            <li>but it was ok over all.</li>
            <li>i think because its a set it appeals more to me rather then buying a shampoo from someone then conditioner from another...</li>
            <li>was expecting more from.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell stays with you throughout the day where most products fade.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel and</li>
            <li>Love the aroma when using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo, love the smell.</li>
            <li>Now I can always get my favorite hair care products without waiting for the salon to get them in stock.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li>great product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love the biolage smell and recommend the brand to everyone.</li>
            <li>Love it, just want I wanted</li>
            <li>Wish it were more eco-friendly.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the entire deal and all was perfect……</li>
            <li>and I think that using a color care shampoo &amp; conditioner helps my color to hold better.  </li>
            <li>I had to remedy the situation with 1.99 Garnier Nutrisse conditioner which worked better than this supposed salon quality product.</li>
            <li>She has colored her hair and it makes her hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>have always enjoyed all of the Matrix products.</li>
            <li>But they smell like an exotic flower.</li>
            <li>Love both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>There okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better product.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this shampoo &amp; conditioner, so does my hubby &amp; son.</li>
            <li>I love this product anyway and as soon as I saw how low the price was I fell in love!!!</li>
            <li>Gentle on hair and color, but very effective cleaner and conditioner.</li>
            <li>First I want to comment the seller was great, fast shipping, good packaging, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The conditioner does not weight down and provides great moisture and also works as a great detangler.</li>
            <li>High quality shampoo and conditioner for a great price.  </li>
            <li>Matrix Biolage is THE perfect match for my dry, split hair many years ago.</li>
            <li>Bought it on a whim since it had so many good reviews and figured there&#x27;s not much worse my hair can do.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>Everyone should find their own match, and this one is worth trying if you are still searching.</li>
            <li>The seller was quick to ship this to me and very easy to deal with, and someone I would use again.</li>
            <li>She strongly recommends both products and said it has made her hair stronger, shiner and softer.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely thrilled, one that I found what I was looking for at a reasonable price and two, the product was delivered with no delay!</li>
            <li>The shampoo I received was fine</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product, thanks!</li>
            <li>When I first began to use the product, that same wonderful scent was there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 6 years and ever since I bought it from this site, it makes my head super itchy!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>Free Shipping was a bonus as well.</li>
            <li>Received two shampoo&#x27;s instead of a duo of shampoo and conditioner, with no returns available.</li>
            <li>The products meets my expectations and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>These are great especially the price!</li>
            <li>I still think my hair does best when I own several shampoo/conditioner brands and alternate between them once in a while.</li>
            <li>It is light without that greasy feel.</li>
            <li>It is also not tested on animals, which is personally important to me.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair silky and smooth all the time.  </li>
            <li>Amazing how fast they processed my order.</li>
            <li>My hair was healthy, shiny, full of body, and my color stayed true.  </li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo many times and enjoy the way it treats my hair as well as the fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Love this product works excellent for the after perm or high lighting to gently keep hair healthy and lasting curls</li>
            <li>Not only did they leave my hair smelling wonderful but also silky and soft, easy to work with and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smells great, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, manages to remove most of the product build up in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love them very much.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Great to be able to get it for less from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my first substandard Amazon purchase and I&#x27;m sure amazon would have accepted return</li>
            <li>My wife was so excited when she rec&#x27;d</li>
            <li>I received these today and am so excited.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t not add any coating to my hair and comes out squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair clean and shinier.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo gets your hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, leaves your hair very nice, soft, shinny and can be used daily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, very cheap for how much you&#x27;re getting for a brand name.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair super soft and very shiny, my hair is in great condition even though Ive colored it and use heat on it.    </li>
            <li>The pump did not work and the shampoo and conditioner were nothing special.</li>
            <li>These products smell amazing and leave my hair soft amd shiny.</li>
            <li>I used to use this shampoo and conditioner because I love the smell so much.</li>
            <li>it  makes the color look very shiny and your hair look healthy.</li>
            <li>The price is such a good deal</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good shampoo that strengthens and adds anti-frizz effects.</li>
            <li>Like the smell, does a good job of cleaning and conditioning respectively.  </li>
            <li>Keeps it shiny and full of body.</li>
            <li>Great product just what I expected and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Other stuff I ordered last time was better but this is still good - its Biolage - love the smell!</li>
            <li>but haven;t had that a-ha moment I have with other great hair products.</li>
            <li>I love biolage and this shampoo and conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair too much and is great for color.</li>
            <li>My last purchase of the same set of products was wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>since often times I shower twice a day and go through it quickly.</li>
            <li>and my hair is soft, silky, and very strong since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find shampoos that will help keep your hair looking nice for a while when it&#x27;s a bright color</li>
            <li>Everytime I use this product my hair is silky and smooth, it really doesn&#x27;t leave gunk on my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells great and you can feel the change in your texture after a few washes.</li>
            <li>people have no idea what gets absorbed into the body through the skin.....</li>
            <li>i would recommend this to anyone it truly is worth what it costs.</li>
            <li>I can now go almost 3 full months before dying is absolutely required!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner, it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I wanted to return the set but mailing liquids isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this product does a great job of being moisturizing enough without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed that right away.  </li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>the whole Biolage line is wonderful and all natural, not using any of the harsh chemicals that are fillers in cheaper products.</li>
            <li>She was excited to have a large bottle of this since she hasn&#x27;t seen any this large for purchase.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased a set of the shampoo and conditioner based on my stylists recommendation and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I try to be very gentle and pull the product through to the ends and everytime, I end up with a handful of hair that have been pulled out in the process.  </li>
            <li>Biolage is the only consistent product that keeps my hair looking and feeling great; and even though it can be difficult to find a good deal on it ($15/Liter), it&#x27;s worth looking.</li>
            <li>so my husband was willing to keep the shampoo and conditioner for himself</li>
            <li>is the first &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I think I may have to go back to my $3 a bottle brand which works a lot better.</li>
            <li>This is my regular shampoo and the value is much better</li>
            <li>This however, is the real product!</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have been using Matrix Biolage for several months and we absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Trick is to use conditioner on your ends first and than work your way up to the roots.</li>
            <li>Thanks for that!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced anything negative with this product</li>
            <li>only stuff i use love it</li>
            <li>I have thick highlighted hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>this is the third time I have done this if I get any more of these request on this item</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the shampoo more than the conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the Matrix Biolage color care set.</li>
            <li>Wish I had just tried this first.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love the big bottles as I don&#x27;t have buy for awhile.</li>
            <li>I had bought a set of these at a beauty supply store a few months ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>1-Liter size is more economical than the smaller sizes available locally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a fresh scent not really a floral scent.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of this from a local Ulta beauty store before shelling out the money for the bigger bottle and loved it.</li>
            <li>We have used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>This is normally true but my hair is not dried out at all...</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good shampoo/conditioner for everyday use that won&#x27;t break the bank, you have found it!</li>
            <li>I have used Biolage for many years and it has never made my hair feel dry and brittle like this has.</li>
            <li>My hair feels super soft and not greasy at all after using.</li>
            <li>My kids &amp; I have been using these products for a few years &amp; we absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>I have tried switching several times but my fine color treated hair</li>
            <li>I like buying shampoo and conditioner in bulk at decent prices (yay amazon!)</li>
            <li>- the conditioner does absolutely nothing to condition/de-tangle and my hair feels like straw.  </li>
            <li>If you still decide to purchase, do not discard packaging until you can confirm the product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This however is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers and cleanses very well without leaving the \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; feeling.    </li>
            <li>Since it is for color treated hair, it is very moisturizing because they assume coloring your hair dries it out.  </li>
            <li>She had both of them in the real version untill</li>
            <li>I think these really help my color, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner really soften the hair.</li>
            <li>didnt do much for my color</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li>Seems to keep my colored hair from fading as fast as it used to.  </li>
            <li>Product came fast.</li>
            <li>I will always highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is really Biolage.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I feel like it wasn&#x27;t a real Matrix Biolage Color Care Shampoo</li>
            <li>High Quality!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like the conditioner does much</li>
            <li>and this is nothing like the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I had heard that all shampoos are the same, but after trying this at a friends house, and then buying my own, I know there is a big difference.</li>
            <li>With the previous bottles I had, my hair was super easy to comb out after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time using it was ok,  but noticed flaky scalp and little scabs.  </li>
            <li>It really helps lock-in and protect my new color!  </li>
            <li>Good product that protects my hair color and has a subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was a fast and easy process with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>bright red a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li>So if you have dry colored hair, this product will be fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in bulk for a decent price after my hair dresser had been washing my hair with it.  </li>
            <li>but maybe i had too high of expectations.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brand of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t condition very well and left my hair dry and tangled</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft and manageable!!</li>
            <li>I found I have allergies to some Aveda products, and Tresemme caused an old dandruff spot to really get out of control.</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of biolage and with this combo pack I saved a few bucks verses buying in store.</li>
            <li>I used to get compliments on my hair all the time, but since I started using this, I have actually had people ask me if I&#x27;m feeling all right.  </li>
            <li>smells different than the one my stylist used which is the same brand but makes my hair really shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>Though the price looks high it actually comes out very reasonable for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>Very nice floral smell, but not overpowering and suffocating.  </li>
            <li>Add the conditioner and my pretty hair color remains vibrant until my next appointment.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use anything but Biolage, it takes care of damaged hair and makes it like new.  </li>
            <li>Super dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li>The scent of the salon purchased shampoo was completely different from what I received; the amazon purchased shampoo smelled exactly like my dish washing detergent.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to dye my hair pretty religiously every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Completely unsatisfied!</li>
            <li>love the smell but not sure of results....</li>
            <li>This is exact same brand I purchase in stores except the smell</li>
            <li>Now I use 2 conditioners because I don&#x27;t want to waste this huge bottle of conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It feels like conditioner (it&#x27;s not, because it foams and behaves like a shampoo), but it doesn&#x27;t get my hair as clean as the previous formula.</li>
            <li>Getting the big bottles from Amazon really saves me money.  </li>
            <li>That hasn&#x27;t happened to me, but then, I have naturally oily hair.  </li>
            <li>Preserves my hair color and highlights while keeping my hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>She is a blonde and says that it is much cheaper value if bought on amazon.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Now that my hair is natural and colored again it still works wonders.</li>
            <li>I have colored and naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s a bit expensive for shampoo and conditioner, but worth every dime.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive product, even though I felt I dealt with good price.</li>
            <li>According to the smaller bottles I have here, they should be the same exact thing</li>
            <li>and if I am consistent in using this product only I can definitely see an improvement.</li>
            <li>I bought this set on Amazon, and despite having the exact same label and ingredient list, it was NOT the same stuff inside the bottles.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, and it is quality shampoo and conditioner for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and really does help the color stay in my hair for a long time.</li>
            <li>Works just as expected, maybe a little better.</li>
            <li>The order came on time but this conditioner seems to make my hair really dry and makes it very tangled -</li>
            <li>She will have no other product.    </li>
            <li>They smell like the real deal and so far, it makes my hair feel like the other one I had bought for $35 a bottle.</li>
            <li>But the shampoo formula seems to have been changed; whereas it&#x27;s always been a clear liquid, now it&#x27;s white and creamy.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the quality when ordering my regular shampoo off of the internet (i thought I might get old conditioner that was sitting in the salon window on display or something).  </li>
            <li>I will go back to my old Matrix</li>
            <li>I am going to be checking at a hair salon near me to see if it smells the same or not.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a professional shampoo that actually works.</li>
            <li>&amp; it got kinda itchy; after towel/air (not blow) drying my hair, it didn&#x27;t feel any better - matter of fact, it felt worse.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t work any better than store-bought products, and the bottles were poorly designed.</li>
            <li>The new formula makes my hair soft, sure, but it&#x27;s also dull and limp.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner does not smell anything like my previous bottle, or a sample that I first tried.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what changed, but I&#x27;m super picky about smells and this just isn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li>(i have long hair)i went online right away to buy one for myself (not for color treatment like she uses), and im never gonna use any other brand</li>
            <li>My hubby has fine, thin hair &amp; my son and I have thick, full hair.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling dry, rough, coarse and very tangled.</li>
            <li>I see other reviews stating that the new formula turned their hair to straw.  </li>
            <li>Although on first look rather pricey, a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I have dry, colored hair thinking that it would really leave my hair silky (as other reviewers have mentioned)</li>

            <li> I love the aroma of the shampoo and my hair looks healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li> Amazon by far had the best price even with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers this set at a great price!</li>
            <li> and I was immediately happy with my good, old biolage.  </li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is good, nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> Now I have two huge bottles of crappy shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;m not even sure I want to put on my dogs!</li>
            <li> Biolage&#x27;s fragrance is still one of my favorite smells in the world, but I can&#x27;t deal with the side effects.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> It seems more like a clarifier.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It not only smelled wonderful, it made my hair feel like silk.</li>
            <li> clear smooth and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I have been using this for many years&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> Biolage is simply the best shampoo and conditioner for your hair.</li>
            <li> I had been using Biolage Color Care for the better part of a decade, and nothing would have convinced me to switch to something else.  </li>
            <li> and I was unsure of what to try next because I haven&#x27;t been impressed with any of</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Love both shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The water here contains too many minerals which damage the hair.  </li>
            <li> but it was ok over all.</li>
            <li> i think because its a set it appeals more to me rather then buying a shampoo from someone then conditioner from another...</li>
            <li> was expecting more from.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> The smell stays with you throughout the day where most products fade.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and</li>
            <li> Love the aroma when using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo, love the smell.</li>
            <li> Now I can always get my favorite hair care products without waiting for the salon to get them in stock.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li> great product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love the biolage smell and recommend the brand to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love it, just want I wanted</li>
            <li> Wish it were more eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the entire deal and all was perfect……</li>
            <li> and I think that using a color care shampoo &amp; conditioner helps my color to hold better.  </li>
            <li> I had to remedy the situation with 1.99 Garnier Nutrisse conditioner which worked better than this supposed salon quality product.</li>
            <li> She has colored her hair and it makes her hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> have always enjoyed all of the Matrix products.</li>
            <li> But they smell like an exotic flower.</li>
            <li> Love both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> There okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better product.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this shampoo &amp; conditioner, so does my hubby &amp; son.</li>
            <li> I love this product anyway and as soon as I saw how low the price was I fell in love!!!</li>
            <li> Gentle on hair and color, but very effective cleaner and conditioner.</li>
            <li> First I want to comment the seller was great, fast shipping, good packaging, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner does not weight down and provides great moisture and also works as a great detangler.</li>
            <li> High quality shampoo and conditioner for a great price.  </li>
            <li> Matrix Biolage is THE perfect match for my dry, split hair many years ago.</li>
            <li> Bought it on a whim since it had so many good reviews and figured there&#x27;s not much worse my hair can do.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> Everyone should find their own match, and this one is worth trying if you are still searching.</li>
            <li> The seller was quick to ship this to me and very easy to deal with, and someone I would use again.</li>
            <li> She strongly recommends both products and said it has made her hair stronger, shiner and softer.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely thrilled, one that I found what I was looking for at a reasonable price and two, the product was delivered with no delay!</li>
            <li> The shampoo I received was fine</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, thanks!</li>
            <li> When I first began to use the product, that same wonderful scent was there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 6 years and ever since I bought it from this site, it makes my head super itchy!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Free Shipping was a bonus as well.</li>
            <li> Received two shampoo&#x27;s instead of a duo of shampoo and conditioner, with no returns available.</li>
            <li> The products meets my expectations and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> These are great especially the price!</li>
            <li> I still think my hair does best when I own several shampoo/conditioner brands and alternate between them once in a while.</li>
            <li> It is light without that greasy feel.</li>
            <li> It is also not tested on animals, which is personally important to me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair silky and smooth all the time.  </li>
            <li> Amazing how fast they processed my order.</li>
            <li> My hair was healthy, shiny, full of body, and my color stayed true.  </li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo many times and enjoy the way it treats my hair as well as the fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product works excellent for the after perm or high lighting to gently keep hair healthy and lasting curls</li>
            <li> Not only did they leave my hair smelling wonderful but also silky and soft, easy to work with and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smells great, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, manages to remove most of the product build up in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love them very much.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Great to be able to get it for less from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my first substandard Amazon purchase and I&#x27;m sure amazon would have accepted return</li>
            <li> My wife was so excited when she rec&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I received these today and am so excited.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t not add any coating to my hair and comes out squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair clean and shinier.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo gets your hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, leaves your hair very nice, soft, shinny and can be used daily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, very cheap for how much you&#x27;re getting for a brand name.</li>
            <li> They leave my hair super soft and very shiny, my hair is in great condition even though Ive colored it and use heat on it.    </li>
            <li> The pump did not work and the shampoo and conditioner were nothing special.</li>
            <li> These products smell amazing and leave my hair soft amd shiny.</li>
            <li> I used to use this shampoo and conditioner because I love the smell so much.</li>
            <li> it  makes the color look very shiny and your hair look healthy.</li>
            <li> The price is such a good deal</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good shampoo that strengthens and adds anti-frizz effects.</li>
            <li> Like the smell, does a good job of cleaning and conditioning respectively.  </li>
            <li> Keeps it shiny and full of body.</li>
            <li> Great product just what I expected and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Other stuff I ordered last time was better but this is still good - its Biolage - love the smell!</li>
            <li> but haven;t had that a-ha moment I have with other great hair products.</li>
            <li> I love biolage and this shampoo and conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair too much and is great for color.</li>
            <li> My last purchase of the same set of products was wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> since often times I shower twice a day and go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> and my hair is soft, silky, and very strong since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find shampoos that will help keep your hair looking nice for a while when it&#x27;s a bright color</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this product my hair is silky and smooth, it really doesn&#x27;t leave gunk on my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells great and you can feel the change in your texture after a few washes.</li>
            <li> people have no idea what gets absorbed into the body through the skin.....</li>
            <li> i would recommend this to anyone it truly is worth what it costs.</li>
            <li> I can now go almost 3 full months before dying is absolutely required!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I wanted to return the set but mailing liquids isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product does a great job of being moisturizing enough without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed that right away.  </li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> the whole Biolage line is wonderful and all natural, not using any of the harsh chemicals that are fillers in cheaper products.</li>
            <li> She was excited to have a large bottle of this since she hasn&#x27;t seen any this large for purchase.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a set of the shampoo and conditioner based on my stylists recommendation and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I try to be very gentle and pull the product through to the ends and everytime, I end up with a handful of hair that have been pulled out in the process.  </li>
            <li> Biolage is the only consistent product that keeps my hair looking and feeling great; and even though it can be difficult to find a good deal on it ($15/Liter), it&#x27;s worth looking.</li>
            <li> so my husband was willing to keep the shampoo and conditioner for himself</li>
            <li> is the first &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I think I may have to go back to my $3 a bottle brand which works a lot better.</li>
            <li> This is my regular shampoo and the value is much better</li>
            <li> This however, is the real product!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using Matrix Biolage for several months and we absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Trick is to use conditioner on your ends first and than work your way up to the roots.</li>
            <li> Thanks for that!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced anything negative with this product</li>
            <li> only stuff i use love it</li>
            <li> I have thick highlighted hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> this is the third time I have done this if I get any more of these request on this item</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the shampoo more than the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Matrix Biolage color care set.</li>
            <li> Wish I had just tried this first.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love the big bottles as I don&#x27;t have buy for awhile.</li>
            <li> I had bought a set of these at a beauty supply store a few months ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> 1-Liter size is more economical than the smaller sizes available locally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a fresh scent not really a floral scent.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this from a local Ulta beauty store before shelling out the money for the bigger bottle and loved it.</li>
            <li> We have used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> This is normally true but my hair is not dried out at all...</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good shampoo/conditioner for everyday use that won&#x27;t break the bank, you have found it!</li>
            <li> I have used Biolage for many years and it has never made my hair feel dry and brittle like this has.</li>
            <li> My hair feels super soft and not greasy at all after using.</li>
            <li> My kids &amp; I have been using these products for a few years &amp; we absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> I have tried switching several times but my fine color treated hair</li>
            <li> I like buying shampoo and conditioner in bulk at decent prices (yay amazon!)</li>
            <li> - the conditioner does absolutely nothing to condition/de-tangle and my hair feels like straw.  </li>
            <li> If you still decide to purchase, do not discard packaging until you can confirm the product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This however is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers and cleanses very well without leaving the \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; feeling.    </li>
            <li> Since it is for color treated hair, it is very moisturizing because they assume coloring your hair dries it out.  </li>
            <li> She had both of them in the real version untill</li>
            <li> I think these really help my color, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner really soften the hair.</li>
            <li> didnt do much for my color</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> Seems to keep my colored hair from fading as fast as it used to.  </li>
            <li> Product came fast.</li>
            <li> I will always highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is really Biolage.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> I feel like it wasn&#x27;t a real Matrix Biolage Color Care Shampoo</li>
            <li> High Quality!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like the conditioner does much</li>
            <li> and this is nothing like the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I had heard that all shampoos are the same, but after trying this at a friends house, and then buying my own, I know there is a big difference.</li>
            <li> With the previous bottles I had, my hair was super easy to comb out after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time using it was ok,  but noticed flaky scalp and little scabs.  </li>
            <li> It really helps lock-in and protect my new color!  </li>
            <li> Good product that protects my hair color and has a subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Other than that, it was a fast and easy process with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> bright red a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> So if you have dry colored hair, this product will be fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in bulk for a decent price after my hair dresser had been washing my hair with it.  </li>
            <li> but maybe i had too high of expectations.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brand of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t condition very well and left my hair dry and tangled</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft and manageable!!</li>
            <li> I found I have allergies to some Aveda products, and Tresemme caused an old dandruff spot to really get out of control.</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of biolage and with this combo pack I saved a few bucks verses buying in store.</li>
            <li> I used to get compliments on my hair all the time, but since I started using this, I have actually had people ask me if I&#x27;m feeling all right.  </li>
            <li> smells different than the one my stylist used which is the same brand but makes my hair really shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> Though the price looks high it actually comes out very reasonable for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Very nice floral smell, but not overpowering and suffocating.  </li>
            <li> Add the conditioner and my pretty hair color remains vibrant until my next appointment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything but Biolage, it takes care of damaged hair and makes it like new.  </li>
            <li> Super dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li> The scent of the salon purchased shampoo was completely different from what I received; the amazon purchased shampoo smelled exactly like my dish washing detergent.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to dye my hair pretty religiously every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Completely unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> love the smell but not sure of results....</li>
            <li> This is exact same brand I purchase in stores except the smell</li>
            <li> Now I use 2 conditioners because I don&#x27;t want to waste this huge bottle of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It feels like conditioner (it&#x27;s not, because it foams and behaves like a shampoo), but it doesn&#x27;t get my hair as clean as the previous formula.</li>
            <li> Getting the big bottles from Amazon really saves me money.  </li>
            <li> That hasn&#x27;t happened to me, but then, I have naturally oily hair.  </li>
            <li> Preserves my hair color and highlights while keeping my hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> She is a blonde and says that it is much cheaper value if bought on amazon.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Now that my hair is natural and colored again it still works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have colored and naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s a bit expensive for shampoo and conditioner, but worth every dime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive product, even though I felt I dealt with good price.</li>
            <li> According to the smaller bottles I have here, they should be the same exact thing</li>
            <li> and if I am consistent in using this product only I can definitely see an improvement.</li>
            <li> I bought this set on Amazon, and despite having the exact same label and ingredient list, it was NOT the same stuff inside the bottles.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, and it is quality shampoo and conditioner for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and really does help the color stay in my hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected, maybe a little better.</li>
            <li> The order came on time but this conditioner seems to make my hair really dry and makes it very tangled -</li>
            <li> She will have no other product.    </li>
            <li> They smell like the real deal and so far, it makes my hair feel like the other one I had bought for $35 a bottle.</li>
            <li> But the shampoo formula seems to have been changed; whereas it&#x27;s always been a clear liquid, now it&#x27;s white and creamy.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the quality when ordering my regular shampoo off of the internet (i thought I might get old conditioner that was sitting in the salon window on display or something).  </li>
            <li> I will go back to my old Matrix</li>
            <li> I am going to be checking at a hair salon near me to see if it smells the same or not.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a professional shampoo that actually works.</li>
            <li> &amp; it got kinda itchy; after towel/air (not blow) drying my hair, it didn&#x27;t feel any better - matter of fact, it felt worse.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work any better than store-bought products, and the bottles were poorly designed.</li>
            <li> The new formula makes my hair soft, sure, but it&#x27;s also dull and limp.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner does not smell anything like my previous bottle, or a sample that I first tried.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what changed, but I&#x27;m super picky about smells and this just isn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li> (i have long hair)i went online right away to buy one for myself (not for color treatment like she uses), and im never gonna use any other brand</li>
            <li> My hubby has fine, thin hair &amp; my son and I have thick, full hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dry, rough, coarse and very tangled.</li>
            <li> I see other reviews stating that the new formula turned their hair to straw.  </li>
            <li> Although on first look rather pricey, a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I have dry, colored hair thinking that it would really leave my hair silky (as other reviewers have mentioned)</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that gets tangled to the point that I would have to cut it, but since I started using this shampoo and conditioner, I finally can grow my hair almost to my waist</li>
            <li> It completely stripped my hair, leaving it in a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> but it just makes my hair so dry, which sucks because I really wanted this stuff to work!</li>
            <li> my hair was very dry prior to purchasing and probably shouldn&#x27;t expect miracles.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely NOT the same product that I have been buying in stores!</li>
            <li> and my color didn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> the smaller size, and price was half of what I paid for smaller size.</li>
            <li> Just finishe my previous bottle, open this one, and it does not smell, feel, or work the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for soooo long!</li>
            <li> so it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I keep trying other shampoos - Aveda, Tresemme, etc. - and always go back to Biolage.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smelled and worked differently than before, causing my hair to be extremely knotted and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products but always come back to this pair.  </li>
            <li> Never dries it out or makes it coarse like some other brands.  </li>
            <li> It also seemed to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> it is still THAT dry.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s DRY and brittle feeling, and my hair is never like that.  </li>
            <li> me a dry, flaky scalp</li>
            <li> (I have long, thick hair) and let it sit for a minute or two, as is my normal routine.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo is fine (nothing special about it) and the conditioner is horrible!!!!</li>
            <li> I had previously been using biolage from a different supplier and never had that issue, but I am underwhelmed by the way this duo makes my hear feel.  </li>
            <li> This product is the best and it is always hard to find this product in salons for this price, usually this product is just the base product without color protection.  </li>
            <li> so why not pay a little extra to keep it on your head longer?</li>
            <li> (he&#x27;s bald so not much risk</li>
            <li> The items came when expected so that was another plus.</li>
            <li> I high-light my hair regularly and always use a round of Matrix Biolage Color Care afterward.  </li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> I wanted the soft and thick feel of my hair and this product does it.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and frizzy, I have long colored hair, and this left me wondering whats wrong with my hair, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for quiet a few months now and my hair is healthier then ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews of this situation happening, but never thought it would happen through Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> The exact same brand scent and color care except the smell is 100% different (terrible like an old bar of soap) and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened between my last shipment and this one</li>
            <li> The conditioner, on the other hand, I just can&#x27;t even work it through my hair.  </li>
            <li> received on time and item is as expected thank you!</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviewer, none of us have had any issues with prolonged use.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife and she says shampoo is real but conditioner is fake.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long dark hair and usually have issues with oily hair</li>
            <li> I ordered the shampoo late one night and it was delivered the next morning!</li>
            <li> More than half of the time, it does make my hair soft &amp; shiny, but I still get some bad hair days, so I am not very much impressed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip it, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist cringed when I told her what product I typically use which I buy at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Biolage for half the cost?</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this and the conditioner was not good this time.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a tangled mess and even after using tons of conditioner</li>
            <li> did eventually break down in desperation and use it for a few days</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve just decided I&#x27;m dumping the conditioner despite the fact that I&#x27;ve only used about 10% of the product but life is too short to put up with bad hair or bad hair products :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Matrix changed their formula, or if Inwas sold a bait and switch, but I use this because it is the only conditioner I found that allowed me to brush my hair without adding detangler, since I moved to an area with hard water.  </li>
            <li> i have been using this product since i was a little girl and stopped using it for a while once i started dying my hair</li>
            <li> Wash and condition every other day usually.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry and dull hair</li>
            <li> Appreciate the packaging contained the two heavy shampoo and conditioner bottles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> This product is sort of too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> and she said that since its on the heavy side on my hair, I need to use a clarifying shampoo once a week to take away the build-up.  </li>
            <li> It helps to preserve the color and does not leave a heavy build-up on your hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair fluffy &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed with the smell of the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The scent was completely different and the products left my hair feeling like straw, and it was very difficult to comb out after washing.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the same at all, it actually smells like dish soap or bad hand soap.</li>
            <li> What everyone else giving a 1 star said - been using Biolage for years and while the shampoo seems ok, the conditioner smells terrible and doesn&#x27;t condition (</li>
            <li> Usually this is $30 a bottle at the beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> And I use a leave in conditioner and argan oil, so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> is 100% different (terrible, like it&#x27;s been expired or sitting in a hot warehouse) and</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure what I got</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like Biolage or leave my hair like Biolage usually does.</li>
            <li> and then I add a small amount of my usual go-to conditioner</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down thin hair but moisturizing for thick hair</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews that were negative, but my hairdresser uses these products so I decided to buy them.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone with colored treated hair , and I can come through my thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> so it is also thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old, fake, or just a terrible new formula, but the conditioner is horrendous!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner did not smell like it should.... not authentic biolage!</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> Have been purchasing this dual pack twice a year for the past 3 yrs!</li>
            <li> my color stays in WAAAY longer than other shampoo types, yes sort of expensive but dont you pay a lot to have your hair colored?</li>
            <li> We both have very thick hair</li>
            <li> This was almost worse.  </li>
            <li> but I am not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I use this over and over and never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews here, I am HIGHLY disappointed in this.  </li>
            <li> Major disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended it to me when she saw how dry and tangled my hair was, and now when I went to trim it, the lady said it was the healthiest hair she had ever seen and felt bad to cut it!</li>
            <li> This item was purchased before it was needed and I (unfortunately) discarded the packaging or it would have been returned.  </li>
            <li> , she noticed one of them was fake.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical buying this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t see any dates on the bottle) or if I was ripped off and it was fake stuff in the Matrix bottle.  </li>
            <li> But after I got out of the shower, when I brushed my hair, it was terrible, so tangled.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo does not have the same consistency and the conditioner smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I use Matrix products every day and there is something seriously wrong with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I knew it was wrong from the smell.</li>
            <li> but once I used it I knew it was wrong.</li>
            <li> My hair stylest refered this product to me becuase my hair was dry and in terrible condition.</li>
            <li> Product is heavy, smells awful and does not condition at all!</li>
            <li> It made my hair worse!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very expensive here in Oz</li>
            <li> How bad could it be?  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s bad.  </li>
            <li> I am incredibly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with the Biolage line of products.  </li>
            <li> I hate this stuff and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I will start finding it annoying  </li>
            <li> It is awful and stinks!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> I had ruined my hair by over coloring it; it looked horrible and scraggly.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all is what it has done to my color.  </li>
            <li> Those of you who have longer, thicker hair probably know what it&#x27;s like to shower and not have conditioner, it&#x27;s horrible.  </li>
            <li> but this one being sold here is terrible!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible, horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> The worst!!!!</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!!!</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This conditioner is NOT Biolage!!! Beware! Product is heavy, smells awful and does not condition at all! Wish I would have read reviews before purchasing! Beware! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> The shampoo I received was fine but the conditioner was not Biolage!!! It smelled like some generic men&#x27;s conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Beware of buying the biologe from this company. It comes in a biologe bottle but smells nothing like it! I have used Biolage for many years and it has never made my hair feel dry and brittle like this has. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased before it was needed and I (unfortunately) discarded the packaging or it would have been returned.  The product received was definitely NOT Matrix Biolage I purchased in a hair salon.  The scent of the salon purchased shampoo was completely different from what I received; the amazon purchased shampoo smelled exactly like my dish washing detergent.  Having color treated hair I didn&#x27;t want to risk use of this product on my own hair so my husband was willing to keep the shampoo and conditioner for himself (he&#x27;s bald so not much risk there).&lt;br /&gt;I did eventually break down in desperation and use it for a few days - the conditioner does absolutely nothing to condition/de-tangle and my hair feels like straw.  Bottom line - Return is still a bit of a hassle so I would recommend not purchasing at all and DO NOT use on color treated hair.This is my first substandard Amazon purchase and I&#x27;m sure amazon would have accepted return had I kept my packaging.  If you still decide to purchase, do not discard packaging until you can confirm the product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> smells different than the one my stylist used which is the same brand but makes my hair really shiny and clean. prob wont buy again though</li>
            <li> I used to use this shampoo and conditioner because I love the smell so much. I still like it once in awhile when they use it at the salon, but I will never buy it again. For one, it irritated my scalp. It also seemed to dry my hair. Biolage&#x27;s fragrance is still one of my favorite smells in the world, but I can&#x27;t deal with the side effects.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this from a local Ulta beauty store before shelling out the money for the bigger bottle and loved it. But somehow these bigger bottles seemed different... According to the smaller bottles I have here, they should be the same exact thing but my hair texture is different than it was when I used the smaller ones I tried...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles were in tact, no leaks and product arrived on time. No complaints on that end.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. I have colored treated hair and it makes a vast difference in texture and appearance.</li>
            <li> Appreciate the packaging contained the two heavy shampoo and conditioner bottles.  They arrived quickly and in good condition.  I would recommend this vendor.  Free Shipping was a bonus as well.</li>
            <li> We have used this product in the past and loved it. This is a great shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair. It will leave your hair very clean and smelling great. It is worth the extra money. Amazon by far had the best price even with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Have been skunked by eBay on this same product. Knockoff contents with the same bottles.  This however is the real deal.  I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while.  First time using it was ok,  but noticed flaky scalp and little scabs.  After several shampoos I noticed build up on my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I looked it up: [...]  and it&#x27;s a 7 on the toxic rating (0-10)  so I am no longer going to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people have no idea what gets absorbed into the body through the skin.....</li>
            <li> Only hair product I use</li>
            <li> Love the product. Have used it for years. Great to be able to get it for less from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner did not smell like it should.... not authentic biolage!</li>
            <li> i bought this one for my wife cause she asked me to, but i had never even heard of this company before that, but after she made me try hers (i have long hair)i went online right away to buy one for myself (not for color treatment like she uses), and im never gonna use any other brand, i dont understand why everyone is not using this, its amazing!!</li>
            <li> i have been using this product since i was a little girl and stopped using it for a while once i started dying my hair this is the product i immediately wanted to try biolage. when i saw the color care line i knew that i had to try it. the product works AMAZINGLY every time i straighten my hair people asked if i dyed it that day. it  makes the color look very shiny and your hair look healthy. i would recommend this to anyone it truly is worth what it costs.</li>
            <li> Whatever was in these bottles was NOT Biolage.  It completely stripped my hair, leaving it in a tangled mess.  I have used Biolage Colorcare for years and have never had these results which leads me to believe something else was in the bottles.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for it.  I bought it because I have dry, colored hair thinking that it would really leave my hair silky (as other reviewers have mentioned) but after I condition it, I can&#x27;t comb through it... it is still THAT dry.  Plus, I seem to be losing quite a lot of hair. It seems more like a clarifier.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner that I&#x27;ve tried and I bought it based off of the reviews.  I think I may have to go back to my $3 a bottle brand which works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely thrilled, one that I found what I was looking for at a reasonable price and two, the product was delivered with no delay! WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> What everyone else giving a 1 star said - been using Biolage for years and while the shampoo seems ok, the conditioner smells terrible and doesn&#x27;t condition (tangles and hair feels like straw). Terrible.</li>
            <li> Other stuff I ordered last time was better but this is still good - its Biolage - love the smell!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. They leave my hair super soft and very shiny, my hair is in great condition even though Ive colored it and use heat on it.    The shampoo lathers and cleanses very well without leaving the \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; feeling.    The conditioner does not weight down and provides great moisture and also works as a great detangler. I can literally run my fingers thru my hair.    And they smell great :)    Amazon offers this set at a great price! I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  It not only smelled wonderful, it made my hair feel like silk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for a few weeks now. Biolage is a very very good brand. This product is sort of too heavy for my hair. Since it is for color treated hair, it is very moisturizing because they assume coloring your hair dries it out.  This is normally true but my hair is not dried out at all...dying my hair seems to make it nicer.  So if you have dry colored hair, this product will be fantastic.  I spoke to a cosmotologist about my situation and she said that since its on the heavy side on my hair, I need to use a clarifying shampoo once a week to take away the build-up.  I hope this review was helpful.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews here, I am HIGHLY disappointed in this.  The shampoo is perfect, but the conditioner smells like pepper and turned my hair to straw!  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old, fake, or just a terrible new formula, but the conditioner is horrendous!</li>
            <li> Amazing product for my color hair.</li>
            <li> I like buying my shampoo/conditioner this way. It lasts a long time, and it is quality shampoo and conditioner for a reasonable price. I wish they offered a pump to go with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything but Biolage, it takes care of damaged hair and makes it like new.  I had ruined my hair by over coloring it; it looked horrible and scraggly.  I went to a hair dresser, she suggested Biolage to get my hair back into shape.  I tried it, it worked wonders on my hair!! now I wont use anything else.  My hair has never felt so soft and manageable!!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this and the conditioner was not good this time. Had a different smell and did not work at all to condition my hair. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling very fresh and clean. I have very dry and dull hair and if I am consistent in using this product only I can definitely see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Biolage Color Care Shampoo is perfect for my highlighted hair.  It helps to preserve the color and does not leave a heavy build-up on your hair.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the quality when ordering my regular shampoo off of the internet (i thought I might get old conditioner that was sitting in the salon window on display or something).  However the product was great and the price was even better. I will def. be ordering from them again!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo/conditioner for years.  I have tried switching several times but my fine color treated hair only seems to like Biolage.  I don&#x27;t plan on ever switching brands!</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife and she says shampoo is real but conditioner is fake. She had both of them in the real version untill i bought them here, she noticed one of them was fake.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product does a great job of being moisturizing enough without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> Very very happy with both the product &amp; the price!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Hair looks great. Plus love the biolage scent!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she swears by it. She will have no other product.    [[ASIN:B000VP9BWW Biolage Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner Liter Set (33.8 Oz)]]</li>
            <li> clear smooth and smells great! this is the one!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome treatment for my hair and at a great price. very nice</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. Have used Biolage for 20+ years!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for soooo long! Works great. Do not need to use a lot so it goes a long way! It definitely prolongs hair colors as well. I used to have to dye my hair pretty religiously every 6 weeks. I can now go almost 3 full months before dying is absolutely required! It also smells good and I am not allergic to it! Totally would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product anyway and as soon as I saw how low the price was I fell in love!!! Awesome shampoo and conditioner for an amazing price!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylest refered this product to me becuase my hair was dry and in terrible condition. I&#x27;ve been using it for quiet a few months now and my hair is healthier then ever! I dye my hair every two months or so and my hair is soft, silky, and very strong since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I have been using this for many years&#x27;. It smells good, and my hair feels better.</li>
            <li> This is my regular shampoo and the value is much better&lt;br /&gt;than the smaller size, and price was half of what I paid for smaller size.</li>
            <li> I got these 32 oz bottles (32oz each) for the same price I would have paid for one 16 oz bottle at a retail store. I love this brand. I have colored hair and need to protect my color and these are perfect!</li>
            <li> Biolage is simply the best shampoo and conditioner for your hair. My hair stylist cringed when I told her what product I typically use which I buy at the grocery store. She recommended Biolage, which smells fantastic and keeps my hair looking great. Sure it&#x27;s a bit expensive for shampoo and conditioner, but worth every dime.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical buying this from Amazon. Working in the beauty industry, I have learned there are a lot of counterfit products out there! Even when I have purchased this at local grocery stores or drug stores, the quality is not the same. This however, is the real product! These products smell amazing and leave my hair soft amd shiny. Biolage has the best quality haircare products I have found. I reccomend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Good product that protects my hair color and has a subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The 1-Liter size is more economical than the smaller sizes available locally.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and frizzy, I have long colored hair, and this left me wondering whats wrong with my hair, and I remembered that I changed shampoo. I will go back to my old Matrix</li>
            <li> smells great, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, manages to remove most of the product build up in my hair.  Getting the big bottles from Amazon really saves me money.  I have wavy/curly hair with medium density and I never go through the same amount of shampoo/conditioner so this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I had been using Biolage Color Care for the better part of a decade, and nothing would have convinced me to switch to something else.  My hair was healthy, shiny, full of body, and my color stayed true.  That&#x27;s why I wasn&#x27;t concerned when I saw that the formula had changed.  How bad could it be?  Well, it&#x27;s bad.  I see other reviews stating that the new formula turned their hair to straw.  That hasn&#x27;t happened to me, but then, I have naturally oily hair.  The new formula makes my hair soft, sure, but it&#x27;s also dull and limp.  Worst of all is what it has done to my color.  Grays started showing through within a couple of uses.  I used to get compliments on my hair all the time, but since I started using this, I have actually had people ask me if I&#x27;m feeling all right.  No more!  I&#x27;m off to buy some Redken.</li>
            <li> I have been using these 2 products for years and they are perfect for keeping your coloring in your hair and not having it to come out.  I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I think these really help my color, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months. The price is such a good deal and I was unsure of what to try next because I haven&#x27;t been impressed with any of my shampoos or conditioners sense I died my hair bright red a little over a year ago. It&#x27;s very hard to find shampoos that will help keep your hair looking nice for a while when it&#x27;s a bright color but I like these, I&#x27;ll definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using Matrix Biolage for several months and we absolutely love this product.  It is great for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the way it makes my hair feel. I will purchase this item again. The items came when expected so that was another plus.</li>
            <li> GRET PRICE FOR GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This is really a good shampoo for color treated hair.  I like to alternate this with the Macadamia Nut&lt;br /&gt;flawless shampoo and conditioner in one.....Biolage always puts out a good product.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner.  I use a lot of the conditioner because it&#x27;s not as conditioning as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t not add any coating to my hair and comes out squeaky clean. Preserves my hair color and highlights while keeping my hair manageable and soft. I really like it. I have lots of fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t make it oily. Trick is to use conditioner on your ends first and than work your way up to the roots. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great match of shampoo and conditioner. I had heard that all shampoos are the same, but after trying this at a friends house, and then buying my own, I know there is a big difference.</li>
            <li> Love both shampoo and conditioner.  Leaves hair very soft and radiant.  The water here contains too many minerals which damage the hair.  The shampoo and conditioner really soften the hair.</li>
            <li> didnt do much for my color but it was ok over all. i think because its a set it appeals more to me rather then buying a shampoo from someone then conditioner from another...</li>
            <li> I am incredibly disappointed.  I bought this product after going through two bottles of the same product from a different vendor.  I wanted bigger bottles that would last longer and I decided to go through Amazon Prime because I figured that would be my safest bet.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews of this situation happening, but never thought it would happen through Amazon Prime.  I&#x27;ve only used the conditioner, but at this point, I&#x27;m not even going to try the shampoo.  The conditioner does not smell anything like my previous bottle, or a sample that I first tried.  I noticed that right away.  I then put it in my hair (I have long, thick hair) and let it sit for a minute or two, as is my normal routine.  I might as well have not put anything in my hair with the way it rinsed out.  It did not condition at all.  Those of you who have longer, thicker hair probably know what it&#x27;s like to shower and not have conditioner, it&#x27;s horrible.  This was almost worse.  I don&#x27;t know if it was expired (I didn&#x27;t see any dates on the bottle) or if I was ripped off and it was fake stuff in the Matrix bottle.  But after I got out of the shower, when I brushed my hair, it was terrible, so tangled.  Now that&#x27;s it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s DRY and brittle feeling, and my hair is never like that.  I take very good care of it.  I 100% believe I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way. If you color your hair, this combination will enhance and extend your hair color and extend time between trips to salon.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time but it&#x27;s very expensive here in Oz so was so happy to get it shipped to  friend in the US&lt;br /&gt;Saved heaps</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair clean and shinier.  Add the conditioner and my pretty hair color remains vibrant until my next appointment. I recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I love the aroma of the shampoo and my hair looks healthy and shiny! Good size!</li>
            <li> Absolutely NOT the same product that I have been buying in stores! The exact same brand scent and color care except the smell is 100% different (terrible like an old bar of soap) and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t work at all! It made my hair worse!! This product in stores is amazing and I have recommended to everyone but this one being sold here is terrible!!! Completely unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. Whatever is in the bottle that I received is not Bioloage Color Care Shampoo or Conditioner.  It is awful and stinks!</li>
            <li> this is good but maybe i had too high of expectations.  my hair was very dry prior to purchasing and probably shouldn&#x27;t expect miracles.  been using on hair for about 2 months now.  Wash and condition every other day usually.  love the smell but not sure of results.... was expecting more from.</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible, horrible. I&#x27;ve been using Matrix Biolage Colorcare for a million years and have loved it. But the shampoo formula seems to have been changed; whereas it&#x27;s always been a clear liquid, now it&#x27;s white and creamy. It feels like conditioner (it&#x27;s not, because it foams and behaves like a shampoo), but it doesn&#x27;t get my hair as clean as the previous formula. I hate this stuff and will not buy it again. It&#x27;s absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> Received two shampoo&#x27;s instead of a duo of shampoo and conditioner, with no returns available. Do not recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  The smell stays with you throughout the day where most products fade. I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time and it hasn&#x27;t changed. Thanks for that!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain.  Biolage for half the cost? that&#x27;s awesome. They smell like the real deal and so far, it makes my hair feel like the other one I had bought for $35 a bottle. very happy</li>
            <li> HAIR NEBER FELT CLEANER AND LIGHTER</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner! Love the smell!</li>
            <li> I trust matrix biolage products and since I started coloring my hair, I wanted a product for treated hair.  The products meets my expectations and I enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> This biolage shampoo smells great and my color hasn&#x27;t faded. I would give this shampoo and conditioner two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than any store I&#x27;ve gone to.</li>
            <li> My kids &amp; I have been using these products for a few years &amp; we absolutely love them! Best products on the market!!</li>
            <li> Great product at a very good price. Helps repair the damage to my hair from coloring, drying and curling my hair. Fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews that were negative, but my hairdresser uses these products so I decided to buy them. Though the price looks high it actually comes out very reasonable for the amount you get. I love the way it makes my hair feel and the smell is wonderful and fresh.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this product my hair is silky and smooth, it really doesn&#x27;t leave gunk on my hair. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good shampoo that strengthens and adds anti-frizz effects.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced anything negative with this product but haven;t had that a-ha moment I have with other great hair products.</li>
            <li> Love the aroma when using this shampoo. Great hair care for hait that has been colored. I have very fine hair and this shampoo makes it feel great!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo, love the smell.</li>
            <li> Now I can always get my favorite hair care products without waiting for the salon to get them in stock.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other shampoos - Aveda, Tresemme, etc. - and always go back to Biolage. I found I have allergies to some Aveda products, and Tresemme caused an old dandruff spot to really get out of control. Biolage is the only consistent product that keeps my hair looking and feeling great; and even though it can be difficult to find a good deal on it ($15/Liter), it&#x27;s worth looking.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products.  The lids on both shampoo and conditioner bottles were both cracked/broken. Other than that, it was a fast and easy process with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> only stuff i use love it</li>
            <li> great product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> my wife hates it.  she said it looks like they added water,  she said she will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product works excellent for the after perm or high lighting to gently keep hair healthy and lasting curls and/or color</li>
            <li> Of course this stuff is amazing. I have thick highlighted hair and it works great. I dont use it all the time I switch it up.</li>
            <li> Matrix Biolage is THE perfect match for my dry, split hair many years ago. Everyone should find their own match, and this one is worth trying if you are still searching.</li>
            <li> These are great especially the price! I love the biolage smell and recommend the brand to everyone. My hair ALWAYS smells great!</li>
            <li> Love it, just want I wanted</li>
            <li> Like the smell, does a good job of cleaning and conditioning respectively.  Wish it were more eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> Seems to keep my colored hair from fading as fast as it used to.  It leaves my hair fluffy &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the entire deal and all was perfect……By the By  this is the third time I have done this if I get any more of these request on this item I will start finding it annoying  and my opinion will change thank you</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Makes my hair feel and smell like I just stepped out of the salon.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, thanks!</li>
            <li> Product came fast. It smells great and you can feel the change in your texture after a few washes. I will hope it continues to work on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, it makes my hair soft and shiny. Even after 2 days it never looks greasy.</li>
            <li> I started using Biolage about 10  years ago and have been a faithful user ever since.  It cleans my hair perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t strip it, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I color my hair often and I think that using a color care shampoo &amp; conditioner helps my color to hold better.  I will always highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a set of the shampoo and conditioner based on my stylists recommendation and I loved it. BUT, when I bought a second set there is no way this is the same product. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same at all, it actually smells like dish soap or bad hand soap. It leaves my hair a tangled mess and even after using tons of conditioner I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers through my hair. I had to remedy the situation with 1.99 Garnier Nutrisse conditioner which worked better than this supposed salon quality product. Not sure what happened between my last shipment and this one but I am not a happy customer. Now I have two huge bottles of crappy shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;m not even sure I want to put on my dogs!</li>
            <li> Super disappointed with the smell of the conditioner.  My last purchase of the same set of products was wonderful!  Not sure what changed, but I&#x27;m super picky about smells and this just isn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using biloage for over 10 years now and it continues to be the best for my hair. It keeps it conditioned and looking great</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brand of shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair feel awesome.</li>
            <li> I purchased the set of shampoo and conditioner. Shampoo is fine (nothing special about it) and the conditioner is horrible!!!! It left my hair feeling dry, rough, coarse and very tangled. Now I don&#x27;t know what to do with such a big bottle. Waste of my money. Do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is really Biolage.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this shampoo and conditioner. She has colored her hair and it makes her hair more manageable. She wanted to give her hair the best treatment after being colored.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best shampoo and conditioner combination I have ever used on my hair. It is great for my very fine, color treated hair. Keeps it shiny and full of body. The price for these cannot be beat. If you are looking for a good shampoo/conditioner for everyday use that won&#x27;t break the bank, you have found it!</li>
            <li> I love biolage and this shampoo and conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair too much and is great for color. My color isn&#x27;t fading as fast and most of all the scent of this product is great! I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product,it is really good for my hair,it was a good buy.  I recommend this product for anyone with colored treated hair , and I can come through my thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the shampoo more than the conditioner. I like washing my hair with the shampoo and conditioning with &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; conditioner. My hair feels amazing!!! :) Best shampoo ever!</li>
            <li> This product is the best and it is always hard to find this product in salons for this price, usually this product is just the base product without color protection.  I only get highlights so I dont get a lot of color but this works for me</li>
            <li> Shampoo gets your hair squeaky clean.  Conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference like Pureology, but then Biolage is cheaper.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells awesome and works so well.  My hair feels super soft and not greasy at all after using.</li>
            <li> Entire 1L bottle can last 1.5 years. More than half of the time, it does make my hair soft &amp; shiny, but I still get some bad hair days, so I am not very much impressed. I still think my hair does best when I own several shampoo/conditioner brands and alternate between them once in a while.</li>
            <li> I have used Biolage for quite some time now but this last order (July 27, 2014) that I just started using smells completely different.  Wondering if the formula changed?  I am going to be checking at a hair salon near me to see if it smells the same or not.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this product.  Usually this is $30 a bottle at the beauty supply store.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I have always used this shampoo and conditioner and love it! It is a great price, too! I would recommend this to anyone looking for good long-lasting shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I high-light my hair regularly and always use a round of Matrix Biolage Color Care afterward.  It really helps lock-in and protect my new color!  Of course, it&#x27;s ALWAYS a plus to find it cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> this product! I use this over and over and never get tired of it. I&#x27;ll buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Matrix Biolage color care set. Bought it on a whim since it had so many good reviews and figured there&#x27;s not much worse my hair can do. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing, Feels great (silky &amp; smooth) when it&#x27;s wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Gave me a dry, flaky scalp &amp; it got kinda itchy; after towel/air (not blow) drying my hair, it didn&#x27;t feel any better - matter of fact, it felt worse. Super dry and brittle. And I use a leave in conditioner and argan oil, so I&#x27;m not sure how that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very cheap for how much you&#x27;re getting for a brand name. Didn&#x27;t work for me, but I hope it works for the next person.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mother for Christmas. She was excited to have a large bottle of this since she hasn&#x27;t seen any this large for purchase.</li>
            <li> This is not the same texture, nor quality I have bought elsewhere.  I&#x27;m not sure if Matrix changed their formula, or if Inwas sold a bait and switch, but I use this because it is the only conditioner I found that allowed me to brush my hair without adding detangler, since I moved to an area with hard water.  Just finishe my previous bottle, open this one, and it does not smell, feel, or work the same.</li>
            <li> NOT the same product that I have been buying in stores! This is exact same brand I purchase in stores except the smell is 100% different (terrible, like it&#x27;s been expired or sitting in a hot warehouse) and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather and conditioner doesn&#x27;t work at all! This product in stores is COMPLETELY different from what I purchased here.  Returning after one use.</li>
            <li> My wife was so excited when she rec&#x27;d this came to the door.  Thank you Amazon for allowing me to score some extra points!  Going to make another order soon before she runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this item it makes me hair feel smooth and smells good very happy customer I love them very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 6 years and ever since I bought it from this site, it makes my head super itchy! I&#x27;ve never had that happen before. Not buying again...</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo. It leaves your hair soft and smells great. It is light without that greasy feel. Nice work Biolage.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> This product is not what is sold in stores. The shampoo does not have the same consistency and the conditioner smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over ten years and my hair loves it. the whole Biolage line is wonderful and all natural, not using any of the harsh chemicals that are fillers in cheaper products. It is also not tested on animals, which is personally important to me. The seller was quick to ship this to me and very easy to deal with, and someone I would use again.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend. According to her, this is the best for her hair. She is a blonde and says that it is much cheaper value if bought on amazon.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo ever! The smell is great, keeps my hair looking shiny and smooth, and the price online beats any retail store! Have been purchasing this dual pack twice a year for the past 3 yrs! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I found the perfect product. I must have purchased thousands of types of shampoo and conditioner. Wish I had just tried this first. Works well for the price. Everyone comments on how shiny my hair is now.</li>
            <li> What can I say this stuff smells good but it just makes my hair so dry, which sucks because I really wanted this stuff to work!</li>
            <li> For some reason, this set did not work as Biolage always has for my hair.  The conditioner smelled and worked differently than before, causing my hair to be extremely knotted and unmanageable.  I wanted to return the set but mailing liquids isn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biolage my entire life and I&#x27;m not sure what I got but it wasn&#x27;t Biolage. Didn&#x27;t smell like Biolage or leave my hair like Biolage usually does. Beware!!</li>
            <li> I wanted the soft and thick feel of my hair and this product does it.  it is also for clored hair which mine is. Really like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and really does help the color stay in my hair for a long time. The smell is wonderful too!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Smell is intoxicating</li>
            <li> The order came on time but this conditioner seems to make my hair really dry and makes it very tangled - I have fairly long dark hair and usually have issues with oily hair so dryness has never been a problem.  I had previously been using biolage from a different supplier and never had that issue, but I am underwhelmed by the way this duo makes my hear feel.  Probably will not buy from here again</li>
            <li> First I want to comment the seller was great, fast shipping, good packaging, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy biolage conditioners.  I have never used the formula for color treated hair before.  When I first began to use the product, that same wonderful scent was there and I was immediately happy with my good, old biolage.  The shampoo is good, nothing extraordinary.  The conditioner, on the other hand, I just can&#x27;t even work it through my hair.  I guess it depends on your hair type but I have the type that has to be conditioned or it will be like a rat&#x27;s nest.  Every time I use this conditioner, my hair gets all tangled up and the conditioner has no ingredient to actual &#x27;condition&#x27; my hair.  My hair literally feels like it has waterproofing on it and the product just won&#x27;t absorb.  I try to be very gentle and pull the product through to the ends and everytime, I end up with a handful of hair that have been pulled out in the process.  Now I use 2 conditioners because I don&#x27;t want to waste this huge bottle of conditioner.  I start with a gob of the biolage and coat the surface area and then I add a small amount of my usual go-to conditioner [[ASIN:B00A0RG2GY L&#x27;Oreal Natures Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme]] to work it through to detangle and pull it through to the ends.  Now that I&#x27;ve written this review, I&#x27;ve just decided I&#x27;m dumping the conditioner despite the fact that I&#x27;ve only used about 10% of the product but life is too short to put up with bad hair or bad hair products :)</li>
            <li> I really like this product, leaves your hair very nice, soft, shinny and can be used daily.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend to use this product.</li>
            <li> love it.. esp the smell.. way cheaper than salon prices too!</li>
            <li> Great product just what I expected and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Great product good price</li>
            <li> Cheaper than store purchase and dependable product - no complaints!</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it and says it is the best shampoo and conditioner she has ever used.  She strongly recommends both products and said it has made her hair stronger, shiner and softer.</li>
            <li> I feel like it wasn&#x27;t a real Matrix Biolage Color Care Shampoo....I don&#x27;t know but won&#x27;t be purchasing again. The worst!!!!</li>
            <li> love, love, love it!!! I also bought some for my daughter and she loves it too!&lt;br /&gt;  We both have very thick hair and we don&#x27;t get the Frizz when using Matrix Biolage</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t condition very well and left my hair dry and tangled</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive product, even though I felt I dealt with good price. Shipped on time, nice product, good price, I love it.</li>
            <li> BeautyLime sent me a counterfeit product.  Used Biolage for 13 years, this is NOT Biolage...  Made my hair turn into straw.</li>
            <li> good price, great product. have always enjoyed all of the Matrix products. Works just as expected, maybe a little better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I received these today and am so excited. I know over shampoo &amp; conditioner. But they smell like an exotic flower. I took a shower as soon as I could. Not only did they leave my hair smelling wonderful but also silky and soft, easy to work with and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I told my hair dresser I had order these he agreed I got a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> High quality shampoo and conditioner for a great price.  This stuff is wonderful...I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week and it never looks greasy in between washings.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for color treated hair. The wife likes to color different shades depending on the time of the year and says this product helps maintain the color of her hair.</li>
            <li> Love both the shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair smell delicious. Leaves my hair feeling so soft and manageable.  A must buy for all treated hair!</li>
            <li> It was nice to get these in the mail. Anytime I can get what I buy at a store and not fight the crowds is great! The price is right too.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of biolage and with this combo pack I saved a few bucks verses buying in store. I already purchased the optional pumps which are helpful with these larger, heavier bottles. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Received As Described</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just what I needed!  The perfect size!  High Quality!  Thank you so much for offering this item at a great price!</li>
            <li> I LLLLOVE LOOOOVE LLLLOVE THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER.  IT MAKES MY HAIR SMELL SO GOOD AND IT DEFINITELY KEEPS THE COLOR LOCKED IN. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a professional shampoo that actually works.</li>
            <li> great and love the scent</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with the Biolage line of products.  Their color care products are of the highest quality.  Although on first look rather pricey, a little bit goes a long way.  The products are especially effective in humid summer weather.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but always come back to this pair.  This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair silky and smooth all the time.  Never dries it out or makes it coarse like some other brands.  My favorite.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo n conditioner</li>
            <li> Great product for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> This product never disappoints. I used it when my hair was permed and colored to treat it. Now that my hair is natural and colored again it still works wonders.</li>
            <li> There okay. I&#x27;ve used better product.</li>
            <li> I will not order again. If it was easier to return I would. I use Matrix products every day and there is something seriously wrong with this shampoo and conditioner. I cannot even use it. Major disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner. I have colored and naturally curly hair. It is a great product for both. Super</li>
            <li> I ordered the shampoo late one night and it was delivered the next morning! Amazing how fast they processed my order. I have very long hair that gets tangled to the point that I would have to cut it, but since I started using this shampoo and conditioner, I finally can grow my hair almost to my waist and it no longer tangles or breaks, so it is also thick. My hairstylist recommended it to me when she saw how dry and tangled my hair was, and now when I went to trim it, the lady said it was the healthiest hair she had ever seen and felt bad to cut it!</li>
            <li> I used it for seven years, it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like the conditioner does much and my color didn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> I got took.  I paid $35+ for the two bottles.  When I received them, they were a &amp;#34;pair&amp;#34; selling for $32.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo and conditioner wife uses.  Recommended by by beautician.</li>
            <li> Gentle on hair and color, but very effective cleaner and conditioner. Love the big bottles as I don&#x27;t have buy for awhile.</li>
            <li> great price and value!</li>
            <li> Whatever is in these bottles is not matrix Biolage. It is very low quality whatever it is. I knew it was wrong from the smell. I questioned myself for a moment but once I used it I knew it was wrong. Feels gunky and gross in my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner together. They didn&#x27;t work any better than store-bought products, and the bottles were poorly designed. The pump did not work and the shampoo and conditioner were nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo many times and enjoy the way it treats my hair as well as the fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this in bulk for a decent price after my hair dresser had been washing my hair with it.  Very nice floral smell, but not overpowering and suffocating.  I like buying shampoo and conditioner in bulk at decent prices (yay amazon!) since often times I shower twice a day and go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and will buy again!</li>
            <li> received on time and item is as expected thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Donna not Allen.I love the scent of this shampoo &amp; conditioner, so does my hubby &amp; son. It&#x27;s more of a fresh scent not really a floral scent. Unlike the other reviewer, none of us have had any issues with prolonged use. My hubby has fine, thin hair &amp; my son and I have thick, full hair. Biolage works for all of us. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down thin hair but moisturizing for thick hair</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!!! FAKE!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!! I ran a salon and used this for years. I recently moved and had to order some and this is nothing like the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my mom and she loved it. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I had bought a set of these at a beauty supply store a few months ago and loved it.  I bought this set on Amazon, and despite having the exact same label and ingredient list, it was NOT the same stuff inside the bottles.  The scent was completely different and the products left my hair feeling like straw, and it was very difficult to comb out after washing.  With the previous bottles I had, my hair was super easy to comb out after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sending back!</li>
            <li> this shampoo is the best for saving your colored/treated hair!  my color stays in WAAAY longer than other shampoo types, yes sort of expensive but dont you pay a lot to have your hair colored? so why not pay a little extra to keep it on your head longer?</li>
