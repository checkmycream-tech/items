            <li> It doesnt have a good quality</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents, extremely happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I still had my old bottle when I purchased this one.  I compared the two several different ways.  The bottle looks the same, but I am pretty sure it is a fake.  No return policy on this product!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this particular perfume after I originally received it as a birthday gift from my sister. I finished my first bottle and found my second on amazon. I was very happy when I received it in brand new condition and it was exactly whet I wanted. I get compliments on this perfume where ever I go. I love it. It was a great experience I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product/scent; great price</li>
            <li> This edt has a weird smell.  It has three levels with the second level smelling cheap and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> You loose the smell 10 minutes after you apply it. I think you should buy the &amp;#34;eau de pafum&amp;#34;. Not good this one I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! (And so does my wife!) I bought it for my wife for a birthday present&lt;br /&gt;after smelling a sample at the mall, and I love the way it smells on her! This is the large bottle and was less than half the price as&lt;br /&gt;the mall version. Thanks for the great product and service!!</li>
            <li> Not so long ago I tried this EDT in Sephora. I loved it so much that I simply became obsessed with it. I had to have it but it was a little too pricey for me. So I decided to try it on Amazon and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It was everything I wanted: bright, clean, effervescent, a little woodsy, and sensual. It lasts good 6 hrs. on my skin. It&#x27;s very inoffensive. Even my picky husband doesn&#x27;t complain. If you like fresh scents then it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> Very distinctive and beautiful scent. After I applied it in the morning, it lasted all day. Not one of those fragrances that dissipate and has to be reapplied. It is not heavy or overpowering either. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances and I am very pleased!! I have used it before but this is the biggest bottle I ever purchased. Very glad I ordered it!!</li>
            <li> I became acquainted with this fragrance when I received a tester from Macy&#x27;s, and then purchased it as a Christmas present. The scent is floral and clean. This size and price is economical.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. I had been wearing the fruity Ed hardy fragrance but I received a sample of this from Ulta and have been hooked ever since. The smell is phenomenal and makes you feel sexy.</li>
            <li> Excelente perfume, exquisito...</li>
            <li> I wear this to the office almost everyday. The scent is soft, unoffensive, and stays close to the skin. It calms me whenever I catch a whiff. It&#x27;s got decent lasting power (4~6 hours) considering it is EDT.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the one I smelled in the retail store. Im disappointed. Might be a replica of the real one.</li>
            <li> We do not like the fragrance ... very sickening ... causes headache ... I will try to resell here in Brazil</li>
            <li> I love this sexy scent by Cartier- it is AMAZING! Being an Eau de toilette it does wear off quicker than others I&#x27;ve owned, but you get what you pay for! The Parfum is so much more expensive though! I&#x27;ll just keep having to apply! Love it though, it is such a great soft yet sexy scent.</li>
            <li> Smells like Baiser Vole, but isn&#x27;t a lasting scent like Baiser Vole I previously had. I have to constantly reapply but still love it! not sure if what I received is truly authentic.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume and it was half the price than if bought at the department store. The fragrance is light and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like many others do.</li>
            <li> Love this. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love this Eau de Toilette spray. It&#x27;s not a heavy scent and a receive a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> Dispenser does not work - the bottle is unusable...</li>
