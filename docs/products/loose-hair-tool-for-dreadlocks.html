            <li>This works great</li>
            <li>This tool is great because of the pointed tip, which makes it so easy to go through locks without ripping the hair.</li>

            <li>Cheap tool, worked well though</li>
            <li>my dreads finally look good after a year of having them</li>
            <li>The pointed tip is more of a rounded tip which will penetrate your lock smoothly, but with limited control.</li>
            <li>It goes through like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>works very well , makes it easy to put hair back in dreads</li>
            <li>Doesnt lock very well to pull through the hair effortlessly.</li>

            <li>This tool is far too large.</li>
            <li>The tool is far too large for medium sized locs.</li>
            <li>I usually have fly aways, but this allows me to pull those in and keep the base looking good.</li>
            <li>It works okay on larger dreds, but it&#x27;s really hard to use by yourself.</li>
            <li>I do upkeep on my dreadlocks and my brothers and this helps soo much with loose hairs.</li>
            <li>The tool is too large and I can only use it on a few choice locs that happen to be large.</li>
            <li>really helps to get the roots tight.</li>

            <li> I used regularly to collect loose hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is that you should be careful with the handle, I&#x27;ve had it break a couple times</li>
            <li> Buy this only if your dreds aren&#x27;t too small and you have someone that will help you with them.</li>
            <li> is a bit sharp, watch your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only if you&#x27;re really hard on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for over a year and a half so that the body has locked up, but my ends are struggling.</li>
            <li> , Does snag a little.</li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars because the tool may work well with very thick locs, however if you have medium locs I would recommend the small loose hair tool.</li>
            <li> The handle to tool ratio is disproportionate so that you must put you fingers on the metal part in order to guide it down the center of your locs, but there is no grip for control so it is difficult to manage.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Rocking my locs!!! I usually have fly aways, but this allows me to pull those in and keep the base looking good. This one is best for medium sized locs. Mine were just big enough to be used. Regardless, awesome product.</li>
            <li> Too big for dreads...a smaller lace crochet hook works the best</li>
            <li> Sticks in the hair when using. Doesnt lock very well to pull through the hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li> works very well , makes it easy to put hair back in dreads</li>
            <li> This tool is far too large. My locs are medium length and medium thickness at the moment. I&#x27;ve had them for over a year and a half so that the body has locked up, but my ends are struggling. I wanted to get this tool with the hopes of blunting my tips. The tool is too large and I can only use it on a few choice locs that happen to be large. The tool is far too large for medium sized locs. The pointed tip is more of a rounded tip which will penetrate your lock smoothly, but with limited control. The handle to tool ratio is disproportionate so that you must put you fingers on the metal part in order to guide it down the center of your locs, but there is no grip for control so it is difficult to manage.

            <li> Out of all the brands I&#x27;ve used, this one is the best. I&#x27;m not a fan of Dreadhead HQ but they outdid themselves with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The pointed tip goes through dreadlocks with ease, regardless of maturity.&lt;br /&gt;-The stem feels fully secured in the handle and can withstand tugging and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;-Hidden compartment in the handle, they recommend lockpeppa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Clasp  is a bit sharp, watch your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;-The stem is a bit fragile, keep it in a secure place or you run the risk of bending it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best tool on the market for the price.</li>
            <li> Really work if u know how to use it</li>
            <li> NICE TOOL FOR THICKER, TIGHTER &amp;#34;DRED&amp;#34; LOCKs</li>

            <li> Love this tool. I used regularly to collect loose hair., Does snag a little.</li>
            <li> This works great my dreads finally look good after a year of having them</li>
            <li> I have bought like 5 of these because I keep losing them. But, I bought five because I need this. I do upkeep on my dreadlocks and my brothers and this helps soo much with loose hairs. It helps you speed up the process to getting your dreads to start forming together. I really recommend it, just don&#x27;t use it too much or you&#x27;ll have a lot of breakage. The only thing I would say is that you should be careful with the handle, I&#x27;ve had it break a couple times but that&#x27;s only if you&#x27;re really hard on it.</li>
            <li> Cheap tool, worked well though</li>
            <li> excellent tool! extremely easy to use and the results are amazing. really helps to get the roots tight.</li>
