            <li>This is a great natural deodorant bar.  </li>
            <li>We love Tom&#x27;s products and this one smells so fresh and citrusy!</li>
            <li>I like that it is supposed to be more healthy and great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love the light scent (that does not linger) and the softness of the bar as well as the clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>I read this might fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>The light fragrance is an added bonus, not too spicy, but not floral either.  </li>

            <li>Smells great, and it never hurts to have enough deodorant in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally able to smell fresh again.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t find it the greatest for moisturizing, but that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t usually use bar soaps.</li>

            <li>Natural and yet effective.  </li>
            <li>I use this to wash &amp; shave my armpits and it makes a significant impact in keeping me fresh.</li>
            <li>Our local market stopped carrying it, so we&#x27;ve had to get creative, finding it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is our favorite soap bar by far.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but this product warrents the effort.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and CLEAN with no feeling of &#x27;residue&#x27; .</li>
            <li>It works great and doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>We have hard water and it lathers great and a bar lasts quite a while for me.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband because I was looking for a non-soap alternative to his much loved Lever 2000 (true soap products leave soap scum in the shower and thus attract certain bacteria that feed on it).</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to many fragrances, including essential oils, but</li>
            <li>This sounds a bit yucky, but my body chemistry seemed to change after my first baby and deodorants , both natural and mainstream brands just weren&#x27;t working well.</li>
            <li>I love using this bar and having the light scent that is not overpowering or unhealthy for my baby to breathe.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for those seeking an alternative to the chemical-laden deodorant soaps with the normal, soapy scents.  </li>
            <li>i have been using tom&#x27;s since the products were first introduced, and although the company &#x27;sold out&#x27; a while back, still find their products to have a purity that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it as a complete body wash as well.</li>
            <li>He was adamantly opposed to using a body wash</li>
            <li>He also has somewhat sensitive skin (although being a manly man, he doesn&#x27;t like that term).  </li>
            <li>I chose it because it was all natural and did not test on animals.  </li>
            <li>Lasts so much longer than other soaps, and it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am generally quite persnickety about my soaps and scents, and I&#x27;ve found this one highly-pleasing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently changed everything in my life to natural.</li>
            <li>It also does not dry out your skin.</li>

            <li> Really great soap for me.  We have hard water and it lathers great and a bar lasts quite a while for me.  I&#x27;m making the transition to cruelty-free and this one of my first products - very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels great.  Just what I want outta a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this soap for my family.  It works great and doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> I use this to wash &amp; shave my armpits and it makes a significant impact in keeping me fresh. I don&#x27;t have any major odor issues to begin with, but I notice I can skip deodorant and go a few days without showering without any BO whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My favorite Tom&#x27;s bar. Lasts so much longer than other soaps, and it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin. I am sensitive to many fragrances, including essential oils, but not Tom&#x27;s. They advertise the odor-fighting sage, but it is the lemongrass scent that I love so much. Forget the lavender. Give me lemongrass.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite soap bar by far. We love Tom&#x27;s products and this one smells so fresh and citrusy! Keeps you feeling fresh and smelling good all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently changed everything in my life to natural. This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found!!! My husband and I both love the light scent (that does not linger) and the softness of the bar as well as the clean feeling after using it. It also does not dry out your skin. I sometimes use it as a complete body wash as well. It is very hard to find this in a two pack especially for the price, so I will be ordering it again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This soap has a lovely scent, fabulous lather, and works well as a deodorant soap.  I am generally quite persnickety about my soaps and scents, and I&#x27;ve found this one highly-pleasing.  I&#x27;ve even put in in my Subscribe-and-Save recurring list.  I highly recommend it for those seeking an alternative to the chemical-laden deodorant soaps with the normal, soapy scents.  This one is not like all the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that it is a little on the expensive side.  I love saving 15% in my monthly Subcribe-and-Save box.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this soap on a daily basis. It took a long time to find a smell we could agree on!  It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue behind. Our local market stopped carrying it, so we&#x27;ve had to get creative, finding it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> i have been using tom&#x27;s since the products were first introduced, and although the company &#x27;sold out&#x27; a while back, still find their products to have a purity that can&#x27;t be beat. this &#x27;deodorant&#x27; is my favorite type of toms soap because i like &#x27;sage&#x27; in my soap. why? i guess it is the very subtle fragrance . tom&#x27;s it leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and CLEAN with no feeling of &#x27;residue&#x27; . the price is right, the ingredients good, the feeling after using it great... can&#x27;t see any reason to use anything but.</li>
            <li> Natural and yet effective.  I really like the smell of this.  It is not overpowering.  This soap does not dry out the skin.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband because I was looking for a non-soap alternative to his much loved Lever 2000 (true soap products leave soap scum in the shower and thus attract certain bacteria that feed on it). He was adamantly opposed to using a body wash so I needed to find something in bar form. He also has somewhat sensitive skin (although being a manly man, he doesn&#x27;t like that term).  He does love this &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; and although it&#x27;s on the expensive side, it has had the desired results for me: No more soap scum! We&#x27;ve officially made the switch.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for over a year.  It is a GREAT NATURAL deodorant soap....I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I prefer a bar to a body gel, but don&#x27;t like scum.  I read this might fit the bill.  The light fragrance is an added bonus, not too spicy, but not floral either.  Smooth and comforting.</li>
            <li> I like that it is supposed to be more healthy and great for dry skin. I liked it ok but it didn&#x27;t jump out at me.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and it never hurts to have enough deodorant in my opinion!</li>
            <li> This is a great natural deodorant bar.  I love the scent.  The sage makes it smell very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. I rarely write reviews but this product warrents the effort. This sounds a bit yucky, but my body chemistry seemed to change after my first baby and deodorants , both natural and mainstream brands just weren&#x27;t working well. I tried this soap and it did the trick. I&#x27;m finally able to smell fresh again. I love using this bar and having the light scent that is not overpowering or unhealthy for my baby to breathe.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I chose it because it was all natural and did not test on animals.  I will continue to use it because it I am very pleased with its quality.</li>
            <li> I bu they deodorant bar for my husband and he loves it. I use it occasionally and I love the smell -  great for men and women. I don&#x27;t find the smell too overpowering and it diminishes after a while anyway. I don&#x27;t find it the greatest for moisturizing, but that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t usually use bar soaps.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Moisture Bar Deodorant cleans well, never irritates, and its light, pleasant fragrance never gives me a headache, as some fragrances do. I highly recommend it.</li>
